We then determined the observed effects of attention on cortical responses and demonstrated that these effects were predicted by the normalization model, but not by the weighted sum or the weighted average models.

Divisive normalization has been proposed as one of these fundamental operations. Under this computation, the response of a neuron is determined based on its excitatory input divided by a factor representing the activity of a pool of nearby neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heeger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carandini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carandini and Heeger, 2011</xref>). Normalization was first introduced based on responses in the cat primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heeger, 1992</xref>), and evidence of its operation in higher regions of the monkey visual cortex has also been demonstrated both during passive viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Tsao, 2018</xref>) and when attention is directed towards a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Maunsell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ni and Maunsell, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Normalization has also been proposed as a critical operation in the human brain based on evidence demonstrating the sublinear addition of responses to multiple stimuli in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem and Ling, 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, in lieu of directly testing the normalization model to resolve multiple-stimulus representation, several previous studies have shown that a weighted average model can account for multiple-stimulus responses in the monkey brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zoccolan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macevoy and Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reddy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kliger and Yovel, 2020</xref>). The only exception is a recent electrophysiology study, which showed that in the category-selective regions of the monkey brain, a winner-take-all, but not averaging, rule can explain neural responses in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Tsao, 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Tsao, 2018</xref> further demonstrated that the normalization model predicts such winner-take-all behavior. It is not clear whether this discrepancy has emerged as a result of different explored regions of the brain, or due to the diversity in stimuli or the task performed by the participants.</p><p>In addition to regional computations for multiple-stimulus representation, the visual cortex relies on top-down mechanisms such as attention to select the most relevant stimulus for detailed processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran and Desimone, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baluch and Itti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noudoost et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maunsell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thiele and Bellgrove, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itthipuripat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore and Zirnsak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buschman and Kastner, 2015</xref>). Attention works through increasing the response gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Treue and Martínez Trujillo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</xref>) or contrast gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez-Trujillo and Treue, 2002</xref>) of the attended stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated how the normalization computation accounts for these observed effects of attention in the monkey brain. They have suggested that normalization attenuates the neural response in proportion to the activity of the neighboring neuronal pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boynton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). These studies have focused on space-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) or feature-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ni and Maunsell, 2019</xref>) attention. While it has been suggested that these different forms of attention affect neural responses in similar ways, there exist distinctions in their reported effects, such as different time courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayden and Gallant, 2005</xref>) and the extent to which they affect different locations in the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serences and Boynton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Womelsdorf et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that there are common sources as well as differences in modulation mechanisms between these forms of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ni and Maunsell, 2019</xref>). This leaves open the question of whether normalization can explain the effects of object-based attention.</p><p>In the human visual cortex, normalization has been speculated to underlie response modulations in the presence of attention, with evidence provided both by behavioral studies of space-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herrmann et al., 2010</xref>) and feature-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herrmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwedhelm et al., 2016</xref>) attention, as well as neuroimaging studies of feature-based attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem and Ling, 2019</xref>). Although previous studies have qualitatively suggested the role of normalization in the human visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem and Ling, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kliger and Yovel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itthipuripat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), evidence for directly testing the validity of the normalization model in predicting human cortical responses in a quantitative way remains scarce. A few studies have demonstrated the quantitative advantage of normalization-based models compared to linear models in predicting human fMRI responses using gratings, noise patterns, and single objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kay et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2013b</xref>), as well as moving checkerboards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aqil et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster and Ling, 2021</xref>). However, whether normalization can also be used to predict cortical responses to multiple objects, and if and to what extent it can explain the modulations in response caused by attention to objects in the human brain remain unanswered.</p><p>To fill this gap and to explore the discrepancies reported about multiple-stimulus responses, here, we aimed to evaluate the predictions of the normalization model against observed responses to visual objects in several regions of the human brain in the presence and absence of attention. In an fMRI experiment using conditions with isolated and cluttered stimuli and recording the response with or without attention, we provide a comprehensive account of normalization in different regions of the visual cortex, showing its success in adjusting the gain related to each stimulus when it is attended or ignored. We also demonstrate that normalization is closer to average in the absence of attention, as previously reported by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zoccolan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macevoy and Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kliger and Yovel, 2020</xref>), but that the results of the weighted average model and the normalization model diverge to a greater extent in the presence of attention. Our work in the human brain, along with previous studies of normalization in the monkey and human brain, suggests the role of normalization as a canonical computation in the primate brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Attention modulates responses to isolated and paired stimuli</title><p>In a blocked-design fMRI paradigm, human participants (N = 19) viewed semi-transparent gray-scale stimuli from the two categories of houses and human bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Each experimental run consisted of one-stimulus (isolated) and two-stimulus (paired) blocks, with attention directed either to an object stimulus or to the color of the fixation point. There was an additional fixation color block in each run with no object stimuli, in which the participants were asked to attend to the fixation point color. The experiment, therefore, had a total number of eight conditions (four isolated, three paired, and one fixation conditions, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In paired blocks, we superimposed the two stimuli to minimize the effect of spatial attention and force participants to use object-based attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). Participants were asked to perform a one-back repetition detection task on the attended object, or a color change detection task on the fixation point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, see Methods for details). Independent localizer runs were used to localize the primary visual cortex (V1), the object-selective regions in the lateral occipital cortex (LO) and posterior fusiform gyrus (pFs), the extrastriate body area (EBA), and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) for each participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Stimuli, paradigm, and regions of interest.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The two stimulus categories (body and house), with the ten exemplars of the body category.

We observed that the average voxel coefficients related to the four conditions in which attention was directed to the body or the house stimuli (the first four conditions, B<sup>at</sup>, B<sup>at</sup>H, BH<sup>at</sup>, H<sup>at</sup>) were generally higher than the response related to the last three conditions (B, H, and BH conditions) in which the body and house stimuli were unattended (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thickmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thickmathspace"/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).

For instance, in the body-selective region EBA, the response to attended body stimuli in isolation is similar to the response to attended body stimuli paired with unattended house stimuli (compare B<sup>at</sup> and B<sup>at</sup>H bars). On the other hand, the response to attended house stimuli in the isolated condition is significantly less than the response to attended house stimuli paired with unattended body stimuli. We can observe similar results in PPA, but not in V1 or the object-selective regions LO and pFs. But note that the latter three regions do not have strong a preference for one stimulus versus the other. Therefore, in order to examine the interaction between attention and preference more closely, we determined preferences at the voxel level in all ROIs.</p><p>We defined the preferred (P) and null (N) stimulus categories for each voxel in each ROI according to the voxel’s response to isolated body and isolated house conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> shows the percentage of voxels in each region that were selective to bodies and houses averaged across participants. As illustrated in the figure, in the object-selective regions LO and pFs, almost half of the voxels were selective to each category, while in the EBA and PPA regions, the general preference of the region prevailed (Even though these regions were selected based on their preference, the noise in the fMRI data and other variations due to imperfect registration led to some voxels showing different preferences in the main session compared to the localizer session <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peelen and Downing, 2005</xref>).</p><p>After determining voxel preferences, we rearranged the seven task conditions according to each voxel’s preference.

Zero contrast for a stimulus denotes that the stimulus is not present in the visual field. In our experiment, we set contrast values to one when a stimulus was presented, and to zero when the stimulus was not presented (see Methods for detailed descriptions of models).</p><p>Although many studies have demonstrated that responses to multiple stimuli are added sublinearly in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heeger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem and Ling, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reddy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aqil et al., 2021</xref>), it has been suggested that for weak stimuli, response summation can approach a linear or even a supralinear regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rubin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heuer and Britten, 2002</xref>). Since the stimuli we used in this experiment were presented in a semi-transparent form and were therefore not in full contrast, we found it probable that the response might be closer to a linear summation regime in some cases. We thus used the weighted sum model to examine whether the response approaches linear summation in any region.</p><p>To compare the three models in their ability to predict the data, we split the fMRI data into two halves (odd and even runs) and estimated the model parameters separately for each voxel of each participant twice: once using the first half of the data, and a second time using the second half of the data. All comparisons of data with model predictions were made using the left-out half of the data in each case. All model results illustrate the average of these two cross-validated predictions. Note that this independent prediction is critical since the numbers of parameters in the three models are different. Possible over-fitting in the normalization model with more parameters will not affect the independent predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2013b</xref>). The predictions of the three models for the five modeled task conditions are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–e</xref> (the two isolated ignored conditions P and N were excluded as they were used by the weighted sum and the weighted average models to predict responses in the remaining five conditions, see Methods).</p><p>As evident in the figure, the predictions of the normalization model (in orange) are generally better than the predictions of the weighted sum and the weighted average models (light blue and gray, respectively) in all regions. To quantify this observation, we calculated the goodness of fit for each voxel by taking the square of the correlation coefficient between the predicted model response and the respective fMRI responses across the five modeled conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also calculated the noise ceiling in each region separately as the r-squared of the correlation between the odd and even halves of the data. Given that the correlation between the model and the data cannot exceed the reliability of the data (as calculated by the correlation between the data from odd and even runs), the r-squared can also not exceed the squared split-half reliability. The noise ceiling (squared split-half reliability), therefore, determines the highest possible goodness of fit a model can reach.

However, when considering all the attended and unattended conditions, our results show that the normalization model is a generally better fit across all ROIs.</p><p>To ensure that the superiority of the normalization model over the weighted sum and weighted average models were not caused by the normalization model’s nonlinearity or its higher number of parameters, we ran simulations of three neural populations. Neurons in each population calculated responses to multiple stimuli and attended stimuli by a summing, an averaging, and a normalizing rule (see Methods). We then used the three models to predict the population responses. Our simulation results demonstrate that despite the higher number of parameters, the normalization model is only a better fit for the population of normalizing neurons and not for summing or averaging neurons, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.

We also showed the success of the normalization model in predicting the observed effects of object-based attention, further suggesting it as a fundamental operation in the human brain.</p><p>While several electrophysiology studies have examined normalization in the monkey brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Tsao, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ni and Maunsell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ni and Maunsell, 2019</xref>), and although normalization has also been proposed to operate in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem and Ling, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kay et al., 2013a</xref>), evidence for its validity in the human brain, particularly in the presence of attention, is still scarce. Expanding on the results of previous studies, showing the role of normalization in the human visual cortex for simple stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kay et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aqil et al., 2021</xref>), our work offers evidence for the role of normalization in multiple-object representation and object-based attention.</p><p>After comparing model predictions with the data, we investigated the effect of attention on multiple-object representation. Defining preferred and null stimuli for each voxel, we showed that when attention shifted from the preferred to the null stimulus, there was a significant reduction in response in multiple regions of interest in the occipito-temporal cortex but not in the primary visual area. Furthermore, this response reduction increased as we moved to higher regions across the hierarchy, consistent with speculations of greater effects of top-down attention on higher regions of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook and Maunsell, 2002</xref>). Although this response reduction has also been predicted by the biased competition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</xref>), our results showed that the predictions of the weighted average model were significantly lower than the response reduction observed in the data in all ROIs except in V1. In contrast, the normalization model predicted the response reduction more accurately in all regions except in V1, where no significant response reduction was observed. Previous reports of the effects of attention in V1 have also been controversial, with some reporting attentional effects in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Somers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gandhi et al., 1999</xref>) while others report little (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</xref>) to no observed effects of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luck et al., 1997</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heeger and Ress, 2002</xref>, this might be due to the difference in task design and the experimental method used.</p><p>Moreover, our results indicated an asymmetry in attentional modulation when attending to the preferred versus the null stimulus. We demonstrated that while attention to a preferred stimulus almost eliminates the effect of the ignored null stimulus, attention to the null stimulus does not remove the effect of the preferred stimulus. Unlike response change with the shift of attention, which increases across the hierarchy, the asymmetry measured by our defined index remains approximately the same in all regions, indicating its dependence not on the top-down attentional signal but on the normalization computation performed in each region. This feature was also predicted by the normalization model but not by the weighted sum and the weighted average models.</p><p>Normalization has been reported to cause neural populations to operate in the averaging or winner-take-all regimes based on stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busse et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we showed that in the presence of attention, responses can deviate from the averaging regime even without a change in contrast. We observed a winner-take-all behavior when the preferred stimulus was attended since its higher response along with its increase in gain due to attention, made it a much stronger input compared to the ignored null stimulus. On the other hand, when the null stimulus was attended, the response was closer to an average than a max-pooling response. This result explains why several previous studies in the object-selective regions indicated averaging as the rule for multiple-stimulus representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zoccolan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macevoy and Epstein, 2009</xref>), while studies in regions with strong preferences for a particular category reported a winner-take-all mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Tsao, 2018</xref>). We, therefore, extend previous reports of multiple-stimulus representation showing that the response is related to stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busse et al., 2009</xref>) and neural selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Tsao, 2018</xref>) by demonstrating that a combination of bottom-up and top-down signals act to yield a response that can be the average of the isolated responses, or a winner-take-all response, or somewhere between the two. We also demonstrate for the first time that the normalization model is superior to the weighted average model, which has often been used in lieu of the normalization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zoccolan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macevoy and Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kliger and Yovel, 2020</xref>), in its ability to account for fMRI responses in the presence of attention. Testing other variants of the weighted average model with unequal weights and unequal attention parameters for the preferred and null stimuli, we demonstrate that the normalization model is a better fit compared to all these variants of the weighted average model.</p><p>Stimulus contrast has also been shown to have a crucial role in how single-stimulus responses are added to obtain the multiple-stimulus response. While responses to strong high-contrast stimuli are added sublinearly to yield the multiple-stimulus response, as predicted by the normalization model and the weighted average model, the sublinearity decreases for lower contrasts and even changes to linearity and supralinearity for weak stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heuer and Britten, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rubin et al., 2015</xref>). Here, since the stimuli we used were not in full contrast, we tested the weighted sum model as well to examine whether responses approach linearity in any region. Our results demonstrate that while the weighted average model generally performs better than the weighted sum model in the higher-level occipito-temporal cortex, the weighted sum model provides better predictions in V1. These results suggest stronger sublinearity in higher regions of the visual cortex compared to V1, which is in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2013b</xref>). This observation might be related to the higher sensitivity of V1 neurons to contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodyear and Menon, 1998</xref>), causing a more significant decrease in V1 responses to low-contrast stimuli. This, in turn, might make the low-contrast stimulus weaker for V1 neurons, causing a move toward a lower level of sublinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sceniak et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Attention to a stimulus has been suggested in the literature to be similar to an increase in the contrast of the attended stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2012</xref>), which is manifested in the similar effects of attention and contrast in the normalization equation. In this study, we presented the stimuli with a constant contrast but changed the number of stimuli and their attentional state to determine whether the normalization model could explain the effects of object-based attention in the human visual cortex, which has not been previously studied. We acknowledge that to fully ascertain the role of normalization in the human brain, we have to measure the contrast response function in each voxel to truly constrain the models and have conditions with varying levels of contrasts across attentional manipulations. Note that including variations of both attentional state and contrast is not trivial and is not possible with a single-session fMRI experiment. Our results remain suggestive of the role of normalization until these conditions are tested in future multi-session experiments.</p><p>Here, we compared the nonlinear normalization model with two linear models with fewer free parameters. To ensure that the difference in the number of free parameters did not affect the results, we used cross-validation and the AIC measure to compare model predictions with the data. If the success of the normalization model was due to its higher number of free parameters, it would affect its predictions for left-out data. We observed that the normalization model was also successful in predicting the left-out part of the data. In addition, we tested a nonlinear model variant with five free parameters. This model was still a worse fit than the normalization model. Finally, we used simulations of three different neural populations, with neurons in each population following either a summing, averaging, or normalization rule in their response to multiple stimuli and attended stimuli. Simulation results demonstrated that the normalization model was a better fit only for the normalizing population, confirming that the success of the normalization model is not due to its nonlinearity or the higher number of parameters but rather as a result of it being a closer estimation of the computation performed at the neural level for object representation.</p><p>It is noteworthy that here, we are looking at the BOLD responses. We are aware of the limitations of the fMRI technique as the BOLD response is an indirect measure of the activity of neural populations. While an increase in the BOLD signal could be related to an increase in the neuronal firing rates of the local population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>), it could also be related to subthreshold activity resulting from feedback from the downstream regions of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heeger and Ress, 2002</xref>). The observed effects, therefore, may be related to local population responses or may be influenced by feedback from downstream regions. Also, since the measured BOLD signal is related to the average activity of the local population, and we do not have access to single-unit responses, some effects may change in the averaging process. Nevertheless, our simulation results show that the effects of the normalization computation are preserved even after averaging. We should keep in mind, though, that these are only simulations and are not based on data directly measured from neurons. Future experiments with intracranial recordings from neurons in the human visual cortex would be invaluable in validating our results.</p><p>Another limitation in interpreting the results is related to a possible stronger saturation of the BOLD response, which can potentially explain the observed asymmetry in attentional modulation. Since the asymmetry in attentional modulation has also been previously reported at the neural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2012</xref>), this effect is unlikely to be exclusively caused by the saturation in the BOLD signal. It is noteworthy, however, that saturation is a characteristic of cortical responses even at the neural level. Whether this effect at the neural level is caused by response saturation or as a result of the normalization computation cannot be distinguished from our current knowledge. Nevertheless, we tested a variant of the weighted average model with an extra saturation parameter. Although this model could partially predict the observed asymmetry, the predictions were worse than the normalization model’s predictions. Also, this model was an overall worse fit to the data compared to the normalization model. The normalization model, therefore, provides a more parsimonious account of the data. Nevertheless, we have only tested a saturation model. The exact nonlinearities that affect the transformation of neural population responses to the BOLD response are not fully mapped out yet, especially in cases where multiple overlapping stimuli are presented in the visual scene. It is possible that the advantage of the normalization model could be at least partly related to these nonlinearities. Modeling such nonlinearities requires experiments that simultaneously record fMRI and neural data. The validity of our conclusions about the superiority of the normalization model should be reevaluated after such data becomes available.</p><p>In sum, our results indicate that the normalization model predicts responses at the voxel level beyond the primary visual cortex and across the visual hierarchy, especially in higher-level regions of the human occipito-temporal cortex, with and without attention and in conditions with isolated or cluttered stimuli. We, therefore, provide evidence suggesting divisive normalization as a canonical computation operating in the human brain during object-based attention.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 21 healthy right-handed participants (10 females, 20–40, all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision) participated in the experiment.

Based on previous studies with sample sizes of 5–10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem and Ling, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reddy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kay et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2013b</xref>), we are confident that with this sample size, we have enough power for comparing different model predictions of fMRI responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimuli and experimental procedure</title><p>Stimuli were from the two categories of human bodies and houses similar to the ones used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vaziri-Pashkam and Xu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vaziri-Pashkam and Xu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu and Vaziri-Pashkam, 2019</xref>). Each category consisted of ten unique exemplars in gray-scale format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These exemplars differed in identity, pose (for bodies), and viewing angle (for houses). Stimuli were fitted into a transparent square subtending 10.2° of visual angle and placed on a gray background. A central red fixation point subtending 0.45° of visual angle was present throughout the run. Stimuli from each category were presented in semi-transparent form, in isolation, or paired with stimuli from the other category.</p><p>In a blocked-design paradigm, participants were instructed by a word cue to attend to bodies, houses, or the color of the fixation point at the beginning of each block. Therefore, the stimuli from each category were either attended (when the category was cued), or ignored (when the fixation point color was cued), in isolation or cluttered by stimuli from the other category. The main experiment thus consisted of seven blocks with all possible combinations of stimulus categories and attention: Attend isolated bodies, Attend cluttered bodies, Attend isolated houses, Attend cluttered houses, Ignore isolated bodies, Ignore isolated houses, Ignore cluttered bodies and houses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In blocks with attention to bodies or houses, participants performed a one-back repetition detection task on the attended stimuli by pressing a button when the exact same stimulus appeared in two consecutive trials. In blocks with attention directed toward the fixation point color, participants responded when the color of the fixation point changed from red to orange. These blocks served as conditions in which the visual stimuli (bodies and houses) were ignored. Target repetition and fixation point color change occurred 2–3 times at random in each block. There was also an additional fixation color block in each run, with a red fixation point presented in the middle of the gray screen and in the absence of stimuli from either category. The participants’ task in this block was to detect a fixation point color change. The fixation point color changed to orange two or three times during the block. We used a contrast between the BH condition (with the same task but with the presence of both body and house stimuli) and this fixation condition to select the voxels in each ROI that were responsive to the presented stimuli. This was especially important for V1 voxels, since the stimuli presented in the early visual area localizer were larger than the stimuli presented in the main experiment.</p><p>Each run started with an 8 s fixation. Each block lasted for 10 s, starting with a 1 s cue and a 1 s fixation. 10 exemplars from one or both categories were presented during the block, each for 400 ms, followed by 400 ms of fixation. There was an 8 s fixation between blocks, and a final 8 s fixation at the end of the last block. The presentation order of the blocks was random, and counterbalanced across the experimental runs. Each run lasted 2 min 32 s. For the main experiment, 14 participants completed 16 runs, two participants completed 14 runs, and three participants completed 12 runs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Localizer experiments</title><p>In this study we examined the primary visual cortex V1 along with the object-selective areas LO and pFs, the body-selective EBA, and the scene-selective PPA.

We used previously established protocols for the localizer experiments, but the details are repeated here for clarification and convenience.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Early visual area localizer</title><p>We used meridian mapping to localize the primary visual cortex V1. Participants viewed a black-and-white checkerboard pattern with a diameter of 27.1° of visual angle through a 60 degree polar angle wedge aperture. The wedge was presented either horizontally or vertically. Participants were asked to detect a luminance change in the wedge in a blocked-design paradigm. Each run consisted of four horizontal and four vertical blocks, each lasting 16 s, with 16 s of fixation in between. A final 16 s fixation followed the last block. Each run lasted 272 s. The order of the blocks was counterbalanced within each run. Each participant completed two runs of this localizer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Category localizer</title><p>A category localizer was used to localize the cortical regions selective to scenes, bodies, and objects. In a blocked-design paradigm, participants viewed stimuli from the five categories of faces, scenes, objects, bodies, and scrambled images, with each stimulus subtending 14.3° of visual angle. Each localizer run contained two 16 s blocks of each category, with the presentation order counterbalanced within each run. An 8 s fixation period was presented at the beginning, middle, and end of the run. In each block, 20 stimuli from the same category were presented. Each trial lasted 750 ms with 50 ms fixation in between. Participants were asked to maintain their fixation on a red circle at the center of the screen and press a key when they detected a slight jitter in the stimuli. Participants completed two runs of this localizer, each lasting 344 s.

For each participant, we performed a whole-brain anatomical scan using a T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence at the beginning of data acquisition. For the functional scans, including the main experiment and the localizer experiments, 33 slices parallel to the AC-PC line were acquired using T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar sequences covering the whole brain (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix size = 64 × 64). The stimuli were back-projected onto a screen using an LCD projector with the refresh rate of 60 Hz and the spatial resolution of 768 × 1024 positioned at the rear of the magnet, and participants observed the screen through a mirror attached to the head coil.

The data in each run were motion-corrected per-run and aligned to the anatomical data using the middle time point of that run. The fMRI data from the localizer was smoothed using a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, but no spatial smoothing was performed on the data from the main experiment to optimize the voxel-wise analyses. A double gamma function was used to model the hemodynamic response function. We eliminated the first four volumes of each run to allow the signal to reach a steady state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ROI definition</title><p>Using freesurfer’s tksurfer module, we determined the primary visual cortex V1 using a contrast of horizontal versus vertical polar angle wedges to reveal the topographic maps in the occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sereno et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tootell et al., 1998</xref>).

Movement parameters and linear and quadratic nuisance regressors were also included in the GLM. We then used these obtained coefficients to compare the BOLD response in different conditions in each ROI. In order to compensate for the difference in size between the localizer stimuli and the stimuli presented in the main experiment, we selected active voxels in each ROI using a contrast between the BH condition (with ignored body and house stimuli) and the fixation block (with no stimuli presented).

Instead, each stimulus had a different weight in the average, but the sum of the weights was set to 1:<disp-formula id="equ11"><label>(4a)</label><mml:math id="m11"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ12"><label>(4b)</label><mml:math id="m12"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ13"><label>(4c)</label><mml:math id="m13"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf101"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes the response elicited with the preferred and null stimuli present in the receptive field, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf102"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf103"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> denote the response to isolated preferred and null stimuli, respectively.

Then, using the estimated parameters for the first half, we calculated model predictions for each voxel in each condition and compared the predictions with the left-out half of the data. All comparisons of data with models, including the calculation of the goodness of fit, were done using the left-out data. We repeated this procedure twice: once using the odd half of the data for parameter estimation and the even half for comparing model predictions with the data, and a second time using the even half of the data for parameter estimation and the odd half for comparison with the model predictions. All figures, including model results, illustrate the average of the two repetitions. Since the weighted sum and the weighted average models used the response in the P and N conditions to predict responses in the remaining five conditions, we only used these five conditions and excluded the P and N conditions when calculating the goodness of fit for all models. The goodness of fit was calculated by taking the square of the correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted responses for each voxel across the five modeled conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also calculated the correlation between voxel responses of the two halves of the data across the same five conditions and calculated the noise ceiling in each ROI as the squared coefficient of this correlation.

A smaller AIC value shows that the model fits the data better. We therefore calculated ΔAIC for all model pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Simulation</title><p>To further check whether the success of the normalization model was due to its higher number of parameters or as a result of it being a closer estimation of the performed neural computations, we used a simulation approach. We simulated neural responses for single and multiple stimuli in the absence and presence of attention. In a neural population composed of 10<sup>4</sup> neurons, neurons were body- or house-selective. Each neuron also responded to the category other than its preferred category, but to a lesser degree and with variation. We had three kinds of neurons: (i) summing neurons, for which the response to multiple stimuli and attended stimuli was calculated based on the weighted sum model, (ii) averaging neurons, which behaved based on the weighted average model, and (iii) normalizing neurons, which behaved based on divisive normalization. We chose neural responses and the attention factor randomly from a range comparable with neural studies of attention and object recognition in the ventral visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Tsao, 2018</xref>). Using equations discussed for each of the models, we calculated the response of each neuron to the seven conditions of our main fMRI experiment. Then, we randomly chose 200 neurons from the population, with the ratio of body/house preference similar to each of the ROIs in the main experiment. We then averaged the selected neurons’ responses to make up a voxel and added Gaussian noise to the voxel, 16 times for each voxel with a different Gaussian noise every time to make up 16 measurements (16 runs, as in the fMRI experiment) for each condition. We had 30 voxels for each ROI. Then, dividing the runs into two halves, we performed the same modeling process as in the fMRI experiment. For the three models of weighted sum, weighted average, and normalization, we estimated model parameters for one-half of the data and predicted voxel responses for the second half of the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Quantifying attentional effects</title><p>We defined two indices to quantify the observed effects of attention.

Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf120"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), so we used the Greenhouse-Geisser estimate to correct the degrees of freedom (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf121"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.19</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). Finally, to compare the fits of the normalization model and the weighted average UWUB saturation model across ROIs, we ran a 2 × 5 repeated measures ANOVA.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note that the reviewers think that the paper has potential but extensive revisions are needed.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Theoretical framework and interpretation</p><p>(1) The title is misleading and a bit grandiose – &quot;In&quot; instead of &quot;across&quot;. Across would imply evidence for normalization across all ~30 areas of visual brain, whereas the authors just have 5. Suggestion to replace with 'in Human visual cortex' or 'in object-selective and category-selective regions in human visual cortex' (see related next point).</p><p>(2) Given that the normalization model is a favorite in the attended conditions but less so in the other conditions, the abstract and title could be toned down, as this gives the impression that the normalization model consistently outperforms the other models.</p><p>(3) Lines 18-20 – Include more recent references</p><p>(4) Line 21 – Explain how normalization regulates the gain of the attended stimulus in the monkey brain.</p><p>(5) The authors state at multiple points in the manuscript that 'no study to date has directly tested the validity of the normalization model in predicting human cortical responses&quot;. Which is odd because the authors then go to cite a few of the studies that have done exactly that. Moreover, there are a number of other studies left out of, such as Ithipuripat et al., 2014. Perhaps the authors mean 'using fMRI', but in that case there still remains a few (including that cited) that suggest otherwise. The authors should soften this statement, or clarify on what they mean.</p><p>(6) Lines 23-25 – Related to the previous point. There is a recent study in PNAS which must be cited Aqil, Knapen and Dumoulin (PNAS 2021). Moreover, the authors should discuss how this manuscript goes beyond that study and discuss any supporting or conflicting conclusions. See also the Commentary by Foster and Ling (PNAS 2021).</p><p>Also, there is evidence of normalization in behavioral studies that seems worth mentioning; e.g., Herrmann et al. (Nature Neurosci 2010, JoV 2012); Schwedhelm et al. (PLoS Comput Biol 2016).</p><p>(7) The authors should discuss if there is neural and/or behavioral evidence of normalization in object-based attention (which would also provide some justification for the stimuli chosen, rather than what prior work of a similar vein has used i.e. contrast gratings). This is important as it is the manipulation in the present study, but most of the papers in the Introduction refer to spatial attention, and it should not be taken for granted that either the behavioral or the neural effects are the same for different types of attention or for different types of stimuli.</p><p>(8) Line 33: Specify which models? The normalization and weighted average model?</p><p>(9) Line 55-56. The authors refer to the figure to show how BOLD response changes across task conditions, but there is no interpretation of these data. How do we expect the raw data to look? Does this match the current data? If so why, if not, why not? In its current form, a figure of data is shown without explaining what it means. The authors could present examples of the BOLD signal elicited from the seven conditions; doing so would provide a deeper look at the data and how the fMRI signal changes with condition. Is there a pattern to the response?</p><p>(10) Line 86-89: The authors state, &quot;As evident in the figure, the predictions of the normalization model (in orange) very closely follow the observed data (in navy), while the predictions of the weighted sum and weighted average models (light blue and gray, respectively) have significant deviations from the data&quot;. In which ROIs? All of them? It looks like the normalization model looks close to the data for PFs, EBA and LO. For V1 and PPA it is better than the other two but it is not as close. Is this what is shown in 2C?</p><p>Suggestion to order the panels in Figure 2 logically (the BOLD and model data all presented in A for all 5 ROIs) – there's no reason to just show LO1 as the main figure because it looks best, then the variance explained panel after – then separately the R2. Much of the paper comes across as 'normalization is better for all' and removes any nuance in differences in different areas; why might it be better in some than others? This is not detailed in the manuscript.</p><p>(11) Could the asymmetry effect found in the BOLD response be driven potentially by nonlinearities in the BOLD response, rather than being neural in origin? Do the authors have ways to mitigate this concern? One thought would be to show the relation (or lack thereof) between voxels that have a high BOLD response, and their degree of asymmetry. If the effect is not due to saturation, one would expect no significant relation.</p><p>(12) The changes in response with attention and the asymmetry effects are predictions of the biased competition model of attention and reference should be made to this literature (e.g., papers by Desimone and Duncan). In addition, this is not the first time that an asymmetry effect is observed in the fMRI literature (line 131). This effect is a direct prediction of the biased competition theory of attention, and has been previously reported in the fMRI literature as well (e.g., in reference 12).</p><p>(13) Line 178-181 – The limitation mentioned here is very vague. Some discussion of the limitations should go beyond 'we are aware there are limitations and hope one day they can be overcome'. What do these limitations mean for the data analysis and the interpretation of results? What could alternative explanations be? How will they be overcome?</p><p>Model</p><p>(1) A main concern regarding the interpretation of these results has to do with the sparseness of data available to fit with the models. The authors pit two linear models against a nonlinear (normalization) model. The predictions for weighted average and summed models are both linear models doomed to poorly match the fMRI data, particularly in contrast to the nonlinear model. So, while the verification that responses to multiple stimuli don't add up or average each other is appreciated, the model comparisons seem less interesting in this light. The model testing endeavor seems rather unconstrained. A 'true' test of the model would likely need a whole range of contrasts tested for one (or both) of the stimuli. Otherwise, as it stands we simply have a parameter (σ) that instantly gives more wiggle room than the other models. It would be fairer to pit this normalization model against other nonlinear models. Indeed, this has already been done in previous work by Kendrick Kay, Jon Winawer and Serge Dumoulin's groups. The same issue of course extends to the attended conditions.</p><p>(2) The difference in the number of free parameters biases the results. The normalization model has more free parameters than the other two models. The authors use a split-half approach to avoid the problem of overfitting, but a model with more free parameters in and of itself potentially has a better capacity to fit the data compared to the other models. This built in bias could account for the results. Model comparison (like with the AIC measure) is necessary to account for this difference.</p><p>(3) Related to the above point, the response to the Pref (P) and Null (N) stimuli are also free parameters in the normalization model and it's not clear why the values of Rp and Rn are not used here as for the other two models? These differences could again account for the better fit observed for the normalization model. Further, what are the values of Cp and Cn in the normalization model? How are they determined?</p><p>(4) The weighted average model is confusing. Equation 5a is a strict average model. The weighted average model (Desimone and Duncan) however proposes that the response to combined stimuli is a weighted average of the response to the individual stimuli (i.e., with possibly different weights for each stimulus). Second, attention biases these weight values by possibly different amounts for different stimuli/in different brain regions. In this study, the response to the combined stimuli is modeled as a strict average (with a fixed weight of 0.5), and further, one fixed weight (β) is assigned to P and N for attention effects. However, in the weighted average model, the effect of attention could potentially be different for the preferred and null stimuli (i.e., a different β for P and another β for N), which might generate a better fit for the weighted average model. Indeed, although it is difficult to read off the graph, attention appears to enhance the response to the N stimuli more than to the P stimuli. How might the results be affected if the weights in the PN condition are not fixed to 0.5, and if attention is allowed to differently affect the two types of stimuli? A similar argument could also be made for the weighted sum model.</p><p>(5) Line 57-61: What is the justification of using the weighted sum model when we know that this model is not reflective of what is going on in the brain? It sounds like it has been set up to fail. Has the weighted sum model been shown to predict responses in prior work? It is never really brought up again in the discussion, so its purpose is unclear. Wouldn't a comparison of the weighted average and normalization model make more sense? Better yet, consider comparisons with other model(s) beyond normalization that could explain the data.</p><p>Methods and data analysis</p><p>(1) FIGURE 1 – protocol – Is task difficulty equated across house category, body category, and color change at fixation?</p><p>(2) Did participants complete any practice trials for the one back task, or just went right into the scanner? Was the accuracy of the participants in the one back task recorded to ensure that they were paying attention and completing the task properly? Same for the fixation task</p><p>(3) Most of page 6 is a repetition of the methods (much copy and paste), not really needed, instead a short summary would be better or just move the methods to after the introduction.</p><p>(4) Some of the details regarding the actual design of the fMRI experiment seem glossed over. From what I can gather, each block was only a few seconds, with no rest between blocks? If so, the BOLD response would be exceptionally driven to saturating levels throughout the experiment. That said, it is difficult to unpack the details based on the Methods section as vague detail is provided.</p><p>(5) Lines 47-51. It is unclear how preferred (P) or null (N) stimulus categories were assigned to each voxel. Does a voxel preferring houses respond greater to houses than a body? Was there a statistical measure for determining what was the P or N stimulus for a given voxel? We imagine that almost all voxels in EBA significantly preferred bodies, and almost all voxels in PPA preferred houses. If so, how is this accounted for? Was there a reliable, statistically significant difference in house or body preference for voxels in the other ROIs, or is the difference between response activation to the two categories marginal? How many voxels preferred houses vs. bodies in each ROI? For each voxel, how reliable is the attribution of the P or N stimulus (e.g., did you use a cross-validation approach and determine P/N on some runs and tested the reliability on the remaining runs)?</p><p>(6) Were the P and N categories determined on all the data (a risk of double-dipping) or only on one half of the dataset?</p><p>(7) Provide more details of the GLM. What were the regressors?</p><p>(8) Lines 79-81: Were the model parameters determined in the second half and predictions made in the first half as well? Would averaging the two directions provide more robust results?</p><p>(9) Category stimuli were fit within a 10.2 degree square of visual angle. The methods describe the V1 localizer as a wedge 60 degree in angle. What was the stimulus extent (i.e. eccentricity) of the wedge? Was it also 10.2 degrees so that the V1 ROI encompassed the same amount of visual space as the category stimuli? Same question for the Category localizer. Were these stimuli also 10.2 degrees? Were the ROIs (at least for V1?) defined within the same eccentricity range so that the ROI analysis was confined to where the category stimuli were presented in the visual field?</p><p>(10) What software was used to define LOC PF EBA and PPA? And what metric do we have to ensure that these are reliable ROIs? The authors would benefit by including figures that show examples of the ROIs overlaid on contrast data for the localizer conditions. The same goes for the β weights within the ROIs.</p><p>(11) Preprocessing – how were the data aligned?</p><p>(12) The paper refers to a Supplementary Methods, which I could not find.</p><p>Results and statistics</p><p>(1) What was accuracy like on these tasks? There was no description of performance at all. It is necessary to provide this information to assess the attentional manipulation</p><p>(2) Line 96 – What is ts? T-statistic? Did you run a series of t-tests comparing normalization vs noise ceiling? Why not an ANOVA and correct for multiple comparisons? And what does it mean that the R2 was not significant different from noise ceiling? Interpretation of these results must be provided.</p><p>(3) Lines 119-123. Again, why a t-test statistic here? Did you run multiple t-tests for each ROI? Shouldn't this be an ANOVA across the 5 ROIs? As it stands, line 120 says that you ran multiple t tests across all the regions, and then report single t-statistic? The paper needs to be clear (and correct) in the type of statistics it uses to make its claims.</p><p>(4) There is no assessment of the quality of the data – no Β weight maps showing the responses on the brain, or what proportion of voxels in each ROI actually responded to the stimuli. A lot of interesting data that could be shown is reduced to line plots -this comes across as the paper starting at the end, rather than providing any sense of buildup in the data analysis and the conclusions that the authors draw.</p><p>(5) The authors show the goodness of fit across the 5 modeled conditions in 2C – fine, but what is the justification for lumping all the conditions together? Is there a supplement figure that teases this apart, with the goodness of fit for each model for each of the conditions, for each ROI? It would help to be comprehensive.</p><p>(6) Averaging all the data together (e.g., in Figure 2c across all conditions) does not provide a clear picture of the results. Is it possible that it is only in the attention conditions that the normalization model outperforms the others (although again, note the remark about the different numbers of free parameters in each model)? It would be more transparent to plot Figure 2c separately for the isolated/paired conditions, even though the story might become more complex.</p><p>(7) Related to the above points, the data are provided in a very synthesized manner, and raw results are not shown. For example, could we see the values of the estimated model parameters? How do they compare when determined in each half of the data (to get a sense of reliability)?</p><p>Figures</p><p>(1) Figure 1b: The gray squares overlap a lot so that we don't see the stimuli in each gray square.</p><p>(2) The y-axis label in Figure 2A is not BOLD response (this would be appropriate if the figure was a BOLD time series); is this the average fMRI Β weight?</p><p>(3) In Figure 2 (a and b), the connecting of data points as if they are on a continuum is not correct given their categorical nature. Moreover, the figure could be improved so that the actual data points are made more prominent, and the model predictions are dashed lines. What exactly do the error bars in Figure 2a and 2b correspond to?</p><p>(4) Suggestion to order the panels in Figure 2 logically (the BOLD and model data all presented in A for all 5 ROIs).</p><p>(5) Is there any statistic to help evaluate the data in Figure 2C? (Line 93)</p><p>(6) Figure 3 – Why not include the BOLD response for P only and N only? That would be informative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75726.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Theoretical framework and interpretation</p><p>(1) The title is misleading and a bit grandiose – &quot;In&quot; instead of &quot;across&quot;.

A few studies have demonstrated the quantitative advantage of normalization-based models compared to linear models in predicting human fMRI responses using gratings, noise patterns, and single objects (Kay et al. 2013a, Kay et al. 2013b), as well as moving checkerboards (Aqil et al. 2021, Foster and Ling 2021).

As the reviewer has pointed out, this is precisely why we ran this study. We could not find evidence of normalization in object-based attention in the literature.

These studies have focused on space-based (Reynolds Heeger 2009, Lee Maunsell 2009, Ni et al. 2012,) or feature-based (Ni et al. 2019) attention. While it has been suggested that these different forms of attention affect neural responses in similar ways, there exist distinctions in their reported effects, such as different time courses (Hayden and Gallant 2005), and the extent to which they affect different locations in the visual field (Serences and Boynton 2007, Womelsdorf et al. 2006), suggesting that there are common sources as well as differences in modulation mechanisms between these forms of attention (Ni and Maunsell 2019).

Is there a pattern to the response?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that including the response in the seven conditions would be very helpful for readers. We have added a figure illustrating the average fMRI responses across voxels for all conditions and in all regions, see Figure 2.</p><p>We have also included our interpretation of the observed results in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 118-150:</p><p>“To examine the cortical response in different task conditions, we fit a general linear model and estimated the regression coefficients for each voxel in each condition. Figure 2a-e illustrates the average voxel coefficients for different conditions in the five regions of interest (ROIs), including V1, LO, pFs, EBA, and PPA. Each task condition was named based on the presented stimuli and the target of attention, with B and H denoting the presence of body and house stimuli, respectively, and the superscript “at” denoting the target of attention. Note that we have not included the responses related to the fixation block with no stimulus since this condition was only used to select the voxels that were responsive to the presented stimuli in each ROI (see Methods). We observed that the average voxel coefficients related to the four conditions in which attention was directed to the body or the house stimuli (the first four conditions, B<sup>at</sup>, B<sup>at</sup>H, BH<sup>at</sup>, H<sup>at</sup>) were generally higher than the response related to the last three conditions (B, H and BH conditions) in which the body and house stimuli were unattended (ts &gt; 4, ps &lt;1.7⨯10<sup>-3</sup>, corrected). This is in agreement with previous research indicating that attention to objects increases their cortical responses (Roelfsema 1998, O’craven 1999, Reddy 2009).</p><p>Looking more closely at the results in the regions EBA and PPA that have strong preferences for body and house stimuli, respectively, it seems that the effect of attention interacts with the regions’ preference. For instance, in the body-selective region EBA, the response to attended body stimuli in isolation is similar to the response to attended body stimuli paired with unattended house stimuli (compare B<sup>at</sup> and B<sup>at</sup>H bars). On the other hand, the response to attended house stimuli in the isolated condition is significantly less than the response to attended house stimuli paired with unattended body stimuli. We can observe similar results in PPA, but not in V1 or the object-selective regions LO and pFs. But note that the latter three regions do not have strong preferences for one of the stimuli. Therefore, in order to examine the interaction between attention and preference more closely, we determined preferences at the voxel level in all ROIs.</p><p>We defined the preferred (P) and null (N) stimulus categories for each voxel in each ROI according to the voxel’s response to isolated body and isolated house conditions. Figure 2f shows the percentage of voxels in each region that were selective to bodies and houses averaged across participants. As illustrated in the figure, in the object-selective regions LO and pFs, almost half of the voxels were selective to each category, while in the EBA and PPA regions, the general preference of the region prevailed (Even though these regions are selected based on their preference), the noise in the fMRI data and other variations due to imperfect registration could lead to some voxels showing different preferences in the main session compared to the localizer session (Peelen and Downing 2005).”</p><p>In addition, we have now included the interpretation of the results illustrated in figure 3 (figure 2 in the previous version) in lines 160-173:</p><p>“We observed that the mean voxel response was generally higher when each stimulus was attended compared to the condition in which it was ignored. For instance, the response in the P<sup>at</sup> condition (in which the isolated preferred stimulus was attended) was higher than in the P condition (where the isolated preferred stimulus was ignored) in LO, pFs, and PPA (ts &gt; 3.6, ps &lt; 0.01, corrected), marginally higher in EBA (t(18)=2.69, p=0.072, corrected), and not significantly higher in V1 (t(18)=2.52, p=0.1, corrected). Similarly, comparing the N and N<sup>at</sup> conditions in each ROI, we observed an increase in response caused by attention in all ROIs (ts &gt; 4, ps &lt; 3.7⨯10<sup>-3</sup>, corrected) except for V1 (t(18)=2.4, p=0.13, corrected). A similar trend of response enhancement due to attention could also be observed in the paired conditions: attending to either stimulus increased the response in all ROIs (ts &gt; 4.4, ps &lt; 1.5⨯10<sup>-3</sup>, corrected) except for V1 (ts&lt;2.59, ps &gt; 0.087, corrected). In all cases, the effect of attention was absent or only marginally significant in V1, which is not surprising since attentional effects are much weaker (Mcadams and Maunsell 1999) or even absent (Luck et al. 1997) in V1 compared to the higher-level regions of the occipito-temporal cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Line 86-89: The authors state, &quot;As evident in the figure, the predictions of the normalization model (in orange) very closely follow the observed data (in navy), while the predictions of the weighted sum and weighted average models (light blue and gray, respectively) have significant deviations from the data&quot;.

We ran a one-way ANOVA to test for the effect of ROI on NRD, and observed that this measure was not significantly different across ROIs (F(4,72)=0.58, p = 0.61), demonstrating that the normalization model was equally successful across ROIs in predicting the explainable variation in the data.”</p><p>We have also included the details of model comparison, showing which model performed better in each region, in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 229-239:</p><p>“We first compared the goodness of fit of the three models across the five ROIs using a 3⨯5 repeated measures ANOVA.

This observation might be related to the higher sensitivity of V1 neurons to contrast (Goodyear and Menon, 1998), causing a more significant decrease in V1 responses to low-contrast stimuli. This, in turn, might make the low-contrast stimulus weaker for V1 neurons, causing a move towards a lower level of sublinearity (Sceniak et al. 1999).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Could the asymmetry effect found in the BOLD response be driven potentially by nonlinearities in the BOLD response, rather than being neural in origin?

In fact, Reddy et al. (2009) used a weighted average model and reported a bias of 30% when attention was directed to one stimulus compared to when it was divided between the two stimuli.

We are aware of the limitations of the fMRI technique as the BOLD response is an indirect measure of the activity of neural populations. While an increase in the BOLD signal could be related to an increase in the neuronal firing rates of the local population (Logothetis et al. 2001), it could also be related to subthreshold activity resulting from feedback from the downstream regions of the visual cortex (Heeger and Ress 2002). The observed effects, therefore, may be related to local population responses or may be influenced by feedback from downstream regions. Also, since the measured BOLD signal is related to the average activity of the local population, and we do not have access to single unit responses, some effects may change in the averaging process. Nevertheless, our simulation results show that the effects of the normalization computation are preserved even after averaging. We should keep in mind, though, that these are only simulations and are not based on data directly measured from neurons. Future experiments with intracranial recordings from neurons in the human visual cortex would be invaluable in validating our results.</p><p>Another limitation in interpreting the results is related to a possible stronger saturation of the BOLD response, which can potentially explain the observed asymmetry in attentional modulation. Since the asymmetry in attentional modulation has also been previously reported at the neural level (Ni and Maunsell, 2012), this effect is unlikely to be exclusively caused by the nonlinearities in the BOLD signal.

The authors pit two linear models against a nonlinear (normalization) model. The predictions for weighted average and summed models are both linear models doomed to poorly match the fMRI data, particularly in contrast to the nonlinear model. So, while the verification that responses to multiple stimuli don't add up or average each other is appreciated, the model comparisons seem less interesting in this light. The model testing endeavor seems rather unconstrained. A 'true' test of the model would likely need a whole range of contrasts tested for one (or both) of the stimuli. Otherwise, as it stands we simply have a parameter (σ) that instantly gives more wiggle room than the other models. It would be fairer to pit this normalization model against other nonlinear models. Indeed, this has already been done in previous work by Kendrick Kay, Jon Winawer and Serge Dumoulin's groups. The same issue of course extends to the attended conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Regarding the reviewer’s concern about comparing a nonlinear model with a linear one, we have tried to answer with two different approaches. First, as suggested by the reviewer, we used a nonlinear variant of the weighted average model with an extra saturation parameter. This model had distinct free parameters for the weights of the preferred and null stimuli and distinct attention parameters for the preferred and null stimuli. It, therefore, had five free parameters. The comparison between the results of this model with the normalization model’s predictions showed that the predictions of this model were significantly worse than normalization in all regions (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.008, corrected).</p><p>We have added these results in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 352-357:</p><p>“After running a 2⨯5 ANOVA to compare the fits of the normalization model and the weighted average UWUB saturation model across ROIs, we observed a significant effect of model (F(1,18) = 91.16, p = 1.8⨯10<sup>-8</sup>), a significant effect of ROI (F(4,72) = 19.46, p = 2.21⨯10<sup>-7</sup>), and a significant model by ROI interaction (F(4,72) = 4.82, p = 0.0061). Post-hoc t-tests showed that the normalization model was a significantly better fit than the saturation model in all ROIs (ps&lt; 0.008, corrected).”</p><p>We have also included a figure illustrating the comparison between the normalization model and the saturation model in the paper (see the figure in the response to comment 11 of <italic>Theoretical framework and interpretation</italic> section of this letter).</p><p>The second approach we took was the simulation of responses of a neural population. We simulated three neural populations: one in which the neural response to multiple stimuli and attended stimuli was calculated based on the weighted sum model (summing neurons), one in which neural responses were calculated based on the weighted average model (averaging neurons), and one in which neural responses were calculated based on divisive normalization (normalizing neurons). Then, by randomly selecting neurons from the population to make up voxels, we estimated model parameters for each voxel using each of the three models used in our study. We then predicted the response of the left-out half of the simulated data using the parameters estimated for the first half. The results demonstrate that the normalization model is only a better fit when predicting the response of a normalizing population (figure 3—figure supplement 2). It performs worse than the weighted sum model for summing neurons and worse than the weighted average model for averaging neurons. Therefore, a nonlinear model is not necessarily a better fit for a linear operation.</p><p>We have included the simulation results in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 258-267:</p><p>“To ensure that the superiority of the normalization model over the weighted sum and weighted average models was not caused by the normalization model's nonlinearity or its higher number of parameters, we ran simulations of three neural populations. Neurons in each population calculated responses to multiple stimuli and attended stimuli by a summing, an averaging, and a normalizing rule (see Methods). We then used the three models to predict the population responses. Our simulation results demonstrate that despite the higher number of parameters, the normalization model is only a better fit for the population of normalizing neurons and not for summing or averaging neurons, as illustrated in figure 3—figure supplement 2. These results confirm that the better fits of the normalization model cannot be related to the model's nonlinearity or its higher number of parameters.”</p><p>We have also included the simulation details in the <italic>Simulation</italic> section in the <italic>Methods</italic> section.</p><p>In addition to these two approaches, and along with cross-validation previously used, we have also included the AIC measure for model comparison to correct for the difference in the number of parameters in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 234-236 (see the response to the next comment):</p><p>“Since the normalization model had more parameters, we also used the AIC measure to correct for the difference in the number of parameters.

Using AIC to compensate for the difference in the number of parameters confirms our cross-validated r-squared comparisons. Given the robustness of the agreement in the results of these analyses, we do not believe nonlinearity or the number of parameters can explain the superiority of the normalization model.</p><p>We have discussed these approaches in the <italic>Discussion section</italic> in lines 442-454:</p><p>“Here, we compared the nonlinear normalization model with two linear models with fewer free parameters. To ensure that the difference in the number of free parameters did not affect the results, we used cross-validation and the AIC measure to compare model predictions with the data. If the success of the normalization model was due to its higher number of free parameters, it would affect its predictions for left-out data. We observed that the normalization model was also successful in predicting the left-out part of the data. In addition, we tested a nonlinear model variant with five free parameters. This model was still a worse fit than the normalization model. Finally, we used simulations of three different neural populations, with neurons in each population following either a summing, averaging, or normalization rule in their response to multiple stimuli and attended stimuli. Simulation results demonstrated that the normalization model was a better fit only for the normalizing population, confirming that the success of the normalization model is not due to its nonlinearity or the higher number of parameters but rather as a result of it being a closer estimation of the computation performed at the neural level for object representation.”</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s suggestion on testing a range of contrasts, as we have now mentioned in the Discussion section, here, we have explored the effects of attention and whether the normalization model could explain the effects of object-based attention in the human visual cortex, which has not been previously studied. While we acknowledge the importance of studying the effects of contrast, the presentation of superimposed stimuli limits the range of contrasts we can use because high-contrast stimuli block each other, and stimuli with very low contrasts are very difficult to recognize. Besides, including variations of both attentional state and contrast would need a multi-session experiment, which was not feasible given the limitations caused by the COVID pandemic.</p><p>We have added this in the <italic>Discussion section</italic> in lines 431-441:</p><p>“Attention to a stimulus has been suggested in the literature to be similar to an increase in the contrast of the attended stimulus (Ni and Maunsell 2012), which is manifested in the similar effects of attention and contrast in the normalization equation. In this study, we presented the stimuli with a constant contrast but changed the number of stimuli and their attentional state to determine whether the normalization model could explain the effects of object-based attention in the human visual cortex, which has not been previously studied. Although we acknowledge that testing for a range of contrasts would help in exploring the interaction of contrast and attention and in generalizing the conclusions of this study, it would not be trivial for the current design because the presentation of superimposed stimuli limits the range of contrasts that can be tested. Besides, including variations of both attentional state and contrast would need a multi-session fMRI experiment that would limit the feasibility of the study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The difference in the number of free parameters biases the results. The normalization model has more free parameters than the other two models. The authors use a split-half approach to avoid the problem of overfitting, but a model with more free parameters in and of itself potentially has a better capacity to fit the data compared to the other models. This built in bias could account for the results. Model comparison (like with the AIC measure) is necessary to account for this difference.</p></disp-quote><p>As our simulation results show (see the response to the previous comment), a non-linear model does not necessarily fit the data better if the underlying population response follows a linear summation. Our cross-validation approach ensures that the number of parameters would not benefit us in fitting the left out data (Kay et al. 2013b). Nevertheless, in addition to predicted r-squared on the left-out data, we have now used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to compare models. Results are in line with our cross-validation approach. This is not surprising given the previous literature showing that the cross-validation approach leads to similar results as the AIC approach (Fang 2011, Kay et al. 2013b). The normalization model had a smaller AIC value than both the weighted sum and the weighted average models in all ROIs.</p><p>We have included the AIC comparison results between normalization and the two other models in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 232-236:</p><p>“On closer inspection, the normalization model was a better fit to the data than both the weighted sum ( ps &lt; 0.019, corrected), and the weighted average model (ps &lt; 5.7⨯10<sup>-5</sup>, corrected) models in all ROIs. Since the normalization model had more parameters, we also used the AIC measure to correct for the difference in the number of parameters.

How are they determined?</p></disp-quote><p>The normalization model is different in nature from the two linear models and takes into account the suppression caused by the neighboring pool of neurons, even in the presence of a single stimulus. We cannot, therefore, use the measured response in isolated conditions as the excitatory drive in paired conditions. Rather, we need extra parameters to estimate the excitation caused by each stimulus and then use this excitation to predict the response to attended and ignored stimuli in isolated and paired conditions (Ni et al. 2012, Ni and Maunsell 2017, Ni and Maunsell 2019). On the other hand, the weighted sum and the weighted average models are not concerned with the underlying excitation and suppression. The assumption of these models is based on the resulting response that we actually measure in the paired condition, considering it to be respectively the sum or the average of the measured response in the isolated conditions. In order to take the difference in the number of model parameters into account, we have used cross-validated r-squared and AIC measures. We also tested a model with five parameters (response to point 1 of the <italic>Model</italic> section of this letter) which was a worse fit than normalization. Moreover, our simulation results (explained in point 1 as well) also showed that a model with a higher number of parameters is not a better fit when the underlying neural computation is different from the model’s computation. Given the robustness of the agreement in the results of these analyses, we do not believe the number of parameters can explain the superiority of the normalization model.</p><p>We have added an explanation of the need for Lp and LN parameters in the <italic>Methods</italic> section in lines 620-631:</p><p>“It is noteworthy that the normalization model is different in nature from the two linear models and takes into account the suppression caused by the neighboring pool even in the presence of a single stimulus.

In our experiment, we set contrast values to one when a stimulus was presented and to zero when the stimulus was not presented.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The weighted average model is confusing. Equation 5a is a strict average model. The weighted average model (Desimone and Duncan) however proposes that the response to combined stimuli is a weighted average of the response to the individual stimuli (i.e., with possibly different weights for each stimulus). Second, attention biases these weight values by possibly different amounts for different stimuli/in different brain regions. In this study, the response to the combined stimuli is modeled as a strict average (with a fixed weight of 0.5), and further, one fixed weight (β) is assigned to P and N for attention effects. However, in the weighted average model, the effect of attention could potentially be different for the preferred and null stimuli (i.e., a different β for P and another β for N), which might generate a better fit for the weighted average model. Indeed, although it is difficult to read off the graph, attention appears to enhance the response to the N stimuli more than to the P stimuli. How might the results be affected if the weights in the PN condition are not fixed to 0.5, and if attention is allowed to differently affect the two types of stimuli? A similar argument could also be made for the weighted sum model.</p></disp-quote><p>As you correctly specified, the weighted average model we used is a strict average model, weighted by the attentional bias.

It has been previously suggested (by Leila Reddy, 2009) that the response to multiple stimuli lies somewhere between the predictions of these two models, closer to the weighted average. Moreover, Heuer and Britten (2002) and Rubin et al. (2015) have shown that for weak stimuli and in low contrasts, the response to multiple stimuli approaches linearity and can even become supralinear. Since our stimuli were not in full contrast, we had to check for the weighted sum model as well.</p><p>In fact, based on our results, the weighted sum model performs better than the weighted average model in V1, and not significantly different from the weighted average model in pFs and PPA. Therefore, for the stimuli we used, the weighted sum model is comparable to the weighted average model in some cases.</p><p>We have added this point in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 199-206:</p><p>“Although many studies have demonstrated that responses to multiple stimuli are added sublinearly in the visual cortex (Heeger 1992, Reddy et al. 2009, Bloem and Ling 2019, Aqil et al. 2021), it has been suggested that for weak stimuli, response summation can approach a linear or even a supralinear regime (Heuer and Britten 2002, Rubin et al. 2015).</p><p>Since the stimuli we used in this experiment were presented in a semi-transparent form and were therefore not in full contrast, we found it probable that the response might be closer to a linear summation regime in some cases. We therefore used the weighted sum model to examine whether the response approaches linear summation in any region.”</p><p>We agree that we need to discuss weighted sum in the discussion as well. We have included why it was necessary to check the weighted sum model in the <italic>Discussion section</italic> in lines 416-430:</p><p>“Stimulus contrast has also been shown to have a crucial role in how single-stimulus responses are added to obtain the multiple-stimulus response. While responses to strong high-contrast stimuli are added sublinearly to yield the multiple-stimulus response, as predicted by the normalization model and the weighted average model, the sublinearity decreases for lower contrasts and even changes to linearity and supralinearity for weak stimuli (Heuer and Britten 2002, Rubin et al. 2015). Here, since the stimuli we used were not in full contrast, we tested the weighted sum model as well to examine whether responses approach linearity in any region. Our results demonstrate that while the weighted average model generally performs better than the weighted sum model in the higher-level occipito-temporal cortex, the weighted sum model provides better predictions in V1. These results suggest stronger sublinearity in higher regions of the visual cortex compared to V1, which is in agreement with previous reports (Kay et al. 2013b). This observation might be related to the higher sensitivity of V1 neurons to contrast (Goodyear and Menon, 1998), causing a more significant decrease in V1 responses to low-contrast stimuli. This, in turn, might make the low-contrast stimulus weaker for V1 neurons, causing a move towards a lower level of sublinearity (Sceniak et al. 1999).”</p><p>Regarding comparisons with other models beyond normalization, we have included a linear model with no constraint on the sum of weights, as the generalization of the weighted sum and the weighted average models, with its nonlinear variant with an extra saturation parameter (as explained in response to the previous point).

We imagine that almost all voxels in EBA significantly preferred bodies, and almost all voxels in PPA preferred houses. If so, how is this accounted for? Was there a reliable, statistically significant difference in house or body preference for voxels in the other ROIs, or is the difference between response activation to the two categories marginal?

A lot of interesting data that could be shown is reduced to line plots -this comes across as the paper starting at the end, rather than providing any sense of buildup in the data analysis and the conclusions that the authors draw.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added a new figure including the average voxel responses in each condition for each ROI and the percentage of voxels in each region that are more responsive to houses and bodies (panel f in figure 2, also pasted in response to comment 9 of the <italic>Theoretical framework and interpretation</italic> section of this letter). We think the addition of this figure helped with the clarification of the later analyses and flow of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors show the goodness of fit across the 5 modeled conditions in 2C – fine, but what is the justification for lumping all the conditions together? Is there a supplement figure that teases this apart, with the goodness of fit for each model for each of the conditions, for each ROI? It would help to be comprehensive.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the method was not clear. We defined the goodness of fit across conditions for each voxel separately (and not across voxels within each condition). Therefore it is not possible to show the goodness of fit for each condition. The reason for calculating the goodness of fit in this manner was to evaluate model fits based on their ability to predict response changes with the addition of a second stimulus and with the shifts of attention. Since correlation is blind to a systematic error in prediction for all voxels in a condition, calculating the goodness of fit across voxels would lead to misinterpretation. See figure 3—figure supplement 1 for an example figure showing how we got the goodness of fit in one voxel across all conditions.</p><p>The details of r-squared calculation were provided before in the <italic>Results</italic> and <italic>Methods</italic> sections. We have now included a reference to this figure in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 220-222:</p><p>“We calculated the goodness of fit for each voxel by taking the square of the correlation coefficient between the predicted model response and the respective fMRI responses across the five modeled conditions (figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>and in the <italic>Methods</italic> section in lines 669-671:</p><p>“The goodness of fit was calculated by taking the square of the correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted responses for each voxel across the five modeled conditions (figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Averaging all the data together (e.g., in Figure 2c across all conditions) does not provide a clear picture of the results. Is it possible that it is only in the attention conditions that the normalization model outperforms the others (although again, note the remark about the different numbers of free parameters in each model)? It would be more transparent to plot Figure 2c separately for the isolated/paired conditions, even though the story might become more complex.</p></disp-quote><p>As we pointed out in our response to the previous comment, the goodness of fit was calculated across the five conditions (as illustrated in (figure 3—figure supplement 1)). Since there is only one condition with unattended stimuli, it is not possible to calculate the goodness of fit across one condition only. Please note that we have provided the prediction of each condition separately in figure 3a-e. However, we have compared the results of the PN condition with model predictions and have added the statistics of this comparison in the <italic>Results section</italic> in lines 247-257:</p><p>“Interestingly, just focusing on the paired condition in which none of the stimuli were attended (the PN condition), the results of the weighted average model were closer to the normalization model (the gray and orange isolated data points on the subplots a-e of figure3 are similarly close to the navy point of data in some regions). For this condition, the predictions of the normalization model were significantly closer to the data compared to the predictions of the weighted average model in V1, pFs, and PPA (ps &lt; 0.028, corrected) but not significantly closer to the data in LO and EBA (ps &gt; 0.09, corrected). These results are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that the weighted average model provides good predictions of neural and voxel responses in the absence of attention (Zoccolan et al. 2005, Macevoy and Epstein 2009, Kliger and Yovel 2020). However, when considering all the attended and unattended conditions, our results show that the normalization model is a generally better fit across all ROIs.”</p><p>Regarding your point about the different number of parameters in the models, as explained in points 1, 2, and 4 of the <italic>Model</italic> section of this letter, we have used new models with more free parameters, AIC calculation, and simulations to show that the difference in the number of parameters cannot account for the observed success of the normalization model compared to other models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Related to the above points, the data are provided in a very synthesized manner, and raw results are not shown.
