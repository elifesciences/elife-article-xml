Plexin signaling depends on their cytoplasmic GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain, which specifically inactivates the Ras homolog Rap through an ill-defined non-canonical catalytic mechanism. The plexin GAP is activated by semaphorin-induced dimerization, the structural basis for which remained unknown. Here we present the crystal structures of the active dimer of zebrafish PlexinC1 cytoplasmic region in the apo state and in complex with Rap. The structures show that the dimerization induces a large-scale conformational change in plexin, which opens the GAP active site to allow Rap binding. Plexin stabilizes the switch II region of Rap in an unprecedented conformation, bringing Gln63 in Rap into the active site for catalyzing GTP hydrolysis. The structures also explain the unique Rap-specificity of plexins. Mutational analyses support that these mechanisms underlie plexin activation and signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01279.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01279.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01279.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A key question in neurobiology is how the brain becomes wired up. How do axons—the ‘wires’ along which neural signals flow—know in which direction to grow to reach their intended targets? A family of signalling proteins called semaphorins contribute to this process by acting as stop signals for axons that are heading in the wrong direction. The actions of semaphorins are mediated by receptors known as plexins, which are found on the membranes of axons.</p><p>Plexins contain an extracellular domain that binds semaphorin, and a large domain inside the cell that can turn semaphorin binding into cellular responses. When a semaphorin protein binds to the extracellular domain of a plexin receptor, the domain inside the cell joins with the intracellular domain of a neighbouring receptor to form a dimer. This activates the intracellular domain, which turns on its ability to inactivate a molecule called Rap. The end result is that the axon stops growing and changes direction, but the molecular mechanisms through which these events occur are not well understood.</p><p>Now, Wang, Pascoe et al. have worked out the structure of the dimers formed by the intracellular plexin domains, both alone and in complex with Rap. The structures reveal how the dimer drives a shape change of the intracellular domain to enable it to bind Rap, and show that Rap itself adopts a novel conformation upon binding to plexin. This conformational change in Rap catalyses the breakdown of a signalling molecule called GTP, which inactivates Rap and triggers an intracellular signalling cascade that causes the axon to collapse and change direction.</p><p>Lastly, Wang, Pascoe et al. have shown that the highly specific nature of these interactions depends on particular amino-acid residues in both Rap and the plexin receptor. Further work is now required to determine whether this pattern of activation represents a general mechanism for signalling by plexin receptors, and for the inhibition of Rap.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01279.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01279.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>plexin</kwd><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>Rap</kwd><kwd>GAP</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>dimerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yuxiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Pascoe</surname><given-names>Heath G</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Huawei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xuewu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Welch foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yuxiao</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Huawei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xuewu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM008203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pascoe</surname><given-names>Heath G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crystal structures of the intracellular part of the plexin receptor in the active dimer form, and its complex with a key downstream signalling protein Rap, provide insights into how plexin initiates a signalling cascade involved in axon guidance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plexins are a large group of type I transmembrane proteins that serve as the major receptors for semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yazdani and Terman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tran et al., 2007</xref>). Plexin-mediated semaphorin signaling controls neuronal axon guidance as well other essential processes such as angiogenesis and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takamatsu and Kumanogoh, 2012</xref>). Aberrant plexin/semaphorin signaling has been implicated in numerous pathologies including neurological disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yaron and Zheng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tamagnone, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</xref>). Plexins all possess a large multi-domain extracellular region, a single transmembrane helix and a multi-domain cytoplasmic region. Binding of semaphorin to the extracellular region of plexin triggers activation of the cytoplasmic region, which relays the signal to downstream pathways.</p><p>The plexin cytoplasmic region contains a juxtamembrane segment, a RhoGTPase binding domain (RBD) and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rohm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2011</xref>). The juxtamembrane segment has been suggested to regulate plexin signaling by interacting with the GAP domain or mediating oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2011</xref>). Binding of RhoGTPases such as Rac1 and RND1 to the RBD facilitates plexin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vikis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driessens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zanata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tong et al., 2007</xref>), the mechanism of which is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The GAP domain in plexin shows structural homology to RasGAPs such as p120GAP, and contains a functionally essential arginine residue corresponding to the catalytic ‘arginine finger’ in RasGAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rohm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oinuma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2009</xref>). Plexins have been reported previously to be GAPs for the Ras homologs R-Ras and M-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oinuma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). Our recent study, however, has demonstrated that the plexin GAP does not act directly on R-Ras or M-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Instead it is active specifically to the Ras homolog Rap, and this RapGAP activity is critical for plexin signaling. GTP-bound active Rap is a key activator of integrin for promoting cell–matrix adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gloerich and Bos, 2011</xref>). Conversion of Rap into the GDP-bound inactive form by the plexin GAP likely contributes to plexin-mediated repulsive axon guidance and other cell morphological changes through causing inactivation of integrin and weakening cell–matrix adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>RasGAPs such as p120GAP and neurofibromin facilitate GTP hydrolysis of Ras, R-Ras and M-Ras by providing the conserved arginine finger to stabilize the leaving γ-phosphate group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scheffzek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scheffzek et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quilliam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohba et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos et al., 2007</xref>). Concomitantly, a conserved glutamine in the GTPases (Gln61 in Ras) coordinates the nucleophilic water for hydrolysis. Many other GAP/small GTPase pairs use similar mechanisms to catalyze GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos et al., 2007</xref>). Rap is distinct from Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras in that it has a threonine at position 61, which lacks the ability to coordinate the catalytic water. Canonical RapGAPs are structurally unrelated to RasGAPs and catalyze Rap GTP hydrolysis by providing an asparagine residue (referred to as the ‘Asn thumb’) to fulfill the water coordination role of Gln61 in Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scrima et al., 2008</xref>). SynGAP (Synaptic GAP), and three GAP1 family members Rasal (Ras-GTPase-activating-like protein), CAPRI (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-promoted Ras inactivator) and GAP1<sup>IP4BP</sup> (tetrakisphosphate binding protein) are dual-specificity GAPs, active to both Ras and Rap. Plexins and these dual-specificity GAPs share the RasGAP fold that contains the arginine finger but lack a conserved Asn thumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kupzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pena et al., 2008</xref>). They facilitate GTP hydrolysis for Rap through a distinct, poorly understood mechanism. A recent study has suggested that Gln63 in Rap plays a role analogous to Gln61 in Ras in the non-canonical catalysis of the dual-specificity GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sot et al., 2010</xref>). Mutating Gln63 in Rap abolishes GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by both the dual-specificity GAPs and plexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sot et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Plexin signaling is critically dependent on the on/off switch of the RapGAP activity under the control of semaphorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Our previous structural analyses have suggested that the plexin GAP is autoinhibited by adopting a closed conformation that sequesters the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2009</xref>). A pre-formed inhibitory dimer of plexin may also be involved in suppressing the GAP activity prior to semaphorin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antipenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nogi et al., 2010</xref>). Semaphorins are dimeric molecules and have been suggested to induce dimerization or oligomerization of plexin for triggering downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klostermann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koppel and Raper, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driessens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perrot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antipenko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Love et al., 2003</xref>). A model of plexin activation involving oligomerization mediated by the RBD/RhoGTPase interaction has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2011</xref>), but existence of this oligomeric structure in solution or on the cell surface has not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siebold and Jones, 2013</xref>). Recent structural studies have demonstrated how dimeric semaphorin brings two copies of the plexin extracellular region into proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janssen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nogi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssen et al., 2012</xref>). We have shown that the purified plexin cytoplasmic region displays low RapGAP activity, which can be activated dramatically by fusing it to the coiled-coil dimerization motif of GCN4 (general control non-repressed 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). These observations collectively support that semaphorin-induced formation of an active dimer of plexin is the major mechanism for activation of the GAP domain and intracellular signaling.</p><p>In this study we sought to understand how the plexin RapGAP is activated by induced-dimerization and facilitates GTP hydrolysis specifically for Rap. We systematically screened various coiled-coil dimer fusions of the plexin cytoplasmic region for optimal activation of the GAP. These experiments led to crystallization and structure determination of the active dimer of zebrafish PlexinC1. In addition, we employed a novel protein ligation system to covalently link the plexin cytoplasmic region and Rap, which stabilized their weak interaction and allowed us to crystallize and determine the structure of a PlexinC1/Rap complex. The structures and the associated mutational analyses together reveal the basis for the dimerization-induced activation, the non-canonical catalysis and the unique specificity of plexin for Rap.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening and crystallization of the coiled-coil-induced active dimer of plexin<sub>cyto</sub></title><p>Our previous study has shown that the RapGAP activity of the cytoplasmic region of plexins (plexins<sub>cyto</sub>) can be activated by fusing it to the coiled-coil motif of GCN4 through a flexible linker of various lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Our extensive crystallization trials of these coiled-coil induced dimers of plexins<sub>cyto</sub> all failed, presumably due to the flexibility of the linker. We therefore removed the linker and directly fused the coiled-coil with the juxtamembrane helix (the N-terminal helix in the juxtamembrane segment) of plexin<sub>cyto</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Assuming the coiled-coil motif and the juxtamembrane helix of plexin merge into a continuous helix, varying the relative register between them by adding or removing residues at the junction can result in dramatically different relative orientations between the two plexin monomers in the dimer. Without knowing the ideal arrangement of the two monomers for active dimer formation, we systematically tested fusing plexin<sub>cyto</sub> to each of the seven unique positions on the heptad repeat of the coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Therefore, a major mechanism in the dimerization-induced activation of plexin appears to be the outward shift of the activation segment, which opens the otherwise obstructed active site to allow Rap binding and catalysis of GTP hydrolysis. While this conformational change in the plexin GAP domain seems small, it is known that interactions between small GTPases and their regulators or effectors can be strongly influenced by subtle changes at the binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nassar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Snyder et al., 2002</xref>).

Both of these mutations likely prevent formation of the active dimer of plexins, consistent with the tumor suppressor function of plexins suggested by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Overall binding mode between zebrafish PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> and human Rap1B</title><p>The species mismatch of the plexin/Rap complex does not affect their interaction, since the human Rap1B construct contains only three residues non-identical to their counterparts in zebrafish Rap1B, which are all located far from the plexin/Rap interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle panel). The linker between PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> and Rap1B is not visible in the electron density map, suggesting that it is flexible as designed and does not impose restraints on the plexin/Rap interaction. A superimposition of Rap and Ras in the PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub>/Rap and p120GAP/Ras complexes shows that the overall binding modes of the two with their respective GAPs are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, left panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scheffzek et al., 1997</xref>). The GAP domain in PlexinC1 and Switches I (residues 30–38) and II (residues 59–67) in Rap constitute the majority of the binding interface, whereas the RBD in plexin is not involved and its role in GAP regulation remains unclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The core of the interface is composed of several hydrophobic residues, which are surrounded by numerous charge–charge interactions at the periphery. Most of the Rap-binding residues are conserved among the plexin family members, suggesting that they all interact with Rap in the same mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). The presumed arginine finger (Arg711) in PlexinC1 superimposes well with the arginine finger (Arg789) in p120GAP, playing the same role in catalysis by interacting with the AlF<sub>x</sub> and GDP in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). While the bound AlF<sub>x</sub> is not clearly resolved in the relatively low-resolution map, the shape of the density suggests that it is the trigonal AlF<sub>3</sub>, the same as in the p120GAP/Ras structure. We therefore modeled it AlF<sub>3</sub> in the structure. The second conserved arginine (Arg1001) in PlexinC1 is equivalent to Arg903 in p120GAP, which stabilizes the position of the arginine finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

The results shown here and in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) together demonstrate that while sharing the same domain fold with RasGAPs and dual-specificity GAPs, plexins are a unique group that are active to Rap, but not to Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras. Our analysis of the plexin/Rap complex structure reveals residues in both plexin and Rap that contribute to this specificity. P120GAP has been shown to bind GTP-bound Rap strongly but fail to catalyze its GTP hydrolysis, making Rap an effective inhibitor of the GAP activity of p120GAP to Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frech et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hata et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yatani et al., 1991</xref>). The apparent GAP activity of plexins towards R-Ras and M-Ras reported previously may be caused indirectly by inactivation of Rap and alleviation of its inhibition on p120GAP. The induced Gln63-in conformation of Rap seen in the PlexinC1/Rap complex structure likely represents the general mechanism by which plexins and the dual-specificity GAPs facilitate GTP hydrolysis for Rap. This conformation is stabilized by specific interactions made by several conserved residues in plexin. The dual-specificity GAPs achieve this through different mechanisms that likely involve the extra domains, the precise basis for which awaits structural studies of these GAPs in complex with Rap.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein expression</title><p>The human Rap1B construct (residues 2–167) in a modified pET28 vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) that encodes a N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag and a recognition site for the human rhinovirus C3 protease has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).

An N-terminal glycine on the Rap1B protein would hinder the sortase-mediated ligation with Plexin (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Popp et al., 2009</xref>). To avoid this problem, the vector was mutated to replace the glycine residue with an aspartate using a Quickchange reaction (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The Rap1B proteins were expressed in the bacteria strain BL21 (DE3) and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The coding region for the zebrafish PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> (residues 552–1153) with a N-terminal di-glycine tag was synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) based on the gene bank entry XM_685667.4. The region encoding residues 552–1147 was subcloned into another modified pET28 vector containing a N-terminal tandem His<sub>6</sub>–SUMO tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The GCN4 coiled-coil motif was fused to the N-terminus of the PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> (residues 553–1153) without the di-glycine motif by PCR. The fusion was subcloned into the same modified pET28 vector. Quikchange (Stratagene) was used to alter the residues at the junction between the coiled-coil and PlexinC1. The coiled-coil fusion constructs of mouse PlexinA1<sub>cyto</sub> were cloned by using similar procedures. The protein was expressed in the bacteria strain ArcticExpress (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-tag was removed by treatment with the SUMO-specific protease Ulp1. For the construct containing the di-glycine encoding sequence, the Ulp1 treatment yielded the PlexinC1 protein with a N-terminal GG-tag. All mutants of Rap and plexins were generated by Quickchange reactions (Stratagene), and expressed and purified as the respective wild-type proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sortase-mediated ligation</title><p>Ligation of the N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>/C-terminal LPETGG-tagged Rap1B and the N-terminal GG-tagged PlexinC1 was catalyzed by the transpeptidase activity of sortase from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (plasmid provide by Dr Hidde Ploegh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Popp et al., 2009</xref>). Sortase with a N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag was expressed and purified by using Ni-NTA chromatography. Sortase first cleaves the peptide bond between the threonine and first glycine within the LPETGG motif in Rap1B. In the second step, the GG-tagged PlexinC1 is added to the threonine to regenerate a native peptide bond between the two proteins. The reaction mix contained Rap1B, PlexinC1 and sortase at 450, 69 and 25 μM respectively. Reactions were performed at room temperature for 3 hr with simultaneous dialysis to remove the di-glycine by-product. The dialysis buffer contained 20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The ligated PlexinC1/Rap1B complex was purified by Ni-NTA, ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic steps. The N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag was removed by treatment with the human rhinovirus C3 protease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>In vitro GAP assays</title><p>The GAP assay was performed by coupling release of inorganic phosphate during GTP hydrolysis to the purine nucleoside phosphorylase-catalyzed conversion of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside to ribose-1-phosphate, which can be monitored photometrically at the wavelength of 360 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Webb and Hunter, 1992</xref>). For analyzing various structure-based mutations of CC(a)PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub>, the single turnover GAP assay was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The concentration of plexin in the assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> was 0.25 µM. In the assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, the concentration of plexin was 2 µM. The concentration of Rap1B(GTP) was 120 µM. In the assays for analyzing various mutants of the PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> monomer and Rap1B, the concentrations of PlexinC1 and Rap1B(GTP) were 5 μM and 60 μM respectively.</p><p>For determining the activation levels of the CC(x)Plexins<sub>cyto</sub> constructs, the initial reaction rate V<sub>0</sub> was measured at different Rap(GTP) concentrations ([S]) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Fitting the data to the Michaelis–Menten equation (V<sub>0</sub> = (V<sub>max</sub>[S])/(K<sub>M</sub> + [S])) suggested that the Rap(GTP) concentrations used (25–150 µM) were far below K<sub>M</sub> (&gt;1 mM). For plexin constructs exhibiting low GAP activity, V<sub>0</sub> was determined by linear fitting of the initial period of the reaction (5–8 min) when less then 10% of Rap(GTP) had been hydrolyzed. After subtraction of the baseline rate from reaction without plexin, the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> value of each construct was estimated by fitting the data to the equation V<sub>0</sub> = (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) [E][S] (when [S] &lt;&lt; K<sub>M</sub>), where [E] is the total plexin concentration. For plexin constructs with high GAP activity, single turn-over reaction curves measured at different Rap(GTP) concentrations were baseline-subtracted and simultaneously fitted to the single exponential equation: A(t) = (A<sub>max</sub> − A<sub>min</sub>) (1 − exp (−kt)) + A<sub>min</sub>, where k = (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>)[E]. In the fitting, k was treated as a global parameter.

To measure the GAP activity for these complexes, we used the multiple-turnover assay, in which (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 10 mM and EDTA at 1 mM are added to promote constant exchange of GTP/GDP for Rap in the complex, allowing continuous GTP hydrolysis provided sufficient GTP is present in the assay solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Webb and Hunter, 1992</xref>). As the ligated complex with the 24-residue linker and the LPETGG motif crystallized and was used for structure determination, the same construct was chosen for extensive activity analyses at various concentrations.

Samples at 0.5, 4, and 20 μM were used for the experiments without AlF<sub>x</sub>. Samples at 0.5, 4, 8 and 20 μM were used for the experiments in the presence of 2 mM AlF<sub>x</sub>. All samples were equilibrated ∼14 hr at 4°C, then ∼400 μl of the samples were loaded into the ‘sample’ sides of dual-sectored charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces that were sandwiched between sapphire windows in a cell housing; the ‘reference’ sectors were filled with the same volume of Centrifugation Buffer. Filled cells were placed in an An50Ti rotor and equilibrated for 2.5 hr under vacuum in the centrifuge at 20°C prior to centrifugation. Experiments were conducted using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at 42,000 rpm at 20°C. Absorbance data at 280 nm were collected using the Beckman control software until all components had fully sedimented. Protein partial-specific volume, solvent viscosity, and density values were calculated using the program Sednterp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laue et al., 1992</xref>).

The data collection and processing were performed in a similar manner as described for the CC(a)PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> crystal, expect that the ‘autocorrections’ option was not used. The diffract pattern extended to 3.3 Å and was consistent with the symmetry of the P1 space group. One protomer from the CC(a)PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> structure was used as the molecular replacement search model for plexin.

In the PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub>/Rap1B structure, the linker between the C-terminus of Rap1B and the N-terminus of PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> is not included in the final model due to lack of discernable electron density. Assuming the complexes in the crystal are formed by the covalently linked pairs of Rap1B and PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub>, the linker and the disordered flanking residues from the two proteins (a total of ∼32 residues) are sufficient for spanning the ∼45 Å distance between the two ends without imposing restraints on the plexin/Rap binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle panel). The structural superimpositions shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref> were based on helices 13, 14 and 15 in the plexin GAP domain, because they are at the center of the GAP active site and adopt highly similar conformations in all the plexin structures.

Your articles have been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Axel Brunger, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The crystal structures (PlexinC1/Rap/ADP AlFx complex and coiled-coil induced homo-dimer of PlexinC1) presented in two manuscripts reveal a new dimerization-dependent mechanism of the GAP activity of PlexinC1.</p><p>The structure with Rap1B bound to the plexinC1 cytoplasmic domain in complex with ADP AlFx revealed that plexin induces a conformational change in the Switch II region of Rap, bringing Glu63 into the active site to catalyze GTP hydrolysis. There is some concern about the medium resolution of this structure, but the interactions found were validated by mutagenesis studies of GAP activity.</p><p>Rap1B binding induced a symmetric dimer of plexinC1. The plexinC1 cytoplasmic domain, when dimerized by fusion with an N-terminal coiled-coil domain to mimic ligand binding, formed a nearly identical symmetrical back-to-back dimer.</p><p>Overall, the formation of the plexinC1 dimer led to a major movement of the juxtamembrane segment compared to the known monomeric plexinC1 form, along with an outward shift of the loop-helix segment in the GAP domain. It is this induced conformation that allows Rap binding and GTP hydrolysis. Mutational analysis of key residues in the dimer interface supports the authors’ conclusion that this mode of dimerization leads to an increase in Rap GAP activity. Taken together, these new structures, along with the associated biochemical studies, reveal for the first time how plexin cytoplasmic domains signal in response to semaphorin binding, through dimerization-mediated conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain promoting Rap GTP binding and induced GTP hydrolysis.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>1) Both articles: there is consensus among all reviewers of these manuscripts that the two need to be combined into one manuscript, as the structure of the coiled-coil induced dimer of PlexinC1 appears to be very similar to that of PlexinC1 in the heterodimer with Rap. As it stands, there is too much redundancy between the two articles, and they both depend on each other to support the key conclusions. The merging of the two manuscripts into one will make the story much easier to read and understand.</p><p>2) Both articles: both structures used insightful methods to accomplish crystallization – fusion to a coiled coil protein and ligation between two proteins, respectively. The authors have done some controls, such as a GAP activity assays and confirming that the observed interactions are supported by mutagenesis studies. Also, the similarity of the PlexinC1 dimer in both structures is reassuring. However, it would be interesting to examine the structures themselves to see if the coiled-coil domain may have affected or “strained” the dimer structure somehow. Also, the authors might comment on any general lessons they learned in using the fusion and ligation approaches (also considering that the linker spanned ∼45 Å), respectively, that might be useful for other systems as well.</p><p>3) Complex article: is it definitively AlF3 rather than another coordination species?</p><p>4) Both articles: how is GTP hydrolysis in the GAP assay exactly measured?</p><p>5) <italic>eLife</italic> discourages the use of supplemental figures and tables unless the supplemental material consists of raw data, or repetitions of information shown in main figures. Thus, all supplemental figures need to be fully merged with figures in the main body of the text. However, all reviewers noted a lot of redundancy among the various figure panels and too much unnecessary detail, so in combining the figures, the authors should work on the presentation of their structures in as few figures as possible. Moreover, sequence alignments could be omitted altogether as long as it is clearly stated how they were obtained, and not essential to the paper.</p><p>6) Dimer article: all supplemental figures should be moved to the main body of the paper as separate figures for better readability.</p><p>7) Both manuscripts: <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

Identical pairs of coiled-coil diagrams do not need to be shown 11 times. They can be shown once and the corresponding entry on the graph labeled “a”, “b”, etc. Numbers are missing on the x-axis.</p><p>11) Dimer article: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is overall quite clear but could be improved by labeling the juxtamembrane helix and 11/11' in (B), and the activation segment in both (B) and (C).</p><p>12) Dimer article: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the steric collisions shown in panel B are not that dramatic as shown. Perhaps the D38-N1774 collision would be clearer if those were shown in space-filling form. Overall, as depicted in this figure, the autoinhibition only barely obstructs the Rap binding site. This might be worth some additional discussion.</p><p>13) Complex article: with respect to the overall impact of the study, various permutations of Gln fingers, dual Arg and Gln fingers, and Asn thumbs have appeared in the small GTPase GAP literature over the past 11 years or so, and this work should be discussed and referenced.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01279.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Both articles: there is consensus among all reviewers of these manuscripts that the two need to be combined into one manuscript, as the structure of the coiled-coil induced dimer of PlexinC1 appears to be very similar to that of PlexinC1 in the heterodimer with Rap.

Indeed there is a small difference in the N-terminal portion of the juxtamembrane helix between the two structures, which is likely caused by a small “geometric incompatibility” between the coiled-coil and the plexin dimer. We have included a detailed discussion on this point in the paper. Regarding the lessons in using the fusion and ligation approaches, it is hard to come up with some general rules other than the notion that these approaches are useful for crystallizing protein dimers or complexes with weak affinities. We tested many linkers on a trial-and-error basis, most of which were long enough to bridge the distance between plexin and Rap. Yet, only the 24-residue linker construct led to crystallization.</p><p><italic>3) Complex article: is it definitively AlF3 rather than another coordination species</italic>?</p><p>While the relative low resolution prevents definitive identification of the form of AlFx, the density is most consistent with the trigonal AlF3. In addition, the highly similar geometry at the active site between our structure and the p120GAP/Ras complex also suggest it is AlF3. We have included this discussion in the paper.</p><p><italic>4) Both articles: How is GTP hydrolysis in the GAP assay exactly measured</italic>?</p><p>The GAP assay was performed by coupling release of inorganic phosphate during GTP hydrolysis to purine nucleoside phosphorylase-catalyzed conversion of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside to ribose-1-phosphate, which can be monitored photometrically at the wavelength of 360 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Webb and Hunter, 1992</xref>).

The P1 space group and the weak diffraction limited the completeness and redundancy of the data. All these contributed to the relatively poor data quality, which likely explains the relatively high R-free value. Regardless, the main conclusion from this structure is not affected because the binding interface between plexin and Rap is among the most well-ordered parts in the structure and show clear electron density (see the simulated annealing omit map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, right panel).</p><p><italic>9) Dimer article: the section on the lack of change in the conformation of the RBD and the distal part of the GAP domain could be contracted into a single sentence stating that there are no differences of interest</italic>.</p><p>This has been done as suggested.</p><p><italic>10) Dimer article: the labeling and legend of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>are more complicated than necessary.

This might be worth some additional discussion</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the clash caused by the autoinhibited state appears not very severe. As discussed in the paper, the disordered portion of the activation segment may also contribute to autoinhibition by sampling conformations that obstruct Rap binding, whereas in the dimer structure this segment is stabilized in the open conformation. These effects together may account for the activity difference between the active dimer and the monomer (which displays basal activity and is not completely inactive). In addition, interactions between small GTPases and their regulators seem to be rather sensitive to subtle changes at the interface. For example, a single Leu/Ile in Dbl-family RhoGEFs serves as the major specificity determinant for distinguishing Rac1 and Cdc42 (Snyder, Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology, 2002, 9, 468).
