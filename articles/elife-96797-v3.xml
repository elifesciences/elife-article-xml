a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture, originating either from root uptake or from catabolism of arginine by arginase. Despite its extensive use, the underlying physiological mechanisms of urea, particularly its adverse effects on seed germination and seedling growth under salt stress, remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that salt stress induces excessive hydrolysis of arginine-derived urea, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic pH within seed radical cells, which, in turn, triggers salt-induced inhibition of seed germination (SISG) and hampers seedling growth. Our findings challenge the long-held belief that ammonium accumulation and toxicity are the primary causes of SISG, offering a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying these processes.

Currently, to boost plant productivity, agricultural products primarily use synthetic chemical fertilizers, which, despite their benefits, have negative consequences on the environment and soil biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2022</xref>). Fertilizers, particularly those containing urea due to its high water solubility, play a crucial role in enhancing soil fertility. Urea, a key synthetic nitrogen source, constitutes about half of the nitrogen applied to crop production globally and is the most widely used nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat.fao.org">http://faostat.fao.org</ext-link>). However, the adverse effects of urea-based fertilizers on seed germination and seedling growth are still not reasonably explained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bremner and Krogmeier, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bremner and Krogmeier, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, a deeper understanding of urea’s hydrolysis, transport, and utilization within plants is imperative for devising informed strategies aimed at crop improvement.</p><p>Urea serves not only the primary nitrogen source that plants actively absorb from the soil solution but also an intermediate in plant arginine catabolism, which is involved in the nitrogen remobilization of nitrogen from source tissues. Arginase (ARGAH; arginine amidinohydrolase), the only enzyme in plants known to generate urea in vivo, plays a pivotal role in the mobilization of seed storage reserves during early seedling growth post-germination. The catabolism of arginine by arginase is crucial for mobilizing stored nitrogen upon germination and redistributing nitrogen from source tissues, as evidenced by various studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldraij and Polacco, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Todd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Todd and Gifford, 2002</xref>). Arginine, abundant in the storage proteins of most plant seeds, has the highest nitrogen-to-carbon ratio (N:C = 4:6) among all amino acids, making it a significant nitrogen source for seed reserve mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones and Boulter, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">King and Gifford, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Polacco et al., 2013</xref>). In a study of 379 angiosperm seeds, arginine accounted for 17% of the seed nitrogen content (8.58 g arginine/16 g seed N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Van Etten et al., 1967</xref>).</p><p>Beyond its hydrolysis by arginase to yield urea, arginine also serves as a substrate for nitric oxide (NO) and polyamine (PA) biosynthesis in plants by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siddappa and Marathe, 2020</xref>), respectively. Consequently, arginine becomes a shared substrate, competitively utilized by the three enzymes ARGAH, NOS, and ADC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Many recent studies suggested that the improved salt tolerance observed in arginase-deficient mutants is attributed to an indirect upregulation of NOS and ADC pathways, thereby enhancing NO and PA-mediated plant defense responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Flores et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi and Chan, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">She et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winter et al., 2015</xref>). However, this raises the question of how the presence of arginase activity still allows urea-deficient mutants to significantly alleviate salt-induced inhibition of seed germination (SISG) and bolster seedling growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Blocking arginine hydrolysis and promoting seed germination under salt stress.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A simple model of arginine metabolism in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.

By employing specific enzyme inhibitors and gene deletion mutants within the arginine two-step hydrolysis pathway, we found that hydrolysis of arginine-derived urea is the key point for effectively alleviating the adverse effects of salt on seed germination and seedling growth. This led us to the question: what mechanism underlies the triggering of SISG and stunted seedling growth by urea hydrolysis? We ruled out the potential accumulation of ammonium, resulting from urea hydrolysis, by incorporating exogenous ammonium into the salt stress medium. Interestingly, our findings on intracellular pH measurements indicate that the salt-induced hydrolysis of urea, yielding OH<sup>-</sup>, leads to an increase in intracellular pH of the radicle, pinpointing this as the primary factor initiating SISG and impeding seedling growth. This finding challenges our previous hypothesis, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2015</xref>, that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation resulting from urea hydrolysis under salt stress is the trigger for SISG. These new insights provide a novel perspective of mechanisms driving SISG and subsequent seedling development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Urea hydrolysis is the cause of SISG in the two-step arginine hydrolysis</title><p>Initially, to determine whether arginase-mediated arginine hydrolysis pathway is involved in SISG and seedling growth, we utilized two inhibitors specific to the two-step hydrolysis reaction of the arginine hydrolysis pathway: <italic>N</italic><sup>G</sup>-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-arginine (NOHA), an arginase inhibitor, and phenyl phosphorodiamidate (PPD), a urease inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We analyzed the seed germination phenotypes under these conditions. In the absence of NOHA, the NaCl treatment significantly hindered the seeds’ capacity to germinate, as evidenced by the radicle’s inability to break through the seed coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, the addition of 5 μM NOHA into NaCl medium significantly increased the germination rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In contrast, the presence or absence of NOHA in the control medium did not notably affect seed germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>To better observe the effect of NOHA on seed germination or early seedling growth, different concentrations of NOHA (0, 1.5, 2.5, and 5 µM) were added to the control or NaCl mediums (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The results showed that the inhibitory effect of salt on seed germination was significantly alleviated by the increasing NOHA concentrations, while NOHA added in control medium had no substantial effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Additionally, root length measurements taken 14 days after germination indicated that NOHA could promote root growth under salt stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To directly elucidate the impact of the arginase-mediated arginine hydrolysis pathway on SISG, and under the assumption that the competition for arginine substrate by multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is not affected at this stage, we investigated the effect of urea hydrolase inhibitor PPD, which acts on a downstream metabolite of arginine, on seed germination. This was then compared to the effects observed in the NOHA assay. The results showed that salt significantly inhibited the germination of wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds, with less than 10% germination. The addition of 15 µM of PPD increased the germination rate to 70%, compared with the rate without PPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), which showed the same trend as NOHA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). These results indicate that salt tolerance in WT seeds germination and seedling growth is manifested especially under NOHA and PPD conditions. The two-step hydrolysis pathway of arginine mediated by arginase and its downstream metabolite urea hydrolase is not only involved in SISG events, but also urea hydrolysis may be the leading cause of SISG occurrence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genetic evidence for SISG triggered by the arginine hydrolysis pathway</title><p>To clarify the genetic basis of arginase inhibitor experiments described above, the following studies were conducted. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has two genes encoding ARGAH, namely ARGAH1 (gene number: AT4G08900) and ARGAH2 (gene number: AT4G08870). <italic>AtArgAH1</italic> has a T-DNA insertion within its first exon, while <italic>AtArgAH2</italic> contains a T-DNA insertion in the fourth exon. Consequently, the mutants resulting from these insertions were denoted as <italic>argah1</italic> and <italic>argah2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Additionally, <italic>AtArgAH1</italic> and <italic>AtArgAH2</italic> double knockout mutants (<italic>argah1/argah2</italic>) were generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/of CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein 9 system. Targeted modifications were introduced into the third exon of the <italic>AtArgAH1</italic> gene and the second exon of the <italic>AtArgAH2</italic> gene. In total, four hygromycin-resistant lines were obtained from the T<sub>0</sub> transgenic lines. Subsequent to CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and sequencing, one line of the <italic>argah1/argah2</italic> double mutant exhibited a 1 bp insertions in the coding region of the <italic>AtArgAH1</italic> gene, and another 1 bp insertions in the coding region of the <italic>AtArgAH2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus, for subsequent genetic phenotypic analyses, <italic>argah1/argah2</italic> double mutants were utilized alongside wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (WT). Seed germination and initial growth after germination of all mutants (<italic>argah1, argah2</italic>, and <italic>argah1/argah2</italic>) were not significantly different from those of WT in the control medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In contrast, adding NaCl to the control medium severely inhibited seed germination and radicle development of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The seed germination rates of each mutant (<italic>argah1, argah2</italic>, and <italic>argah1/argah2</italic>) were significantly higher than those of WT under NaCl conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Furthermore, the root length of the mutant under salt stress was significantly higher than that of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Moreover, arginase activity analysis revealed significantly lower levels in <italic>argah1, argah2</italic>, and <italic>argah1/argah2</italic> mutants following NaCl treatment compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These findings indicate that partial or complete blocking of the arginine hydrolysis pathway can effectively alleviate SISG. We have previously reported that deletion mutants of the urea hydrolase gene (<italic>urease</italic>) enhance salt tolerance during seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2015</xref>). That implies that even the accumulation of urea in vivo, derived from the hydrolysis of arginine by arginase, is insufficient to trigger SISG.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Deletion of arginase hydrolytic pathway alleviates the inhibition of seed germination by salt.</title><p>WT, <italic>argah1</italic>, <italic>argah2,</italic> and <italic>argah1/argah2</italic> mutant seeds germinated, and seedling growth was observed on ½ MS medium under two conditions: 0 mM NaCl (control) (<bold>a</bold>) and 135 mM NaCl (<bold>b</bold>).

Therefore, SOS3-deficient mutant (<italic>sos3</italic>) accumulate substantial Na<sup>+</sup> levels and are highly sensitive to salt stress. In order to further clarify the importance of urea hydrolysis in SISG, <italic>sos3</italic> mutants were considered as standard materials for SISG analysis, along with <italic>aturease/sos3</italic> double mutant. Initially, we introduced PPD to 50 mM NaCl medium to observe the growth of <italic>sos3</italic>. Notably, with increasing the concentrations of PPD, the growth inhibition of <italic>sos3</italic> induced by NaCl was alleviated significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Furthermore, both seed germination rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and 14-day root length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) were significantly increased compared to those without PPD treatment.

It is noteworthy that urea in plants is mainly produced by the hydrolysis of arginine. During the mobilization of seed nitrogen stores, urea produced in the cotyledon is transported to the root by urea transporters. This raises the question: does blocking the transport of free urea generated by the arginine hydrolysis pathway also alleviate SISG? Moreover, urea transport might be involved in long-distance movement of urea from the cotyledon to the radicle, thereby affecting SISG. Exploring urea transport is essential to understand the SISG events caused by the arginine hydrolysis pathway during the mobilization of seed storage nitrogen at the tissue and organ level. To address these questions, here, we identified a loss-of-function mutant, <italic>atdur3</italic>, which lacks the urea transporter gene AtDur3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The <italic>atdur3</italic> mutant line exhibited impaired growth on a medium containing urea as the sole nitrogen source (&lt;5 mM) (data not shown). When <italic>atdur3</italic> and WT were germinated on control mediums, there was no significant difference in their seed germination ability and root development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–c</xref>). On the control medium supplemented with NaCl, the germination ability of WT seeds was significantly inhibited (the ability of radicle to break through the seed coat), and the germination rate of <italic>atdur3</italic> mutant seeds was significantly higher than that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>). These results suggest that blocking urea transport in vivo could effectively alleviate SISG. We hypothesized that blocking the transport of urea from arginine hydrolysis in the cotyledon to the root and blocking its hydrolysis in the root would promote the germination of seeds under salt stress. Therefore, we subsequently analyzed urea concentrations in the roots and cotyledon of <italic>atdur3</italic> under salt stress. Under nonstressed normal conditions (control), root urea concentrations were lower in <italic>atdur3</italic> plants than in WT plants, but urea levels in cotyledons had no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). However, when plants were grown under NaCl stress, the urea levels were lower in <italic>atdur3</italic> roots than in WT roots. Still, urea levels were higher in <italic>atdur3</italic> cotyledons than in WT cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). We further analyzed the change ratio of urea (cotyledon/root), and the results show that urea was mainly accumulated in <italic>atdur3</italic> cotyledons under control or NaCl conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>).

Failure of seeds to germinate stands as a significant contributor to crop loss, particularly under salt stress conditions, which not only delays germination but also reduces the overall percent of successful germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kojima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazachkova et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, developing effective strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of salinity on seed germination and seedling establishment is imperative. Here we focused on the effect of seed reserve nitrogen mobilization on SISG. Arginase, a key enzyme in seed nitrogen storage mobilization, has garnered considerable attention in recent efforts aiming at understanding plant responses to abiotic stresses. Arginase-deficient mutants have been extensively utilized because of the competition among three enzymes, ARGAH, NOS, and ADC, for a common substrate, arginine. It has been proposed that blocking arginase activity indirectly enhances the NOS and ADC pathways, thereby increasing the plant defense response mediated by NO and PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">She et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Flores et al., 2008</xref>). For example, ARGAH knockout mutants exhibit increased tolerance to various abiotic stresses, including water deficit, salt, and freezing, while lines overexpressing AtARGAH show decreased tolerance to these stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shi et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Flores et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The enhanced tolerance of AtARGAH knockouts to multiple abiotic stresses may arise from the competition for arginine between the ARGAH pathway and other metabolic pathways, such as those involving NOS and ADC. However, subsequent studies suggest that terrestrial plants might not possess animal-like NOS enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Santolini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeandroz et al., 2016</xref>).

Therefore, the link between the enhanced salt tolerance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> arginase mutants and NO accumulation via the NOS pathway is controversial. These explanations of ARGAH’s role under salt stress are based solely on the competition of several metabolic pathways for substrate arginine and may be incomplete. Here we clearly indicated that by employing experiments involving arginase inhibitors, arginase gene mutants, as well as PPD and urease mutants, the arginine hydrolysis pathway (a two-step hydrolysis reaction) is directly involved in SISG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This finding not only challenges existing explanations but also underscores the significance of seed reserve nitrogen mobilization in the context of SISG.</p><p>How exactly does the arginine hydrolysis pathway trigger SISG? Our hypothetical model, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, elucidates the following process. The arginine hydrolysis pathway is implicated in triggering SISG through a series of interconnected physiological mechanisms. During seed germination, the activity of arginase and urease, especially particularly heightened under salt stress conditions, facilitates the conversion of arginine to urea and then into the ammonia pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Polacco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siddappa and Marathe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kojima et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, arginase activity was significantly upregulated under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Polacco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siddappa and Marathe, 2020</xref>). This induction is further supported by strong evidence demonstrating the salt-induced expression of arginase and urease genes during seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Polacco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siddappa and Marathe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kazachkova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2020</xref>), and triggers significant accumulation of urea and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the arginine hydrolysis pathway is induced by salt stress.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model for the regulation of seed germination by the arginine hydrolysis pathway under salt stress condition.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Salt stress highly induced the accumulation of arginine through the degradation of seed-stored proteins in the cotyledon. Then, arginine is hydrolyzed to urea through the action of arginine amidinohydrolase (ARGAH), and urea is further degraded by plant urease to form NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>. (<bold>b</bold>) Salt stress stimulates the arginine hydrolysis pathway, leading to urea production by ARGAH, and its subsequent breakdown by urease, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup> levels, and cytoplasmic pH (pH<sub>cyt</sub>), which inhibits seed germination (SISG). Application of arginine hydrolysis inhibitors (e.g., <italic>N</italic><sup>G</sup>-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-arginine [NOHA] for arginase, and phenyl phosphorodiamidate [PPD] for urease) or using <italic>ARGAH</italic> or <italic>Urease</italic> gene deletion mutants under salt stress can reduce NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup> levels, and decreased pH<sub>cyt</sub>, thus promoting seed germination (SISG alleviate).

Thus, the toxic effects of arginine or urea accumulation can be excluded as a cause of SISG. Our results suggest that blocking arginase or urease activity leads to a decrease in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> levels, which effectively mitigates SISG. This finding challenges our previous hypothesis that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation due to urea hydrolysis under salt stress triggers SISG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2015</xref>). However, our new results showed that the addition of ammonium to the medium under salt stress, on the contrary, effectively alleviated SISG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This new unexpected experimental result refutes this seemingly plausible hypothesis that ammonium accumulation (ammonia toxicity) resulting from excessive urea hydrolysis is sufficient to trigger SISG.</p><p>Recent studies have shed light on the role of glutamine synthetase 2 (GLN2), primarily located in plastid, in inducing acid stress through assimilation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, which exerts toxic effects on plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hachiya et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, our results showed that MSX treatment fails to alleviate SISG under salt stress, and interestingly, SISG shows a negative correlation with GS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This indicates that assimilation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> by GS may serve as an adaptive strategy for SISG. These results hint at the potential of cell acidification in alleviating SISG, which may explain why the addition of ammonium can effectively alleviate SISG. Traditionally, the hydrolysis of urea has been considered to produce ammonia and CO<sub>2</sub>; in fact, the urea hydrolysis in the two-step hydrolysis reaction of the arginine hydrolysis pathway, ‘(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO + 3H<sub>2</sub>O → 2NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>+OH<sup>−’</sup>, is indeed an alkalinization reaction. In addition, further hydrolysis of bicarbonate will also produce hydroxide ‘HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇆ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>+OH<sup>−’</sup>, leading to further alkalization. Changes in cell parameters, including cytosolic pH (pHcyt), play a crucial role in both sensory and protective processes in plants under stress conditions. pHcyt acts as a pivotal regulator for numerous intracellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Felle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gjetting et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, to adapt to stressful environments, plants activate sensory and protective mechanisms within their roots, which are essential for maintaining the health of roots and shoots. It appears that root tissue plays a key role in plants’ sensitivity to salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang and Lee, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). However, investigations focusing on salinity-induced, tissue-specific pH changes in roots or other tissues at salt concentrations have rarely been published, and they have mainly been conducted on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ageyeva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rombolá-Caldentey et al., 2023</xref>). This scarcity is primarily due to the limitations of current measurement methods, which are not suitable for long-lasting observations on intact plants. Therefore, based on our findings on the influence of urea hydrolysis from the arginine storage in cotyledon on SISG and the associated alkalization process, we utilized transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing fluorescent pH probes. These plants allowed us to assess the effects of salinity and the addition of PPD or urea on pHcyt in the cells of root elongation zones. Our investigation revealed that salt stress leads to an increase in cytoplasmic pH of seed radical cells, which results in SISG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Overall, these hypothetical models suggest that blocking arginase or urease activity under salt-stressed conditions can effectively mitigate the events leading to SISG, both depending on whether the alkaline hydrolysis reaction of the core metabolite urea occurs or is enhanced, providing new insights into SISG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Salt inhibition of seed germination has been attributed to various signaling mediators and pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zörb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaleem et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu, 2016</xref>). Na<sup>+</sup> toxicity is thought to be one of the main factors triggering SISG, as evidenced by the mitigation of SISG in the salt-sensitive mutant <italic>sos3</italic> by blocking the arginine hydrolysis pathway. This result implies that initiation of the arginine hydrolysis pathway exerts an additional effect on SISG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Excessive hydrolysis of arginine leads to the accumulation of urea, and further hydrolysis of urea, coupled with elevated intracellular pH, leads to SISG events. Therefore, we posit that, in addition to Na<sup>+</sup> toxicity, SISG is also instigated by elevated intracellular pH resulting from urea hydrolysis. Salt sensitivity of <italic>sos3</italic> can be ameliorated by blocking urease activity and reducing intracellular pH under salt stress.</p><p>Urea is a plant metabolite derived from arginine hydrolysis or root uptake. In addition to the enzyme reaction required for urea hydrolysis, there are related urea transport steps in the mobilization process of nitrogen storage in seeds. In general, urea can be transported across plant cell membranes by high- or low-affinity transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Polacco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kojima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bohner et al., 2015</xref>). On the cellular and mitochondrial membranes, low-affinity urea transporters are mediated by PIP/TIP or TIP aqueous proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kojima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bohner et al., 2015</xref>). The Dur3 mediates the high-affinity transport of urea. The Dur3 mRNA level increased significantly during seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Zelm et al., 2020</xref>). According to our initial study, blocking the transport of free urea generated by the arginine hydrolysis pathway may also alleviate SISG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and AtDur3 may be involved in long-distance urea transport from cotyledons to radicles. Urea transport and the arginine hydrolysis pathway may synergistically affect SISG.</p><p>In summary, our study elucidates the hydrolysis reaction of arginine-derived urea in mobilizing stored nitrogen in seeds and its role in triggering SISG by raising the pH levels in seed radical cells. Although our evidence is primarily derived from studies on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the application of PPD treatment across a diverse range of plants, including glycophytes, halophytes, graminaceous crops, and legumes, demonstrated consistent underlying principles. This consistency suggests that our findings may be applicable across the seed plant community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), underscoring a broader relevance of our conclusions.</p><p>To conceptualize our findings, we summarized a hypothetical model illustrating the arginine hydrolysis pathway that regulates seed germination under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Salt stress significantly induced the accumulation of arginine through the degradation of seed-stored proteins in the cotyledon. Then, arginine is hydrolyzed to urea by arginase, which is subsequently degraded by plant urease into NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). During this process, the inhibition of salt stress on seed germination and seedling growth can be alleviated by blocking either step of the arginine hydrolysis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>), with the rise in intracellular pH due to urea hydrolysis in the roots, being the actual trigger for SISG, rather than the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The persistence of the two-step hydrolysis of arginine through evolutionary history, despite its potential adverse effects on seed germination, suggests that arginase and urease activities may represent an adaptive response to environmental changes. This resilience highlights the complexity of plant adaptation and provides further insight into SISG. Future studies focused on the enzymes involved in arginine metabolism and the regulatory mechanisms governing the allocation of arginine-derived nitrogen to defend against stress will enhance our understanding of the essential intermediates in this process. Additionally, examining the developmental switches between nitrogen storage and remobilization could help improve crop cultivation conditions and practices. Such studies will not only be pivotal for optimizing crop cultivation conditions but also for mitigating the negative economic and environmental ramifications associated with excessive urea application in agriculture.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutant (atargah1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ABRC (Ohio State University)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SALK_057987</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CR-PCR-AtArgAH1AtArgAH2 (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">M2CRISPR vector</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">atargah1/atargah2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers AtArgAH1- FW/ RV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">ACATGGGTTTCATTATGAAC</named-content>/ <named-content content-type="sequence">CACAAAAGACTAAATACATG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">atargah1/atargah2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers AtArgAH2- FW/ RV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCTTGCGGTCCTTGCCAAC</named-content>/ <named-content content-type="sequence">ATAAACAGAATCTTATTGAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Arginase Assay Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bioassay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DARG-048</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Urea Assay Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bioassay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DIUR-048</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>N</italic><sup>G</sup>-Hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-arginine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H7278</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Phenyl phosphorodiamidate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Macklin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">p858176</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><sc>l</sc>-Methionine sulfoximine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">M5379</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPSS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPSS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>All experiments were performed with <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia (Col) wild-type plants and mutants in the Col background.

In our initial experimental design, we aimed to determine the pH levels in various parts of plants, including leaves, stems, and roots. However, we encountered significant challenges due to the limitations of our measurement technology. Specifically, the auto-fluorescence of chlorophyll and complex structures of leaves and other organs interfered with our ability to obtain accurate pH readings. This issue is common in pH measurement in other labs, as current literature often focuses on measuring pH in roots.</p><p>Given these constraints and the focus of our study on root physiology, we concentrated our efforts on analyzing the pH levels in fresh root tip tissue, where pH determination was more feasible and reliable. This decision aligns with our research objectives to explore the impact of urea hydrolysis on root function and soil-root interactions, which are critical for nutrient uptake and plant health.</p><p>We acknowledge the importance of understanding how these processes affect the entire plant, and we have discussed the limitations of our study and potential future research directions in this context (Lines 357-372). Future studies could leverage advancements in measurement technologies or innovative methodologies to overcome these challenges and provide a more comprehensive understanding of pH variations in different plant organs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Where is this urea coming from? Is this coming from the shoot? Would that transport be necessary for SISG?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your excellent question. Urea may be absorbed from the external environment, or produced from the degradation of cotyledon storage nitrogen. In this study context, we only considered the key role of endogenous urea hydrolysis from the degradation of cotyledon storage N during seed germination. We used arginase mutants and inhibitors to analyze the effect of urea hydrolysis on salt inhibition of seed germination. Furthermore, our experiment with urea transport mutants confirmed that blocking urea transport can alleviate salt inhibition of seed germination, which means that urea transport, potentially from the cotyledons to the germinating tissues, is necessary for salt inhibition of seed germination observed in seed germination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is worth evaluating the effects of different pHs from acid to alkaline on SISG.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment and suggestions. In this study, we primarily used genetic materials to explore how internal changes in pH, resulting from urea hydrolysis, influence SISG. Your suggestion to examine the effects of varying exogenous pH levels, from acidic to alkaline, on SISG is indeed a valuable research direction. We have initiated investigations in this domain and have observed some preliminary trends that hint at the complex role of pH in modulating SISG. These investigations are guided by the understanding that pH can significantly impact nutrient availability and enzyme activities critical for seed germination. We are employing a systematic approach to explore this, encompassing a broad spectrum of pH conditions. We anticipate that these findings will greatly enrich our understanding of pH regulation in SISG and look forward to discussing these in detail in our subsequent publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A higher salt concentration (and at their optimum temperature) is necessary to confirm if the mechanism is valid for other species, especially for the halophytic plants</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely apologize for the oversight and appreciate your valuable feedback. It should be clarified that the processing temperature for our study subjects, such as rice, soybeans and other materials, is set at 28℃, reflecting the optimal temperature range for these species' germination and early growth stages. This has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><p>For the treatment of high salt concentration, we conducted a series of preliminary experiments with varying salt concentrations. We observed that the addition of PPD consistently alleviated the salt inhibition of seed germination across all tested concentrations. The chosen salt concentration for our main experiments was determined based on these pre-experimental results, aiming to illustrate a balance between ecological relevance and the clarity of the observed effects.</p><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's point on testing the mechanism in halophytic plants, which are inherently adapted to thrive in high salinity conditions, this indeed presents an intriguing direction for future research. Investigating the response of halophytes could provide valuable insights into the universality and limits of the observed mechanisms and is a direction we are considering for subsequent studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More details are provided below</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions to improve.</p><p>The main idea of the first paragraph in the introduction is not clear (it's confusing whether you will study urea or salt toxicity).

In response, we have carefully revised the first paragraph of the introduction to focus more cohesively on urea's role as a vital nitrogen source in agricultural practices. We clarified the transition from discussing urea's importance to its potential toxicity and the challenges presented by extreme saline soils, ensuring a logical flow of ideas.</p><p>We have also made a concerted effort to link urea's role to arginine metabolism more explicitly, outlining how these aspects are crucial to understanding the broader context of our study. The sections on urea toxicity and the impact of saline soils have been repositioned to precede the concluding paragraphs of the introduction, aligning with your suggestion for a more coherent structure.</p><p>Additionally, we have integrated a concise overview of previous findings on urea toxicity under salinity, specifically referencing seminal works such as Bu et al., 2015, to provide a solid foundation for our study's premise. These revisions are reflected in lines 57-71 for the restructured introduction and lines 103-107 for the detailed discussion on urea toxicity under saline conditions.</p><p>We believe these changes have significantly improved the clarity and flow of the introduction, accurately setting the stage for the subsequent sections of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>pH reduction by salt stress. I suggest including a pharmacological approach to reduce (and increase) pH or scavenge OH to confirm that the cause is the change in the pH and no other mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion regarding the use of a pharmacological approach to manipulate pH levels. We recognize the potential of such methods to provide clearer insights into the role of pH changes in seed germination under salt stress. In this study, we primarily focused on understanding the endogenous pH changes resulting from urea hydrolysis stimulated by salt stress on seed germination, as this aligns closely with our research objectives of exploring internal physiological responses.</p><p>We acknowledge that exogenous acid treatment could offer a more direct method of manipulating pH levels. However, we were cautious of the potential for such treatments to introduce additional complexities, given their potential to interfere with other cellular and physiological processes, thereby complicating the interpretation of results related to seed germination.</p><p>Given these considerations, we did not pursue exogenous pH manipulation in this study. However, we fully appreciate the importance of this approach and are planning to incorporate pharmacological methods to both reduce and increase pH, as well as scavenge OH<sup>-</sup>, in our future work. This will allow us to more definitively determine the causal relationship between pH changes and seed germination under salt stress, and to distinguish these effects from other concurrent mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Urea transport. Are you hypothesizing that urea accumulating in the roots is coming from leaves? Would that be necessary for SISG? I think these results expand the knowledge about SISG but they sound preliminary. I think at least you may need to connect these findings with the previous results, analyzing the atdur3 mutants' germination under salt stress in combination with PPD.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your excellent question. Urea is not only absorbed from the external environment, but also be produced from the degradation of nitrogen stored in the cotyledon, which is thought to be a significant internal source of urea produced in seedlings. However, our study specifically focuses on urea derived from cotyledon-stored nitrogen due to its significant role in the early stages of seedling development, particularly in the context of SISG.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the effect of urea hydrolysis on SISG using arginase mutants and inhibitors, and demonstrated that by nitrogen arginine hydrolysis the urea produced influences SISG significantly in cotyledon.</p><p>Urea transport from the cotyledon to the roots, mediated by specific transporters such as <italic>atdur3</italic>, is essential. Our findings using the <italic>atdur3</italic> mutant, which lacks efficient urea transport, suggest that this transport is a crucial factor in triggering SISG. Therefore, we consider urea transport to be a necessary condition for SISG.</p><p>Regarding the combined effects of the atdur3 mutation and PPD on salt stress, our preliminary experiments (referenced in the figure below) indicate that the <italic>atdur3</italic> mutant's growth under salt stress does not significantly differ with or without PPD. In contrast, the wild type exhibits significant changes, underscoring that disrupting urea transport enhances the mutant's tolerance to salt stress. This is true regardless of the presence of PPD, which further blocks urea hydrolysis, highlighting the pivotal role of urea transport in SISG.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of AtUrease inhibitor PPD on growth of Wild-type (WT) and &lt;italic&gt;atdur3&lt;/italic&gt;.(A-D) germinated on half-strength MS or 135 mM NaCl with or without 15 µM PPD.</title><p>Representative images show the morphology of seedlings 14 d after 2 days stratification at 4℃.

We have expanded the discussion to clarify the independence of NOS and ADC pathways from the arginase pathway in the revised manuscript. Please find our revisions in lines 307-319: &quot;For example, ARGAH knockout mutants exhibit increased tolerance to various abiotic stresses, including water deficit, salt, and freezing, while lines overexpressing AtARGAH show decreased tolerance to these stresses (Shi et al., 2013; Flores et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011). The enhanced tolerance of AtARGAH knockouts to multiple abiotic stresses may arise from the competition for arginine between the ARGAH pathway and other metabolic pathways, such as those involving NOS and ADC. However, subsequent studies suggest that terrestrial plants might not possess animal-like NOS enzymes (Zhao et al., 2015; Santolini et al., 2017; Jeandroz et al., 2016). These studies showed that Arabidopsis nitric oxide synthase 1 (AtNOS1) was different from NOS, leading to its renaming as AtNOA1. Therefore, the link between the enhanced salt tolerance of Arabidopsis arginase mutants and NO accumulation via the NOS pathway is controversial. These explanations of ARGAH's role under salt stress are based solely on competition of several metabolic pathways for substrate arginine may be incomplete.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It makes no sense that root growth is affected in the same way in soybean and rice compared to Chloris and Puccinellia.

We acknowledge the discrepancy in the reported culture temperatures for germination; Rice and soybean were indeed cultured at 28℃, not 22℃ as erroneously mentioned, which has been corrected in the revised text.</p><p>Regarding the salt tolerance of <italic>Chloris</italic> and <italic>Puccinellia</italic>, it's recognized that these species are generally more salt-tolerant. In our preliminary experiments across a range of salt concentrations, we observed that the addition of PPD consistently mitigated the salt-induced inhibition of seed germination and growth in all tested species.

In our current study, we have focused on utilizing genetic materials to investigate the impact of internal pH changes, resulting from urea hydrolysis, on salt inhibition of seed germination (SISG). This approach primarily considers the effect of internal acid-base balance on seed germination. We acknowledge that the application of exogenous acids or bases to adjust pH could introduce more complex effects on in vivo pH responses, which represent a significant and more intricate biological process.</p><p>The exploration of exogenous pH influences on SISG is indeed a valuable research direction. We are currently undertaking studies in this area to delve deeper into the regulatory role of pH on SISG. As such, we have not yet obtained results regarding the effects of exogenous acid treatments on modulating pH levels. We anticipate discussing these findings and their implications in detail in our forthcoming paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The biological significance of the two-step catalyzed arginine catabolic pathway that is induced by salt stress and inhibits seed germination and seedling growth needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have discussed the biological significance of the two-step catalyzed arginine catabolic pathway that is induced by salt stress and inhibits seed germination and seedling growth. Please find our revisions in lines 414-420: &quot;The persistence of the two-step hydrolysis of arginine through evolutionary history, despite its potential adverse effects on seed germination, suggests that arginase and urease activities may represent an adaptive response to environmental changes. This resilience highlights the complexity of plant adaptation and provides further insight into SISG. Future studies focused on the enzymes involved in arginine metabolism and the regulatory mechanisms governing the allocation of arginine-derived nitrogen to defend against stress will enhance our understanding of the essential intermediates in this process.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
