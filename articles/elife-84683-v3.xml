However, for the corresponding metabolic glucose demands both decreases and increases have been reported. To resolve this discrepancy, functional PET/MRI data from 50 healthy subjects performing Tetris were combined with previously published data sets of working memory, visual and motor stimulation. We show that the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN is dependent on the metabolic demands of the correspondingly engaged task-positive networks. Specifically, the dorsal attention and frontoparietal network shape the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN in opposing directions. While tasks that mainly require an external focus of attention lead to a consistent downregulation of both metabolism and the BOLD signal in the posteromedial DMN, cognitive control during working memory requires a metabolically expensive BOLD suppression. This indicates that two types of BOLD deactivations with different oxygen-to-glucose index may occur in this region. We further speculate that consistent downregulation of the two signals is mediated by decreased glutamate signaling, while divergence may be subject to active GABAergic inhibition. The results demonstrate that the DMN relates to cognitive processing in a flexible manner and does not always act as a cohesive task-negative network in isolation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>default mode network</kwd><kwd>BOLD signal</kwd><kwd>deactivation</kwd><kwd>functional PET</kwd><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KLI610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical University of Vienna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDPhD Excellence Programm</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klug</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-STG-716065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieckmann</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Stiernman</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GN2001283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cocchi</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the human brain, default mode network BOLD deactivations can be accompanied by both increases and decreases in glucose metabolism, depending on the respective metabolic demands of task-positive cognitive control and attention networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Large-scale brain networks progressively integrate sensory input to enable complex cognitive processes and behaviors in accordance with internal goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cocchi et al., 2013</xref>). The default mode network (DMN) was originally termed ‘task-negative’ due to decreased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal (‘deactivation’, see Methods for full description) during the performance of tasks requiring an external focus of attention as compared to rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raichle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>). Processing of external stimuli in turn increases the BOLD signal in ‘task-positive’ networks including the dorsal attention (DAN) and the frontoparietal network (FPN). While the DAN is mainly engaged when attention to sensory information is required, such as in visuo-spatial reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fox et al., 2005</xref>), the FPN mediates cognitive control across various task conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 2013</xref>) such as the maintenance and manipulation of information also in the absence of external sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scolari et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the low (or anti-) correlation in BOLD signals between task-positive and default mode networks at resting-state, it has long been assumed that an antagonism between the DMN and other large-scale networks represents a general characteristic of brain functioning (regardless if computed with or without global signal regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckner and DiNicola, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy and Fox, 2017</xref>). However, the DMN can also be activated during complex cognitive tasks (e.g., memory recollection, abstract self-generated thought; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hearne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). This DMN engagement is thought to facilitate between-network integration, instead of being a segregated network alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fornito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leech et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, some brain regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus (part of the posteromedial DMN) have been suggested to play a key role in across-network integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cocchi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it has been suggested that task-positive attention/control networks and the DMN can flexibly switch between cooperative and antagonistic patterns to adapt to the task context at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cocchi et al., 2013</xref>). Despite these advancements in the organization of brain networks, our understanding of the underlying metabolic demands of these context-specific neuronal processes is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal and Snyder, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this context, functional PET (fPET) imaging represents a promising approach to investigate the dynamics of brain metabolism. fPET refers to the assessment of stimulation-induced changes in physiological processes such as glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villien et al., 2014</xref>) and neurotransmitter synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>) in a single scan. The temporal resolution of this approach of 6–30 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>) is considerably higher than that of a conventional bolus administration. This is achieved through the constant infusion of the radioligand, thereby providing free radioligand throughout the scan that is available to bind according to the actual task demands. Here, the term ‘functional’ is used in analogy to fMRI, where paradigms are often presented in repeated blocks of stimulation, which can subsequently be assessed by the general linear model.</p><p>Studies using simultaneous fPET/fMRI have shown a strong spatial correspondence between the BOLD signal changes and glucose metabolism in several task-positive networks and across various tasks requiring different levels of cognitive engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jamadar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villien et al., 2014</xref>). However, also regional differences in activation patterns have been observed previously between both modalities in these and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wehrl et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, a dissociation between BOLD changes (negative) and glucose metabolism (positive) has recently been observed even in the same region of the DMN during a working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>), namely the posteromedial default mode network (pmDMN). In contrast, simple visual and motor tasks elicited a negative metabolic response in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that distinct underlying metabolic processes support state-specific BOLD signal changes in the DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal and Snyder, 2021</xref>). However, the consistency and functional specialization of neuronal and metabolic interactions between default mode and task-positive networks is unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether the observed dissociation between patterns of metabolism and BOLD changes in the DMN generalizes for complex cognitive tasks, and whether this in turn depends on the brain networks supporting the task performance and their interaction with the DMN.</p><p>To address these open questions, we employed functional PET/MR imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG during rest and performance of a visuo-spatial task requiring a broad range of cognitive functions primarily supported by the dorsal attention network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klug et al., 2022</xref>). The results were then compared to previously published data from tasks of varying complexity (working memory, eyes opening and finger tapping), primarily involving different brain networks (FPN, visual and motor, respectively). The task response of the posteromedial DMN was the main focus of interest, due to its key role in integrating specialized large-scale brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cocchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leech et al., 2012</xref>). The combination of different imaging modalities and cognitive tasks sheds further light on the interaction across brain networks involved in external attention and cognitive control as well as on the corresponding metabolic underpinnings of the BOLD signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Simultaneous fPET/fMRI data and arterial blood samples were acquired from 50 healthy participants during the performance of the video game Tetris, a challenging cognitive task requiring rapid visuo-spatial processing and motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klug et al., 2022</xref>). From this dataset (DS1), we evaluated the spatial overlap of negative task responses in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlu quantified with the Patlak plot) and the BOLD signal specifically in the pmDMN. Next, comparisons to other tasks were drawn, focusing on the corresponding positive task effects across different large-scale functional networks. For this purpose, group-average statistical results of previously published data sets were re-analyzed. These comprised the aforementioned working memory task, specifically the difficult manipulation condition which required active continuation of alphabetic letters (DS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>), as well as data from simple eyes open and finger tapping conditions (DS3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>). After that, the distinct spatial activation patterns across different tasks were used to quantitatively characterize the CMRGlu response of the pmDMN in DS1. Finally, we investigated the directional influence between the pmDMN and task-positive networks using metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Regional and task specific effects of CMRGlu and BOLD changes</title><p>We first assessed the regional overlap of task-induced changes in CMRGlu and the BOLD signal for the Tetris paradigm specifically for the DMN.

This included a cluster in the pmDMN, previously referred to as the ventral PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leech et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, working memory was associated with a dissociation in the DMN.

These findings resolve the discrepancy between (non)congruent glucose demands and BOLD signal changes across different cognitive tasks, emphasizing the distinct metabolic underpinnings of BOLD signal deactivations during cognitive processing.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Spatially distinct metabolic response within the DMN</title><p>The tasks investigated in this work resulted in distinct metabolic responses in the pmDMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). This included the PCC, a spatially and functionally heterogeneous region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leech et al., 2014</xref>) with ventral and dorsal subcomponents (vPCC/dPCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>). The PCC is a central hub, connecting brain networks involved in complex behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagmann et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, the PCC is thought to act as an interface between distributed functional networks by echoing their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leech et al., 2011</xref>) and tuning the balance between the internal and external focus of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leech and Sharp, 2014</xref>). Despite a consistent negative BOLD response during external tasks, the dPCC and vPCC are differently integrated into the DMN and distinct large-scale networks underpinning task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leech et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parker and Razlighi, 2019</xref>). That is, these two DMN regions are thought to be flexibly recruited to support various cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cocchi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The vPCC is engaged in tasks with an internal focus of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leech and Sharp, 2014</xref>), such as autobiographical memory recollection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svoboda et al., 2006</xref>), and when demands for externally directed attention are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leech et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings add to this knowledge by suggesting that vPCC BOLD deactivation represents a downregulation of internal processing in favor of a focus on the external task for example, as supported by DAN, VIN, and SMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leech et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, a negative BOLD response paralleled by a decreased CMRGlu, as observed for Tetris as well as simple visual and motor stimulation, indicates a reduction of overall metabolism, in line with the original understanding of DMN task-negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the dPCC is involved in externally directed attention and plays an opposite role to the vPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leech et al., 2011</xref>).

This could lead to a competition between self-generated and task-induced demands. Thus, vPCC BOLD deactivation during working memory seems to reflect a metabolically expensive process that suppresses self-generated thoughts to enhance task focus, particularly when internal task demands are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckner and DiNicola, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hearne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leech et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Metabolic and neurophysiological considerations</title><p>The distinct relationships between BOLD and CMRGlu signals that emerge during specific tasks highlight the different physiological processes contributing to neuronal activation of cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal and Snyder, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh, 2012</xref>). While CMRGlu measured by fPET provides an absolute indicator for glucose consumption, the BOLD signal reflects deoxyhemoglobin concentration, which depends on various factors, such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goense et al., 2016</xref>). In simple terms, the BOLD signal relates to the ratio of ∆CBF/∆CMRO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Assuming that the observed BOLD decreases during Tetris and WM emerge from the same mechanisms, this would result in a comparable ∆CBF/∆CMRO<sub>2</sub> in the pmDMN for both tasks. Given that these types of tasks (external attention and cognitive control) elicit a reduction in CBF in the pmDMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shulman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zou et al., 2011</xref>), CMRO<sub>2</sub> also decreases albeit to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, the respective metabolic processes can be described by their oxygen-to-glucose index (OGI), the ratio of CMRO<sub>2</sub>/CMRGlu. Accordingly, our results suggest two distinct pathways underlying BOLD deactivations in the pmDMN that differ regarding their OGI. During Tetris there is a BOLD deactivation with a high OGI, resulting from a larger decrease in CMRGlu than CMRO<sub>2</sub>. This metabolically inactive state is in line with electrophysiological recordings in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fox et al., 2018</xref>) and in non-human primates showing a decrease of neuronal activity in the pmDMN that covaries with the degree of exteroceptive vigilance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bentley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shmuel et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the negative BOLD response during external tasks reflects a reduction of neuronal activity and their respective metabolic demands. On the other hand, the relatively increased CMRGlu without the corresponding surge in CMRO<sub>2</sub> (combined with decreased CBF) hints at another kind of BOLD deactivation with a low OGI in the pmDMN during working memory, indicating energy supply by aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blazey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaishnavi et al., 2010</xref>). Previous work in non-human primates has indeed suggested a differential coupling of neuronal activity to hemodynamic oxygen supply in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bentley et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, tonic suppression of PCC neuronal spiking during task performance was punctuated by positive phasic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayden et al., 2009</xref>), which could indicate differences between both tasks also at the level of electrophysiologically measured activity.</p><p>On the neurotransmitter level, one of the current hypotheses regarding BOLD deactivations proposes that CMRO<sub>2</sub> and CBF are affected by the balance of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, specifically GABA and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsáki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lauritzen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sten et al., 2017</xref>). In the PCC, glutamate release prevents negative BOLD responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), whereas a lower glutamate/GABA ratio is associated with greater deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu et al., 2019</xref>). As glutamate elicits proportional glucose consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lundgaard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimmer et al., 2017</xref>), decreases in glutamate signaling in the pmDMN could indeed explain both, the decreased BOLD response and decreased CMRGlu during the Tetris task. Conversely, increased GABA supports a negative BOLD response in the PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), as do working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koush et al., 2021</xref>) and pharmacological stimulation with GABAergic benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walter et al., 2016</xref>). In consequence, the observed dissociation between BOLD changes and CMRGlu during working memory could indeed result from metabolically expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2012</xref>) GABAergic suppression of the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>). However, we need to emphasize that glutamate and GABAergic signaling was not measured in the current study, thus, the above interpretations are of speculative nature. Nonetheless, future work may test this promising hypothesis, for example, using pharmacological alteration of GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling or optogenetic approaches modulating GABAergic interneuron activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations, outlook, and conclusions</title><p>To summarize, our work provides novel insights into the metabolic underpinnings of negative BOLD responses in the pmDMN, showing that regionally specific effects depend on the functional networks involved in task execution. Acknowledging the underlying energy demands and neurotransmitter actions underpinning neuronal activity is necessary to understand PCC function, including how this essential DMN region dynamically interacts with macroscale networks as a function of changing behavioral demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hampson et al., 2006</xref>). While our work provides valuable information to address this knowledge gap, several caveats are worth noting: First, we did not assess the different tasks in the same cohorts, but pooled different studies. However, only effects corrected at the group level were used as obtained from commonly employed sample sizes, which should provide representative findings. Second, Tetris and WM data were acquired with different acquisition details and task designs, that is, continuous task performance versus hierarchical embedding of short task blocks for BOLD into longer PET acquisition, respectively. As the latter may not clearly differentiate between start-cue and task activation, this may limit transferability. Therefore, future studies investigating these effects should address this limitation, ideally studying the different tasks in the same cohort, with a comparable task design. Third, our results were obtained using rest with crosshair fixation as the baseline condition. Since task-specific effects in the BOLD signal and CMRGlu are relative to this baseline condition, these would likely change if using an active control condition as baseline. Fourth, additional contextual load input to the pmDMN, (e.g., task-relevant emotional content) may be another important factor affecting its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies may therefore include additional cognitive and emotional domains. Of particular interest would be the investigation of introspective tasks such as autobiographical memory as these typically induce a positive BOLD response in the PCC, while the coupling with the CMRGlu response is unknown. Such paradigms would also allow to assess whether the presently observed network interactions are symmetrical, that is, if task positive networks show decreased activation when the DMN exhibits a positive response. This hypothesis seems reasonable in the light of recent work reporting bidirectional information exchange between default mode and other networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Menon et al., 2023</xref>). Although the DMN, and in particular the PCC, has been implicated in numerous brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckner and DiNicola, 2019</xref>), our data suggests that this could be mediated by other interacting cortical networks. Assessing the differential influence of attention and control networks on the pmDMN may therefore represent an interesting approach to improve our understanding of network dysfunction in different patient populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Throughout this manuscript, we refer to deactivation/decrease/negative response and likewise to activation/increase/positive response as relative changes compared to the baseline condition.

The radiotracer [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG was applied in a bolus +infusion protocol (510 kBq/kg/frame for 1 min, 40 kBq/kg/frame for 51 min) using a perfusion pump (Syramed µSP6000, Arcomed, Regensdorf, Switzerland), which was kept in an MRI-shield (UniQUE, Arcomed).</p><p>MRI acquisitions included a T1-weighted structural scan (MPRAGE sequence, TE/TR = 4.21/2200ms, TI = 900ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix size = 240 x 256, 160 slices, voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm +0.1 mm gap, 7.72 min) and BOLD fMRI (EPI sequence, TE/TR = 30/2000ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 80 x 80, 34 slices, voxel size = 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm +0.825 mm gap, 6 min for functional connectivity and 8.17 min for neuronal activation in the block design).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data acquisition of DS2 (working memory task)</title><p>Data were obtained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>).

Intravenous infusion of 180 MBq [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG was started simultaneously with PET/MRI acquisition (GE Signa) and lasted 60 min (0.016 ml/s). MRI scans included an attenuation correction sequence, T1-weighted structural imaging (TE/TR = 3.1/7200ms, flip angle = 12°, matrix size = 256 x 256, 180 slices, voxel size = 0.49 x 0.49 x 1<bold>,</bold> mm, 7.36 min) and BOLD functional MRI (EPI sequence, TE/TR = 30/4000ms, flip angle = 80°, matrix size = 96 x 96, voxel size = 1.95 x 1.95 x 3.9 mm, 42 min).</p><p>During PET/MRI acquisition participants kept their eyes open. The working memory task was completed in a hierarchical design. That is, short task blocks of 45 s and 15 s rest served for assessment of task changes in the BOLD signal. These short blocks were embedded in long 6 min blocks, which enabled identification of task effects in glucose metabolism. Participants completed 2x6 min maintenance and 2x6 min manipulation blocks, with 3x6 min rest blocks in-between. In the maintenance condition, 4 target letters were shown and participants were asked if a delayed probe letter matches one of the targets. In the manipulation condition, 2 target letters were shown and participants were required to indicate if a delayed probe letter represents the subsequent letter in the alphabet of any of the targets.</p><p>PET data were reconstructed to 60x1 min frames and analyzed with the general linear model (GLM). Since arterial blood samples were not available for DS2, beta estimates from the GLM were entered into group-level statistical analysis (p&lt;0.05 TFCE corrected). The contrast of interest was manipulation vs. rest. Confirmatory kinetic modeling was performed with a literature-based arterial input function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data acquisition of DS3 (eyes open and finger tapping tasks)</title><p>Data were obtained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>). In short, participants fasted for at least 5.5 hr before the scan. Intravenous infusion of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (3 MBq/kg body weight) was started simultaneously with PET/MRI acquisition (Siemens mMR) and lasted 95 min (36 ml/h). MRI scans included T1-weighted structural imaging (MPRAGE, TE/TR = 4.2/2000ms, TI = 900ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix size = 256 x 240, 160 slices, voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm +0.1 mm gap, 7.02 min) and BOLD functional MRI (EPI sequence, TE/TR = 30/2440ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 100 x 100, 30 slices, voxel size = 2.1 x 2.1 x 3 mm +0.75 mm gap, 5 min per task block).</p><p>During PET/MRI acquisition participants kept their eyes closed. Continuous task performance included opening the eyes for 2x10 min and 2x10 min tapping the right thumb to the fingers with 15 min rest blocks in-between. Arterial blood samples were obtained during the rest periods.</p><p>PET data were reconstructed to 95x1 min frames and analyzed with the GLM. Quantification of CMRGlu was carried out with the arterial input function and the Patlak plot. CMRGlu maps were entered into group-level statistical analysis (p&lt;0.05 FWE corrected cluster-level after p&lt;0.001 uncorrected voxel level). The contrast of interest was eyes open vs. eyes closed or finger tapping vs. rest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Blood sampling</title><p>Before the PET/MRI scan blood glucose levels were assessed as triplicate (Glu<sub>plasma</sub>). During the PET/MRI acquisitions, manual arterial blood samples were drawn at 3, 4, 5, 14, 25, 36, and 47 min after the start of the radiotracer administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>). From these samples, whole-blood and plasma activity were measured in a gamma counter (Wizard<sup>2</sup>, Perkin Elmer). The arterial input function was obtained by linear interpolation of the manual samples to match PET frames and multiplication with the average plasma-to-whole-blood ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cerebral metabolic rate of glucose metabolism (CMRGlu)</title><p>PET images were reconstructed and processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, PET list mode data were corrected for attenuation with a database approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgos et al., 2014</xref>) and reconstructed to 30 s frames (matrix size = 344 x 344, 127 slices). Preprocessing was carried out in SPM12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>) and comprised motion correction (quality = 1, register to mean), spatial normalization to MNI space using the T1-weighted structural image and spatial smoothing with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. Non-gray matter voxels were masked out and a low pass filter was applied, which induces temporal smoothing (cutoff frequency = 3 min). The rationale for this filter is to reduce noise in the high temporal resolution [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG signal. Since task blocks lasted 6 min (or even longer for DS3), we assume that changes faster than this do not reflect task-related effects. Identification of task-specific effects was done with the general linear model. Four regressors were included to characterize the baseline, the two task conditions (easy and hard as a linear function with slope = 1 kBq/frame) and head motion (the first principal component of the 6 motion parameters). The baseline regressor was given by the average time course of all gray matter voxels, excluding those activated during the hard task condition of the individual BOLD block design (p&lt;0.05 FWE corrected voxel level). This approach provides the best model fits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>) without negatively affecting task-specific changes in glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>) or test-retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rischka et al., 2021</xref>).

The resulting maps represented individual task-specific changes in CMRGlu, which were used for group-level analyses and MCM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes</title><p>BOLD imaging data of the block design were processed with SPM12 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>). In short, data were corrected for slice timing effects (reference = middle slice) and head motion (quality = 1, register to mean), normalized to MNI-space via the T1-weighted image and smoothed with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. First-level analysis was carried out to assess individual estimates of the BOLD task response. Here, regressors were included for the two task conditions (easy, hard) and the control condition as well as nuisance regressors for head motion, white matter and CSF signals. The contrast of interest was chosen as the hard task level vs. baseline to facilitate comparison to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM)</title><p>MCM was calculated during the performance of the hard task between regions of interest as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>). The approach combines patterns of functional connectivity (FC) and CMRGlu and enables to estimate directional connectivity between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>). MCM relies on physiological characteristics of energy demands, which mostly emerge postsynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mergenthaler et al., 2013</xref>) and thereby allow to identify the target region of a connection. Briefly, computing the FC between region A and region B yields a distinct FC voxel-wise pattern in region B. If the influence of region A on B is causal, this will result in a corresponding CMRGlu pattern in region B because of the coupling between the BOLD signal and the underlying glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>). FC was computed from continuously acquired BOLD imaging data during the performance of the hard task condition. Preprocessing was done as described above for the BOLD block design. After spatial smoothing, motion scrubbing was performed by removing frames with a displacement &gt;0.5 mm (plus one frame back and two forward). To remove potentially confounding signals linear regression was used (including motion parameters, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals), followed by band-pass filtering (0.01&lt;f &lt; 0.15 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2004</xref>). FC was then calculated as the temporal correlation between regions A and B. MCM was computed as the spatial correlation between voxel-wise patterns of FC and CMRGlu in region B (both correlations were z-transformed). ROIs were defined as for the regression analysis below, i.e., as voxels of the DAN and FPN which were specific for each task as well as voxels of the pmDMN identified with DS1. One subject was excluded from MCM analysis because of movement during the BOLD acquisition of the hard task condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For DS1, task responses in CMRGlu and BOLD were evaluated during the Tetris task with separate one sample t-tests for each imaging modality (p&lt;0.05 FWE corrected cluster-level after p&lt;0.001 uncorrected voxel level). Group maps with significant changes were then binarized and the overlap between CMRGlu and BOLD responses was computed as their intersection. First, this was done for negative task effects to assess if DMN deactivations are present in both modalities.</p><p>Next, we tested the hypothesis that negative responses in the DMN are mirrored by the corresponding positive task changes that are specific to other cortical networks. To provide a comprehensive overview of changes across different tasks, we also included results from a working memory task (DS2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiernman et al., 2021</xref>) as well as eyes opened vs. eyes closed conditions and right finger tapping (DS3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>). For the Tetris and working memory tasks, overlapping increases in CMRGlu and BOLD signal changes were computed in the same way as above, that is, by computing the intersection of group-level significant positive task effects across modalities for each task separately. For the visual and motor paradigms, only CMRGlu data was available.</p><p>The different positive task responses were first compared qualitatively by computing the percentage of activated voxels for each task and 7 cortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). Negative task responses were calculated at a finer level of detail with the DMN subdivisions obtained from the 17 network parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>After that, these network-specific differences in positive responses between the Tetris and working memory tasks (i.e., DS1 vs. DS2) were then used to quantitatively explain the CMRGlu decreases in the pmDMN observed in the current dataset. Individual CMRGlu values of DS1 were extracted for visual, dorsal attention and fronto-parietal networks, as these networks showed greatest differences in activation (see results). Here, only voxels were used which showed an overlap of significant task changes (i.e., the intersection between CMRGlu and BOLD signal) and which were specific for each task (i.e., voxels that did not overlap between the two tasks). Voxels of the pmDMN were defined by the overlapping negative task response between CMRGlu and BOLD changes of DS1. The extracted values were then entered into a regression analysis to characterize the CMRGlu response in the pmDMN. To assess the robustness of our results and allow for generalization, two control analyses were performed. First, the overlap of task responses across imaging modalities at the group-level was also computed by a formal conjunction analysis in SPM12 for the Tetris and working memory tasks. That is, for each task the individual maps of CMRGlu and BOLD response were z-scored and entered in a one-way ANOVA with each modality representing a ‘group’. The separate contrasts for each of the modalities were then combined in a conjunction (p &lt; 0.05 FWE corrected cluster level following p &lt; 0.001 uncorrected voxel level). Second, the regression was also calculated when extracting CMRGlu values from the entire visual, dorsal attention and fronto-parietal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), i.e., independent of regionally specific prior knowledge on positive task responses.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the directionality of the association between DMN and task-positive networks in DS1. Individual MCM values were entered in a paired t-test to assess differences between directions, for example, DAN-&gt;DMN vs. DMN-&gt;DAN.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>declares to having received speaker honoraria from the GE Healthcare and research grants from Ipsen Pharma, Eckert-Ziegler AG, Scintomics, and ITG; and working as a part time employee of CBmed Ltd.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan Smallwood (Reviewer #2); Tommaso Volpi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Claims must be tempered to reflect the data. The authors should clearly separate speculation from a conclusion based on the measurements that they made. For example, they measured BOLD/CMRglc and yet they conclude on a GABA mechanism.</p><p>2) The distinction between the broader questions, and what the data says, should be made explicit throughout.</p><p>3) More details need to be given for the methods so that readers do not have to locate previous papers to understand what was done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Please clarify what you mean by &quot;We suggest that the former is mediated by decreased glutamate signaling, while the latter results from active GABAergic inhibition&quot; in the Abstract, as it is not clearly evident what is former and latter here.</p><p>2. Explain with full clarity and disclosure how the two studies (Tetris and the published working memory, visual and motor stimulations) were different in terms of data acquisition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really enjoyed your study and think it is a great piece of work. I wonder whether there is a boundary condition that could be made more explicit. It may be that the landscape of activity is both context-dependent and symmetrical. It is possible therefore that an analysis of tasks in which the DMN increases activity will lead to a suppression of activity in systems like the DAN. It would be quite easy to modify the language you use to make this clear and to make this a goal for the future (you do mention autobiographical memory in the discussion so could make this point there).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) When the authors in the introduction directly talk about &quot;Studies using simultaneous fPET/fMRI&quot; (line 94), I believe fPET and its peculiarities with respect to traditional bolus injection PET, which is the base of most quantitative PET literature, require to be briefly defined since it is not a given that the audience would know this technique.</p><p>2) Could the authors elaborate on the negative activations shared by BOLD and [18F]FDG in Figures 2 and S1? Some seem to fall for instance in the temporal pole, i.e., in areas that are known to be prone to susceptibility artifacts in fMRI. Are activations in those areas considered to be reliable?</p><p>3) When the anti-correlation between BOLD of task-positive and task-negative networks is brought up, Fox et al. 2005 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0504136102) might not be the most appropriate reference, as the anticorrelations in that work were largely driven by global signal regression, as later shown by e.g., Murphy et al. 2009 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.09.036).</p><p>4) The application of a low-pass filter applied to the PET time-activity curves (line 477), despite being mentioned in the authors' previous publications, should be briefly justified.</p><p>5) When the Patlak plot is employed (line 486), the chosen t-star (t*) should be reported.</p><p>6) A reference for the choice of the lumped constant = 0.89 should be provided, as there are controversies over its precise value.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84683.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Claims must be tempered to reflect the data.

This indicates that two types of BOLD deactivations with different oxygen-to-glucose index may occur in this region. We further speculate that consistent downregulation of the two signals is mediated by decreased glutamate signaling, while divergence may be subject to active GABAergic inhibition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The details about the acquisition schemes of DS2 and DS3 are now also included in the methods section. The limitations already included a statement about these differences and the implications.</p><p>Limitations, page 16, line 374:</p><p>“Second, Tetris and WM data were acquired with different acquisition details and task designs, i.e., continuous task performance versus hierarchical embedding of short task blocks for BOLD into longer PET acquisition, respectively. As the latter may not clearly differentiate between start-cue and task activation, this may limit transferability. Therefore, future studies investigating these effects should address this limitation, ideally studying the different tasks in the same cohort, with a comparable task design.”</p><p>Methods, page 21, line 500:</p><p>“Data acquisition of DS2 (working memory task)</p><p>Data were obtained as described previously (Stiernman et al. 2021). Briefly, participants fasted for 4 h before the scan. Intravenous infusion of 180 MBq [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG was started simultaneously with PET/MRI acquisition (GE Signa) and lasted 60 min (0.016 ml/s). MRI scans included an attenuation correction sequence, T1-weighted structural imaging (TE/TR = 3.1/7200 ms, flip angle = 12°, matrix size = 256 x 256, 180 slices, voxel size = 0.49 x 0.49 x 1 mm, 7.36 min) and BOLD functional MRI (EPI sequence, TE/TR = 30/4000 ms, flip angle = 80°, matrix size = 96 x 96, voxel size = 1.95 x 1.95 x 3.9 mm, 42 min).</p><p>During PET/MRI acquisition participants kept their eyes open. The working memory task was completed in a hierarchical design. That is, short task blocks of 45 s and 15 s rest served for assessment of task changes in the BOLD signal. These short blocks were embedded in long 6 min blocks, which enabled identification of task effects in glucose metabolism. Participants completed 2x 6 min maintenance and 2x 6 min manipulation blocks, with 3x 6 min rest blocks in-between. In the maintenance condition, 4 target letters were shown and participants were asked if a delayed probe letter matches one of the targets. In the manipulation condition, 2 target letters were shown and participants were required to indicate if a delayed probe letter represents the subsequent letter in the alphabet of any of the targets.</p><p>PET data were reconstructed to 60x 1 min frames and analyzed with the general linear model (GLM). Since arterial blood samples were not available for DS2, β estimates from the GLM were entered into group-level statistical analysis (p&lt;0.05 TFCE corrected). The contrast of interest was manipulation vs. rest. Confirmatory kinetic modeling was performed with a literature-based arterial input function.”</p><p>Methods, page 22, line 523:</p><p>“Data acquisition of DS3 (eyes open and finger tapping tasks)</p><p>Data were obtained as described previously (Hahn et al. 2018). In short, participants fasted for at least 5.5 h before the scan. Intravenous infusion of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (3 MBq/kg body weight) was started simultaneously with PET/MRI acquisition (Siemens mMR) and lasted 95 min (36 ml/h). MRI scans included T1-weighted structural imaging (MPRAGE, TE/TR = 4.2/2000 ms, TI = 900ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix size = 256 x 240, 160 slices, voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm + 0.1 mm gap, 7.02 min) and BOLD functional MRI (EPI sequence, TE/TR = 30/2440 ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 100 x 100, 30 slices, voxel size = 2.1 x 2.1 x 3 mm + 0.75 mm gap, 5 min per task block).</p><p>During PET/MRI acquisition participants kept their eyes closed. Continuous task performance included opening the eyes for 2x 10 min and 2x 10 min tapping the right thumb to the fingers with 15 min rest blocks in-between. Arterial blood samples were obtained during the rest periods.</p><p>PET data were reconstructed to 95x 1 min frames and analyzed with the GLM. Quantification of CMRGlu was carried out with the arterial input function and the Patlak plot. CMRGlu maps were entered into group-level statistical analysis (p&lt;0.05 FWE corrected cluster-level after p&lt;0.001 uncorrected voxel level).

Whether these effects are symmetrical would certainly be an interesting question. We have included further references that point to this hypothesis as well and added the following paragraph.</p><p>Limitations, outlook and conclusion, page 17, line 385:</p><p>“Of particular interest would be the investigation of introspective tasks such as autobiographical memory as these typically induce a positive BOLD response in the PCC, while the coupling with the CMRGlu response is unknown. Such paradigms would also allow to assess whether the presently observed network interactions are symmetrical, i.e., if task positive networks show decreased activation when the DMN exhibits a positive response. This hypothesis seems reasonable in the light of recent work reporting bidirectional information exchange between default mode and other networks (Das et al., 2022; Menon et al., 2023).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) When the authors in the introduction directly talk about &quot;Studies using simultaneous fPET/fMRI&quot; (line 94), I believe fPET and its peculiarities with respect to traditional bolus injection PET, which is the base of most quantitative PET literature, require to be briefly defined since it is not a given that the audience would know this technique.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment, which will make the work more accessible. In the revised manuscript we have now described the method of fPET in more detail.</p><p>Introduction, page 5, line 99:</p><p>“In this context, functional PET (fPET) imaging represents a promising approach to investigate the dynamics of brain metabolism. fPET refers to the assessment of stimulation-induced changes in physiological processes such as glucose metabolism (Hahn et al., 2016; Villien et al., 2014) and neurotransmitter synthesis (Hahn et al., 2021) in a single scan. The temporal resolution of this approach of 6-30 s (Rischka et al., 2018) is considerably higher than that of a conventional bolus administration. This is achieved through the constant infusion of the radioligand, thereby providing free radioligand throughout the scan that is available to bind according to the actual task demands. Here, the term “functional” is used in analogy to fMRI, where paradigms are often presented in repeated blocks of stimulation, which can subsequently be assessed by the general linear model.”2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could the authors elaborate on the negative activations shared by BOLD and [18F]FDG in Figures 2 and S1? Some seem to fall for instance in the temporal pole, i.e., in areas that are known to be prone to susceptibility artifacts in fMRI. Are activations in those areas considered to be reliable?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this interesting point. These areas are indeed prone to susceptibility artifacts, however, this is only the case for fMRI acquisitions due to nearby air cavities. Considering that this issue is not present in fPET imaging, we believe that functional PET offers some major opportunities when investigating activation patterns in these regions. This is now included in the manuscript.</p><p>Results, page 9, line 190:</p><p>“Overlapping negative responses for both imaging modalities occurred in DMN3 (“core”) and DMN4 (“ventral”) for Tetris, but only in DMN4 for working memory (Figure 2f). Simple visual stimulation (eyes open vs. eyes closed) and right finger tapping elicited increased CMRGlu in VIN and SMN (somato-motor), respectively, and a negative response mostly in DMN3 (Figure 2). Notably, some of the regions with negative responses are particularly prone to susceptibility artifacts in fMRI. Since this issue is not present in fPET, these deactivations do not seem to be solely driven by artifacts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When the anti-correlation between BOLD of task-positive and task-negative networks is brought up, Fox et al. 2005 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0504136102) might not be the most appropriate reference, as the anticorrelations in that work were largely driven by global signal regression, as later shown by e.g., Murphy et al. 2009 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.09.036).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and agree that another reference is more suitable here. Murphy et al. 2009 found the anticorrelation to be driven by global signal regression and as a consequence, a controversial discussion on this topic emerged. In 2017, Murphy and Fox reviewed this disputed topic together. Overall, we got the impression that Buckner brought this discussion in few words well to a common point:</p><p>“…the observed between-network differences are robust. Regardless of whether the anticorrelations are interpreted mechanistically, it is still true that the network linked to external attention is less correlated with the default network than with any other network in the brain“ (Buckner et al., 2019).”</p><p>To address this important discussion in our paper, we have added the following sentence to the manuscript, and included more up-to-date references.</p><p>Introduction, page 4, line 81:</p><p>“Because of the low (or anti-) correlation in BOLD signals between task-positive and default mode networks at resting-state, it has long been assumed that an antagonism between the DMN and other large-scale networks represents a general characteristic of brain functioning (regardless if computed with or without global signal regression (Murphy et al., 2017; Buckner et al., 2019))”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The application of a low-pass filter applied to the PET time-activity curves (line 477), despite being mentioned in the authors' previous publications, should be briefly justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for using a low pass filter is to reduce artifacts in the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG signal that is sampled at a relatively high temporal resolution of 30 s to 1 min frames. More specifically, due to the long task blocks of 6 min (or even longer as in previous work) we assume that changes faster than this do not reflect task-related effects. These unspecific signal changes are therefore reduced by the low-pass filter, which acts as temporal smoothing. This is now included in the manuscript.</p><p>Methods, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose metabolism, page 23, line 557:</p><p>“Non-gray matter voxels were masked out and a low pass filter was applied, which induces temporal smoothing (cutoff frequency = 3 min). The rationale for this filter is to reduce noise in the high temporal resolution [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG signal. Since task blocks lasted 6 min (or even longer for DS3), we assume that changes faster than this do not reflect task-related effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) When the Patlak plot is employed (line 486), the chosen t-star (t*) should be reported.</p><p>6) A reference for the choice of the lumped constant = 0.89 should be provided, as there are controversies over its precise value.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these important details. After visual inspection of representative TACs the value of t* was fixed in the Patlak analysis, which is now included in the text. We also agree with the reviewer that the exact value of the lumped constant is a matter of debate. Still, we would like to emphasize that constant values only induce a scaling of CMRGlu values (see e.g., discussion in Wienhard (2002)). Since this scaling is identical for all subjects it will not affect group statistics. A reference for the lumped constant is now provided in the manuscript.</p><p>Methods, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose metabolism, page 24, line 570:</p><p>“Quantification was carried out with the Patlak plot (t* fixed to 15 min) and the influx constant K<sub>i</sub> was converted to CMRGlu as CMRGlu = K<sub>i</sub> * Glu<sub>plasma</sub> / LC * 100 with LC being the lumped constant = 0.89 (Graham et al. 2002, Wienhard 2002).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
