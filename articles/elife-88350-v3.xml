Experimental data presented here identify two independent regulatory mechanisms, transcriptional and translational, by which <italic>Ifrd1</italic> (TIS7) and its orthologue <italic>Ifrd2</italic> (SKMc15) regulate <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels. Mice deficient in both <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> (dKO) had severely reduced adipose tissue and were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Wnt signaling, a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation, was significantly upregulated in dKO mice. Elevated levels of the Wnt/β-catenin target protein Dlk1 inhibited the expression of adipogenesis regulators <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic>, and fatty acid transporter <italic>Cd36</italic>. Although both <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> contributed to this phenotype, they utilized two different mechanisms. <italic>Ifrd1</italic> acted by controlling Wnt signaling and thereby transcriptional regulation of <italic>Dlk1</italic>. On the other hand, distinctive experimental evidence showed that Ifrd2 acts as a general translational inhibitor significantly affecting Dlk1 protein levels.

These mechanisms involve protein factor regulators, epigenetic factors, and miRNAs. TPA-induced sequence 7 (TIS7) protein has been shown to be involved in the mainly transcriptional regulation of differentiation processes in various cell types, for example, neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iacopetti et al., 1996</xref>), enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vadivelu et al., 2004</xref>), and also adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence link the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling to the physiological function of <italic>Tis</italic>7, known in human as interferon-related developmental regulator 1 (<italic>Ifrd1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iezaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vietor et al., 2005</xref>). Experiments with <italic>Ifrd1</italic> knockout mice generated in our laboratory show a negative effect of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> on Wnt signaling and a positive effect on adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vietor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2010</xref>, #3955). <italic>Ifrd1</italic> deficiency leads to a significant upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity in both primary osteoblasts and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from <italic>Ifrd1</italic> knockout (KO) mice. It was shown that <italic>Ifrd1</italic> is also involved in the control of adipocytes differentiation in mice and was upregulated in both visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) of genetically obese ob/ob mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Ifrd1</italic> transgenic mice have increased total body adiposity and decreased lean mass compared with wild type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). On high-fat diet (HFD), <italic>Ifrd1</italic> transgenic mice exhibit a more rapid and proportionately greater gain in body weight with persistently elevated total body adiposity. Enhanced triglyceride (TG) absorption in the gut of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) indicated that <italic>Ifrd1</italic> expressed in the gut epithelium has direct effects on fat absorption in enterocytes. As a result of impaired intestinal lipid absorption, <italic>Ifrd1</italic> KO mice displayed lower body adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Compared with WT littermates, <italic>Ifrd1</italic> KO mice do not gain weight when chronically fed an HFD and <italic>Ifrd1</italic> deletion results in delayed lipid absorption and altered intestinal and hepatic lipid trafficking, with reduced intestinal TG, cholesterol, and free fatty acid mucosal levels in the jejunum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>). Ifrd1 protein functions as a transcriptional co-regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Micheli et al., 2005</xref>) due to its interaction with protein complexes containing either histone deacetylases (HDAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vadivelu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vietor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wick et al., 2004</xref>) or protein methyl transferases, in particular PRMT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lammirato et al., 2016</xref>). The analysis of adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytic 3T3-L1 cells suggested an involvement of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> in the regulation of adipogenesis in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>SKMc15, also known as interferon-related developmental regulator 2 (<italic>Ifrd2</italic>), a second member of the <italic>Ifrd</italic> gene family, is highly conserved in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Latif et al., 1997</xref>). Mouse <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> are homologous, with a remarkable identity at both the cDNA and amino acid levels (58 and 88%, respectively). However, there was so far no information about the physiological function and mechanisms of action of Ifrd2 protein and its possible involvement in differentiation of various tissues. Recently, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses of inactive ribosomes identified Ifrd2 as a novel ribosome-binding protein inhibiting translation to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). The physiological function of Ifrd2 matching the mechanism based on the abovementioned cryo-EM data was so far not shown. Ifrd2 could be involved in adipogenesis since a significant reduction of whole protein synthesis was previously shown as a major regulatory event during early adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Adipogenesis occurs late in embryonic development and in postnatal periods. Adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (<italic>Cebpa</italic>) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (<italic>Pparg</italic>) play critical roles in adipogenesis and in the induction of adipocyte markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farmer, 2006</xref>). <italic>Pparg</italic> is the major downstream target of Delta-like protein 1 (Dlk1). It is inactivated by the induction of the MEK/ERK pathway, leading to its phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Sul, 2009</xref>).

Pparg and Wnt/β-catenin pathways are regarded as master mediators of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Wnt signaling is a progenitor fate determinator and negatively regulates preadipocyte proliferation through Dlk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mortensen et al., 2012</xref>).

PRMT5 acts as a co-activator of adipogenic gene expression and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LeBlanc et al., 2012</xref>). SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (Sox9), a transcription factor expressed in preadipocytes, is downregulated preceding adipocyte differentiation. Dlk1 prevents downregulation of Sox9 by activating ERK, resulting in inhibition of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sul, 2009</xref>). The PRMT5- and histone-associated protein Coprs affects PRMT5 functions related to cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paul et al., 2012</xref>).

Two independent molecular mechanisms through which <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> fulfill this function were found. The fact that these two genes use independent mechanisms of action supported by the observation that whole-body deficiency of both genes led to a stronger phenotype when compared to single knockouts of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> or <italic>Ifrd2. Ifrd1</italic> regulates the Wnt signaling pathway activity and restricts Dlk1 protein levels, thereby allowing adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, <italic>Ifrd2</italic> KO did not affect Wnt signaling, but as we show here, cells lacking <italic>Ifrd2</italic> have significantly upregulated translational activity. In addition, strongly enriched <italic>Dlk1</italic> mRNA concentrations were identified specifically in polyribosomes isolated from <italic>Ifrd2</italic> knockout MEFs when compared to the WT MEFs. This was true also for dKO, but not for the single <italic>Ifrd1</italic> knockout cells. The ablation of both <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> genes significantly affected the expression of genes essential for adipocyte differentiation and function.

It was previously shown that elevated levels of the cleaved ectodomain of <italic>Dlk1</italic> have been correlated with reduced expression of <italic>Pparg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, the differences in <italic>Pparg</italic> expression between WT and dKO inguinal SVF cells were analyzed. While <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> mRNA levels were strongly induced in undifferentiated WT, these were barely detectable in dKO SVF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Similarly, significantly decreased <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>Ifrd1</italic>, <italic>Ifrd2,</italic> and dKO inguinal SVF cells following 8-day adipocyte differentiation protocol were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p><p>Earlier chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that Ifrd1 binds directly to DNA and via interaction with PRMT5 regulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lammirato et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, ChIP experiments were performed to study binding of Ifrd1 and Ifrd2 proteins, transcription factor β-catenin, and symmetrically dimethylated histone H4 at arginine residue 3 (H4R3me2s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paul et al., 2015</xref>) to regulatory elements of the <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene. dKO MEFs treated 8 d with the adipocyte differentiation cocktail were increased β-catenin binding to the β-catenin/TCF binding site 2 of the <italic>Dlk1</italic> regulatory element found when compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). On the other hand, binding of H4R3me2s to the same <italic>Dlk1</italic> regulatory element was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001). No direct binding of Irfd1 or Ifrd2 proteins to two different <italic>Dlk1</italic> regulatory elements (<italic>Dlk1</italic> region A and β-cat/TCFbs2), neither in WT nor in dKO MEFs, could be identified, suggesting rather an epigenetic regulation than via their direct binding to <italic>Dlk1</italic> regulatory elements. These results suggested that proteins Ifrd1 and Ifrd2 are required to restrain the <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and yet another so far unknown mechanism.</p><p>After finding significantly increased Dlk1 protein levels in inguinal WAT of SKMc15 single knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression in MEFs generated from these mice was measured. These were significantly increased (&gt;70-fold) when compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In a search for a Ifrd2-specific regulatory mechanism of <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels, primarily the translational regulation was studied. It was previously shown that general reduction of protein synthesis and downregulation of the expression and translational efficiency of ribosomal proteins are events crucial for the regulation of adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcon et al., 2017</xref>). Initially, specifically polyribosome-bound <italic>Dlk1</italic> RNA in <italic>Ifrd2</italic> knockout MEFs was measured. This analysis detected significantly (p&lt;8.26104 E-07) higher <italic>Dlk1</italic> mRNA levels in polyribosome RNA fraction of <italic>Ifrd2</italic> KO when compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Ifrd2</italic> was recently identified as a novel specific factor capable of translationally inactivating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). Because <italic>Ifrd2</italic> may play a crucial role in the adipogenesis regulation in the following experiment, the effect of <italic>Ifrd2</italic> knockout on the general translational efficiency of WT, <italic>Ifrd1</italic>, <italic>Ifrd2</italic> single and double KO MEFs was tested. Cells were incubated 30 min in the absence of methionine and cysteine, followed by 1 hr in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, there was a significant increase in the general translational activity of MEFs lacking <italic>Ifrd2</italic> alone or both <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic>, but not in TIS7 single knockout cells. These data suggested that <italic>Ifrd2</italic> alone, but not <italic>Ifrd1,</italic> inhibits the general translational activity necessary for the induction of adipogenic differentiation, also via the translational regulation of <italic>Dlk1</italic>.

Hence, adding soluble Dlk1 to the medium inhibits adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garcés et al., 1999</xref>). To test whether the dKO MEFs secreted Dlk1, cell culture media from MEFs treated 8 d with the adipocyte differentiation cocktail were collected and analyzed by western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, dKO cells secreted Dlk1 protein, but in an identical volume of the cell culture medium from WT MEFs no Dlk1 could be detected.

As <italic>DLK1</italic> was strongly upregulated in dKO SVF cells during adipocyte differentiation, the possible activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in gonadal WAT samples of WT and dKO mice was analyzed subsequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The phosphorylation of p44 and p42 was upregulated 1.8-fold (p&lt;0.001) in the dKO when compared to the WT G WAT samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Next, the question of expression levels of <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> in WAT depots was addressed. Both adipocyte differentiation regulators <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa’</italic>s mRNA expression levels were in gonadal WAT samples isolated from dKO mice significantly (p&lt;0.01) downregulated when compared to the values of WT control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Furthermore, the possible effect of <italic>Ifrd1</italic>, <italic>Ifrd2</italic> and their combined knockout on the <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) was analyzed. Western blot analysis identified a significant (p&lt;0.001) increase in Dlk1 protein levels in BAT samples in knockout mice of all three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The MEK/ERK pathway was similarly as in gonadal WAT, upregulated also in MEFs generated from dKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The phosphorylation of p42 and of p44 was upregulated 3-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively (p&lt;0.01), in the adipocyte-differentiated dKO when compared to the WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Previously, activation of MEK/ERK by <italic>Dlk1</italic> was shown to upregulate the expression of the transcription factor <italic>Sox9</italic>, resulting in the inhibition of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sul, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we measured <italic>Sox9</italic> mRNA expression by RT qPCR in 8-day adipocyte-differentiated MEFs. <italic>Sox9</italic> expression was significantly (p&lt;0.001) upregulated in 8-day adipocyte-differentiated dKO when compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> mRNA levels were both continuously upregulated during the 8-day differentiation protocol of WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). On the contrary, no significant increase in <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> mRNA levels was found in dKO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). A rescue experiment showed that only the co-expression of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> strongly increased the expression of the <italic>Pparg</italic> in undifferentiated dKO MEFs (p&lt;0.001), almost up to the levels of WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Because of downregulated <italic>Pparg</italic> levels in adipose tissues of dKO mice, the regulation of <italic>Cd36</italic> was studied more in detail as well. In inguinal WAT from dKO mice were found strongly reduced <italic>Cd36</italic> mRNA expression levels (64% of the WT values) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Next, we analyzed <italic>Cd36</italic> in WT and dKO MEFs before onset and during adipocyte differentiation. As long as <italic>Cd36</italic> mRNA expression substantially increased in WT MEFs, there were almost undetectable transcript levels of <italic>Cd36</italic> in dKO cells treated with the adipocyte differentiation cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1), a protein associated with the enterocytic TG absorption and intracellular lipid processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nozaki et al., 1999</xref>), is besides Cd36 another target gene of adipogenesis master regulator <italic>Pparg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koliwad et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Dgat1</italic> mRNA levels are strongly upregulated during adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cases et al., 1998</xref>), its promoter region contains a Pparg binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwig et al., 2002</xref>), and <italic>Dgat1</italic> is also negatively regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Dgat1</italic> expression was shown to be increased in <italic>Ifrd1</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and its expression was decreased in the gut of HFD-fed <italic>Ifrd1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).

Two parallel mechanisms were identified, leading to a deficiency in adipocyte differentiation. Firstly, <italic>Ifrd1</italic>-regulated Wnt signaling affected <italic>Dlk1</italic> transcription, and secondly, experimental evidence proved that Ifrd2 acted as a translational inhibitor that controls Dlk1 protein levels, thereby contributing to the regulation of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>dKO mice were phenotypically similar to both <italic>Cd36</italic>-deficient and <italic>Dlk1</italic> transgenic mice, namely in decreased amounts of WAT and resistance to HFD-induced obesity. Previous studies showed that overexpression of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> caused increased intestinal lipid transport, resulting in elevated body weight gain during HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Knockout of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> impaired absorption of free fatty acids from the lumen into enterocytes and reduced rate of fat absorption from intestines into the circulation. Simultaneously, higher concentrations of free fatty acids in the feces of dKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) suggested that mice lacking <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> suffer from an intestinal lipid uptake deficiency, yet another contributing reason for the lean phenotype of these mice. In dKO mice, <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> levels were inhibited, induced MEK/ERK pathway, and decreased expression of <italic>Cd36</italic> and <italic>Dgat1</italic>, all hallmarks of upregulated <italic>Dlk1</italic>, a known adipogenesis inhibitor. <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> acted after the commitment to the preadipocyte stage since the elevated <italic>Dlk1</italic> and β-catenin levels found in WAT of dKO mice were characteristic of the preadipocyte stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gautam et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Disruption of Wnt signaling in embryonic fibroblasts results in spontaneous adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2003</xref>), and in contrast, stabilized β-catenin keeps cells in the preadipocyte stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ross et al., 2000</xref>). A subpopulation of the SVF of adipose tissue is adipogenic and at the same time has a weaker Wnt/β-catenin signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this knowledge, upregulated β-catenin protein levels and increased Wnt signaling activity in WAT of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> single and dKO MEFs were found. It has to be mentioned that the data presented here differ from those published by Nakamura et al., who showed that following the <italic>Ifrd1</italic> overexpression in adipocytes Wnt/β-catenin signaling was upregulated and inhibited oil red O staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>). However, one has to take into consideration the difference in cell systems used in these two studies. In contrast to Nakamura’s study where results were obtained in 3T3-L1 cells fibroblasts overexpressing <italic>Ifrd1</italic>, the data presented here document the role of endogenous <italic>Ifrd1</italic> in cells derived from WT or knockout mice. Moreover, <italic>Ifrd1</italic> was found to be ubiquitously expressed in all WT mouse organs without any pretreatment such as hypoxia. On the other hand, Nakamura et al. identified upregulated <italic>Ifrd1</italic> expression levels in WAT of obesity model mice. This result, however, fully supports the findings of lean phenotype in <italic>Ifrd1</italic> and <italic>Ifrd2</italic> dKO mice.</p><p>In dKO MEFs, induced for adipocyte differentiation, the increase in Wnt signaling led to upregulated binding of β-catenin to the <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene regulatory elements, resulting in sustained <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression. In adipogenesis, <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression is downregulated through histone methylation by Coprs and PRMT5 proteins that prevent β-catenin binding to the <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paul et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, in dKO MEFs weaker binding of dimethylated H4R3 to the <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene was found, consistent with the previous findings on the negative role of <italic>Ifrd1</italic> in epigenetic regulation of gene expression including the PRMT5 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lammirato et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The difference in the effects of ectopic expression of <italic>Ifrd1</italic>, <italic>Ifrd2</italic> and their co-expression on <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) confirmed the hypothesis that proteins Ifrd1 and Ifrd2 regulate <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels via two independent pathways/mechanisms. Despite the fact that <italic>Ifrd2</italic> knockout had no effect on Wnt signaling, it nevertheless affected <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels, suggesting a contribution of Ifrd2. Since protein Ifrd2 was identified as a novel factor translationally inactivating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2018</xref>), downregulation of the protein synthesis machinery is an essential regulatory event during early adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcon et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, there was a possibility that Ifrd2 regulates Dlk1 protein levels through translational regulation. The experimental data presented here confirmed specific regulation of <italic>Dlk1</italic> through this mechanism. Elevated <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels in dKO MEFs activated the MEK/ERK pathway, thereby decreasing <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> levels important for adipogenic differentiation. Besides, the expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Hes1</italic> was upregulated, suggesting that the dKO MEFs keep their proliferative state and cannot enter differentiation into mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Downregulation of <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> implied changes in the expression of downstream adipogenesis-related genes. Among them, decreased <italic>Cd36</italic> and <italic>Dgat1</italic> levels were a plausible explanation of the dKO mice lean phenotype since it is known that both proteins play a functional role in the differentiation of murine adipocytes and their deficiency impairs fat pad formation independent of lipid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christiaens et al., 2012</xref>). The results presented here implicate that Ifrd1 and Ifrd2 play a up to now unknown role in the regulation of Cd36 and therefore possibly contribute to Cd36-related pathogenesis of human metabolic diseases, such as hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagasaka et al., 2011</xref>), hypertriglyceridemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kashiwagi et al., 2001</xref>), and disordered fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glazier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that due to the reduced <italic>Cd36</italic> expression levels in intestines, <italic>Ifrd1 Ifrd2</italic> dKO mice accumulated lower amounts of body fat and were resistant to diet-induced obesity also because of limited intestinal fat uptake.

Two molecules, TIS7 and SKMc15, are shown to regulate the activity of the key transcriptional regulator DLK-1 via discrete mechanisms – one involving transcription and the other translation. These findings add additional information to the well known roles of Wnt/catenin and PPARg on adipocyte differentiation.</p><p>The authors have extensively addressed the comments of the referees and all referees are convinced that the manuscript is now improved and the mechanistic details of the link between SKMc15 and regulation of adipogenesis is now strengthened. However, as described below there are still some important issues that need to be addressed by the authors prior to publication.

They generate SKMc15 KO mice and cross them to previously published TIS7 KO mice. All 3 mutant strains show decreased fat mass, with the effect being most pronounced in double KO mice (dKO). Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mutant mice, they authors ascribe a defect in adipogenic differentiation of mutant cells to an upregulation of DLK-1. In the case of TIS7, they propose that this is due to its known inhibition of Wnt signaling, which regulates DLK-1 expression. In the case of SKMc15, they suggest a new mechanism linked to its ability to suppress translation. Overall, the work is of interest, with the finding, that SKMc15 regulates adipocyte differentiation being its novelty, and generally well done, though multiple aspects need to be improved to bolster the conclusions put forth.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The main mechanism put forth by the authors to explain the inability of dKO cells to differentiate into adipocytes is the upregulation of DLK-1 levels. However, this notion is never directly tested. Authors should test if knockdown of DLK-1 in dKO cells is sufficient to correct the defect in differentiation, or if additional factors are involved.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s concerns, we have generated two stable cell lines expressing short hairpin RNAs directed against DLK1 in the TIS7 SKMc15 dKO MEFs. With these two and the parental dKO MEF cell line, we have performed adipogenesis differentiation experiments as explained in the manuscript before. Figure EV2C (left and right panels) shows that knockdown of DLK1 with two different DLK1 shRNA constructs (targeting DLK1 with or without the extracellular cleavage site) significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased the adipocyte differentiation ability of dKO MEFs. This result indicated that DLK1 knockdown alone was sufficient to correct the differentiation deficit of these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are multiple instances were the authors refer to &quot;data not shown&quot;, such as when discussing the body length of dKO mice.

An explanation could be altered lipid absorption. The authors indicate that feces were collected. An analysis of fat content in feces (NEFAs, TG) needs to be performed to examine this possibility. The discussion alludes to it, but no data is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point that prompted us to present data clarifying this aspect of the metabolic phenotype of dKO mice. As shown in Figures 6A,B, while fed with HFD, dKO mice had higher concentrations of free fatty acids in the feces (109 ± 10.4 µmol/g) when compared to the WT animals (78 ± 6.5 µmol/g) and a consequent increase in feces energy content (WT: 14.442 ± 0.433 kJ/g dry mass compared to dKO: 15.497 ± 0.482 kJ/g dry mass). Thus, lack of TIS7 and SKMc15 reduced efficient free fatty acid uptake in the intestines of mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be important to know if increased MEK/ERK signaling and SOX9 expression are seen in fat pads of mutant mice, not just on the MEF system. Similarly, what are the expression levels of PPARg and C/EBPa in WAT depots of mutant mice?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now performed the MEK/ERK activity measurement for the revised version of the manuscript in gonadal WAT tissue (GWAT). As noted in samples from several mice, there was an increase in p42 and p44 MAPK phosphorylation in G WAT isolated from dKO mice compared with the G WAT from WT control mice (Figure 4G).</p><p>The mRNA expression levels of PPARg and C/EBPa were significantly downregulated in GWAT samples isolated from dKO mice compared with levels from WT control animals (Figure 4H).

Novel data gained in this cell system fully confirmed our previous observations in MEFs. Therefore, in the current version of the manuscript we have replaced figures describing the effects of lacking TIS7 and SKMc15 in MEFs by adipose tissues samples (Figures 2D,E, 4G,H,I and 6C) or SVF cells from inguinal WAT (Figures 2A,B,F,G,H, 3C,D,E and F).

The only truly novel finding in this work is the observation that SKMc15 also plays a role in adipogenesis.

However, they need to be bolstered by additional data.</p><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I think we are all in agreement that the findings in this work are of interest, but that significant additional work is required to discern the mechanisms involved. In my view, a direct and specific link between SKMc15 and translation of DLK-1 needs to be established and its significance for adipogenesis in cells derived from the SVF of fat pads determined. Reviewer 2 has suggested some concrete ways to provide evidence of a direct link.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment and have also noted that this point will be crucial in assessing the novelty value of our manuscript, as was also expressed in the referees cross-commenting. Therefore, we have now additionally performed a polysomal RNA analysis, which has of course been included in the current version of the manuscript.</p><p>We analyzed the differences in DLK-1 translation between wild-type control cells and SKMc15 knockout cells in the gradient-purified ribosomal fractions by DLK-1 qPCR. Our analysis identified significantly (p&lt;8,26104E-07) higher DLK-1 mRNA levels in polysomal RNA fraction of SKMc15 KO when compared to wild type MEFs (Figure 3I).</p><p>Similarly, as proposed by the reviewer, we have established stromal vascular fraction cell cultures from inguinal fat pads. In SVF cells of TIS7 and SKMc15 single and double knockout mice, we found increased DLK1 mRNA and protein levels (Figures 2F,G and H) as well as decreased PPARg and C/EBPa levels (Figures 3C,D,E and F). Specifically, we found that the ability of knockout SVF cells to differentiate into adipocytes was significantly downregulated (Figures 2A and B), fully confirming our original findings in TIS7 and SKMc15 knockout MEFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the current study, Vietor et al. aimed to explore the regulation of Δ-like homolog 1 (DLK-1), an inhibitor of adipogenesis, and demonstrated a role for TIS7 and its orthologue SKMc15 in the regulation of adipogenesis by controlling the level of DLK-1. Using mouse models with whole body deficiency of TIS7 (TIS7 KO) or SKMc15 (SKMc15KO) and double KO (TIS7 and SKMc15 dKO) mice, the authors used a combination of in-vivo experiments and cell culture experiments with mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from the KO animals, to show that the concurrent depletion of TIS7 and SKMc15 dramatically reduced the amount of adipose tissues and protected against diet-induced obesity in mice, which was associated with defective adipogenesis in vitro.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>Overall, this study presents convincing evidence that TIOS7 and SKMc15 are necessary for optimal adipogenesis, and proposes a novel mechanism for the control of DLK1 abundance via coordinated regulation of DLK-1 transcription and translation. However, a number of questions remain largely unanswered. In particular, the direct ability of SKMc15 to regulate the translation of DLK-1 is lacking, and this claim remains speculative. SKMc15 being a general inhibitor of translation, SKMc15 may have an effect on adipogenesis independently of its regulation of DLK-1. Thus, addressing the following comments would further improve the quality of the manuscript:</p></disp-quote><p>We have been very attentive to these comments to improve the novelty and quality of our manuscript and have tried to address them experimentally. Therefore, this thorough revision of our manuscript took a longer time. First, we identified polysomal enrichment of DLK-1 RNA in SKMc15 KO MEFs, demonstrating that SKMc15 translationally affects DLK-1 levels (Figure 3I). Second, treatment with a recombinant DLK-1 protein as well as its ectopic expression quite clearly blocked adipocyte differentiation of WT MEFs (Figures EV3B,C). In addition, two different shRNA constructs targeting DLK-1 significantly induced adipocyte differentiation of TIS7 SKMc15 dKO MEFs (Figure EV2C, left and right panels). We believe that these results, taken together, sufficiently support our proposed mechanism, namely that TIS7 and SKMc15 control adipocyte differentiation through DLK-1 regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experimental evidence supporting that SKMc15 controls DLK-1 protein levels comes primarily from the observations that DLK-1 abundance is further increased in SKMc15 KO and dKO WAT than in TIS7KO WAT (Figure 3d), and that translation is generally increased in SKMc15 KO and dKO cells (Figure 5a). However, since the rescue experiment is performed in dKO cells, by restoring both TIS7 and SKMc15 together, it is impossible to disentangle the effects on DLK-1 transcription, DLK-1 translation and on adipogenesis. A more detailed description of the TIS7 and SKM15c single KO cells, with or without re-expression of TIS7 and SKMc15 individually, at the level of DLK-1 mRNA expression and DLK-1 protein abundance would be necessary. In addition, polyribosome fractioning followed by qPCR for DLK-1 in each fraction, and by comparison with DLK-1 global expression in control and SKMc15 KO cells, would reveal the efficiency of translation for DLK-1 specifically, and directly prove a translational control of DLK-1 by SKMc15. Alternatively, showing that DLK-1 is among the proteins newly translated in SKMc15 KO cells (Figure 5a) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we used single TIS7 and SKMc15 knockout cells and demonstrated that both, TIS7 and SKMc15, affect Dlk-1 mRNA levels. We identified a highly significant effect on total DLK-1 mRNA levels in SKMc15 knockout MEFs as presented in Figure 3H. We also show that DLK-1 mRNA is specifically enriched in polysomal fractions obtained from proliferating SKMc15 knockout MEFs when compared to WT MEFs. However, the strong accumulation of DLK-1 mRNA in polysomes cannot be explained by transcriptional upregulation of DLK-1 alone, suggesting that regulation also occurs at the translational level. We took up this suggestion and ectopically expressed TIS7 and SKMc15 separately or together. For this purpose, we used not only MEF cell lines with double knockout but also with single knockout. Our recent data showed that stable ectopic expression of SKMc15 significantly increased adipocyte differentiation in both, single and double TIS7 and SKMc15 knockout MEF cell lines (Figures EV1C,D and EV2A). Ectopic expression of TIS7 significantly induced the adipocyte differentiation in TIS7 single knockout MEFs (Figure EV1C). In addition, both genes down regulated DLK-1 mRNA expression in dKO MEFs (Figure EV2A, bar chart on the right). We fully agree with the opinion of both reviewers and as already explained above we identified by qPCR in the polysomes that SKMc15 directly regulates DLK-1 translation (Figure 3I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the scope of the study focuses on the molecular control of adipogenesis by TIS7 and SKMc15 via the regulation of DLK-1, basic elements of the metabolic characterization of the KO animals providing the basis for this study would be useful. Since the difference in body weight between WT and dKO animals is already apparent 1 week after birth (Figure 1a), it would be interesting to determine whether the fat mass is decreased at an earlier age than 6 months (Figure 1b). The dKO mice are leaner despite identical food intake, activity and RER (Sup Figure 1). It remains unclear whether defective fat mass expansion is a result or consequence of this phenotype. Is the excess energy stored ectopically? The authors mention defective lipid absorption, however, these data are not presented in the manuscript. It would be interesting to investigate the relative contribution of calorie intake and adipose lipid storage capacity in the resistance to diet-induced obesity. In addition, data reported in Figure 1c seem to indicate a preferential defect in visceral fat development, as compared to subcutaneous fat. It would be relevant if the authors could quantify it and comment on it. Are TIS7 and SKMc15 differentially expressed in various adipose depots? The authors used embryonic fibroblasts as a paradigm to study adipogenesis. It would be important to investigate, especially in light of the former comment, whether pre-adipocytes from subcutaneous and visceral stroma-vascular fractions present similar defects in adipogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the issue of lipid storage capacity raised by the reviewer using two experimental methods. First, we have analyzed feces of mice fed with high fat diet. The free fatty acids content in dKO mice feces was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than in that of their WT siblings (Figure 6A). Second, the energy content of dried feces from dKO mice, as determined by bomb calorimetry, was significantly higher than that from WT mice (P&lt;0.001) (Figure 6B).</p><p>Concerning the question of younger animals, we have repeated microCT fat measurements on a group of 1-2 months old WT and dKO male mice (n=4 per group).

However, we have sought to address the reviewer's concerns and have now also examined DLK-1 mRNA levels in proliferating SKMc15 knockout MEFs (Figure 3H). In addition to this experiment, we measured DLK-1 mRNA levels also during the process of adipocyte differentiation of single knockout cells. In WT MEFs we observed a transient increase of DLK-1 mRNA only on day 1. In contrast, significantly elevated DLK-1 mRNA levels were found in TIS7 single-knockout MEFs throughout the differentiation process, with the highest level reached at day 8. Interestingly, in SKMc15 single knockout MEFs we found an upregulation of DLK-1 mRNA level in proliferating cells but not a further increase during the differentiation. This supported our idea that SKMc15 acts mainly via translational regulation of DLK-1.

The study takes advantage of number of different methods and approaches and combines both in vivo and in vitro work. However, some more detailed analysis and clarifications would be needed to fully justify some of the statements. Including the role of TIS7 as a transcriptional regulator of DLK1, SKMc15 as translational regulator of DLK1 and overall contribution of DLK1 in the observed differentiation defects. The observed results could still be explained by many indirect effects caused by the knock-outs and more direct functional connections between the studied molecules would be needed.

Since the manufacturer couldn’t supply information on biological activities of recombinant DLK-1 proteins, we analyzed in vivo the effects of two different ones, namely RPL437Mu01 and RPL437Mu02. The 8-day adipocyte differentiation protocol showed that the RPL437Mu02 protein was cytotoxic to WT MEF cells and therefore could not be used for analysis. On the other hand, treatment with the Mu01 recombinant DLK-1 protein did not result in a substantial cell death. According to oil red O staining, incubation with 3.3 mg/ml (final concentration) RPL437Mu01 led to 75% inhibition of adipocyte differentiation when compared to not treated WT MEFs (Figure EV3B and C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are the data and the methods presented in such a way that they can be reproduced?

Regarding the possible cell death, the cells stained with Oil Red O were adherent and alive. The adipocyte differentiation protocol consists of 3 days proliferation and further 5 days of differentiation including three changes of media during which dead cells are washed away and their vitality cannot be checked. However, in the meantime, we have repeated this protocol and the density of SKMc15 knockout MEFs was now not substantially lower than those of controls. Despite the comparable cell density, we have seen a substantial negative effect of the SKMc15 knockout on the adipogenic differentiation ability of these cells.

Similarly, as in response to Reviewer #2 and as already mentioned above, in response to “major comments” of Reviewer #3, in our novel experiments we found that treatment with recombinant DLK-1 protein as well as ectopic expression of DLK-1 blocked adipocyte differentiation of WT MEFs (Figures EV3B,C,D and E) as well as medium from dKO shDLK-1 391 cells (Figure EV3F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Figure 5C: The details and the timeline of the experiment with conditioned media are not provided in the figure or in the methods.

In general, the treatment for adipocyte differentiation was identical with the previous experiments. The only difference was that after three days in proliferation medium, we used either fresh differentiation medium or 2-day-old differentiation medium from dKO control or dKO-shDLK-1 391 cell cultures then for wild-type cells, as shown in the figure (Figure EV3F). Cells were incubated additional five days with the differentiation medium with two changes of media, every second day.

The importance of their induction in undifferentiated MEFs is a little difficult to judge.</p></disp-quote><p>We have focused our attention primarily on the ability of TIS7 and SKMc15 to “rescue” the adipocyte differentiation phenotype of dKO MEFs. dKO MEFs stably expressing SKMc15, TIS7 or both genes were differentiated into adipocytes for 8 days and afterwards stained with oil red O. There was a statistically significant increase in oil red O staining following the individual ectopic expression of SKMc15 (p=5.7E-03), a negative effect of TIS7 ectopic expression and a significant (p=9.3E-03), positive effect of co-expression of both genes (Figure EV2A). We found a significant decrease in Dlk-1 mRNA expression following the ectopic expression of TIS7 and/or SKMc15 (Figure EV2A, very right panel). However, C/EBPa mRNA levels were only partially rescued in 8 days differentiated MEFs by TIS7 and/or SKMc15 ectopic expression, and PPARg mRNA levels were not significantly altered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Fig8: it is not surprising that PPARg targets are not induced in the absence of PPARg. What is the upstream event explaining this defect? Is DLK1 alone enough to explain the results? Could there be additional mediators of the differences?

Although we showed that in undifferentiated MEFs, the levels of PPARg and C/EBPa are controlled (or upregulated) by both TIS7 and SKMc15, we also expected differences in the expression of genes regulating fat uptake. To determine changes in expression of lipid processing and transporting molecules, we performed transcriptome analyses of total RNA samples isolated from the small intestines of HFD-fed WT type and dKO animals. Cluster analyses of lipid transport-related gene transcripts revealed differences between WT type and dKO animals in the expression of adipogenesis regulators.

Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a protein associated with the enterocytic triglyceride absorption and intracellular lipid processing is besides CD36 another target gene of adipogenesis master regulator PPARγ [11]. DGAT1 mRNA levels are strongly up regulated during adipocyte differentiation [12], its promoter region contains a PPARγ binding site and DGAT1 is also negatively regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway. DGAT1 expression was shown to be increased in TIS7 transgenic mice [13] and its expression was decreased in the gut of high fat diet-fed TIS7 KO mice [14]. Importantly, DGAT1 expression in adipocytes and WAT is up regulated by PPARγ activation [11].</p><fig id="sa2fig13" position="float"><label>Author response image 13.</label><caption><title>Heatmap of hierarchical cluster analysis of intestinal gene expression involved in lipid transport altered in TIS7 SKMc15 dKO mice fed a high-fat diet for 3 weeks.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88350-sa2-fig13-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the upstream event explaining this defect?</p></disp-quote><p>Wnt pathway causes epigenetic repression of the master adipogenic gene PPARγ.

The over-expression levels were 14.7-fold for TIS7 and 10.91-fold for SKMc15, respectively in comparison to the endogenous levels of these proteins in wild type MEF cells. Images shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2I and J originate from the same membrane, just lanes with unrelated samples are here not shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is the levels of blood lipids in the dKO mice, since this is the first report of their existence, and presumably the defect in intestinal lipid absorption may affect these?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to answer this question we have now measured cholesterol, triglycerides levels, and the lipoprotein profile in four wild type and four TIS7 SKMc15 dKO, 7 months old, male mice. None of these three analyses identified any statistically significant difference between wild type and dKO mice. Results of these measurements are presented in the Figure 1 —figure supplement 2K, L, and M and explained in the legend, lanes 798-806.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The methods need to be carefully edited. For instance, lines 564-65 state &quot;Small intestines were harvested for oil red O staining to detect lipid accumulation&quot;; these data are not shown anywhere in the paper. Similarly, the section on fecal fat determination describes a protocol to analyze neutral sterols and bile acids (nowhere in the paper), but it does not describe how the free fatty acid levels were determined. One more example, line 651 alludes to &quot;pulse labeling of mitochondrial proteins&quot; which is not what is presented in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for the careful reading of our manuscript. We corrected all mentioned inaccuracies in the Methods section and completely replaced a paragraph describing the analysis of fatty acids. The new version is now explained in lines 554-558. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride analyses are described in lines 562-565.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The main text should indicate at the outset that only male mice were analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Results section, line 154-155 and in the Material and methods section, lines 496-497 we explicitly note that: “In order to achieve maximal homogeneity of experimental groups, in all experiments presented here we used only male mice”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is incorrect to state that the dKO mice are not smaller when the graph showing that data (panel A in Figure EV1) shows a significant difference.</p></disp-quote><p>This information was corrected, see lines 162-164.</p></body></sub-article></article>
