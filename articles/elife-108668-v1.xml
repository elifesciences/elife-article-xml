In the following, we would like to explain the circumstances that led to this duplication.</p><p>As part of our project, we performed flow cytometric analysis to determine cell surface vimentin (CSV) on human chondrocytes from several donors and later compared the data to the outcome of a chondrogenic differentiation in pellet culture, which was assessed by Safranin-O staining. The image in question shows a Safranin-O staining that indeed represents the outcome of chondrogenesis of the same donor, which was also used for flow cytometric analysis. Since the donor-matched data were not consolidated until several months later, it did not become apparent to us that this particular donor had also been used for a chondrogenic differentiation in a different project. Unfortunately, the same assay type, same donor ID, and same passage led to the inadvertently reuse of the image.</p><p>We have since replaced the data in Figure 6g with the results from a different donor. This correction does not affect the conclusions of our study.</p><p>The corrected Figure 6 with updated panel g (leftmost image) is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-108668-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The originally published Figure 6g is shown for reference, including the reference to the initial publication:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-108668-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Note: The first image, depicting a Safranin-O-stained pellet after chondrogenic differentiation, has previously been published in Riegger et al., 2022. <italic>Front Bioeng Biotechnol</italic>; 10:965302. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2022.965302.
