Among these, music is a defining and ancient aspect of human sociality. Human social interaction has largely been addressed in dyadic paradigms, and it is yet to be determined whether the ensuing conclusions generalize to larger groups. Studied more extensively in non-human animal behavior, the presence of multiple agents engaged in the same task space creates different constraints and possibilities than in simpler dyadic interactions. We addressed whether collective dynamics play a role in human circle drumming. The task was to synchronize in a group with an initial reference pattern and then maintain synchronization after it was muted. We varied the number of drummers from solo to dyad, quartet, and octet. The observed lower variability, lack of speeding up, smoother individual dynamics, and leader-less inter-personal coordination indicated that stability increased as group size increased, a sort of temporal wisdom of crowds. We propose a hybrid continuous-discrete Kuramoto model for emergent group synchronization with a pulse-based coupling that exhibits a mean field positive feedback loop. This research suggests that collective phenomena are among the factors that play a role in social cognition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>collective behavior</kwd><kwd>group dynamics</kwd><kwd>joint action</kwd><kwd>drumming</kwd><kwd>rhythm</kwd><kwd>network analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000155</institution-id><institution>Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Insight Grant 435-2020-0442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trainor</surname><given-names>Laurel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2019-05416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trainor</surname><given-names>Laurel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CIFAR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trainor</surname><given-names>Laurel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human performance in a group synchronization task, described as a temporal version of the wisdom of crowds, can be understood as a phenomenon of the same nature as collective dynamics in swarming animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans are social animals who engage in a variety of collective activities requiring coordinated joint action. Collective goals can be achieved through spontaneously distributed workloads among group members, such that the emerging collective dynamics confer benefits to performance not available to individuals—the ‘wisdom of crowds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Galton, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Surowiecki, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Principles of collective dynamics explain the adaptive value of collective behavior in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couzin, 2018</xref>). For example, collective dynamics can overcome the limitations of individuals’ knowledge and ability to communicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goldstone and Roberts, 2006</xref>) by integrating information quickly during group decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ispolatov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rosenthal et al., 2015</xref>). Large coherent swarming and flocking in groups can arise from short-range interactions among proximal individuals in non-human animals including primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farine et al., 2017</xref>), insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jacobs et al., 2007</xref>), fish, and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Parrish et al., 2002</xref>). As such dynamics have been demonstrated in numerous species, theoretical models have been developed to provide additional quantitative explanatory support. In contrast, in spatial tasks such as navigation, aggregate group behavior, formalized as a mean field, can serve to stabilize feedback to individuals by virtue of being a group average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berdahl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sumpter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Torney et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we test whether mean field behavior accounts for stability of temporal group dynamics in humans during a drumming task.</p><p>Collective dynamics are observable in animal as well as in human group behavior. Crowds of walking individuals achieve globally coherent states based on local inter-individual interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Warren, 2018</xref>). In audiences, individual-group interactions and social contagion govern the spontaneous onset and offset of applause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mann et al., 2013</xref>). Collective dynamics can also play a constitutive role in sports by permitting advantages not available to individuals alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Vilar et al., 2013</xref>). Evidence of collective dynamics is seen even in the minimal group, a dyad: spontaneous synchronization between two individuals emerges from constraints such as weak coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oullier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schmidt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schmidt and O’Brien, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Synchronized group action is an essential element of music making, a defining social behavior of human interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Honing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Patel and Iversen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Salimpoor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Savage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Trainor, 2015</xref>), and the value of precise synchronization may vary from culture to culture and across musical contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benadon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lucas et al., 2011</xref>).The archaeological evidence of musical instruments goes back 30,000 years, and singing and drumming are thought to be even older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conard et al., 2009</xref>). The evolutionary origins of musical rhythmic actions may relate to social motor behaviors in non-human species, such as the synchronization and desynchronization of vocalizations between individuals in group chorusing, arising from pressures to either collaborate or compete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gamba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Greenfield et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ravignani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ravignani et al., 2019</xref>). Fundamental aspects of music are present in humans from early stages in development: infants show early musical preferences, social-emotional responses to music, and rate-sensitive motoric responses to musical rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cirelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cirelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Trainor and Marsh-Rollo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zentner and Eerola, 2010</xref>). Although musical behavior is found in individuals alone, it occurs mainly in groups ranging from duets to hundreds of participants. Yet, the role of collective dynamics, especially in groups larger than dyads, has largely remained untested. Here, we consider a musical task in which timing consistency and synchrony are crucial. We investigate in what ways the group average performs better than the individuals, a temporal version of the wisdom of the crowd phenomenon.</p><p>To account for group interaction, one popular strategy is to first develop a theory for single-person tasks and then extrapolate into dyadic contexts. For example, the idea that the brain is a prediction machine that enables timely motor control in an uncertain environment can be extrapolated as two brains mutually predicting each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Friston and Frith, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wolpert et al., 2003</xref>). This means that each individual instantiates two processes: the first for controlling one’s own rhythm and timing and the second for predicting the rhythm and timing of the partner in the dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heggli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heggli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">van der Steen and Keller, 2013</xref>). It is not clear, however, if this can serve as an adequate foundation for behavior in larger groups. Every individual would have to predict every other individual and potentially factor-in higher-order predictions. Furthermore, at the perceptual level, group size changes the auditory information available to an individual. A listener is likely to hear an entire choir as one, or a small number of, coherent sounds rather than perceive every singer’s voice within that choir.</p><p>Group interaction can also be addressed in terms of theoretical models explicitly developed for synchronization in systems made of many dynamic units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderisio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oullier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schmidt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schmidt and O’Brien, 1997</xref>). The individual units in such models usually do not contain processes dedicated separately to self-timing and other-predicting. Instead, each unit has only a self-timing and a phase-correction coupling term. The propagation of phase adjustment across all units is sufficient for the collective to enter a group-synchronized state, despite that each unit is only trying to cancel a phase difference. An important benefit of this approach is that it is inherently collective, converging on the same formalisms used for small or large groups of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kelso, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we consider such a system of coupled oscillators to account for empirical data on individual and group variability in a drumming task.</p><p>Group music making constitutes an ecologically valid and convenient paradigm for studying group action and collective experience in the laboratory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">D’Ausilio et al., 2015</xref>). We used a timing task performed by groups of different sizes. Larger group dynamics are less studied because measuring highly precise timing while collecting group data is difficult for both logistical and methodological reasons (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderisio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chauvigné et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shahal et al., 2020</xref>). Participants completed a group synchronization-continuation task (SCT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It required them to drum in synchrony with an isochronous auditory stimulus and continue drumming at the same rate after the stimulus stopped, while we collected the onset times of each drum hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Stimulus tempo was varied across trials. We tested groups of two (dyads), four (quartets), and eight (octets) participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The task tested participants’ ability to synchronize to an external reference as well as to other participants, while also minimizing temporal variability and maintaining the initial stimulus rate. This ensemble drumming was also compared against the solo condition. Specifically, participants tested in duets or quartets completed both solo and ensemble conditions. The octet group did not complete the solo conditions for logistical reasons, but they instead completed a control condition in which the synchronization phase continued for the whole trial (i.e. there was no continuation phase) as well as trials using a more complex and musically realistic rhythm. Analyses of the more complex rhythm will be reported separately.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experiment setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In ensemble condition, drummers faced each other in a circle. (<bold>B</bold>) The main task was synchronization-continuation where participants were paced initially by an auditory stimulus and then had to maintain the rhythm, tempo, and synchronization among each other. The inter-onset intervals between drum hits, shown schematically as vertical lines, were used to obtain individual-level measures of variability and speeding up. Cross-correlation and transfer entropy were used as pair-level measures of synchronization and interaction.

A key prediction was that the relative influence of the stabilizing feedback would increase with increasing ensemble size. To this end, we measured separately the variability of individual drummers and the group. We constructed a theoretical group-aggregate onset time as the center of clusters of individual onset times. We expected that larger groups would exhibit lower variability as measured using the coefficient of variation of inter-onset intervals. We also tested this idea formally by adapting a Kuramoto model of group synchronization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Group synchronization of eight oscillators with random initial conditions (<bold>A</bold>) and coherent phases later in the trial (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>The middle inset shows individual trajectories (red lines) and the mean field (blue line) in time (t).

The adapted model reproduced the pattern of behavioral results at both the level of individual oscillators (relating to individuals in our drumming data) and the mean field (relating to our group-aggregate analyses). Specifically, for all group sizes, variability was higher for individual oscillators when playing in the group than when playing solo, but variability was always lowest for the mean field (group aggregate). In addition, with increasing group size, the difference between individual variability and that of the mean field became greater, indicating increasing collective benefits with increasing group size.

A separate report will address the model’s individual unit dynamics and co-variation in more detail (Delasanta et al., in preparation). The importance of the mean-field hybrid model for understanding the present results can be seen in that other versions of the Kuramoto model did not successfully replicate the pattern of the data. Specifically, a pulse-coupled network in a neighbors-only ring-topology and a constant coupling network in full connectivity did not exhibit the same pattern of variability as the empirical data, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study examined how group performance in a synchronization timing task depends on group size and interactions among group members. Our overall hypothesis was that the mean field would influence individuals in a group, thereby stabilizing group performance. We expected that larger groups would exhibit more stable performance due to a more stable mean field. This hypothesis was motivated by the collective dynamics that allow animals with limited capacity for interacting with each other to achieve mutual goals by exploiting processes such as positive collective feedback and wisdom of crowds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sumpter, 2006</xref>). As expected, we observed that temporal variability in group drumming decreased with group size. This occurred only at the level of the ensemble or mean field when the group was taken as a single entity. The effect was reversed for individual participants; their variability increased from solo to group playing conditions and with group size. We showed that this result agrees with a collective dynamics framework based on an adapted Kuramoto model. The model is consistent with the idea from theoretical biology that self-organizing systems can successfully coordinate with an external constraint by reducing their disorder at the macro-level at the expense of increasing their micro-level disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kugler and Turvey, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Prokopenko et al., 2014</xref>) and that medium-sized groups exhibit commonalities with principles of organization found both in two-unit and large collectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kelso, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Our theory is related to the Vicsek model, an influential account of collective animal behavior which explains the spontaneous coherent heading direction arising in collective animal movement, also in human crowds, in terms of local interactions of attraction and repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Silverberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vicsek et al., 1995</xref>). The Vicsek model also relies on individual coupling with the average of a group, with the important difference that only a small radius of neighbors defines the interaction field, called a local order parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaté et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The continuous-discrete Kuramoto system introduced here included fluctuating intrinsic frequencies and event-based feedback. Consistent with the discrete nature of time asynchronies in a drumming task, the model used a pulse function instead of continuous coupling. The implications of this idea reach beyond the topic of the present study. The combination of continuous movement and discrete sensory sampling of the environment is a frequently observed scenario; in the present study, participants used the discrete auditory feedback of drum taps to inform their continuous movements leading up to future drum taps. Our task reduced the opportunity of visual coupling but did not eliminate it completely, leaving the possibility that group drumming involved both discrete and continuous feedback such as visual information about continuous arm, hand, and drumstick movements related to the timing of individual drumming sounds. Future studies should address whether visual feedback during group drumming is informative, as well as explore how that visual information is captured within the individual and collective dynamics of the system.</p><p>Interestingly, in the octet group, individual variability was similar in both the synchronization-only condition, where the metronome pacing stimulus was present, and in the self-paced continuation stage of the SCT trials, where no pacing stimulus was present. This result implies that, although tempo accuracy and drift were superior when the pacing stimulus was present, the stability of group timing in a group of eight participants may hit a ceiling, where performance becomes as stable as with a pacing stimulus.</p><p>Individuals’ tempos tended to increase in solo trials, and as expected, this effect was amplified (i.e. speeding up was greater) when trying to stay synchronized with other participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Okano et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, the amount of speeding up was not higher for larger groups of drummers, and it was even reduced for larger groups, at least at faster tempos. In contrast, accounts based on mutual prediction imply more speeding up for larger groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Thomson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>). This discrepancy highlights the importance of testing tempo drift with specific task constraints and avoiding hasty generalizations from smaller to larger groups. Indeed, tempo can also slowdown in some circumstances. This was observed, for example, in a group synchronization task when participants synchronized their oscillations using swung pendulums, a task involving continuous visual coupling rather than discrete acoustic event coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardy et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Having summarized task performance in terms of consistency and accuracy, we next considered drumming dynamics. Individuals’ autocorrelations exhibited negative coefficient peaks at odd lags and positive coefficient peaks at even lags. This is the typical error-correction process demonstrated when individuals synchronize their tapping with a stimulus or with each other in pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Konvalinka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Repp, 2005</xref>). With increasing group size, however, the magnitudes of the autocorrelation coefficient fluctuations with lag decreased; individuals’ alternating patterns became smoother. This suggests that as group size increases, drumming dynamics are dominated less by tap-by-tap error-correction and more by a group dynamic. Interestingly, the group-aggregate onsets exhibited the same autocorrelation pattern as individuals, even in octets. This implies that the collective mean field behavior spontaneously acquired some of the dynamic properties typically associated with individual performance.</p><p>Inter-personal coordination in duets exhibited the negative cross-correlation at lag 0 and positive cross-correlation at lag 1 expected from past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Repp, 2005</xref>). The results for speeding up, variability, and cross-correlations in the dyads were consistent with the literature on dyadic interaction with tapping tasks. Yet, as group size increased in the present study, the coefficient magnitudes for cross-correlations decreased. In fact, they all but disappeared for groups of eight, suggestive of a leader-less group coordination scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heggli et al., 2019</xref>). In a small number of trials, we even observed positive lag 0 cross-correlations in groups of eight, a signature of anticipation emerging from dynamic interaction. This result is consistent with the idea that group members coordinated less with each other and more with the mean field. Along with a more slowly decaying autocorrelation function, this suggests the emergence of a larger-scale group dynamic in the octet. As we hypothesized, mutual prediction is not necessarily the only basis for coordination in larger groups. The present model would be more like a predictive account had we included a new variable and an additional equation in the model, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, corresponding to a separate internal oscillatory process <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> that individual <italic>i</italic> dedicates to the prediction of an external signal <italic>j</italic>. Yet, there is no reason to assume that collective dynamics and mutual prediction are exclusive alternatives, only that collective dynamics are a mode of social interaction that emerges under certain constraints such as large groups of interacting agents.</p><p>Characterizing inter-personal interaction on the basis of bivariate measures is typical in the context of dyadic paradigms. Larger groups, however, create the possibility for higher-order interactions. Network analysis was applied to the connectivity graph of TEs among drummers. Larger groups had lower causal density but higher node strength. This is possible because individual nodes in larger groups project to a larger number of other individual nodes and suggests that in larger groups, each individual has a decreased influence on the group, both less potential to destabilize the group and lower requirements to keep the group stable. We also found that higher node strength was associated with better overall performance, both in terms of variability and tempo accuracy.</p><p>Group timing tasks address some of the foundations of human social interaction. This area of research has been labeled the ‘dark matter’ of social neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dumas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Insel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schilbach et al., 2013</xref>) because it has not received enough attention despite the fact that large parts of the human cortex respond to social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frith and Frith, 2001</xref>). The temporal regularities in music make it an ideal stimulus to promote synchronous and cooperative movement, providing evidence as to why music is often present at emotional social gatherings such as weddings, funerals, parties, and political rallies. Feelings of affiliation and cooperation increase between people who have experienced synchronous movement with each other, even during infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cirelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cirelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hove and Risen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mogan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Trainor and Cirelli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Valdesolo et al., 2010</xref>).

Arguably, the presence of a convergent regular rhythm defined over the ensemble allows individuals of varying skill level to perform together without having to predict each note they play, an idea that remained largely untested in the present study because of the relative simplicity of the isochronous stimulus.</p><p>Participants in group activities sometimes report a so-called state of flow characterized by absorption, loss of sense of control, loss of self-consciousness, togetherness, and effortless action toward a shared goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Csikszentmihalyi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gaggioli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). Little is known about the underlying group processes that enable such experiences. Some of the required conditions have been studied in the context of group musical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bishop et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Amario et al., 2018</xref>). Collective intentionality is often seen as an extrapolation of single-person cognitive processes in that individuals predict other individuals’ goals and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tomasello, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tomasello, 2014</xref>). Yet, the neural and cognitive mechanisms historically identified in single-person paradigms do not always map onto the ontology of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Przyrembel et al., 2012</xref>). Collective intentionality can stand for an independent mode of social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Satne and Salice, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zahavi and Satne, 2015</xref>).

The present work shows how collective dynamics can absorb individual action.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Beyond the group average</title><p>We have argued that attraction to the group average constitutes an organizing principle that supports the coordinated performance of medium and large groups of individuals. There are theoretical and empirical reasons, however, to assume that other organizing tendencies can compete with the group average and potentially lead to more complicated dynamics. To begin with, our synchronization task was designed to foster collaboration, did not challenge individual skill, and did not create any incentives for competitive individual behavior. This collaborative aspect corresponds to social behaviors where crowds want to appear as a strong unity, for instance, when chanting a protest song or storming into battle. In contrast, choir singing demonstrates that both cooperation and competition are involved often in group musical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keller et al., 2017</xref>). And different players in musical ensembles often simultaneously play different parts with different melodic and rhythmic features. While these parts must fit together, reflecting cooperation, at any one point, the player of the ‘melody’ or most important part influences other players more than vice versa, setting up leadership dynamics within the group (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). Different cultural contexts and performance styles may even emphasize the creative and expressive de-synchronization from the regular group beat, or avoid isochrony altogether, allowing musicians to unfold their own ideas or belonging to a specific tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benadon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lucas et al., 2011</xref>). Understanding musical creativity requires a situated approach and ethnographic engagement to find which features of the emergent collective acoustic environment constitute meaningful affordances for given musicians in a given context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Linson and Clarke, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The combination of attractive and repulsive coupling among individuals is particularly evident in the context of collective animal behavior. The well-known Vicsek model accounts for the coherent heading direction in collective movement in terms of a combination of local attraction and repulsion forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Vicsek et al., 1995</xref>). In chorusing animals, there is a tendency for male individuals to cluster their acoustic behavior in time but also to advance ahead of the cluster, presumably to have better chances at attracting the attention of other relevant individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gamba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Greenfield et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ravignani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ravignani et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The present study focused on a scenario with uniform coupling by keeping group members close to each other and restricting the timbre and pitch of their drums to a very narrow range, making them acoustically inseparable from each other when playing synchronously. Musicians who play on large stages sometimes report noticeable delays amongst each other. In the present study, the delay was limited in the range from 4 ms to 16 ms depending on partners’ spatial separation, and the sound intensity drop was from 6.3 to 15.1 dB. Yet, selective attention plays an important role in animal chorusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greenfield et al., 2021</xref>). Variations in the layout of the acoustic environment, individualized timbres, and the availability of alternative coupling modalities such as vision, all create affordances for selective attention and individualized roles in the ensemble. For example, low-pitch sounds afford better beat-based timing precision in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hove et al., 2020</xref>). The discernability of individual sounds facilitates temporal coordination tasks, presumably through the involvement of neural mechanisms for self-other segregation and integration mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liebermann-Jordanidis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Novembre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ragert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we assume that the aforementioned factors fit within the collective dynamics framework as symmetry-breaking terms, complications in task space that enable more interesting stabilities than mere attraction to the group average. Future studies can address this idea by manipulating individual heterogeneity, task difficulty, spatial layout, and coupling topology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 102 university students participated in the duet (n=11 sessions; 22 participants), quartet (n=8 sessions; 32 participants), and octet (n=6 sessions; 48 participants) groups.

Across the set of all participants, musical training was distributed in the range from non-musician to amateur musician. We did not control the composition of musical skill within each ensemble.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Apparatus</title><p>In ensemble playing conditions, participants were seated in chairs facing each other, equally spaced in a linear, square, or octagon arrangement, with diagonal distances of 3 meters in the duet and quartet groups and 6 meters in octet group. Ensemble playing conditions were performed in a large, tall-ceiling dance studio, part of the LIVELab, a laboratory dedicated to auditory and movement neuroscience (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://livelab.mcmaster.ca">http://livelab.mcmaster.ca</ext-link>). In the duet and quartet groups, solo trials were recorded with individual participants immediately before or after the ensemble sessions in an adjacent sound-proof room.</p><p>In the duet and quartet groups, participants used drumsticks on plastic buckets that were dampened and placed upside-down. Their fundamental frequencies varied in a narrow range (117–129 Hz). They are of the type seen in street-style group drumming observed in the community and were used previously by a group drumming workshop instructor. Piezoelectric sensor elements were taped on the inner side of the attack surface of each bucket. The analog signal was recorded on a computer at 48 kHz via a multi-channel studio-grade analog-digital interface (Focusrite RedNet 4) and the digital audio production software Reaper (Cockos Incorporated, Rosendale, NY, USA). This setup provided for a clean signal with minimal noise and a sharp, high-amplitude attack that was digitized into onset times in Matlab using a custom algorithm with thresholding and rejection of rebounds under 150 ms.</p><p>The octet group used a set of electronic pads which, unlike the bucket drums, allowed tuning the drums to distinct fundamental frequencies across a larger number of individual drums. Eight identical pads (Yamaha TP70 7.5” snare/tom) and eight independent powered studio reference monitors (Yorkville Sound YSM5) placed under each pad were connected to the head module (Yamaha DTX 920 K). The pads had linear amplitude response and, on impact, produced the same woodblock sound. The woodblock fundamental frequencies, about double those of the bucket drums, also varied in a narrow range (249–284 Hz). The two setups were similar as they both involved polymer impact surfaces and piezoelectric sensors embedded within those surfaces to detect impacts and record onset times. To record the electronic drums, the head module was connected to the computer which stored drum hits as MIDI events. The recording line was parallel to the drum set and did not contribute additional latency between drum impact and drum sound (5 ms). Separately, we measured that the recording pipeline added negligible timing variability with a SD of 1 ms relative to the ground truth based on a direct analog recording of the drum pad impacts.</p><p>The reference metronome that participants were asked to synchronize with was played over a dedicated speaker placed in the middle between participants. A custom patch for the sound synthesis and production software Pure Data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Puckette, 1997</xref>) ran on the computer to generate and time a sharp electronic kick drum sound, with a timbre very distinct from the individuals’ drums (600 Hz sine wave with 250 ms duration, 20 ms amplitude attack, and 230 ms decay). The stimulus was fed back and recorded as an additional channel along with the participants’ drum beats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Stimuli</title><p>The stimulus tempo of the isochronous reference metronome varied between 50 and 240 beats per minute (bpm) depending on condition (see below). Trials were 90 s long, and the synchronization phase always included 32 stimulus events. Thus, slower tempos had longer duration synchronization phases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Task</title><p>Drumming is ecologically valid in terms of common musical practice, and tapping with sticks has been shown to improve timing relative to finger tapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Madison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Manning et al., 2017</xref>). The task on each trial was a SCT. During the synchronization phase, participants were presented with trials containing a reference isochronous metronome at a particular tempo and were asked, using drumsticks, to: (1) synchronize with the given reference metronome, (2) keep their own variability as low as possible, (3) keep their drumming rate as steady as possible, and (4) synchronize with the other drummers when in an ensemble condition. During the continuation phase, the reference metronome stopped, and participants were told to continue to keep their drumming rate as steady as possible while synchronizing with other drummers in an ensemble. Those in the octet group also completed trials in a synchronization-only control task in which the isochronous metronome played for the entire trial (i.e. there was no continuation phase). Participants were instructed to focus their eyes on an ‘X’ taped in the centers of their drums, thus reducing the visual coupling among group members in the ensemble conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Design</title><p>Participants were assigned to one of three group sizes: duet (2), quartet (4), or octet (8). Those in the duet and quartet groups completed the SCT task in both solo and ensemble conditions. Duet and quartet groups completed six trials at each of the following tempos: 50, 80, 120, 160, 200, and 240 bpm (or 1200, 750, 500, 375, 300, and 250 ms onset-to-onset intervals between beats) in each of the solo and ensemble conditions, with the order of tempos randomized. For each set of participants, there was random assignment to either the solo or ensemble condition first. Trials lasted 90 s with a synchronization phase of 32 metronome beats.</p><p>For octet groups, there were three differences in the design. First, they did not complete solo trials because of time and space constraints. Second, the set of tempos was slightly different (80, 100, 120, 160, and 200 bpm or 750, 600, 500, 375, and 300 ms intervals). Finally, an additional condition was included, consisting of a synchronization-only control task (i.e. with the reference metronome throughout).</p><p>We found that the very low and very high tempos led to poor performance; hence, we eliminated extreme tempo trials and only analyzed the set of matching tempos across dyads, quartets, and octets, namely 80, 120, 160, and 200 bpm (750, 500, 375, and 300 ms). See the figure supplements for the extreme tempo conditions. For all groups, prior to completing the trials in each condition, participants engaged in practicing synchronized steady drumming without an initial metronome to set the tempo so that participants could become familiar with the sticks and drums and playing together in an ensemble.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Procedure</title><p>After providing informed consent, filling out demographic and music background questionnaires, reading instructions, and observing a demonstration of the apparatus, participants were instructed to find a comfortable posture on their chair and adjust the drum position during practice. They were asked not to adjust these further during the trials. Participants were allowed to practice as needed to feel comfortable with the task. After each trial, the experimenter verified with the participants that they were ready to start drumming again before the next trial was initiated. The whole session from arrival to departure lasted about an hour. Before asking for informed consent, the overall goals of the study were explained to the participants, including that the collected drumming data would potentially be presented anonymously at meetings and in scientific papers, and that the procedures had been approved by the McMaster Research Ethics Board.</p><p>During the solo performance in the duet condition, one participant was moved to an adjacent sound-proof room while the second remained in the large dance studio. For the quartet condition, two of the participants were randomly assigned to arrive earlier and perform their solo trials before the group trials and the other two to perform their solo trials after the group trials. In the octets, individuals did not perform solo trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Pre-processing of onset times</title><p>Onset times were processed using custom Matlab scripts (an example script for cleaning and matching IOIs is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/dodo_bird/group_sync_elife">https://gitlab.com/dodo_bird/group_sync_elife</ext-link>, copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:a203ffdbf29ac2532c1625c7aa397e43fbdb6eb4;origin=https://gitlab.com/dodo_bird/group_sync_elife;visit=swh:1:snp:7d9f1691d935937d923f4090877180af0adc599b;anchor=swh:1:rev:6479ed2e3409ebc156fbc917a246cf4c4edf4f44">swh:1:rev:6479ed2e3409ebc156fbc917a246cf4c4edf4f44</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dobromir, 2022</xref>). In SCT trials, only data from the continuation phase was analyzed. In the synchronization-only control trials of the octet group, the full-trial length was analyzed. The following steps were taken to remove artifacts and condition the data according to the requirements of the analyses used.</p><sec id="s4-7-1-1"><title>Signal</title><p>On a few occasions, participants accidentally pulled the cable from the drum and disconnected or damaged the sensor. A total of 15 bad channels (i.e. participants) were detected and removed from further analysis with a custom script using the onset variability, signal noise, and amplitude consistency. For further verification, we visually inspected the signals and onset times from all channels and trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-1-2"><title>Group-aggregate (mean field) measure for ensembles and pseudo-ensembles</title><p>For ensemble trials, we created a measure of the beat onset times of the group as a whole by constructing theoretical group-aggregate onsets in the center of clusters of individuals’ onset times, <italic>t<sub>n,g</sub></italic>, where <italic>n</italic> is the beat onset number, and <italic>g</italic> signifies it is the group-aggregate onset. Specifically, we: (1) convolved onset times with a Gaussian kernel 200 ms in width, (2) smoothed the resulting group activity rate with a moving average window of a quarter of the reference stimulus beat onset-to-onset time, and (3) took the peak locations for group-aggregate beat onset times (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This algorithm, typically used in neuroscience to extract a firing rate or population activity from the spike times of multiple recorded units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</xref>), provides a measure of the central tendency of one or more events clustered in time. The method does not necessarily restrict the group-aggregate pattern to one average onset because if a single onset time is isolated away from other clusters, for example, when a participant erroneously hits the drum while the other participants were silent, it will also be detected as a single-event cluster. Such events of large individual deviations from the group were very rare in the present study and eliminated from analysis because, overall, participants performed the task consistently and in agreement with group members. Group-aggregate beat onset times were calculated for each trial in each group during ensemble playing conditions. In solo trials of dyads and quartets, participants could not see or hear each other, but we computed onset times of the pseudo-group-aggregate for a baseline.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Group-aggregate onset times from convolving the drummers’ onsets with a Gaussian kernel.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74816-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-7-1-3"><title>From beat onset times to IOIs, outlier removal, and clustering</title><p>For each trial for each participant, the sequence of onset times <italic>t<sub>n,i</sub></italic>, where <italic>i</italic> is participant and <italic>n</italic> onset number, was differenced to produce a time-series of inter-onset-intervals, IOI<italic><sub>n,i</sub></italic>=<italic>tn<sub>n,i</sub> – t<sub>n−1,i</sub></italic>.

Inter-personal coordination lists bi-variate measures typically used to analyze dyadic tapping and sensorimotor coordination problems. Yet, even such pair-level analysis is not sufficient in the group context where more than two participants coordinate simultaneously with each other. Hence, we obtained group-level measures by analyzing the network of effective connectivity among drummers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Newman et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Greenfield (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data do fit, to some extent, the proposed hypothesis (response to the mean of all neighbors). However, as noted by Reviewer #2, there are alternative hypotheses which may be as good or better.</p><p>2) The fact that the 'agents' could see as well as hear each other poses some problems for adapting the Kuramoto model correctly. Moreover, selective attention (to only some neighbors) has not been dealt with in the proposed hypotheses or in the perceptual and response mechanisms of the individual agents. The issue that individuals might have adapted more strongly to the output of their neighbours should be discussed in the article.</p><p>3) Both reviewers #1 and #3 recommended that the article should clarify which of the conclusions from the study might be generalisable to musical activities.</p><p>4) Statements regarding predictive mechanisms should be fully justified. Note also the point made by Reviewer #1: the task used here requires minimal prediction due to the constant tempo of the task.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are some comments and suggestions.</p><p>1. Abstract. I would try to be more explicit about potential dissociations between dyadic vs. large group interactions (i.e. comparing this study with previous ones focusing on dyads). The authors might even attempt to refer to this issue more explicitly in the abstract.</p><p>2. Introduction, page 4, &quot;arising from pressures to either collaborate or compete&quot;. The study by Keller et al., 2017 (Frontiers in Psychology), showing that collaboration and competition are not always alternatives in joint music making, might also be relevant here.</p><p>3. Introduction, page 4, &quot;Group music making constitutes an ecologically valid and convenient paradigm for studying group action and collective experience in the laboratory&quot;. This statement would be better supported by a reference, e.g. D'Ausilio et al., 2015 (TICS).</p><p>4. Introduction. The role of &quot;prediction&quot; in &quot;interpersonal synchronization&quot; is discussed briefly on two occasions in the introduction (page 4 and page 5, final sentence). I am not sure the authors have sufficiently conveyed their message. I believe they should better explain how prediction would emerge &quot;implicitly&quot; from the dynamic models they are referring to. Ideally, they should provide a concrete example of this, and support this with some data from previous studies. Otherwise, I am not sure a naïve reader will be able to make much of this issue.</p><p>5. Methods. The equipment used across small and large groups is slightly different. I don't think this should be a problem. However, I believe it would be good to explain why this was the case. This might be important for colleagues planning other studies in the future.</p><p>6. Methods and results. Page 9: &quot;We found that the very low and very high tempos led to poor performance, hence we eliminated extreme tempo trials and only analyzed the set of matching tempos across dyads, quartets, and octets, namely 80, 120, 160, and 200 bpm&quot;. I believe it would be important to show this data (ideally as a supplement, i.e. not in the main text).</p><p>7. Methods and results. Section 2.7.2.1. &quot;In ensemble conditions, we only kept the group-aggregate tempo trend&quot;. For comparability with previous studies testing smaller groups, it might be important to conduct this analysis looking at each individual separately, and then average the results. I realize this might yield qualitatively similar results, but I still think it's an important detail to report somewhere.</p><p>8. Methods and results. Page 19. &quot;IOIs were matched across participants by proximity&quot;. Does this mean that cross correlations were computed between pairs of participants that were physically proximal? Or have the authors computed these coefficients by cross-correlating each individual's IOIs with the aggregate IOI measure? This is an important detail, which I am not sure I have fully understood.</p><p>9. General comment. The authors have selectively tested experimental conditions in which the effects produced by the performers were qualitatively similar (i.e. same acoustic output). I would like the authors to make a prediction about what would happen should the effects produced be different. Considering that the authors often refer to music, and that musical ensembles are often composed of players producing distinct sounds, I believe it might be important to discuss this.</p><p>10. General comment. Following on the previous point, the authors might consider that in this experiment participants only needed to &quot;integrate&quot; the acoustic outputs produced by the other players. However, in more complex coordination dynamics (e.g. an orchestra), each individual might need to weight the outputs produced by the other members, eventually &quot;integrating&quot; with some and &quot;segregating&quot; from others. This principle is well known in auditory cognition and has also been proposed to be important for ensemble music performance (see e.g. Ragert et al., 2014 (Plos One), Novembre et al., 2016 (Neuropsychologia), Liebermann-Jordanidis et al., 2021 (Acta Psychologica)). Could the proposed model account for this kind of behavior? And, if so, how? Would this require modelling individuals as separate processes (see also point 4 above)?</p><p>11. General comment. In relation to the role of &quot;prediction&quot;, the authors state that this &quot;is implicit in the emergent synchronization of coupled individual oscillatory dynamics&quot;. I am not sure this can be generalized to all instances of interpersonal coordination though. Take, as an example, the instance where one of the drummers gradually changes tempo (I am not referring to microtiming deviations or phase adjustments, but to an actual gradual change of the period). This might strongly call for predictive processes, more so than in the current scenario (where there is not much to predict given that all participants have to drum at a stable, non-changing tempo). A more ecological example would be joint musical improvisation, where players notably introduce unexpected behaviors, yet their peers are able to synchronize with (and sometimes even anticipate) these. To what extent can the discussed results and model be generalized to similar instances?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Several details not addressed above:</p><p>It is noted that the human subjects filled out a questionnaire which included information on musical experience/background. Was this information used to eliminate or retain subjects? Would musical background, or lack thereof, potentially influence the results of drummer timing?

' could benefit from a better explanation. There are some profound statements here, and it would behove the authors to avoid possibilities of misinterpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please, have a look at the &quot;groove&quot; and expressivity studies (groove has many culturally specific definitions: swing, swingue, ginga, balanço, etc) and reflect on how these studies solve and shed light on some aspects of the contribution.

We consider the mean field approach to be the most likely for the present scenario because the task makes it hard to pay selective attention to individual participants. We discussed the role of individual heterogeneity and spatial separation in breaking symmetry and creating affordances for more interesting forms of coordination. An additional argument is provided by comparing different versions of the model. We included a neighbour-only coupling (ring topology) version of the model which does not correspond well to the empirical data. We showed this in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The fact that the 'agents' could see as well as hear each other poses some problems for adapting the Kuramoto model correctly. Moreover, selective attention (to only some neighbors) has not been dealt with in the proposed hypotheses or in the perceptual and response mechanisms of the individual agents. The issue that individuals might have adapted more strongly to the output of their neighbours should be discussed in the article.</p></disp-quote><p>We included further discussion of this limitation of the task. Indeed, we cannot rule out visual coupling which is of a different nature than the short auditory pulses. We also included the following points. First, we emphasized that participants were instructed to focus on X’s in the center of their drums, hence partners were only visible in the peripheral field (pages 22-23, section 4.4). Second, our results in the dyad group essentially replicated other dyadic tapping studies (end of page 17). Third, we included two new versions of our model, one with a continuous coupling (classical Kuramoto), and one with a restricted topology, a ring, where individual units are only coupled to their immediate neighbours (bottom of page 8 and Figure 3—figure supplementary 2). The classical model would be expected to fit the data if the primary input was continuous (i.e., visual) and the ring model would be expected to fit the data if participants were indeed focusing on the visual information from those beside them. However, neither model fit the empirical data well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both reviewers #1 and #3 recommended that the article should clarify which of the conclusions from the study might be generalisable to musical activities.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the present task is an idealized impoverished scenario. We inserted a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the present study and where future research can be directed to capture more realistic musical activities in a new section, “Beyond the group average”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statements regarding predictive mechanisms should be fully justified. Note also the point made by Reviewer #1: the task used here requires minimal prediction due to the constant tempo of the task.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the isochronous task is not challenging as a pattern. Because we did not design the study to specifically test predictive processes, we prefer to minimize the discussion of predictive mechanisms. It is hard to talk about predictive processes and whatever is the alternative to such processes without engaging in a lengthy discussion including definitions and how prediction can be used to mean different things. Having said that, this has been an important topic of research in the last few years that should not be ignored. To this end, we made revisions so that the topic is acknowledged but without committing to uncovering new knowledge about prediction as our study was not designed to do that. We do now, however, pointed out a definite way for distinguishing models in that context. Specifically, one set of models, typically associated with predictive processing theories, assume that two separate (oscillatory) processes are needed to account for an individual: one for controlling one’s own timing, and the second for tracking an external process (the partner). Our approach makes use of only one oscillator per individual; doesn’t separate the mechanism into self-timing and other-tracking. We added a brief mention of this distinction at the beginning of page 18.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Here are some comments and suggestions.</p><p>1.

Additionally, while the drums in the initial setup had distinct sounds, they didn’t allow us to manipulate them to produce eight drums with nominally different fundamental frequencies.

What was meant here was not spatial proximity with the neighbours but deciding which drum hits from different participants go together and which ones, on very rare occasions, are mistakes. The issue of spatial proximity, raised by the other reviewers as well, is very important for understanding large ensembles but is less relevant here because of the relative proximity of all drummers (see also section 3.1. “Beyond …”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. General comment. The authors have selectively tested experimental conditions in which the effects produced by the performers were qualitatively similar (i.e. same acoustic output).

For example, low-pitch sounds may afford better beat-based timing precision. In general, heterogeneity should make it possible for specialized individual roles, sub-groups and leader-follower dynamics to emerge. See 3.1. “Beyond the group average” at the end of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. General comment.

We have incorporated the literature, bottom of page 20. Additionally, we now discuss that the present approach needs to be expanded to be able to account for competitive pressure and selective attention.

The main assumption of the statistical method (linear mixed effects models with maximum likelihood estimation) is normality of the residuals and random effects of the given fitted model. We included examples of how we verified that this assumption is satisfied to a reasonable degree. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> show how the given data fit a normal distribution. The first row is for the residuals of the model for tempo speeding up. Second row, the random effects from the same model (the random effects estimate individuals’ or groups’ overall tendency to speed up aside from effects of experimental condition). Left, model fitted to individuals. Right, model fitted to the group-average of individuals for better statistical properties.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74816-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Try to communicate and describe the musical/performative effect of the results to open a dialogue with researchers in the music field.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for encouraging us to do so.
