in SA immune evasion and nutrient acquisition. LukED targets specific G protein-coupled chemokine receptors to lyse human erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells). The first recognition step of receptors is critical for specific cell targeting and lysis. The structural and molecular bases for this mechanism are not well understood but could constitute essential information to guide antibiotic development. Here, we characterized the interaction of LukE with chemokine receptors ACKR1, CCR2, and CCR5 using a combination of structural, pharmacological, and computational approaches. First, crystal structures of LukE in complex with a small molecule mimicking sulfotyrosine side chain (p-cresyl sulfate) and with peptides containing sulfotyrosines issued from receptor sequences revealed the location of receptor sulfotyrosine binding sites in the toxins. Then, by combining previous and novel experimental data with protein docking, classical and accelerated weight histogram (AWH) molecular dynamics we propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes. This work provides novel insights into chemokine receptor recognition by leukotoxins and suggests that the conserved sulfotyrosine binding pocket could be a target of choice for future drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>S. aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>GPCRs</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd><kwd>chemokine receptors</kwd><kwd>sulfotyrosine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE15-0002-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leyrat</surname><given-names>Cédric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimentally validated structural models of ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes reveal the critical contributions of sulfotyrosine binding sites and divergent loops of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> leukotoxins to the recognition of chemokine receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (SA) is a major opportunistic human pathogen that causes a wide range of clinical manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tong et al., 2015</xref>), and poses growing health concern due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Pathogenic SA strains produce a number of wall-associated or secreted virulence factors that promote growth, nutrient acquisition and evasion of the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeLeo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliveira et al., 2018</xref>). Among this arsenal of virulence factors, the bicomponent leukotoxins are β-barrel pore forming toxins that play an important role in SA pathogenesis by targeting host leukocytes and erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spaan et al., 2017</xref>), and appear to be promising targets for drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kong et al., 2016</xref>). Human clinical SA isolates can produce up to five different leukotoxins: γ-hemolysin AB and CB (HlgAB and HlgCB), Leukocidin ED (LukED), Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL or LukSF-PV), and Leukocidin AB (LukAB, also known as LukGH). Each leukotoxin is made up of two subunits of approximately 30 kDa: a host cell targeting S-component (HlgA, HlgC, LukE, lukS-PV, and LukA/G), and a polymerization F- component (HlgB, LukD, lukF-PV, and LukB/H), which can bind the plasma membrane through highly conserved phosphocholine binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). S- and F-components typically display relatively high conservation within each group ( ~ 70% sequence identity), but sequence identity drops below 30% between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spaan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>With the exception of LukGH, these toxins are secreted as monomers that bind target cells and subsequently octamerize into a lytic pore on the plasma membrane, composed of alternating S- and F- subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guillet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamashita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nocadello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trstenjak et al., 2020</xref>). Each toxin is composed of two domains: a central β sandwich called the CAP domain and involved in inter-protomer interactions, and a RIM domain which contains several divergent loops driving host cell specificity. The STEM region is a subdomain of the CAP, which changes its conformation upon pore formation to associate with neighboring protomers and form a β barrel that inserts into the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamashita et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decade, membrane protein receptors have been identified for most of the bicomponent leukotoxins, providing key insights into their role in SA pathogenesis and the mechanisms driving their cellular tropism and species specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spaan et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, HlgA and LukE were shown to share atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) as their main receptor on erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spaan et al., 2015</xref>), while recruiting CCR5 (LukE), CCR2 (HlgA), CXCR1, and CXCR2 (both HlgA and LukE) to differentially target specific leukocyte populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reyes-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spaan et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, HlgC and LukS-PV were found to bind monocytes and neutrophils through C5aR1 and C5aR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spaan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spaan et al., 2014</xref>). All of the identified receptors belong to the chemokine or complement receptor families of class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), except for the divergent lukGH toxin which binds CD11b (aka complement receptor 3) expressed on phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DuMont et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, F-component-specific receptors have been identified as well: human CD45 was shown to act as a receptor for lukF-PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tromp et al., 2018</xref>), while HlgB was found to interact with ACKR1.</p><p>Several of these toxin-GPCR pairs have been characterized at the molecular level by swapping mutagenesis of divergent regions/loops (DRs) of the RIM domain, in particular for LukE and HlgA that can target multiple chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reyes-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laventie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasquez et al., 2020</xref>). These studies highlighted the critical role of several DRs located in the rim domain in determining receptor specificity. From the receptor’s side, residues of CCR5 were identified in eCL2 and in the upper part of TM7 that lead to severe loss of LukED activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam et al., 2016</xref>). Several residues of ACKR1 were also identified by mutagenesis, the most critical being the sulphated tyrosine sTyr41 for which the alanine substitution nearly abolished LukED and HlgAB activity on erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spaan et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, all of the GPCRs that bind leukotoxins possess between 1 and 4 potentially sulfated tyrosine residues in their N-terminal regions, and the interaction between LukS-PV and the C5aR1 N-terminal region was shown to require tyrosine sulfation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spaan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, post-translational modification pathways involved in the sulfation of the leukotoxin receptors were recently found to impact on HlgAB, HlgCB, LukED, and PVL induced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tromp et al., 2020</xref>). Despite these advances, a structural understanding of toxin–chemokine receptors interactions is still lacking due to the unavailability of high resolution structures of the complexes.</p><p>In the present study, we provide a detailed characterization of the structure and dynamics of monomeric LukE using integrated structural biology methods. We show that recombinant LukE is able to displace bound chemokines from ACKR1, CCR5, and CCR2 on the cell surface using a time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) based approach. We next solved the crystal structures of LukE in complex with a small molecule mimicking a sulfotyrosine side chain (p-cresyl sulfate) and with sulfopeptides derived from the N-terminal region of ACKR1 and CCR2, revealing two conserved sulfotyrosine binding sites. Finally, we use computational docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes that are supported by previous pharmacological experiments as well as novel mutagenesis data described here.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Solution and crystallographic structures of LukE</title><p>The crystal structure of monomeric LukE has previously been reported at 3.2 Å resolution (PDB code 3ROH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nocadello et al., 2016</xref>). While attempting to co-crystallize LukE in complex with peptides encompassing the sulfated ACKR1 Tyr41 residue, we serendipitously obtained two additional apo crystal forms of LukE at 1.5 Å (apo1) and 1.9 Å (apo2), allowing us to build a higher quality model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and Materials and methods). The apo2 structure, like the original 3ROH structure, belongs to space group I4, while the apo1 structure crystallized in P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> and features an entirely different crystal packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All three structures contain one copy of the protein in the asymmetric unit and display very similar conformations, with Cα RMSDs of 1.18 Å (apo1) and 0.81 Å (apo2) relative to the 3ROH structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). One notable difference is the presence of residues 12–23 belonging to the N-terminal signal sequence in apo2, which are involved in crystal packing interactions, possibly accounting for the higher resolution compared to the 3ROH structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A comparison of the B-factors of the three structures is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>, highlighting the influence of crystal packing on protein

SNAP-tag-fused CCR5, ACKR1, and CCR2 receptors transiently expressed in HEK293 cells were covalently labeled with Lumi4-terbium as donor. Cells were then incubated in the presence of 5 nM tracer chemokines d2-CCL5 (CCR5 and ACKR1) or d2-CCL2 (CCR2).

Because recognition of sulfated tyrosines appears to be a common trend among leukotoxins, we selected 3 synthetic molecules for soaking, in an attempt to identify potential sulfotyrosine binding sites: (1) para-cresyl sulfate (pCS) is a metabolite of tyrosine and a uremic toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gryp et al., 2017</xref>). Its chemical structure is identical to that of a sulfotyrosine side chain (Cβ replaced by a methyl group); (2) the <sup>34</sup>DSFPDGDsYGANLE<sup>46</sup> peptide of ACKR1, with a functionally critical sulfated tyrosine in position 41; and (3) the <sup>25</sup>DsYDsYG<sup>29</sup> peptide of CCR2 bearing 2 sulfated tyrosines in position 26 and 28.

Unexpectedly, we found two bound copies of the peptide, which may be due to the potentially very high peptide concentration used during crystal soaking experiments (see Materials and methods). Residues 34–43, and residues 39–46 are visible for the 1st and 2nd peptide, respectively. Although the signal for each sulfotyrosine is fairly strong, the electron density of the other peptide residues is weaker, particularly for the 1st peptide (see Polder map in Figure S4B). This is apparent in the refined occupancies which are ~0.7 for the sulfotyrosines, but only 0.3–0.6 for the other peptide residues. The first peptide interacts with site 1 through its sTyr41 residue in a manner similar to the pCS molecule. The preceding residues <sup>36</sup>FPDGD<sup>40</sup> close the back of the binding pocket, decreasing the solvent exposed surface area of sTyr41, and provide additional stability through multiple intermolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Phe36 and Pro37 pack hydrophobically against Lys51 and Lys52 of LukE. Asp38 forms a salt bridge with LukE Arg290, and Gly39 carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen bonded to Arg101 from site 2. The 2nd peptide sTyr41 residue interacts with site 2, in a way that is also similar to pCS, although Arg101 sidechain adopts a different conformation and an additional salt bridge is formed between the sulfate and Lys283 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Other stabilizing interactions include several backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds between Asp40-Lys92, Gly42-Asp90, and Leu45-Phe88, and hydrophobic interactions between Leu45 and Phe88, Ala219 and Arg220 of LukE. Although the conformation of both peptides is stabilized by multiple interactions with LukE, it should be noted that the 2nd peptide chain runs with its C-terminus going away from the putative location of the membrane. In addition, the occupancy is relatively low (except for the sulfotyrosines) and the conformation of the peptides is likely influenced by crystal packing and the associated steric constraints.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of LukE in complex with ACKR1 peptide <sup>34</sup>DSFPDGDsYGANLE<sup>46</sup> and CCR2 peptide <sup>25</sup>DsYDsYG<sup>29</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the asymmetric unit of the ACKR1 peptide-soaked crystal.

This third alternate conformation clashes with the sulfate group of sTyr28, suggesting the existence of a minor population of molecules in which sTyr28 unbinds while sTyr26 flips its sidechain to the second site. This is consistent with the lower occupancy for site 2 versus site 1 sulfotyrosine (0.56 and 0.98), and the presence of a chain break at Asp27 in the electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Available mutagenesis data were encoded into Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs) by HADDOCK, providing relatively strong constraints on the orientation of the bound toxin (see Materials and methods). In the second step, the tyrosine-sulfated N-terminal region of the receptor was added to the best model of each complex, and multiple MD simulations were performed in order to simultaneously dock the N-terminal region of the receptor onto the toxin and assess the stability of the docking pose.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref> show the HADDOCK (energy) score versus iRMSD (relative to the best scoring model) for the best ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE docking runs, revealing in both cases a deep energy funnel corresponding to the best cluster. The best scoring ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE clusters are also the largest ones with 44 and 67 members, respectively. The best scoring pose for each complex is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>, after addition of the missing N-terminal residues and prior to MD simulations. The relative orientation of LukE in each complex is somewhat different, with CCR5-bound LukE forming a more acute angle with the membrane plane compared to the ACKR1-LukE pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). However, in both cases LukE loop 4 inserts into the orthosteric pocket and interacts with ACKR1 eCL3 and TMs residues, while loop 3 interacts with eCL2. Importantly, the position of TM1 and the N-terminal region of the receptor for both toxin-receptor pairs seem compatible with sulfotyrosine interactions at site 1 and/or 2 observed in crystal structures. Indeed, ACKR1 sTyr 41 is located 10 residues upstream of Cys51 that marks the beginning of TM1, while the potentially sulfated tyrosines of CCR5 (sTyr3, sTyr10, sTyr 14, and sTyr 15) are located 5–17 residues upstream of the equivalent Cys20 at the top of CCR5 TM1. This short distance between TM1 and the sulfated tyrosines, combined with the known location of site 1 and 2 on LukE, provide an additional constraint on the possible orientations of the toxin, further suggesting the correctness of the identified docking poses.</p><p>In order to assess the stability of these poses and dock the N-terminal region of both receptors onto LukE, we ran multiple MD simulations starting from the equilibrated models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref> (see Materials and methods).

In the case of CCR5, no information is available about which of the potentially sulfated tyrosines are important for binding LukED, although all 4 tyrosines are heterogeneously sulfated in vivo, and sulfation is known to affect binding to other CCR5 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farzan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jen et al., 2009</xref>).

TR-FRET competition assays indicated that LukE can displace bound CCL2/CCL5 from their cognate receptors, confirming significant overlap between the chemokine and toxin binding surfaces on the receptors. Surprisingly, LukE competed with CCL2 for CCR2 binding with a slightly better IC50 than for the other receptors, suggesting a strong interaction between CCR2 and LukE. This indicates that even though LukED is unable to lyse CCR2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam et al., 2016</xref>), LukE can still prevent CCR2 signalling. Such competitive inhibition might exist for other chemokine receptors bearing sulfotyrosines in their N-terminus, and could play a role in SA infections by modulating inflammatory responses.</p><p>Based on the information available in the literature, it appeared that sulfotyrosine recognition may constitute a common feature of leukotoxin–GPCR interactions, which may in part explain their broad receptor specificity. We thus sought to obtain high resolution structural information regarding this type of interactions. The crystal structure of LukE in complex with p-cresyl sulfate identified 3 potential sulfotyrosine binding sites, 2 of which were also observed in the LukE structures in complex with peptides derived from the N-terminal region of ACKR1 and CCR2. We then used protein-protein docking and MD simulations to propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes that are consistent with the crystallographic data and with previous mutagenesis data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reyes-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spaan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasquez et al., 2020</xref>). Our work demonstrates that site 1 is used to bind ACKR1 sTyr 41, CCR2 sTyr 26, and CCR5 sTyr 10, while site 2 can accommodate an additional downstream sulfotyrosine such as CCR5 sTyr 14 or 15, or CCR2 sTyr 28.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conservation of the sulfotyrosine binding sites among GPCR-binding leukotoxins</title><p>Site 1 is widely conserved across leukotoxin S components, and the three arginines (Arg 85, 263, and 290 of LukE) coordinating the tyrosine sulfate are strictly conserved in HlgA, HlgC and lukS-PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> <bold>BDEG</bold>). The three hydrophobic residues that are in direct interaction with the sulfotyrosine phenyl ring (Ile103, Leu265, Phe287 of LukE) show more variability, with Leu265 mutated to Met in HlgA, and both Leu265 and Ile103 changed to Met and Arg in HlgC and LukS-PV. This high level of conservation strongly suggests that all four toxins use site 1 to recognize sulfated tyrosines in their respective receptors. These receptors contain sulfotyrosines within a YXY (CXCR2, CCR2), YXXY (C5aR1, C5aR2), or YXXXY (CCR5) motif, except for ACKR1 and CXCR1 that possess isolated sulfotyrosine residue(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Conservation of the sulfotyrosine sites in the N-terminal region of leukotoxins receptors and structural alignment of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bicomponent pore forming toxins in the sulfotyrosine binding region (site 1).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Manual sequence alignment of the sulfotyrosine motifs in the N-terminal region of the bicomponent pore forming toxin receptors.

Interestingly, a bound sulfate ion is also visible at LukS-PV site 1 in the PVL crystal structure reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2020</xref> (PDB CODE 6U3Y). Taken together, these data indicate that the sulfotyrosine - site 1 interactions observed in this study play a critical role in receptor recognition by S-components.</p><p>Site 2 is only conserved in LukE and HlgA, and likely confers to these toxins the ability to bind the second sTyr of the motif in the N-termini of CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR2.

Given the recently described interaction between ACKR1 and HlgB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grison et al., 2021</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that these residues might play a role in receptor recognition, although further experiments will be necessary to (in)validate this hypothesis. Intriguingly, the Arg residue sitting at the bottom of site 1 pocket (LukE Arg263) is conserved in all toxins, including the more distantly related lukGH. Nevertheless, F components harbour a C-terminal extension of their last β strand with an exposed acidic residue (for example LukD Glu296) that can neutralize the positively charged Arg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C, F, H, J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of the proposed ACKR1- and CCR5-LukE models for receptor binding, conformational changes and subsequent pore formation</title><p>In this study, we used computational docking and MD simulations to produce plausible models of the ACKR1- and CCR5-Luke complexes that are consistent with all available experimental data. During most MD simulations, we observed fast binding of ACKR1 sTyr 41 or CCR5 sTyr 10 to LukE Arg263 of site 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>), with an inter-residue distance going from ~3 nm to ~0.2 nm within a few hundred nanoseconds or less. Such fast binding indicates that the clustering of positive charges in site 1 generates large electrostatic forces leading to long-range attraction of the negatively charged N-terminal region of chemokine receptors. This, in turn, suggests that sulfotyrosine recognition through site 1 may be the first step in receptor recognition, followed by binding of the divergent regions/loops to the receptor’s orthosteric pocket.</p><p>Although our models offer a glimpse of how LukE might bind to ACKR1 and CCR5 orthosteric pocket, it should be emphasized that computational models are error-prone and thus might be inaccurate. Moreover, the timescale of the simulations used is limited and unable to account for potential large-scale receptor conformational changes that toxin binding may induce. For the same reason, it is not currently possible to determine from the data whether LukE- receptor binding might allosterically induce STEM release in LukE, which would be a necessary step to enable LukD binding and subsequent pore assembly without inter-protomeric steric clashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamashita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).

One of the lukF-PV/HlgB protomer is omitted for clarity. The structural alignment highlights the presence of lipid headgroup binding sites on lukF-PV that correspond to different membrane insertion depths, which we interpreted as pore and prepore membrane levels. The LukE-CCR2 peptide structure is also superimposed onto the pore and prepore structures to indicate the location of the bound sulfotyrosines (shown as cyan spheres). In the case of a fully formed pore, sTyr sulfate at site 2 is located at the same level as the PC headgroups.

Again, this might be due to model inaccuracies and/or conformational changes of the receptors unaccounted for in our modeling procedure. An alternative possibility is that receptors might serve as an assembly platform for the prepore structure but be released from the interaction prior to full pore formation. In support of this hypothesis, the crystal structure of PVL (pre)pore bound to fos-choline-14 has shown binding of 3 PC headgroups in different regions of LukF-PV corresponding to different membrane insertion depths, with the highest one compatible with the full membrane spanning pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). When compared with the sulfotyrosine-bound crystal structures reported here, this would imply that site 2 is at membrane level, which would be incompatible with receptor binding. On the contrary, the 2 other PC binding sites, which have also been identified in lukD structures, are located in regions compatible with the level of membrane insertion implied by our ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE models. Importantly, these observations are also consistent with the study by Haapasalo et al. which showed that C5a receptors dissociate from lukSF-PV upon pore formation, enabling renewed ligand binding and pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haapasalo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE models suggest that the bound toxin could make an acute angle with the membrane that may bring the preSTEM region closer to the lipid headgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), possibly playing some role in STEM release.</p><p>In summary, we have elucidated the structural basis for recognition of sulfotyrosine motifs located in the N-terminal region of leukotoxin receptors and used this data to propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE encounter complexes. We then used these models to design LukE mutants that disrupt key interactions within the modelled complexes, and showed that the mutants lost their receptor binding activity in the TR-FRET assay. Although the combination of crystallographic and mutagenesis data provide substantial validation for these models, they might still suffer from inaccuracies and may be further improved by additional interface mapping through biophysical approaches (such as HDX-MS or NMR for instance). They also constitute a starting point to design strategies to obtain high-resolution structural data, as, so far, the purified complexes were reluctant to LCP crystallography and cryoEM analyses. However, in the absence of high resolution cryoEM or x-ray structures of full-length GPCR-toxin complexes, these models help refine our understanding of the mechanisms driving receptor recognition and subsequent pore formation by SA leukotoxins. Sulfotyrosine site 1 additionally appears to have a unique architecture, which is distinct from the recognition motifs used by chemokines. The binding site is widely conserved across S-components, suggesting that this pocket might be a promising target for structure-based design of inhibitors preventing receptor recognition. Such inhibitors might be active against a broad range of SA strains expressing different leukotoxins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein constructs and reagents</title><p>The synthetic gene of <italic>S. aureus</italic> LukEv (UniprotKB-Q2FXB0) residue 12–311 (the product of which was successfully expressed and crystallized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nocadello et al., 2016</xref>) was subcloned into popinE vector (OPPF-UK), resulting in a construct bearing a part of the N-terminal signal sequence (<sup>12</sup>SVGLIAPLASPIQESRA<sup>28</sup>) and a C-terminal K(H)<sub>6</sub>-tag.

The v-rescale thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat were used to maintain a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm. Each system was energy minimized using 1,000 steps of steepest descent and equilibrated for 200 ps with restrained protein heavy atoms. A single 500 ns production simulation was run using each forcefield. RMSF and radius of gyration were calculated using GROMACS routines. Snapshots were extracted every 500 ps, resulting in a pool of 2,000 models. Theoretical SAXS patterns were calculated with the program CRYSOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Svergun et al., 1995</xref>) and ensemble fitting was performed with GAJOE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernadó et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Peptide synthesis</title><p>ACKR1 <italic><bold><sup>34</sup>DSFPDGDsYGANLE<sup>46</sup></bold> and CCR2 <bold><sup>25</sup>DsYDsYG<sup>29</sup></bold></italic> sulfopeptides used in crystal soaking experiments were synthesized using solid-phase synthesis (SPPS) methodology with Fmoc/tBu protocol and all amino acids were incorporated into the sequence by the building block approach.

LukE was concentrated to about 12 mg/ml (390 µM) in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 75 mM NaCl, and in the presence of 6 molar equivalents of the ACKR1 sulfopeptide. The protein crystallized after ~3–7 days at 20°C in 0.1 M imidazole.HCl pH 8.0, 30% (w/v) MPD, 10% (w/v) PEG 4000 (apo1 condition), or in 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.05 M magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.5% and 22.5 % v/v PEG Smear Medium (BCS screen from Molecular Dimensions) (apo2 condition). These crystals led to the apo structures (apo1 and 2, respectively). No sign of the sulfopeptide was observed in the electron density. Consequently, new crystals were produced in the apo1 crystallization condition in order to perform crystal soaking experiments. A single crystal was obtained and broken into three pieces, each of which were incubated in mother liquor supplemented with either p-cresol sulfate, CCR2 or ACKR1 sulfopeptide (all in powder form) for 3 days. Crystals were then frozen in liquid nitrogen after being soaked in mineral oil. Diffraction data were recorded on the MASSIF-1 beamline at the ESRF, Grenoble, France (soaks), or on the X06DA beamline at the Swiss Light Source (apo 1 and 2).

In the absence of a high-resolution structure for ACKR1, we used an ensemble of six MD simulation-derived models that have been partially validated using H/DX mass spectrometry data in our previous ACKR1 study (ref biorxiv). Each model was docked to the LukE apo1 structure using default parameters (six runs).

The active residues of LukE were defined as Tyr96, Asp197, Pro215, and Arg275, which are located respectively in loop 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE MD systems were then set up using the CHARMM-GUI membrane builder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The starting models were each inserted into a hydrated, equilibrated bilayer composed of approximately 500 2-Oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 100 cholesterol molecules. Sodium and chloride ions were added to neutralize the system, reaching a final concentration of approximately 150 mM. Molecular dynamics calculations were performed in GROMACS 2020 using the CHARMM36m force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) and the CHARMM TIP3P water model. Forcefield parameters for sulfotyrosine were obtained by combining CHARMM topologies from related molecules. The input systems were subjected to energy minimization, equilibration and production simulation using the GROMACS input scripts generated by CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). The temperature and pressure were held at 310.15 K and 1 bar, respectively. During production simulations an NPT ensemble was used with semi-isotropic pressure coupling via the Parrinello-Rahman barostat method while the Nose-Hoover thermostat was used to maintain a temperature of 310.15 K. A leapfrog integration scheme was used, and all bonds were constrained allowing for a time-step of 2 ps to be used during NPT equilibration and production MD simulations. For each system, we performed three production runs and subsequently analyzed the resulting trajectories using GROMACS tools to yield iRMSD, complex BSA, number of interchain hydrogen bonds and inter-residue distances.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>AWH molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The AWH method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lindahl et al., 2014</xref>) is an adaptive biasing method implemented in GROMACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hess et al., 2008</xref>). This method enables the calculation of PMF profiles along (a) chosen reaction coordinate(s), and functions by applying a time-dependent biasing potential that flattens free energy barriers along the reaction path. In the case of ACKR1-LukE, the sTyr 41 – Arg263 and sTyr41 – Tyr269 COM distances were defined as a two-dimensional reaction coordinate to report on site 1 and site 2 sulfotyrosine interactions. The sampling interval was 0.2–3.5 nm. The force constant and initial error for AWH calculations were set to 10,000 kJ/mol/nm<sup>2</sup> and 10 kJ/mol, respectively. An estimated diffusion parameter of 1.10<sup>–5</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>/ps was used for each coordinate dimension. A free energy cutoff of 50 kJ/mol was applied to the AWH target distribution to avoid sampling of very high free energy regions. A single trajectory of 2.147 µs was calculated in GROMACS. The free energy profiles at different simulation times were constructed using the gmx awh program included in GROMACS. The final PMF seemed converged with no major change taking place after about 1.8 µs when it exited the initial stage. The estimated AWH target error at the end of the simulation was ~2.2 kJ/mol (down from 10 kJ/mol at the start). In the case of CCR5-LukE, the sTyr 10 – Arg263 and sTyr10 – Tyr269 COM distances were defined as a two-dimensional reaction coordinate. Simulation parameters were the same as for the ACKR1-LukE system. A single trajectory of 2.050 µs was calculated in GROMACS. The simulation exited the initial stage and started converging quickly after sampling its global minimum multiple times in the first 100 ns.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72555-transrepform1-v4.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Diffraction data have been deposited in PDB under the accession codes 7P8T, 7P8S, 7P8U, 7P8X and 7P93.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that while the study is quite extensive in its scope and clearly deals with an important biomedical phenomenon, there are multiple concerns about the study which the authors would have to clarify through additional experiments. For example, the reviewers agree that the manuscript needs further experimental studies using biophysical techniques to validate computational models. As concluded by the authors, models based on a combination of crystallographic and mutagenesis data may be further improved by biophysical data, as for example derived from HDX-MS or NMR. Including such experimental data would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Specific Comments to the Authors:</p><p>1. Regarding the MD simulations:</p><p>a. What was the rationale for simulation using two force fields? Was it simply to generate diverse conformational libraries for EROS?</p><p>b. The authors carried out AWH MD simulations of the ACKR1-LukE, what about the CCR5-LukE system? The authors should include these results or explain why it is missing.</p><p>c. Related to this, a more concise presentation of the MD simulations would be to only present AWH MD simulations of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE. The conventional MD results don't add much to the story. The author might even consider removing the results and figures associated with conventional MD or putting them in supporting information less dramatically. Using the AWH simulations and their PMFs, the authors can harvest and show the snapshots at the dominant local minima and use those structures as the MD-based models of these complexes. And instead of analyzing the structures in the final 300 ns (Figure 5), which is a bit arbitrary, analyze and show the details of the most probable structures.</p><p>2. In the abstract, would it be possible to include the common names for erythrocytes and leukocytes in parentheses, i.e., erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells)? This change might make the abstract even more accessible to a broader audience.</p><p>9. X-ray structures of LukE: Of the multiple high-resolution structures shown by the authors the apo and p-cresol sulfate bound structures are fairly convincing. The structures in complex the two receptor peptides &quot;DSFPDGDsYGANLE&quot; and &quot;DsYDsYG&quot; have multiple issues.</p><p>a. The longer peptide complex shows very weak 2FoFc density and I can see density clearly only when I contour the map at a level of 0.4 which is very low. At the usual contour level that one uses for a structure of this resolution, say around 0.8 to 1, there are serious breaks in the density and only the sulfated tyrosine sidechain looks reasonable.</p><p>b. The authors make no attempt to show the omit density for any of the bound ligands (a standard practice) and do not comment on the weak quality of the peptide density.</p><p>c. The DSFPDGDsYGANLE peptide is also given an occupancy of just 0.3 which is very low and I am therefore not very convinced about this peptide binding site.</p><p>d. Moreover, there are two of these peptides bound at site 1 and site 2 and the authors do not make it clear to which of the two peptides binding sites they think is the binding site for the native receptor, before proceeding to explain the structure with double sulfated tyrosine peptide complex.</p><p>e. The density for the peptide &quot;DsYDsYG&quot; from CCR2 is only marginally better (again modeled at low occupancy) and here also there are breaks in 2FoFc map at the normal contour levels. The peptide however interacts with both site 1 and 2 suggesting that this could be a stronger interaction. The lack of omit or polder maps in the manuscript for the ligand-bound LukE is quite surprising.</p><p>10. LukE peptide interaction affinities: Although the authors have performed crystallographic analysis, there would be much more confidence if binding assays of the two peptides and p-cresol sulfate are done with LukE to obtain affinity and stoichiometry of the interaction. The ability of the CCR2 double sulfated peptide interacting at sites 1 and 2 could further serve as a basis to understand the high affinity of LukE to CCR2 in comparison to AckR1.</p><p>11. Docking and interaction analysis: While the authors have generated their docking based on prior mutant information and the docked model seems largely convincing, I hope to see some low-resolution experimental data to be convinced about this organization. Can the authors potentially look to obtain a low-resolution electron microscopy image or 2D classes (a fairly routine exercise) of LukE complexed with CCR2 to further validate their modeled complex? This will go a long way in enhancing the confidence in the findings.</p><p>12. Also, can the authors clarify the effects of mutating Arg275 of LukE on its ability to interact with the receptor? If the interaction interface is accurate, mutating this residue should significantly weaken this interaction.</p><p>13. Authors referenced previous SPR studies characterizing the interaction between LukE and CCR5/ACKR1 receptors and could also use a similar approach to validate computational models using a carefully selected set of point mutations.</p><p>14. TR-FRET assay could be used to evaluate the effect of mutations in LukE disrupting the complexes with cytokine receptors.</p><p>15. Crystal structures of the complex between LukE and ligands may be biased by crystal pacing and may also reflect non-native interactions when soaked at high ligand concentrations. Binding sites for sulfated tyrosines should be validated experimentally, for example using NMR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72555.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that while the study is quite extensive in its scope and clearly deals with an important biomedical phenomenon, there are multiple concerns about the study which the authors would have to clarify through additional experiments.

The AMBER99SB-ILDN* force field tends to favor collapsed states for the intrinsically disordered regions (signal peptide and polyhistidine tag in this case), while the AMBER99SBWS force field samples more effectively the extended conformations. We have clarified this point for the reader by adding this information in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors carried out AWH MD simulations of the ACKR1-LukE, what about the CCR5-LukE system? The authors should include these results or explain why it is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason why we didn’t perform the AWH MD simulations of the CCR5-LukE system is because we thought that the classical MD simulations were already pretty convincing for that system (given that all 3 MD trajectories showed binding of sTyr10 at site 1 on the toxin). In the case of ACKR1-LukE, only two out of three MD trajectories showed binding of sTyr41 at site 1, so we deemed it worthwhile to use AWH MD to further validate the model.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have now produced a 2.05 µs AWH MD trajectory of CCR5-LukE, which confirms the results obtained in classical MD, showing binding of sTyr10 at site 1 and sTyr14 at site 2 at the dominant local energy minimum. The results are shown in figure 8, and the results and methods sections have been updated accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Related to this, a more concise presentation of the MD simulations would be to only present AWH MD simulations of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE. The conventional MD results don't add much to the story. The author might even consider removing the results and figures associated with conventional MD or putting them in supporting information less dramatically. Using the AWH simulations and their PMFs, the authors can harvest and show the snapshots at the dominant local minima and use those structures as the MD-based models of these complexes.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the idea of using the snapshots from the dominant local minimum of the AWH simulations is attractive, we think the conventional MD model shows better agreement with the experimental data at the level of the orthosteric pocket interactions with LukE. This is true at least for the ACKR1LukE system, where we observed that the conventional MD model forms a tightly packed hydrophobic cluster involving Tyr279, Phe273 from LukE and Cys51-Cys276 from ACKR1 (which are SS linked). This is consistent with the study by (Spaan et al. ,2015) who found that Cys51 to Ser mutation in ACKR1 had a strong impact on LukED activity (but not HlgAB). On the contrary, in the AWH-extracted models of ACKR1-LukE, the disulfide bridged Cys51-Cys276 are not interacting with LukE because of conformational rearrangements at the receptor-toxin interface. Similarly, when we compare conventional MD and AWH models of CCR5-LukE, the toxin seems to insert less deeply into the orthosteric pocket in the AWH models.</p><p>Our AWH simulations are designed to calculate the potential of mean force along the chosen reaction coordinate, which corresponds to distances between ACKR1 sTyr41 (or CCR5 sTyr10) and LukE Arg263 or Tyr269 located at site 1 and 2. The bias introduced to the simulation greatly increase the conformational sampling along the reaction coordinate and effectively reconstitutes the PMF, however it is possible that this extra energy may indirectly destabilize other regions of the protein complex (such as the orthosteric pocket interaction site). It is also possible that the most stable conformation that can be reached for the sulfotyrosine site 1 interaction would be incompatible with the most stable conformation of the orthosteric pocket interface, putting the complex in a dynamic equilibrium. In any case, there is no theoretical reason for the most stable AWH models to represent the most stable state of the orthosteric pocket interaction site because the chosen reaction coordinate doesn’t report on this region of the receptor-toxin complex. For these reasons, we believe that conventional and AWH MD approaches are complementary and we do not want to emphasize one over the other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And instead of analyzing the structures in the final 300 ns (Figure 5), which is a bit arbitrary, analyze and show the details of the most probable structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that analyzing the most probable structures would indeed be a more rigorous approach. We have performed clustering analysis on the conventional MD trajectories of ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE, and selected the middle structure of the largest cluster as MD-based models of these complexes (RMSD of about 1Å with the models previously used). The close ups in figure 5 and 7 have been updated accordingly. This sentence was added to the figure legends “The MD model of ACKR1-LukE (or CCR5-LukE in Figure 7) corresponds to the middle structure of the largest cluster in the MD trajectory ”. The models resulting from the clustering analysis have been added as source data to Figure 5 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 1B, where did the full signal peptide come from? It does not appear in the crystal structure, was it modeled?</p></disp-quote><p>The signal peptide (without residues 1 to 11, not present in the construct) was modeled in order to generate a conformational ensemble of LukE and fit the SAXS data. We started from the APO2 structure in which residues 12-23 were already visible, and added the missing residues (residues 2428, but also the C-terminal polyhistidine tag). When fitting SAXS data using ensembles of models, it is critical that the model has all the residues that were present in the construct including tags and disordered regions. This information has been added to the methods section (Molecular dynamics and ensemble optimization of LukE).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. X-ray structures of LukE: Of the multiple high-resolution structures shown by the authors the apo and p-cresol sulfate bound structures are fairly convincing. The structures in complex the two receptor peptides &quot;DSFPDGDsYGANLE&quot; and &quot;DsYDsYG&quot; have multiple issues.</p><p>a. The longer peptide complex shows very weak 2FoFc density and I can see density clearly only when I contour the map at a level of 0.4 which is very low. At the usual contour level that one uses for a structure of this resolution, say around 0.8 to 1, there are serious breaks in the density and only the sulfated tyrosine sidechain looks reasonable.</p></disp-quote><p>We think part of the issue is because we performed all the structure refinement in Buster but we ran a quick refinement in Phenix on the final &quot;DSFPDGDsYGANLE&quot; and &quot;DsYDsYG&quot; structures. After initial submission, we were asked to provide pdb and mtz files for each structure, and we uploaded both the Phenix and Buster refinements. We have produced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> with Coot snapshots of the different maps for the &quot;DSFPDGDsYGANLE&quot; structure. In Buster, the &quot;DSFPDGDsYGANLE&quot; structure has reasonable density for the 2 peptide chains (B and M), although both chains have occupancies of only 0.3 to 0.6 (with the strongest signal for the sulfotyrosines at 0.66 and 0.69 occupancy). There is only a small chain break when the map is contoured at 1σ at Gly42 of chain M. however, the final Buster structure still has a lot of positive signal in the Fo-Fc difference map at 3σ, but most of the signal vanishes at 4σ (panels B and C in the figure). We think this signal comes from structural heterogeneity in the bound conformation of the peptide, such as the presence of alternative minor populations. We then decided to run a refinement using Phenix, which has a different method for computing the electron density maps compared to Buster – in order to see if the signal in the difference map is also present. The Phenix refined structure shows no significant signal in the difference map at 3σ, but the electron density for peptide chain M is very faint in the 2Fo-Fc map, except for the sulfotyrosine (panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72555-sa2-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors make no attempt to show the omit density for any of the bound ligands (a standard practice) and do not comment on the weak quality of the peptide density.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now produced a figure that shows the Polder maps contoured at 2.5 σ for each structure. We have also added some text to comment on the weak quality of the peptide density. “Although the signal for each sulfotyrosine is fairly strong, the electron density of the other peptide residues is weaker, particularly for the 1<sup>st</sup> peptide (see Polder map in figure S4B). This is apparent in the refined occupancies which are ~ 0.7 for the sulfotyrosines, but only 0.3 to 0.6 for the other peptide residues.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The DSFPDGDsYGANLE peptide is also given an occupancy of just 0.3 which is very low and I am therefore not very convinced about this peptide binding site.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that parts of the peptide have a low occupancy value of 0.3. It was however still possible to build them using the high quality maps from Buster, and we are fairly confident in the quality of our model, also given the high resolution of the dataset. It is our experience with a variety of protein crystals that Buster tends to produce better quality maps than other refinement programs, which sometimes is critical when dealing with weak or ambiguous ligand density. As can be seen in panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, it might not have been possible to build anything beyond the sulfotyrosine of chain M using the maps from Phenix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Moreover, there are two of these peptides bound at site 1 and site 2 and the authors do not make it clear to which of the two peptides binding sites they think is the binding site for the native receptor, before proceeding to explain the structure with double sulfated tyrosine peptide complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we didn’t make this point particularly clear. The peptide that is bound at site 2 and has the highest overall occupancy, is running upside down on the toxin surface (the C-terminus is going away from the direction of the membrane surface). In addition, a symmetry-related LukE molecule also interacts with the sulfate group of the sulfotyrosine. The peptide bound at site 1 has is C-terminus going toward the membrane and doesn’t interact with any symmetry related molecule. However, its conformation can still be influenced by crystal packing and obviously by the presence of the other peptide molecule as well. For these reasons, we think that the conformations of the peptides don’t necessarily carry biological meaning (but maybe only biophysical meaning), and that only the location of the sulfotyrosine binding sites can be inferred with confidence from these structures. We have added some text to clarify this point. “Although the conformation of both peptides is stabilized by multiple interactions with LukE, it should be noted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> peptide chain runs with its C-terminus going away from the putative location of the membrane. In addition, the occupancy is relatively low and the conformation of the peptides is likely influenced by crystal packing and the associated steric constraints.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. The density for the peptide &quot;DsYDsYG&quot; from CCR2 is only marginally better (again modeled at low occupancy) and here also there are breaks in 2FoFc map at the normal contour levels. The peptide however interacts with both site 1 and 2 suggesting that this could be a stronger interaction. The lack of omit or polder maps in the manuscript for the ligand-bound LukE is quite surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to the other peptide structure, the maps obtained from Buster for the &quot;DsYDsYG&quot; structure show a stronger density for the peptide compared to Phenix. The occupancy is 0.98 for site 1 sulfotyrosine (2 alternate conformations modelled, 0.49 occupancy each) and 0.56 for site 2 sulfotyrosine. There also seems to be a lot of conformational heterogeneity for this bound peptide, with at least 2 distinct possibilities as we show in figure S4 C and D. There is one chain break at Asp27, and we believe this is due to this residue being disordered because of the conformational equilibrium of the peptide adopting different bound conformations. We have added a figure with the POLDER omit map contoured at 2.5 σ, to complement the 2Fo-Fc map at 1σ shown in figure S4. And we have also added some text to comment on the occupancy and weak electron density. “This is consistent with the lower occupancy for site 2 versus site 1 sulfotyrosine (0.56 and 0.98), and the presence of a chain break at Asp27 in the electron density (Figure S3). These observations indicate that the binding of the doubly sulfated CCR2 peptide is highly dynamic within the crystal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. LukE peptide interaction affinities: Although the authors have performed crystallographic analysis, there would be much more confidence if binding assays of the two peptides and p-cresol sulfate are done with LukE to obtain affinity and stoichiometry of the interaction. The ability of the CCR2 double sulfated peptide interacting at sites 1 and 2 could further serve as a basis to understand the high affinity of LukE to CCR2 in comparison to AckR1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to use binding assays in order to determine the affinity and stoichiometry of the interaction between LukE and the peptides, or p-cresol sulfate. Such data could also help understand if the interaction at site 1 and 2 for the CCR2 peptide is responsible for the more effective inhibition of CCL2 binding on CCR2 in the TR-FRET assay. We are currently running HDX-MS combined with native MS analysis to explore the effect of the presence of the peptides on toxins dynamics and map binding sites. Our preliminary data confirms peptide binding, however this binding does not only impact the HDX of the direct binding sites but also leads to important conformational changes within the toxins, which we are currently analysing. In addition, binding of the peptides might influence toxin’s propensity of oligomerise, which makes it more complicated to quantify an affinity to one binding site. We do not wish to include this data in the manuscript because it would add unnecessary complexity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Docking and interaction analysis: While the authors have generated their docking based on prior mutant information and the docked model seems largely convincing, I hope to see some low-resolution experimental data to be convinced about this organization. Can the authors potentially look to obtain a low-resolution electron microscopy image or 2D classes (a fairly routine exercise) of LukE complexed with CCR2 to further validate their modeled complex? This will go a long way in enhancing the confidence in the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>The characterization of the chemokine receptors in complex with LukE (and other family members) using electron microscopy has been challenging for several reasons. LukE tends to interact with the carbohydrate-based gel filtration column matrices, and also has some affinity for the detergent molecules that are used to solubilize the receptor (DDM, LMNG…), which makes complex purification difficult using standard approaches. The complexes can however be isolated using affinity tag based purifications, but the yield is generally low due to partial dissociation during the washing steps. We did obtain some cryoEM images of ACKR1-LukE on a TALOS microscope, but small size and particle heterogeneity precluded analysis. We have also analysed a CCR5-LukE sample using negative stain EM, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Although we could identify particles with the expected size and shape, the quality of the data is poor and we don’t think it deserves to be included in this manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72555-sa2-fig2-v4.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.
