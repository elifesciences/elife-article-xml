excessive stress signaling. We found that Wallenda (Wnd), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of DLK, is highly enriched in the axon terminals of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons in vivo and that this subcellular localization is necessary for Highwire-mediated Wnd protein turnover under normal conditions. Our structure-function analysis found that Wnd palmitoylation is essential for its axon terminal localization. Palmitoylation-defective Wnd accumulated in neuronal cell bodies, exhibited dramatically increased protein expression levels, and triggered excessive neuronal stress responses. Defective intracellular transport is implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. Comprehensive dominant-negative Rab protein screening identified Rab11 as an essential factor for Wnd localization in axon terminals. Consequently, <italic>Rab11</italic> loss-of-function increased the protein levels of Wnd and induced neuronal stress responses. Inhibiting Wnd activity significantly ameliorated neuronal loss and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling triggered by <italic>Rab11</italic> loss-of-function. Taken together, these suggest that DLK proteins are constantly transported to axon terminals for protein turnover and a failure of such transport can lead to neuronal loss. Our study demonstrates how subcellular protein localization is coupled to protein turnover for neuronal stress signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuronal stress</kwd><kwd>DLK</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>protein turnover</kwd><kwd>Rab11</kwd><kwd>Highwire</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS116463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seung Mi</given-names></name><name><surname>Quagraine</surname><given-names>Yaw</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Monika</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jung Hwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 GM145646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seung Mi</given-names></name><name><surname>Quagraine</surname><given-names>Yaw</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Monika</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jung Hwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 GM103440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seung Mi</given-names></name><name><surname>Quagraine</surname><given-names>Yaw</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Monika</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jung Hwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Coupling between subcellular localization and protein turnover of a neuronal stress kinase, DLK, and its role in neuronal stress responses in Drosophila.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A typical neuron is composed of distinct somatodendritic and axonal compartments that express unique compositions of membrane and cytoplasmic proteins, which are precisely established and maintained through a complex network of intracellular transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guedes-Dias and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillaud et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, impaired neuronal intracellular transport has been recognized as an early cellular event in various neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collard et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Vos and Hafezparast, 2017</xref>), Alzheimer’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), Parkinson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saha et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2012</xref>), and Huntington’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reddy and Shirendeb, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). The intricate regulation of intracellular transport relies on a family of small G proteins known as Rab (Ras-related in the brain) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Studies have demonstrated altered Rab activity or expression levels in Huntington’s disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2009b</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pensalfini et al., 2020</xref>), and from the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitra et al., 2019</xref>). However, how defective neuronal intracellular transport leads to neuronal loss is not fully understood.</p><p>DLK, also known as MAP3K12 is a cytoplasmic protein kinase essential for stress signaling and mediates diverse neuronal responses including axon regeneration, axon degeneration, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiong and Collins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Under normal conditions, neurons tightly control DLK activity to prevent excessive stress signaling primarily through protein turnover by an evolutionarily conserved PHR1/RPM-1/Highwire (Hiw) ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, recent studies have shown potential widespread involvement of DLK in neuronal death observed in neurotrophic factor deprivation, glaucoma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Welsbie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larhammar et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). These observations suggest the possibility of dysregulated or elevated DLK protein/activity levels in these conditions. Interestingly, DLK proteins are found within axonal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klinedinst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niu et al., 2022</xref>). However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying DLK protein localization in axonal compartments and how such axonal localization of DLK plays a role in neuronal stress responses.</p><p>Here, we report a novel coupling between axon terminal localization and protein turnover of DLK. We further found that Rab11 is essential for this coupling, which when disrupted, leads to neuronal loss by excessive stress signaling. We found that Wallenda (Wnd), <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLK is highly enriched in the axon terminals of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons in vivo. Furthermore, we found that Wnd protein turnover by Hiw is confined to axon terminals. We identified a protein palmitoylation on Wnd as an essential motif for Wnd protein localization in axon terminals. By taking advantage of this unique behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLK, Wnd in its reliance on protein palmitoylation for axonal localization, we demonstrated that Wnd protein turnover is greatly diminished when Wnd proteins are not transported to axon terminals, which in turn causes excessive Wnd signaling and neuronal cell death. We further uncovered the selective role of Rab11 in Wnd axonal localization and protein turnover. Importantly, neuronal stress responses caused by <italic>Rab11</italic> loss-of-function were significantly mitigated by inhibiting Wnd. Together, our findings suggest that Rab11 suppresses DLK protein levels by coupling axonal localization and protein turnover of DLK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wnd is highly enriched in axon terminals and Wnd protein turnover is restricted to axon terminals</title><p>DLK proteins are found in the axonal compartments of diverse animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niu et al., 2022</xref>). To understand the mechanism of DLK axonal localization, we first set out to investigate the extent of axonal localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLK, Wnd. We took advantage of a <italic>wnd</italic> protein-trap allele, <italic>Mi{MIC}wnd<sup>GFSTF</sup></italic>, which allows us to visualize endogenous Wnd protein localization via an EGFP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venken et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The levels of Wnd-GFSTF proteins in the third instar larva stage were extremely low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). To enhance the detection of Wnd-GFSTF, the experiment was performed in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants, <italic>hiw<sup>ΔN</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Hiw is a neuronal ubiquitin ligase that selectively targets Wnd for protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). Immunostaining was conducted using an anti-GFP antibody, and the larval samples were examined using a confocal microscope. The result showed a strikingly polarized expression pattern of Wnd. While Wnd-GFSTF expression was evident in the neuropil region in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), we could not detect any meaningful signal from neuronal cell bodies, especially from the peripheral nervous system neurons. Neuropils are enriched in neuronal dendrites and axons, while neuronal cell bodies are mostly absent in this region. This suggests that Wnd protein expression levels are kept extremely low in neuronal cell bodies but enriched in neuronal processes likely in axon terminals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wallenda (Wnd) protein turnover by Highwire (Hiw) is restricted in the axon terminals of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons.</title><p>Wnd is highly enriched in axon terminals (<bold>A–D</bold>).

We generated Wnd-GFP transgenes with and without <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA’s untranslated region (UTR), namely 5'UTR-Wnd::GFP-3'UTR and Wnd::GFP to test the role of <italic>wnd</italic>-UTRs in Wnd protein localization. These transgenes were expressed specifically in larval class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons using the <italic>ppk</italic>-GAL4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grueber et al., 2007</xref>). C4da neurons have their cell bodies positioned in the larval body wall, where they extend dendrites and send axons to the VNC of the larval central nervous system. This sensory neuron system provides an excellent opportunity for studying protein localization in cell bodies, dendrites, and axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grueber et al., 2007</xref>). We quantified the expression levels of Wnd transgenes in the cell bodies and axon terminals of C4da neurons using quantitative confocal microscope imaging. The expression levels were normalized using a general membrane marker, mCD8::RFP. The expression levels of mCD8::RFP in axon terminals may represent passive diffusion of membrane proteins, which reports the absence of axonal enrichment or equals to the axonal enrichment of 1. We observed a significant enrichment of Wnd in the axon terminals of C4da neurons, regardless of <italic>wnd</italic>-UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Overactive Wnd signaling impairs <italic>ppk</italic>-GAL4 activity, compounding our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). To address this, we treated larvae with DLKi/GNE-3511, a specific inhibitor of DLK/Wnd kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo and DiAntonio, 2019</xref>). The treatment with DLKi did not affect larval viability or basal Cd4a morphology. Additionally, a kinase-dead version of Wnd, Wnd-KD::GFP, exhibited similar axonal enrichment in comparison to Wnd::GFP in the presence and absence of DLKi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>What might be the biological significance of such high axon terminal enrichment of Wnd proteins? Interestingly, a previous work has shown that nerve injury in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae increased Wnd protein levels in proximal axons but not in motor neuron cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests that injury signal does not affect Wnd protein levels in neuronal cell bodies. Thus, we wondered whether Wnd protein degradation under normal conditions is also compartment-specific. To test this possibility, we expressed Wnd-KD::GFP in C4da neurons of wild-type and <italic>hiw</italic> mutant animals (<italic>hiw<sup>ΔN</sup></italic>). The expression levels of Wnd-KD::GFP was measured in C4da cell bodies and C4da axon terminals by quantitative confocal microscope imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

DLK proteins act as a sensor in neuronal stress responses, and under normal conditions, their protein levels are constantly suppressed to prevent undesired stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). In this context, if Wnd localization in axon terminals is disrupted, it may lead to dysregulated Wnd protein expression levels, potentially resulting in exacerbated stress signaling.

Together these further suggest that Wnd protein localization in axon terminals are through axonal anterograde transport of Wnd proteins, and that Wnd protein degradation is dependent on this axonal anterograde transport. Protein transport often involves small protein domains or motifs. To find the motifs necessary for the axonal transport of Wnd, we performed a structure-function analysis by progressively deleting 100 amino acids (aa) from Wnd transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These Wnd transgenes were expressed in C4da neurons, and the axonal enrichment of Wnd was measured as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.

Similarly, deleting aa 101–200 of Wnd (WndΔ101–200::GFP) led to a dramatic decrease in Wnd localization in axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

A failure in this coupling leads to dysregulated Wnd protein turnover and triggers excessive stress signaling. We further uncover the role of Rab11 in this coupling.</p><p>Many neuronal proteins exhibit polarized protein expression patterns. DLK proteins are found in the axonal compartments of diverse animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klinedinst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niu et al., 2022</xref>). However, the extent of DLK axonal localization has not been thoroughly studied, presumably because of technical limitations. We employed <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval sensory neurons to answer this question. Our data suggests that Wnd proteins are highly enriched in the axon terminals of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Given that Wnd encodes a cytoplasmic protein, the extent of axonal enrichment was rather surprising. Wnd protein levels are constantly suppressed by Hiw in the axon terminals. Without such suppression, Wnd proteins would show well over 70-fold enrichment in axons. The UTRs of <italic>wnd</italic> are dispensable for Wnd axonal enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which suggests that axonal anterograde transport of Wnd is responsible for such axonal enrichment. This is supported by previous observations of DLK proteins on membrane vesicles undergoing both anterograde and retrograde transport in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these indicate that Wnd proteins are synthesized in the neuronal cell body and subsequently transported into axon terminals through a highly active and efficient anterograde transport process.</p><p>What might be such a transport mechanism? DLK genes encode cytoplasmic proteins. Protein palmitoylation is an important post-translational mechanism for protein transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aicart-Ramos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tortosa and Hoogenraad, 2018</xref>). It increases the hydrophobicity of target proteins to aid membrane association so that palmitoylated proteins are transported along with the membrane vesicles they associate. In our study, we found that protein palmitoylation on Wnd at the Cysteine residue 130 (Wnd-C130) is essential for its axonal localization. Interestingly, the palmitoylation-defective mutant Wnd-C130S exhibited large punctate structures in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which colocalized with the somatic Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that Wnd-C130 palmitoylation is not solely responsible for membrane association. The presence of residual palmitoylation in Wnd-C130S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) may indicate the existence of an additional palmitoylation site, which may explain how Wnd-C130S associates with the Golgi. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have shown that DLK proteins in mammalian cells and <italic>C. elegans</italic> are palmitoylated on a single Cysteine residue, and when this residue is mutated, the proteins exhibit a diffuse cytoplasmic expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holland et al., 2016</xref>). These observations raise the question of why Wnd-C130S, with its residual palmitoylation and membrane association, fails to be transported to axon terminals. Interestingly, a recent research has proposed a role for protein palmitoylation in anterograde transport within the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>). We envision that Wnd-C130 palmitoylation is a necessary sorting step towards the axonal anterograde transport from the somatic Golgi complex rather than merely acting as a membrane anchor.</p><p>The role of Rab11 in Wnd axonal targeting and protein turnover uncovered by our DN-Rab screening suggests a role of RE in these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Rab11 plays a critical role in membrane trafficking events at the RE and is often used as a marker for the RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taguchi, 2013</xref>). It is involved in the anterograde transport of cargo from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane through the RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Satoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taguchi, 2013</xref>). We envision that once Wnd is palmitoylated, it is sorted at the peri-nuclear RE for subsequent axonal anterograde transport. Our observation of significant colocalization between Wnd proteins and Rab11-positive puncta in C4da cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) but not in axon terminals or in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) supports the idea that Wnd proteins are associated with the RE during their anterograde transport. These further suggest that Rab11 is not directly involved in the anterograde long-distance transport of Wnd proteins, but rather is responsible for sorting Wnd into the axonal anterograde transporting vesicles.</p><p>Inhibiting Rab11 activity led to increased Wnd protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Reduced activity or expression levels of Rab11 have been reported in experimental models of Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rai and Kumar Roy, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies point to the involvement of DLK in multiple neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Welsbie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larhammar et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). These raise a tantalizing possibility that disrupted anterograde transport of DLK, and subsequent dysregulated DLK protein turnover, could be a contributing factor in these neurodegenerative disorders. In this regard, it is highly encouraging that inhibiting Wnd activity mitigated the neuronal loss and JNK activation by <italic>Rab11</italic> loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Further investigations are needed to elucidate the causal role of dysregulated DLK protein turnover in neurodegenerative conditions and to better understand the interplay between Rab11-mediated transport, protein turnover, and DLK-mediated stress signaling.</p><p>The mechanism by which Hiw performs compartmentalized Wnd protein turnover in axons is an interesting question. There are several possibilities to consider. One possibility is that Hiw protein itself is specifically present in the axon terminals and not in the cell body. Studies have shown that Phr1, the mammalian homolog of Hiw, is expressed in axonal segments of motor neuron explants and in the axon shaft of sensory neurons, but its expression in the growth cone is low or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewcock et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is not known whether Hiw proteins are present in the cell body and to what extent. Unfortunately, the lack of an immunostaining compatible Hiw antibody has limited our ability to test this possibility. Nevertheless, transgenic expression of GFP::Hiw in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown significantly higher expression in the motor neuron cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, a study has demonstrated that Hiw controls the expression of dNMNAT2, a substrate of Hiw, both in the cell body and the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). These observations suggest that Hiw expression itself may not be restricted to the axon terminals. Another possibility is that DLK proteins are protected from PHR1/RMP-1/Hiw-mediated protein turnover in the cell body. DLK protein stability can be enhanced by Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karney-Grobe et al., 2018</xref>), protein phosphorylation by JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>), and PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hao et al., 2016</xref>). These protective pathways may collaborate with PHR1/RMP-1/Hiw to execute axon-specific protein turnover of DLK proteins. Understanding the interplay between these protective mechanisms and PHR1/RMP-1/Hiw in regulating DLK protein turnover will provide valuable insights on subcellular-specific Wnd protein turnover.</p><p>The coupling between axonal transport and protein turnover of DLK proteins may have important implications in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have implicated DLK as a central player in neuronal death, including in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Welsbie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larhammar et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larhammar et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). Defective axonal transport is a common feature observed in many neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Vos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), and it has been proposed to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, studies have reported increased DLK protein levels in neuronal cell bodies following neuronal insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, DLK signaling has been shown to be activated by cytoskeletal disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valakh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valakh et al., 2015</xref>), which may impair cytoskeleton-based axonal transport. This raises an intriguing possibility that disrupted axonal transport, leading to the accumulation of DLK proteins, could be a contributing factor for DLK activation and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains, rearing, DNA constructs for generating transgenic flies</title><p>The following <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains were reared at 25 °C in a humidified chamber. <italic>ppk-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grueber et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>UAS-dHIP14::Tdtomato</italic> and <italic>Dhip14<sup>ex11</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stowers and Isacoff, 2007</xref>); <italic>hiw<sup>∆N</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2005</xref>); <italic>UAS-ManII::GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ye et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>UAS-ManII-Tag::RFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>); <italic>Mi{MIC}wnd <sup>GFSTF</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venken et al., 2011</xref>); <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seong et al., 2001</xref>); <italic>elav-Gal4<sup>C155</sup></italic> (BDSC #458); <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (BDSC #3605); <italic>TI{TI}Rab11<sup>EYFP</sup></italic> (BDSC #62549) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunst et al., 2015</xref>); <italic>UASp-YFP.Rab11</italic> (BDSC #50782) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>Rab11<sup>93Bi</sup></italic> (BDSC #4158) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giansanti et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martín-Blanco et al., 1998</xref>).

Albeit with this technical limitation, our work addresses an important mechanistic link between DLK’s axonal localization and protein turnover, in neuronal stress signaling and neurodegeneration.</p><p>Additionally, most of our experiments were done using a kinase-dead form of Wnd or with DLKi treatment (DLK kinase inhibitor). Neurons do not display synaptic overgrowth phenotypes under these experimental conditions. Thus, the changes in Wnd axonal localization are likely independent of synaptic overgrowth phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Palmitoylation of the Wnd orthologue DLK in sensory neurons has previously been identified as important for DLK trafficking in a cell culture model.</p></disp-quote><p>Palmitoylation of DLK has been studied in previous works including Holland et al. 2015. These are important works. However, there are significant differences from our findings. First, inhibiting DLK palmitoylation caused cytoplasmic localization of DLK. It has been reported that expression levels of wild-type and the palmitoylation-defective DLK (DLK-CS) in axons are not different in cultured sensory neurons (Holland 2015, Figure 2A and 2B). This could be simply because DLK-CS is entirely cytoplasmic and can readily diffuse into axons – which led to the conclusion that DLK palmitoylation is essential for DLK localization on motile axonal puncta. Second, because of this cytoplasmic localization, DLK-CS failed to induce downstream signaling (Holland 2015).</p><p>However, the behavior of Wnd-CS from our study is entirely different. Wnd-CS does not show diffuse cytoplasmic localization, rather shows discrete localizations in neuronal cell bodies (Figure 2E, Figure 2-supplement 1). Furthermore, Wnd-CS is able to induce downstream signaling (Figure 4 – supplement 1 and 2). Thus, our manuscript is not an extension of previously published work. Rather, our manuscript took advantage of this unique behavior of Wnd-CS and elucidated biological function of the axonal localization of Wnd.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors find genetic interaction between Wnd and Rab11, but these studies are incomplete and they do not support the authors' mechanistic interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Our model describes that Wnd is constantly transported to axon terminals for protein degradation (protein turnover), and that this process is essential to keep Wnd activity at low levels to prevent unwanted neuronal stress signal. Based on this model, a failure in Wnd transport to axon terminals – as seen in Wnd-C130S or by Rab11 loss-of-function – would compromises protein degradation of Wnd, hence, results in excessive abundance of Wnd proteins. This was clearly demonstrated for Wnd-C130S (Figure 3) and for Rab11 mutants (Figure 6E), which support our model.</p><p>To strengthen the link between Rab11 and Wnd, we have added additional data in our revised manuscript, which showed that heterozygous mutation of wnd significantly rescued the eye degeneration phenotypes caused by Rab11 loss-of-function (new Figure 7C).</p><p>We did not intent to imply that Rab11 directly mediates anterograde Wnd protein transport towards axon terminals. We re-worded related text throughout our manuscript to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It would be interesting to overexpress Hiw in C4da neurons to see if this can degrade the C130S Wnd protein and reduce ERK signaling, or overexpress Hiw in the Rab11 mutant background to see if this can reduce the accumulation of Wnd or total Wnd levels. This could address the question of whether the reduction in Wnd turnover is due to Hiw's inaccessibility to Wnd.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We believe this question warrants an independent line of study. Although this is beyond the scope of current work, we would like to share our findings here. We have found that overexpressing Hiw did not suppress the transgenic expression of Wnd-KD in C4da neurons regardless of cellular locations. However interestingly, the same Hiw overexpression suppressed increased Wnd-KD expression by hiw mutations in C4da neuron axon terminals. Thus, it seems that endogenous levels of Hiw in wild-type was sufficient to suppress transgenic expression of Wnd-KD, and that excessive Hiw expression does not further enhance this effect. Currently, we do not know the mechanisms underlying these observations. One possibility is that Hiw functions exclusively in the context of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Wu et al. (2007) found that DFsn is synaptically enriched and acts as an F-box protein of Hiw E3 ligase complex. It is possible that DFsn or some other components of Hiw E3 ligase complex determine the subcellular specificity of Hiw function. We are actively pursuing this research question currently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors claim that Rab11 transports Wnd to the axon terminals. However, they do not see reliable colocalization of Rab11 and Wnd at axon terminals. Can the authors see Rab11-enriched vesicles with Wnd in nerve bundles, or is the role only to sort Wnd onto a post-recycling endosome compartment that moves to axonal terminals without Rab11?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We did not intend to claim that Rab11 directly transports Wnd along axons. We suggested that Rab11 is necessary for axonal localization of Wnd by acting at the somatic recycling endosomes since Rab11 and Wnd extensively colocalize in the cell body but not in the axon terminals (Figure 6 and Figure 6 supplement 1). In our new “Figure 6 supplement 1”, we have now added Rab11 and Wnd colocalization in axons (segmental nerves). We also revised the text (line 294-298) “On the other hand, we did not detect any meaningful colocalization between YFP::Rab11 and Wnd-KD::mRFP in C4da axon terminals or in axons (Manders’ coefficient 0.34 ± 0.14 and 0.41 ± 0.10 respectively) (Figure 6 – supplement 1). These suggest that Rab11 is involved in Wnd protein sorting at the somatic REs rather than transporting Wnd directly.” And in Discussion (line 396-398) “These further suggest that Rab11 is not directly involved in the anterograde long-distance transport of Wnd proteins, rather is responsible for sorting Wnd into the axonal anterograde transporting vesicles.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors mis-cite the Tortosa et al 2022 study which shows the exact opposite of what the authors state. Tortosa et al show DLK recruitment to vesicles through phosphorylation and palmitoylation is essential for its signaling, not the opposite, so the authors should reword that or remove the citation.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the citation is correct. Tortosa et al (2022) “Stress‐induced vesicular assemblies of dual leucine zipper kinase are signaling hubs involved in kinase activation and neurodegeneration” describes that membrane association of DLK rather than palmitoylation itself is sufficient for DLK signaling activation. This is achieved by DLK palmitoylation for mammalian DLK. However, when artificially targeted to cellular membranes, palmitoylation defective DLK (mammalian DLK-CS in their study) was able to induce DLK signaling. Specifically, in their Figure 2 (K-N), when targeted to the intracellular membranes of ER and mitochondria, DLK-CS (palmitoylation defective DLK) elicited DLK signaling as shown by c-Jun phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>(1) A concern is the overinterpretation of results. The authors find the accumulation of Wnd in axon terminals when they express hiw null or when they overexpress Wnd, but extrapolate that this occurs in &quot;normal conditions&quot; without evidence. Could the increase of Wnd in the axonal terminal be in the setting of known synaptic overgrowth associated with transgene expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Most of our work was conducted using a kinase-dead version of Wnd (Wnd-KD) in a wild-type background (Figure 1C and Figure 1 supplement 1). Moreover, Wnd kinase activity does not affect Wnd axonal localization in our experimental settings (Figure 1 supplement 1).</p><p>When using hiw mutant background, the larvae were treated with Wnd kinase inhibitor thus, prevented excessive axonal growth (Figure 1E, bottom right image – note that there is no axonal overgrowth in this condition). Additionally, Wnd-C130S is expressed lower levels in axon terminals than Wnd (Figure 3B) while exhibiting similar axon overgrowth (Figure 4 supplement 1B). Taken together, axonal overgrowth is unlikely affect axonal protein localization of Wnd.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The interpretation of these results is based on a supposition that Rab11 anterogradely transports Wnd along axons without evidence for this. Indeed, it has been shown that Rab11 is excluded from axons in mature neurons, but can be mislocalized when overexpressed. This should be addressed in their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We did not intend to suggest that Rab11 directly transports Wnd along axons. We suggested that Rab11 is necessary for axonal localization of Wnd by acting at the somatic recycling endosomes since Rab11 and Wnd extensively colocalize in the cell body but not in the axon terminals (Figure 6 and Figure 6 supplement 1). In our new “Figure 6 supplement 1”, we have now added Rab11 and Wnd colocalization in axons (segmental nerves). We also revised the text (line 296-298) “On the other hand, we did not detect any meaningful colocalization between YFP::Rab11 and Wnd-KD::mRFP in C4da axon terminals or in axons (Manders’ coefficient 0.34 ± 0.14 and 0.41 ± 0.10 respectively) (Figure 6 – supplement 1). These suggest that Rab11 is involved in Wnd protein sorting at the somatic REs rather than transporting Wnd directly.” And in Discussion (line 396-398) “These further suggest that Rab11 is not directly involved in the anterograde long-distance transport of Wnd proteins, rather is responsible for sorting Wnd into the axonal anterograde transporting vesicles.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 1, the authors should also show images of Wnd-GFSTF in wild-type (non-hiw mutations) to show endogenous Wnd levels in the axon terminal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the figures of Wnd-GFSTF in wild-type (new Figure 1A). To show the comparable fluorescent intensities, we also re-performed hiw mutant experiment and replaced the old images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) For Figure 1- Supplement, the authors state that the kinase-dead version of Wnd exhibited similar axonal enrichment in comparison to Wnd::GFP in the presence and absence of DLKi. This statement would be better supported with images specifically showing this (for example Wnd-KD::GFP compared to Wnd:GFP with DLKi and Wnd:GFP without DLKi).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not show the images from Wnd::GFP (DLKi) in this supplement figure because it would be redundant with Figure 1C. Rather, we presented the axonal enrichment index for Wnd::GFP (DLKi), Wnd-KD::GFP, Wnd-KD::GFP (DLKi), and Wnd-KD::GFP (DMSO) in Figure 1 supplement 1B.</p><p>Overexpressing catalytically active Wnd dramatically lowers ppk-GAL4 activity in C4da neurons thus prevents us from performing an experiment for Wnd::GFP without DLKi. In this condition, Wnd::GFP expression is barely detectable in C4da neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 2 - Supplement 3 the authors state that their data suggests that Wnd protein palmitoylation is catalyzed by HIP14 due to colocalization in the somatic Golgi and mutating HIP14 leads to less Wnd in the axon terminal. This statement would be better supported by evaluating Wnd's palmitoylation via immunoprecipitation in response to dHIP14 enzyme activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer’s comment. Although the exact identity of Wnd palmitoyltransferase might be of high interest, our study rather concerns about the biological role of Wnd axonal localization. Moreover, the identity of DLK palmitoyltransferase has been identified in mammalian cell culture and worm studies (Niu et al. 2020 “Coupled Control of Distal Axon Integrity and Somal Responses to Axonal Damage by the Palmitoyl Acyltransferase ZDHHC17”). ZDHHC17 is another name for HIP14. Our data together with these published works strongly suggest that Wnd, the Drosophila DLK might also be targeted by <italic>Drosophila</italic> HIP14 or dHIP14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors argue that palmitoylation of Wnd is essential for axonal localization of Wnd. If dHIP14 indeed palmitoylates Wnd as the authors claim, shouldn't there be a decrease in Wnd's palmitoylation within dHIP14 mutants, consequently resulting in its accumulation in the cell body rather than localization in the axonal terminal? However, Wnd is reduced at the axon terminal in dHip14 mutants, but it does not appear to increase in the cell body (Figure 2S3.C). This observation contradicts the results showing increased Wnd in the cell body presented in Figure 2. B and E. This discrepancy should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Our study concerns about the biological role of Wnd axonal localization. Although in an ideal model, dHIP14 mutations should prevent Wnd palmitoylation and causes subsequent cell body accumulation. However, it is highly likely that dHIP14 mutations affect a large number of protein palmitoylations – not just Wnd, which likely changes many aspect of cell functions. We envision that Wnd protein expression might be indirectly affected by these changes. In this context, mutating C130 in Wnd can be considered as more targeted approach – and our data clearly shows that such Wnd mutations render Wnd accumulation in cell bodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 3 - the authors show increased Wnd protein by western blot in WndC130S:GFP compared to Wnd::GFP. qPCR experiments to show similar mRNA expression of these two transgenes would be an important control, if it's thought that the increase of protein is due to reduction of protein degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Expressing WndC130S::GFP vs Wnd::GFP was done by GAL4-UAS system – not through endogenous wnd promoter. Thus, we do not expect different mRNA abundance of WndC130S::GFP and Wnd::GFP. However, your concern is valid for Rab11 mutants. We measured wnd mRNA abundance by RT-qPCR and found that Rab11 mutations did not increase wnd mRNA levels (Figure 6 - Supplement 2). Rather, we observed consistent reduction in wnd mRNA levels by Rab11 mutant. Please note that total Wnd protein levels were significantly increased by Rab11 mutations. We currently do not have a clear explanation. We envision that the dramatic increase in Wnd signaling (ie, JNK signal, Figure 7A) induces a negative-feedback to reduce wnd mRNA levels (line 313-317).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 4 Supplement - the authors report that Wnd::GFP causes robust induction of Puc-LacZ. A control without Wnd::GFP expression would be necessary to support that there was an induction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added control data of UAS-Wnd-KD::GFP (new Figure 4 supplement 1A). Since this required a new side-by-side comparison of fluorescent intensities, we re-performed the full set of experiments and replaced our old data sets. The results confirmed that both Wnd::GFP and Wnd-C130S::GFP induces puc-lacZ expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Previously it was shown that inhibiting palmitoylation of DLK prevented activation of JNK signaling (Holland et al 2015), but the authors show in Figure 4A instead an increase of JNK signaling. This discrepancy should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of Wnd palmitoylation-defective mutant in our study was only possible because of different behavior of Wnd-C130S from those of palmitoylation-defective DLK. Unlike diffuse cytoplasmic localization of the palmitoylation-defective DLK in mammalian cells or in C elegans neurons, Wnd-C130S exhibited clear puncta localization in neuronal cell bodies – which extensively co-localizes with somatic Golgi complex (Figure 2E and Figure 2 supplement 1). Tortosa et al (2022) showed that palmitoylation-defective DLK (DLK-CS) can trigger DLK signaling when artificially targeted to intracellular membranous organelles (Tortosa 2022, Figure 2 (K-N)). Thus, we reasoned that unlike the palmitoylation-defective DLK from mammalian and worms, <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLK, Wnd might be catalytically active when mutated on Cysteine 130 because of its puncta localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 6 Supplement - the Rab11 staining is not in a pattern that would be expected with endosomes. A control of just YFP would be useful to determine if this fluorescence signal is specific to Rab11. Can endogenous Rab11 be detected in axons or in the axonal terminal?</p></disp-quote><p>In our model system, endogenously tagged Rab11 (TI-Rab11) does not show clear puncta patterns in segmental nerves (axons) and neuropils (axon terminals), neither colocalize with Wnd-KD. This is indeed related to the reviewer’s comment #2, which suggests that Rab11 does not form endosomes in distal axons or axon terminals in mature neurons. Expressing Rab11 transgenes exhibited some puncta structures in axons (segmental nerves) (new Figure 6 supplement 1). However, they did not show meaningful colocalize with Wnd-KD. These are consistent with our model that Rab11 acts in neuronal cell bodies for Wnd axonal transport – likely via a sorting process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) There is growing evidence that palmitoylation is important for cargo sorting in the Golgi, and Rab11 is also located at the Golgi and important for trafficking from the Golgi. A mechanism that could be considered from your data is that blocking palmitoylation impairs sorting at the Golgi and trafficking from the Golgi, as opposed to impairing fast axonal transport. Indeed, Rab11 has been shown to be blocked from axons in mature neurons, making Rab11 unlikely to be responsible for the fast axonal transport of Wnd. Direct evidence of Rab11 transporting Wnd in axons would be necessary for the claim that Rab11 constantly transports DLK to terminals.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We did not intend to suggest that Rab11 directly transports Wnd along the axons. We suggested that Rab11 is necessary for axonal localization of Wnd by acting at the somatic recycling endosomes since Rab11 and Wnd extensively colocalize in the cell body but not in the axon terminals (Figure 6 and Figure 6 supplement 1).
