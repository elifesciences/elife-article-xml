Dengue and other flaviviruses commandeer the host cell’s RNA degradation machinery to generate the small flaviviral RNA (sfRNA), a noncoding RNA that induces cytopathicity and pathogenesis. Host cell exonuclease Xrn1 likely loads on the 5′ end of viral genomic RNA and degrades processively through ∼10 kB of RNA, halting near the 3′ end of the viral RNA. The surviving RNA is the sfRNA. We interrogated the architecture of the complete Dengue 2 sfRNA, identifying five independently-folded RNA structures, two of which quantitatively confer Xrn1 resistance. We developed an assay for real-time monitoring of Xrn1 resistance that we used with mutagenesis and RNA folding experiments to show that Xrn1-resistant RNAs adopt a specific fold organized around a three-way junction. Disrupting the junction’s fold eliminates the buildup of disease-related sfRNAs in human cells infected with a flavivirus, directly linking RNA structure to sfRNA production.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01892.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01892.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01892.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>More than 40% of people around the globe are at risk of being bitten by mosquitoes infected with the virus that causes Dengue fever. Every year, more than 100 million of these individuals are infected. Many develop severe headaches, pain, and fever, but some develop a life-threatening condition where tiny blood vessels in the body begin to leak. If not treated quickly, this more severe manifestation of the illness can lead to death.</p><p>There are currently no specific therapies or vaccines against Dengue or many other closely related viruses such as West Nile and Japanese Encephalitis. These viruses use instructions encoded in a single strand of RNA to take over an infected cell and to reproduce. The viruses also exploit an enzyme that cells use to destroy RNA to instead produce short stretches of RNA called sfRNAs that, among other things, may help the virus to avoid the immune system of its host. Understanding exactly how Dengue and other viruses thwart this enzyme—which is called Xrn1—may help scientists develop treatments or vaccines for these diseases.</p><p>Chapman et al. have now shown that Dengue virus RNA contains a number of RNA elements that prevent it being completely degraded by the Xrn1 enzyme. In particular, a junction formed by three RNA helixes is critical for stopping the enzyme in its tracks, leaving the disease-associated sfRNA behind. A single mutation in the Dengue RNA disrupts the structure of the three-helix junction and allows the enzyme to completely destroy the RNA. A similar mutation was also made in the West Nile virus RNA and when human cells were infected with the mutated West Nile virus, the short sfRNAs were not produced. Treatments or vaccines targeting this structure may therefore help reduce illness associated with Dengue and related viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01892.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01892.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Xrn1</kwd><kwd>dengue virus</kwd><kwd>exonuclease resistance</kwd><kwd>xrRNA</kwd><kwd>small flavivirus RNA</kwd><kwd>3′UTR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kieft</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM081346, GM097333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kieft</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 AI-065357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilusz</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Dengue virus contains discretely folded RNA structures that confer the ability to resist a powerful host cell enzyme and produce a disease-inducing noncoding RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flaviviruses (FVs) are single-stranded, (+)-sense RNA viruses that include West Nile (WNV), Yellow Fever (YFV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV) and other human disease-causing viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fields et al., 2013</xref>).

There is no broadly-effective therapy or vaccine against DENV or many other FVs, motivating continued research into the molecular basis of disease to identify new vulnerabilities in the viral lifecycle.</p><p>FVs enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, culminating in the release of an infectious, ∼10.5 kB genomic RNA (gRNA) into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhn et al., 2002</xref>). The capped but non-polyadenylated viral genomic RNA (gRNA) encodes a single open reading frame (ORF), flanked by structured 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Translation of the FV ORF produces a single polypeptide that is processed by both viral and cellular proteases to yield ten viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fields et al., 2013</xref>). Both FV UTRs fulfill critical roles in the viral lifecycle, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iglesias and Gamarnik, 2011</xref>) including forming base pairing interactions during (−) strand synthesis of the viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filomatori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Villordo and Gamarnik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friebe and Harris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Villordo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebhard et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to replicated copies of the gRNA, high levels of shorter non-coding viral RNAs are also produced during FV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naeve and Trent, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takeda et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wengler and Gross, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urosevic et al., 1997</xref>). These subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) contain most of the 3′UTR of the FV gRNA and play an important role in regulating the switch between translation and replication of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2004</xref>). Production of sfRNAs is an evolutionarily-conserved trait in arthropod-borne FV’s and its accumulation is directly linked to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pijlman et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, through still poorly-understood mechanisms, sfRNA controls WNV’s ability to evoke cytopathicity in mammalian cell culture and the onset of pathogenesis in fetal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pijlman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Virological studies of sfRNAs from WNV, DENV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) and other flaviviruses showed that they disrupt aspects of the immune response, affecting RNAi mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schnettler et al., 2012</xref>), mRNA turnover pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moon et al., 2012</xref>), and the type-I interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuessler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). The importance of sfRNAs in FV-induced disease raised questions about the mechanism by which these RNAs are produced and maintained at levels approaching or exceeding those of viral gRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). Several studies showed that sfRNAs form by viral manipulation of the host cell’s RNA turnover machinery. Specifically, sfRNAs form as the result of incomplete degradation of viral gRNA by the cytoplasmic exoribonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2010</xref>). Xrn1 is a processive, 5′→3′ exonuclease responsible for degradation of roughly 30–40% of mRNA in actively dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). sfRNA production occurs when viral gRNA is loaded into Xrn1 for decay. Xrn1 degrades through nearly the entire viral gRNA before stalling near the beginning of the 3′UTR; what remains is an sfRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01892.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>sfRNAs are formed by incomplete degradation of the flaviviral genomic RNA by the 5′→3′ exonuclease Xrn1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Xrn1 (red) likely loads onto decapped, monophosphorylated gRNA and degrades ∼10 kb of RNA before stopping within the viral 3′UTR. The remaining RNA is the sfRNA. (<bold>B</bold>) In the sfRNAs studied to date, stem-loop (SL) elements near the 5′ border of the 3′UTR/sfRNA appear to be signals for Xrn1 resistance, and are depicted here as cartoon secondary structures. In Dengue and many other FVs, two of these SLs are present in tandem, as shown. The most highly-conserved parts of the RNA are shaded red and putative PK interactions are indicated with dashed lines.

RNA degradation by Xrn1 takes place in the enzyme’s catalytic chamber buried within a conserved active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jinek et al., 2011</xref>). Progression of Xrn1 along an RNA being degraded is hypothesized to be powered by a combination of electrostatic interactions specific for 5′-monophosphorylated RNAs and by repetitious π-stacking of RNA nucleobases with aromatic residues in the enzyme′s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jinek et al., 2011</xref>). These features enable Xrn1 to degrade through complex RNA structures, including decapped mRNAs and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Thus, a popular practical application for Xrn1 is eliminating unwanted monophosphorylated RNA (e.g., rRNAs) from samples bound for next-generation sequencing.</p><p>How do sfRNAs escape degradation by Xrn1? Current evidence suggests that specific RNA sequences and structures located in the 3′UTR of different FVs are the signals that cause Xrn1 to stall. Presumably, these RNAs have unique features that make them impervious to Xrn1. It has been proposed that both stem-loop (SL) and dumbbell (DB) type structures found in the FVs 3′UTRs can halt Xrn1 progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pijlman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2010</xref>). Of these putatively resistant structures, the SL elements from WNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funk et al., 2010</xref>) and YFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2010</xref>) have been explored. Phylogenetic studies identified ∼19 conserved nucleotides within a secondary structure predicted to include a three-helix junction, a downstream hairpin, and an RNA pseudoknot (PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pijlman et al., 2008</xref>). The presence of the PK is supported by virological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2010</xref>), and this led to the proposal that these are ‘rigid’ structures. However, our current understanding of these RNA structures does not explain their ability to halt Xrn1 and in the case of DENV, the relationship of the structure of the 3′UTR to its Xrn1-resistant properties is unexplored.</p><p>Here, we describe our interrogation of the structure and Xrn1-resistant properties of the complete 3′UTR of a serotype 2 Dengue Virus (DENV2). Chemical probing of the global structure of the 3′UTR revealed five independently-folded RNA structures within the longer RNA. We recapitulated Xrn1 resistance in vitro and developed a new fluorescence-based assay capable of quantitative, real-time monitoring of RNA degradation by Xrn1 and resistance to the enzyme. We used this assay to explore the Xrn1-resistant behavior of RNA structures throughout the DENV2 3′UTR, identifying two Xrn1-resistant RNA structures that confer quantitative protection to downstream segments of RNA. Using one of these structures we developed a series of mutants and precisely mapped where Xrn1 halts, revealing that a specifically-structured three-way junction is a functionally critical element of Xrn1 resistance. Similar mutations within the Xrn1-resistant structures of another FV (the Kunjin strain of WNV), also impair the formation of sfRNAs in vitro and in infected human cells. Cumulatively, these results set the stage for detailed mechanistic and structural studies of these unique, disease-related viral RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural architecture of the complete DENV2 3′UTR</title><p>We first characterized the global architecture of the DENV2 3′UTR and the secondary structures of five shorter RNA sequences within the UTR that are predicted to form discrete secondary structure domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We probed the structure of these RNAs using dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA, SHAPE chemistry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tijerina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weeks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGinnis et al., 2012</xref>), and used the resultant data to produce an experimentally-supported secondary structure of the complete 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The chemical reactivity profiles obtained by probing individual regions of the 3′UTR in isolation match the profiles of those regions in the context of the intact 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We refer to them as ‘Xrn1-resistant RNAs’ (xrRNAs), and we modify this term by including the name of the virus in which the xrRNA is found. When more than one xrRNA is present in a viral RNA, we propose numbering them sequentially. Thus, the 5′ most discrete Xrn1-resistant structure in the Dengue virus genome is named ‘DENV2xrRNA1.’ This nomenclature builds on and is consistent with existing nomenclature and has several advantages: Distinguishes between the discrete RNA structures that resist Xrn1 (xrRNAs) and the larger product of resistance that includes additional sequences of diverse function (sfRNAs). Provides a consistent convention across viral species and independent of idiosyncratic naming of putative secondary structure elements. Is consistent with the accepted practice of classifying and naming RNAs based on function. For example, IRES RNAs are often part of a larger 5′ UTR and may comprise a collection of secondary structural elements, but they are named as discrete functional entities within the 5′ UTR and are identified by their source (e.g., ‘HCV IRES RNA’). The term ‘xrRNA’, modified by source, follows this convention. Allows matching of the name of the xrRNA to the sfRNA it produces. For example, during Kunjin virus infection 4 putative sfRNAs are made (sfRNA1, sfRNA2, etc). With our proposed nomenclature, the name of the xrRNA structure logically corresponds to the product it makes (i.e., sfRNA1 is made by xRNA1, sfRNA2 by xrRNA2 etc). Because this naming convention is based on function and position, this nomenclature is readily extended to xrRNAs that could someday be found in contexts other than flaviviruses. <bold>Outline of the naming strategy we propose for Xrn1-Resistant RNAs and application to test RNAs in this study.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) As shown, we propose a naming strategy that includes designations for an Xrn1-resistant RNA’s function, viral origin, position within in a FV 3′UTR and the presence upstream and downstream RNA sequences.

Addition of BdRppH and KlXrn1 to a reaction containing this test RNA as well as a synthetically generated 5′-monophosphorylated 24 nucleotide-long internal control RNA (24-mer) resulted in complete degradation of the control RNA and truncation of the test RNA to a discrete product, indicative of Xrn1 resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Because the enzymes used in this experiment were pure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), this experiment establishes that Xrn1 resistance is conferred entirely by the SL II test RNA (no auxiliary proteins are needed). We therefore conclude that RNA elements from within the DENV 3′UTR as short as ∼60 nucleotides can resist Xrn1 and that these RNAs operate effectively outside the context of the viral 3′UTR. Interestingly, we observed no enzymatic resistance using other commercially available exonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting this RNA is specifically resistant to Xrn1. For clarity, here we refer to this (and other) discrete RNAs using the functionally-descriptive name of ‘Xrn1-resistant RNAs’ (xrRNAs) in order to distinguish them from the longer sfRNAs. To facilitate discussion of xrRNAs in this and future work we propose a simple naming scheme for xrRNAs that is outlined in the (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this nomenclature, we here refer to the first Xrn1-resistant structure in the DENV 3′ UTR as ‘DVxrRNA1’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Testing each discrete structure for Xrn1 resistance</title><p>To augment the aforementioned assay and enable monitoring of Xrn1 resistance in a quantitative and time-resolved manner, we engineered a fluorescence-based assay based on the malachite green (MG) aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grate and Wilson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baugh et al., 2000</xref>). The fluorescence of the triphenylmethylene MG dye is quenched when free in solution but dramatically increases when bound to the aptamer. This feature provides a fluorescent readout of the MG aptamer’s integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babendure et al., 2003</xref>). We designed RNA substrates with the 40 nt-long MG aptamer placed downstream of each RNA structure to be tested for Xrn1 resistance (following a 4 nucleotide-long poly(U) linker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In solution with MG, these RNAs produce an ∼2300-fold increase in MG fluorescence over free dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babendure et al., 2003</xref>). If addition of RppH and Xrn1 results in degradation of the aptamer-tagged RNA (no Xrn1 resistance), fluorescence disappears over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom). If the RNA being tested provides Xrn1 resistance, the MG aptamer remains intact and fluorescence persists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top). A fuller description of the development and testing of this technique will be reported elsewhere (Chapman et al., in preparation). We used this fluorescence assay to test the Xrn1 resistance properties of the five discrete structures located within the DENV2 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The 5′ leader of each RNA consisted of nucleotides 10,273–10,304 of the DENV 3′UTR, which is degraded when present before DVxrRNA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and each had the MG aptamer downstream. For DVxrRNA1, the test RNA was thus named (+31)-DVxrRNA1-MG and other input RNAs were named following the same convention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, upon the addition of both enzymes (+31)-DVxrRNA1-MG maintains high fluorescence throughout the course of the experiment, consistent with Xrn1 resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Likewise, SL IV demonstrated resistance to Xrn1-mediated decay (DVxrRNA2). In contrast, reactions with the DB2 and the 3′ terminal stem loop [test RNAs: (+31)-DVDB2-MG and (+31)-DV3SL-MG] show a decrease in fluorescence that is consistent with no Xrn1 resistance.

In the case of the DB1-containing test RNA, the full-length RNA is partially depleted however there is no truncated product as would be expected if the DB1 sequence itself were Xrn1-resistant. The persistence of full-length RNA in this reaction suggests that Xrn1 may not be able to efficiently load onto this RNA and the lower intensity of the band suggests that when Xrn1 does load it degrades the RNA entirely. As &gt;3 nucleotides of single-stranded RNA are required for Xrn1 to efficiently load on an RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jinek et al., 2011</xref>), the behavior of the DB1-containing RNA may indicate an alternate secondary structure that precludes the 5′ end of this RNA from being recognized by Xrn1.

Substrate recognition by Xrn1 requires a 5′ monophosphate at the end of an RNA and each catalytic cycle regenerates this chemical species. Could Xrn1 resistance be based in part upon malfunction of this process? If so, the products formed by xrRNAs might not bear a 5′ monophosphate and would be precluded from further degradation. We determined the phosphorylation state of the 5′ end of Xrn1-resistant products formed by DVxrRNA1 using the procedure outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and described in the Supplementary Description of ‘Materials and methods’. Briefly, after ‘product’ and ‘control’ RNAs were isolated, half of each sample was dephosphoylated using calf intestinal alkaline phosphotase (‘CIP’ed’). We then compared the ability of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) to ligate a radioactive phosphate to the CIP’ed vs un-CIP’ed RNAs, expecting that the presence of a 5′-monophosphate would interfere with effective phosphorylation. In these experiments we included both a synthetically 5′ monophosphorylated 24-mer RNA and a 5′ hydroxylated 40-mer DNA as controls. As predicted, the dephosphorylated products of the DVxrRNA1 ‘control’ RNA are better substrates for phosphorylation than their un-CIP’ed counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes A and B). Control reactions involving the synthetic 5′-monophosphorylated 24-mer produce similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes E and F). Similarly, the CIP’ed Xrn1-resistant product RNAs are better substrates for phosphorylation than their un-CIP’ed counterparts. These results indicate that the RNA product of Xrn1 resistance are 5′-monophosphorylated and are still viable substrates for Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes C and D).

The motivation for exploring these mutations was based on the conservation of the sequences in these helical regions. In mutant 7, mutation of the natural G-C rich stem of P1 into a series of five A-U base pairs abrogates Xrn1 resistance, consistent with the need for a P1 helix of defined sequence. In contrast Xrn1 resistance is maintained in mutant 8, in which the C-G base at the base of P2 is exchanged for a U-A base pair. This result suggests accurate assignment of secondary structure in this region and reveals tolerance to mutations in this conserved base pair.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-5"><title>Importance of the 5′ and 3′ ends</title><p>Mutants 9–11 tested the consequences of truncating the DVxrRNA1 structure from either the 5′ or 3’′ end. Deleting the first 10 nucleotides after the conserved 5′ end of DVxrRNA1 (nucleotides 10,304–10,314, mutant 9) yielded an RNA that wasn’t completely degraded over the course of the experiment but did not yield a truncated product indicative of Xrn1 resistance. This RNA likely has a 5′ end structure that inhibits efficient Xrn1 loading. Mutations 10 and 11 tested truncations of the 3′ end. Despite conservation of several nucleotides in this region, mutants 10 and 11 remain resistant to Xrn1. In conjunction with our experiments which define the 5′ border of xrRNA1 we can therefore localize Xrn1 resistance to a region of the DENV2 genome as small as 59 nucleotides (nucleotides U10299–U10358).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The three-way junction structure is essential for function</title><p>If Xrn1 resistance is due to the formation of a specific RNA structure, mutations that affect Xrn1 resistance should disrupt this structure. To test this, we subjected the mutants described above to non-denaturing (native) gel electrophoresis, which is sensitive to changes in the global structure of a folded RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Woodson and Koculi, 2009</xref>). In gels containing 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, mutants of DVxrRNA1 display a spectrum of electrophoretic behaviors, indicating a variety of effects on RNA structure. One mutant that stood out was the non-Xrn1-resistant mutant 6 (C10320→G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In EDTA-containing gels this mutant migrated at the same rate as WT DVxrRNA1, however in gels containing MgCl<sub>2</sub> mutant 6 demonstrates significantly retarded mobility, indicative of altered folding of the RNA. This suggests that a single point mutation made in the DVxrRNA1 three-helix junction is capable of disrupting a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent tertiary fold that is linked to Xrn1 resistance. To further examine this behavior we used chemical probing experiments to assess the structure of the mutant 6 RNA. The normalized NMIA and DMS reactivity profiles of the WT and mutant 6 MG aptamer-tagged RNAs are similar but with several marked differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,D</xref>). These data reveal that the WT and mutant 6 RNA have similar secondary structures (consistent with the EDTA-containing native gels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) but indicate that the C10320→G mutation affects several structural elements and changes the global fold of the RNA (consistent with the MgCl<sub>2</sub>-containing native gel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

Because sfRNA formation is readily explored in the context of the Kunjin strain of WNV (WNV<sub>KUN</sub>), we used this virus system to assess the generality and relevance. We first tested two proposed xrRNA structures located within in the WNV<sub>KUN</sub> 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) for Xrn1 resistance, again using a 31 nucleotide-long leader. Both of these RNAs, WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 (nucleotides 10,499–10,574) and WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2 (nucleotides 10,659–10,728), demonstrate resistance to Xrn1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

We infected human 293T cells with both wild-type and mutant WNV<sub>KUN</sub> and assessed sfRNA accumulation at 48 hours post infection (h.p.i.). Northern blots of total RNA isolates show that infection by wild-type WNV produces three prominent sfRNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Based on their size, the largest of these RNAs, sfRNA1 and sfRNA2, are the result of Xrn1 pausing at WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 and WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2, respectively. The third species, sfRNA3 corresponds with previous observations of Xrn1 stopping prior to DB1 of WNV<sub>KUN</sub>. Infections using a WNV<sub>KUN</sub> harboring a C10519→G point mutation in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 results in a significant and reproducible decrease in sfRNA1 formation, corresponding with the incomplete loss of Xrn1 resistance we observe in vitro. Likewise, infection with WNV<sub>KUN</sub> containing a C10680→G point mutation in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2 results in the disappearance of sfRNA2, and again mirrors our findings in vitro. Finally, infection by a WNV<sub>KUN</sub> containing both C10519→G and C10680→G point mutations produces low levels of sfRNA1 and essentially no sfRNA2. The more substantial decrease in sfRNA1 formation in the double mutant as opposed to the C10519→G single mutant may suggest a degree of cooperation between the two xrRNA structures although establishing such an interaction will require additional experimentation. Cumulatively our results show that the structural and functional features we observe have applicability across xrRNAs from diverse FV’s and that the structural characteristics that confer Xrn1 resistance in vitro corresponds directly to the accumulation of disease-causing sfRNAs during viral infection.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01892.019</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>sfRNAs produced during infection by wild-type and mutated WNV<sub>KUN</sub>.</title><p>Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from human 293T cells infected with WT and mutants WNV<sub>KUN</sub>, analyzed at 48 h.p.i.

During infections caused by FV’s, the formation of sfRNAs through incomplete degradation of the viral genome is directly linked to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pijlman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). In this study we identified discrete elements of the DENV2 3′UTR that confer resistance to Xrn1 (xrRNAs) and explored characteristics of the RNA structures responsible. We correlated these findings with similar RNAs in WNV<sub>KUN</sub> and demonstrated that the formation of specific, discrete folded structure is responsible for the production of sfRNAs. Here we discuss implications of these findings as they relate to the organization of the FV 3′UTR and the infection strategy used by these viruses. Based on our data we propose a model for how an RNA structure might confer Xrn1 resistance, and speculate about implications for other Xrn1-resistant RNAs.</p><p>The DENV 3′UTR (and correspondingly its sfRNA) is comprised of individual structural elements that, based on our probing data, do not appear to interact with each other to form a higher-order structure. This differs from other viral 3′UTRs that we have shown can fold into a single higher-order structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammond et al., 2010</xref>). The presence of individually folded, discrete structures within the DENV 3′UTR correlates well with the observation that different elements are responsible for interacting with different proteins and perform different tasks during the FV replication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Polacek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manzano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hussain et al., 2012</xref>). This ‘knots in a rope’ architecture of the DENV2 3′UTR and sfRNA may be important to enable and organize these multiple functions.</p><p>We identified two resistant functional RNA structures (DVxrRNA1, DVxrRNA2) located in succession near the 5′ end of the DENV 3′UTR. These elements contain previously-proposed secondary structure stem-loop elements SL II and SL IV. We did not observe resistance from the DB elements in vitro; if they confer Xrn1 resistance during infection this may require interaction with a protein factor. The position of the two confirmed xrRNAs is consistent with a role in protecting downstream sequences and structures, including the DBs and 3′SL from degradation. Many other FV′s also contain two neighboring xrRNA structures at the 5′ end of their 3′UTR′s (a notable exception is YF, which only contains one) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pijlman et al., 2008</xref>). The evolutionary conservation of this pattern suggests that downstream RNA elements are critical for sfRNA function and viral success; however, the nearly quantitative resistance to Xrn1 demonstrated by these structures begs the question: why there are two xrRNAs in series when seemingly one should suffice? Perhaps two xrRNAs provide redundancy to ensure production of the sfRNA or perhaps each xrRNA is tuned to operate most efficiently under different intracellular conditions encountered during the infection cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Villordo and Gamarnik, 2013</xref>). Our data suggest that the PK interaction is stable in only one of the two xrRNAs in DENV2, hinting that subtle functional differences may exist between the two structures. Furthermore, our data from cells infected with mutant Kunjin Virus hint at cooperation or coupling between these elements.</p><p>Cumulatively, our data suggest that a critical feature of Xrn1 resistance is the formation of a specifically structured three-helix junction. The presence of multiple conserved bases within the three-way junction, including several unpaired nucleotides, suggests that this core organizes the tertiary fold of the RNA. This idea is supported by that fact that this fold can be disrupted by a point mutation made in one of the unpaired nucleotides within the junction. The fold this junction organizes is important for Xrn1 resistance, and while it may be further stabilized by a PK, this tertiary interaction does not appear to be necessary for Xrn1 resistance in vitro (at least in the context of DVxrRNA1).</p><p>Full understanding of the basis of Xrn1 resistance will require a high-resolution structure of an xrRNA, but our results allow some predictions. First, examination of the three-way junction features and comparisons with other RNA junctions suggest that it forms a ‘type-C’ three-helix junction in which P1 and P2 coaxially stack and P3 assumes an acute angle relative to P1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lescoute and Westhof, 2006</xref>). Based on this, we predict that folding of the junction (in the absence of any tertiary interactions) would bring L3 close to the base of P1. Formation of the PK would further stabilize this helical arrangement. How does this conformation result in Xrn1 resistance? We speculate that as the 5′ end of the RNA is drawn into the active site, the enzyme encounters a structure formed by the spatially adjacent P1 and P3 helices that prevents the helicase activity of the enzyme from unwinding the RNA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jinek et al. (2011)</xref> have proposed that RNA entering the active site of Xrn1 is unwound when pulled through a narrow channel formed by the α1 helix and an adjacent loop. The xrRNA may have evolved an unusual and specific structure that prevents these features of the enzyme from effectively interacting with and unwinding the RNA. Such a structure need not be rigid or even exceptionally thermodynamically stable, but must be arranged in such a way that the enzyme cannot process it.</p><p>We did not directly address the pathways by which viral genomic RNAs could be decapped and recognized by Xrn1, or the pathways by which sfRNA alters infected cells once it has been formed, but our results may lend insight into these processes. One interesting idea is that sfRNA production causes dysregulation of Xrn1-dependent mRNA turnover in the infected cell. Indeed, studies of Dengue and Kunjin virus infections showed that sfRNA production stabilizes mRNAs by inhibiting Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moon et al., 2012</xref>). One possible explanation of this effect could be that Xrn1 remains bound to xrRNAs, perhaps locking the enzyme in an inactive conformation or sequestering it from other substrates. There is evidence that an RNase L-inhibiting RNA of poliovirus operates as a competitive inhibitor through this type of mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keel et al., 2012</xref>). However, in several of our experiments Xrn1 processes over 150 copies of the xrRNA substrate and over 300 copies of the 24-mer control RNA, indicating multiple turnover by the enzyme. Nonetheless, we did find conditions under which afforded some protection to an Xrn1 substrates <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), but we have been unable to obtain evidence of formation of a stable complex between a resistant RNA and Xrn1 in a purified system (data not shown). Overall, these observations argue against a simple binding model for sfRNA-induced changes in mRNA turnover and suggest that sfRNA may act as a reversible inhibitor of Xrn1, perhaps changing the kinetics of the enzyme in infected cells.</p><p>That Xrn1 resistance is conferred by a discrete, relatively short, and highly conserved RNA structure raises the notion that it could be targeted with therapeutics. The observation that mutation of a single conserved nucleotide in the three-way junction completely abrogates Xrn1 resistance and sfRNA formation in human cells suggests that only a few key intermolecular interactions need to be altered to prevent xrRNA folding and function. Perhaps mutations or deletions in individual xrRNA elements present in other FV genomes could be become part of a general route toward the development of attenuated vaccines.</p><p>In conclusion, we mapped the architecture of the complete 3′UTR of DENV2 and identified Xrn1-resistant activity residing in discrete and portable structural elements. We identified similar Xrn1-resistant RNA structures in WNV<sub>KUN</sub> and demonstrated that these structures are directly linked to the formation of sfRNAs in vivo. Our studies regarding the characteristics of these uniquely, Xrn1-resistant RNAs suggest that a specific and unusual structure confers resistance to Xrn1. These studies provide a framework for more detailed structure-based mechanistic investigations of these RNAs that are directly linked to disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Chemical reagents and synthetic DNA</title><p>General chemical reagents were all of molecular biology grade or higher.

Because the Dengue 3′UTR is predicted to harbor multiple pseudoknot structures, we used the recently developed software program Shapeknots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hajdin et al., 2013</xref>) to incorporate our chemical mapping data into secondary structure prediction algorithms capable of identifying such structures. Figures overlaying chemical probing data onto RNA secondary structures were made using the software program R2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinberg and Breaker, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Xrn1 resistance experiment</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Standard Xrn1 resistance assay</title><p>A standard assay for determining Xrn1-resistance was developed in which 4 μg of RNA (typically ∼100–200 pmol or ∼2.5–4 μM RNA depending on the specific construct being evaluated) was folded in 36 μl of 1X EC3. In some experiments 300–450 pmol (∼10 μM) of a synthetically prepared 5′-monophosphorylated 24-mer (IDT) was also included as an internal control for Xrn1 activity. Following refolding, 2 μl of &gt;3 U/μl BdRppH was added and the reaction was split between two tubes. 1 μl of &gt;3 U/μl Xrn1 was added to one half of the reaction while the other served as a (−)Xrn1 control. Reactions were incubated 6 hr at 37°C. Reactions were then quenched by the addition of an equal volume of a dPAGE loading dye containing 30 mM EDTA, 8 M Urea and 0.1% (wt/vol) xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue. RNA products were analyzed on 12–20% dPAGE gels and visualized by staining with methylene blue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Xrn1 decay kinetics monitored by the fluorescence of the malachite green aptamer</title><p>To assess RNA decay kinetics through monitoring the fluorescence of the MG aptamer, 100 μl reactions of 4 μM RNA (400 pmol, ∼16 μg) were refolded in 1X EC3. Often several 100 μl reactions using the same RNA were carried out simultaneously and were pooled after being folded separately in an 8-tube PCR strip. While reactions were still pooled, 5 μl of &gt;3 U/ μl RppH per reaction and 7.5–10 equivalents of malachite green (30 μM final concentration, 3 μmol per reaction) were added. 105 μl aliquots of this mixture were then divided into separate wells of a black, flat bottomed 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC). Fluorescence was monitored using a Glomax Multi+ plate reader using a filter set that allowed excitation at 625 nm and monitoring of emission over 660–720 nm. Prior to the addition of Xrn1, fluorescence was measured for 5 min in order to ensure reactions had reached equilibrium and to allow RppH to start producing 5′-monophosphorylated Xrn1 substrates. At 5 min, 5 μl of &gt;3 U/μl Xrn1 was added and the reaction was then monitored for the next 160 min. Under these conditions RNA decay rates vary linearly with added Xrn1 (data not shown). To produce the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, after the experiment had ended, 20 μl of each reaction was removed and subjected to 10% dPAGE.

Reverse transcription was carried out as essentially as described for chemical mapping experiments. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 8 M urea, 10 mM EDTA loading dye and then heated to 90°C for 10 min in order to promote dissociation of cDNAs from the RNA. Reactions were then loaded onto 10% sequencing gels. Electrophoresis was carried out at 50 W for 4 hr.

CIP reactions were carried out using ∼5 μg of each RNA in a reaction performed as prescribed by the manufacturer of the enzyme (NEB). CIP’ed RNAs were purified by phenol chloroform extraction, washed once with 24:1 chloroform to isoamyl alcohol and then ethanol precipitated (70% ice cold EtOH, 300 mM NaOAC pH 5.2, −20°C, 2 hr). CIP’ed RNAs were then resuspended and quantified. All RNAs: CIP’ed and un-CIP’ed, ‘product’, ‘control’ and ’24-mer’ were then entered into phosphorylation reactions containing 50 pmol γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP and 8 pmol of each RNA (line iv, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).1 pmol of an synthetic, 5′-hydroxylated 40mer DNA was included to serve as a internal control for PNK activity. RNAs were then phosphorylated using T4 PNK (NEB) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer for 1.5 hr at 37°C. Individual samples were diluted and then passed over homemade G-25 Sephadex columns to remove unincorporated γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP. An equal volume of each reaction was the subjected to 15% dPAGE.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Timothy Nilsen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All agreed that the work was well done and interesting, but we were concerned that the manuscript came up a bit short at present for the expectations of <italic>eLife</italic>. It was agreed that the manuscript would be significantly elevated if it were shown that the three-helix junction structure was important for viral replication of sfRNA levels in a cell-based assay. Alternatively, if a second Xrn1 resistant structure from a different virus was analyzed perhaps in a bit less detail, it would establish the generality or not of the observations you have made. A revised paper must address either of these points.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01892.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We chose to address both of these points. First, we interrogated the Xrn1-resistant properties of two putative Xrn1-resistant RNA structures (xrRNAs) present in the 3’UTR of a flavivirus related to Dengue: the Kunjin strain of West Nile Virus (WNV<sub>KUN</sub>). We found that these RNA structures also resist Xrn1 in vitro and their function demonstrates similar sensitivity to mutations made in conserved sequence elements. These data are contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Second, because WNV<sub>KUN</sub> is a convenient strain for cell-based assays, we used it to correlate the observations we made regarding Xrn1 resistance in vitro with the formation of sfRNAs during infection. Specifically, we introduced mutations in the virus that match those we studied in vitro (in the three-way junction), and observed that these decrease sfRNA formation in infected cells. These data are contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. As a result of including these experiments, we added two authors, who have read and fully agree with the manuscript. We believe these experiments establish the generality of our observations and the direct link between the presence of Xrn1-resistant RNA structures and the production of sfRNAs in human cell lines and thus fulfill the requirements for resubmission of our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
