orchestration of gene transcription programs. We find that expression of this maturation gene program in mouse cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) requires dynamic changes in the genomic distribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), demonstrating a function for this chromatin modification beyond its role in cell fate specification. The developmental loss of H3K27me3 at promoters of genes activated as CGNs mature is facilitated by the lysine demethylase and ASD-risk gene, Kdm6b. Interestingly, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 in newborn CGNs not only blocks the repression of progenitor genes but also impairs the induction of mature CGN genes, showing the importance of bidirectional H3K27me3 regulation across the genome. These data demonstrate that H3K27me3 turnover in developing postmitotic neurons regulates the temporal coordination of gene expression programs that underlie functional neuronal maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>polycomb</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>Kdm6b</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS0988804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bidirectional regulation of the chromatin modification H3K27me3 orchestrates programs of gene expression that underlie postmitotic stages of neuronal maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell identity is determined during differentiation by the coordinated actions of chromatin regulatory factors, which serve to establish the accessibility of gene regulatory elements that control the transcription of cell-type specific genes. Histone proteins play a key role in determining the architecture of chromatin, and specific post-translational modifications of the histones are tightly associated with the transcriptional state of a given locus or gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyun et al., 2017</xref>). Among these modifications, histone methylation occurs on lysine and arginine residues of specific histones, and has roles in both gene activation and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jambhekar et al., 2019</xref>), and acts to alter gene transcription by recruiting the site-specific binding of effector proteins that carry out specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniel et al., 2005</xref>). H3K27me3 is a repressive histone modification that is best known for its role during cell-fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Mierlo et al., 2019</xref>). H3K27 methylation is deposited by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) lysine methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voncken et al., 2003</xref>). H3K27me3 can be enzymatically removed by the H3K27-specific lysine demethylases KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swigut and Wysocka, 2007</xref>). In mice, null mutations in <italic>Ezh2</italic> result in early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Carroll et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Kdm6a</italic> knockouts show severely impaired mid-gestational development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Welstead et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> knockouts die at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgold et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting the physiological importance of H3K27me3 regulation for mammalian embryonic development.</p><p>Neurons are born very early in their overall lifespan, and they undergo significant transcriptional and functional changes during the postmitotic stages of their developmental maturation. The enzymes that write and erase H3K27me3 remain expressed in neurons both during postnatal stages of development and in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wijayatunge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijayatunge et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that they have functions beyond fate determination that remain to be understood. Conditional deletion of both <italic>Ezh1</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic> in neurons of the adult mouse causes a slow global loss of H3K27me3 as well as progressive neurodegeneration and death showing the importance of these enzymes in adult neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Schimmelmann et al., 2016</xref>). One possibility is that H3K27me3 is required for fate maintenance. For example, deleting EED in developing postmitotic dopamine or serotonin neurons in vivo leads not only to the loss of H3K27me3 but also to reduced expression of the enzymes that define the transmitter phenotype of these neuromodulatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toskas et al., 2022</xref>). Other studies suggest that H3K27me3 might be required in terminally differentiated neurons to persistently repress genes that have the potential to drive trans-differentiation to alternate cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Schimmelmann et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The global depletion of H3K27me3 in postmitotic neurons takes months to appear after the deletion of EZH1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Schimmelmann et al., 2016</xref>) revealing that this histone modification is remarkably stable across the bulk of the genome. Although histone replacement is a major mechanism of H3K27me3 removal in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shpargel et al., 2014</xref>), histone turnover is very slow in postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maze et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, H3K27-selective lysine demethylases are widely expressed in the adult brain suggesting that these enzymes may have a particularly important role in the local regulation of histone methylation patterns in postmitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swahari and West, 2019</xref>). Both <italic>Kdm6a</italic> and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> are expressed in neurons over the course of brain development, though only <italic>Kdm6b</italic> shows enhanced expression following exposure of cells to neuronal differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Santa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jepsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijayatunge et al., 2018</xref>). Germline knockout of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> does not impair the gross architecture of the embryonic brain, but it does result in perinatal lethality caused by disruption of the functional maturation of a respiratory circuit that is required for proper breathing after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgold et al., 2012</xref>). This phenotype arises as a result of the lost demethylase function of Kdm6b, because survival cannot be rescued by transgenic expression of a demethylase-dead Kdm6b in the knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgold et al., 2012</xref>). These data are important because they suggest that demethylation mediated by Kdm6b is essential for the proper function of postmitotic neurons. Chromatin regulators are one of the major classes of genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and notably <italic>KDM6B</italic> has been identified as a high-confidence ASD risk gene in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Kdm6b</italic> haploinsufficiency in mice is associated with ASD-like impairments in sociability suggesting its importance for proper social network function in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022</xref>), however, the underlying chromatin and transcriptional mechanisms of these Kdm6b mutation phenotypes remain to be elucidated.</p><p>We use CGNs to model neurodevelopment because they comprise more than 99% of all neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Consalez et al., 2021</xref>) and 85% of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman and Bayer, 1997</xref>) in the cerebellum, enabling the in vivo comparison of chromatin across CGN developmental states with limited contamination from other cell types. When purified and placed in ex vivo culture, CGN progenitors coordinately exit the cell cycle, minimizing heterogeneity of cell developmental stage across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fogarty et al., 2007</xref>). In both preparations, gene transcription programs change over time coincident with changes in CGN biology (e.g<italic>.</italic> proliferation, migration, synapse formation, and synapse maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sathyanesan et al., 2019</xref>). We previously showed that loss of <italic>Kdm6a/b</italic> had no effect on postnatal morphogenesis of the cerebellum, demonstrating these enzymes are not required in vivo for the regulation of CGN progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijayatunge et al., 2018</xref>). However, knockdown of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in cultured CGNs impaired the developmental induction of genes during the period of postmitotic neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijayatunge et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these data, we hypothesized that H3K27me3 may serve as a temporal gatekeeper of these maturation genes, delaying their activation beyond the immediate period of terminal differentiation to the neuronal fate.</p><p>Here to directly test the hypothesis that H3K27me3 regulation serves as a mechanism of neuronal maturation we determined the role of H3K27me3 dynamics in changing programs of gene transcription in postmitotic CGNs. We used ChIP-seq and a CUT&amp;RUN time course study to identify the genomic location and timing of differential sites of H3K27me3 enrichment across the genome of fate-committed CGNs developing in vivo and in culture. We observed that H3K27me3 distributions continue to change even after fate-committed CGN progenitors exit the cell cycle, and that the loss of H3K27me3 at gene promoters is associated with the activation of genes induced as neurons mature. We also found a smaller subset of differential H3K27me3 peaks that occur at poised enhancers, which are dually marked by H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 and inversely correlated over time with H3K27ac enrichment. We used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to disrupt the action of H3K27me3 regulatory enzymes and show evidence of roles for both the lysine demethylase KDM6B and the lysine methyltransferase EZH2 in the induction of a postmitotic program of gene transcription that underlies functional maturation of CGNs. Taken together, our data advance our understanding of how programs of gene expression are temporally orchestrated by changing H3K27me3 distributions in the chromatin of maturing neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cerebellar maturation involves dynamic, genome-wide changes in H3K27me3 distribution</title><p>To measure H3K27me3 dynamics during cerebellar maturation in vivo, we harvested cerebellar cortex from C57BL/6NCrl mice at postnatal days 7, 14, and 60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At P7, about half of all granule cells in the mouse cerebellum are proliferating granule neuron precursors (GNPs) whereas the rest are immature, postmitotic cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs).

We found local losses as well as gains in H3K27me3 enrichment at different sites between developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This was true even when comparing P14 with P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating that bidirectional changes in H3K27me3 distributions occur during postmitotic stages of neuronal maturation, well after the period of terminal cell fate commitment has ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We stratified differential H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peaks by their genomic location with respect to proximal gene promoters, gene bodies, or intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and found a consistent overrepresentation of proximal gene promoters among developmentally demethylated peaks for all three comparisons. By contrast, H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peaks differentially gained between all three comparisons did not differ from the global distribution of H3K27me3, which was distributed across gene-body and distal intergenic regions as well as proximal promoters. The percentage of total H3K27me3-positive promoters gradually decreased by ~ twofold from P7 to P60, while that of H3K27me3-positive distal intergenic regions increased, and that of gene bodies stayed about the same over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, the total number of H3K27me3 peaks called centered within a 5 kb window around the TSS of genes annotated with H3K27me3 appeared to gradually decrease from P7 to P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data demonstrate that in CGNs H3K27me3 patterns are locally regulated in postmitotic neurons, suggesting a function for H3K27me3-dependent gene regulation in developing neurons that extends beyond the restriction of cell fate commitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3K27me3 dynamics at promoters during cerebellar maturation inversely correlate with H3K4me3 enrichment and gene expression</title><p>We identified 3618 differential H3K27me3 peaks across all time points using a strict cut-off of |Log<sub>2</sub>FC|&gt;2, p-adj &lt;0.05. We first filtered these for promoters because these regions can be directly mapped to their target gene for transcriptional regulation and obtained 1805 peaks. We then asked whether peaks that were up- and downregulated over stages of CGN differentiation were found at genes that can be stratified according to cellular function. Examples of genes with promoter-associated peaks lost or gained from P7 to P60, respectively, were the genes encoding the mature NMDA-type glutamate receptor <italic>Grin2c</italic> which is strongly expressed in mature CGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijayatunge et al., 2018</xref>) and the cell-proliferation factor <italic>Mycn,</italic> which is expressed only in GNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the levels of promoter H3K27me3 inversely correlate with changes in gene expression over development.</p><p>To determine if the correlation of H3K27me3 demethylation with transcriptional maturation holds broadly, we first performed hierarchical clustering on the 1805 differential H3K27me3 promoter peaks and identified three major clusters with differing direction and timing of change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The first cluster, which we termed ‘H3K27me3 Up,’ contained peaks that gained methylation as early as P14 and maintained methylation during CGN maturation. The next two clusters included demethylated peaks, that we termed ‘H3K27me3 Down (Fast)’ and ‘H3K27me3 Down (Slow)’, respectively, depending on whether they changed between P7 and P14 or between P14 and P60. Because H3K27me3 at promoters has been associated with H3K4me3 bivalency during cell-fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>), a state that is thought to poise genes for later activation, we next asked whether the presence of H3K27me3 at these gene promoters was associated with H3K4me3. We downloaded H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from P6 and P22 mouse cerebellar tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>), and compared both the presence and the levels of H3K4me3 across development at promoters of genes within the differential H3K27me3 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Regardless of their H3K27me3 dynamics, most of these promoters had peaks of H3K4me3 at both P6 and P22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, these data also show that, compared with the set of promoters that have unchanged H3K27me3 over development, there was a significant decrease in H3K4me3 levels over time at promoters that gain H3K27me3, whereas there is a significant increase in H3K4me3 at promoters that lose H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further consistent with the hypothesis that turnover of promoter H3K27me3 permits promoter activation, we saw an inverse correlation between changes in H3K27me3 and enrichment of the active chromatin marker H3K27ac as well as chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>) at the same promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Differential histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) promoters cluster by turnover kinetics and correlate with cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) maturation gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differential H3K27me3 peaks across P7 to P60 were filtered for promoter-associated peaks, followed by the hierarchical clustering with Pearson correlation, of their VST-transformed DESeq2-normalized counts (left) from P7-P60, and corresponding VST-transformed DESeq2-normalized counts for H3K4me3 from P6-P22 (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>).

Because developmentally gained peaks showed a broader distribution than just promoters, we performed the same type of filtering and hierarchical clustering for differential H3K27me3 peaks overlying gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Again, these data show that gene bodies that lose H3K27me3 are associated with terms related to genes expressed in mature neurons, however, these are much fewer in number compared to promoters. To determine if H3K27me3 dynamics at promoters were associated with the expression of the corresponding RNA transcript across CGN maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we compared our H3K27me3 ChIP-seq to a dataset of gene expression at the same time points from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>). We found that ‘H3K27me3 Up’ peaks at gene promoters were significantly associated with a decrease in expression of the associated gene over the same period of developmental time and ‘H3K27me3 Down’ peaks were associated with an increase in gene expression. Among the H3K27me3 Down peaks, ‘Fast’ peaks were associated with a significantly greater magnitude of gene induction than ‘Slow’ peaks between P7 and P14, but ‘Slow’ peaks were associated with a significantly greater magnitude of gene induction than ‘Fast’ peaks between P14 and P60. There was no significant difference between ‘Fast’ and ‘Slow’ peaks from P7 to P60 indicating that it is the timing not the magnitude of differential developmental gene expression that defines the two clusters. These data show that the H3K27me3 dynamics at gene promoters are associated with differential H3K4me3 enrichment, and the timing of gene expression changes in postmitotic neurons, which allows for multiple postmitotic waves of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken together, these data provide evidence that the postmitotic removal of H3K27me3 from a subset of gene promoters is important for the coordinated induction of gene expression that underlies neuronal maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>H3K27me3 is bidirectionally regulated at a sparse set of cerebellar enhancers</title><p>Widespread changes in the activation and function of key developmentally regulated enhancers have been identified during cerebellar maturation in vivo over embryonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramirez et al., 2022</xref>) and postnatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>) timepoints. To determine whether the non-promoter H3K27me3 peaks we identified in developing cerebellum might function to regulate enhancers, we assessed our differential H3K27me3 sites for histone markers that are characteristic of enhancers. Like the concept of bivalent promoters, the dual presence of H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 at enhancers is proposed to poise them for future activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>).

To determine if the developmental change in H3K27me3 at these regulatory elements was correlated with a change in their function, we determined the relationship between developmental changes in H3K27me3 and changes in the levels of H3K27ac, which is widely used as a marker of enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ernst and Kellis, 2013</xref>). As we did in our analysis of H3K27me3 at promoters, we first clustered H3K27me3 peaks at putative enhancers by their H3K27me3 levels over time and identified two clusters that increase or decrease H3K27me3 as CGNs mature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These peak clusters were inversely associated with changes in H3K27ac levels over developmental time, such that putative enhancers gaining H3K27me3 by P60 lost activity (we term these ‘Decommissioned’) and putative enhancers losing H3K27me3 by P60 gained activity (we term these ‘Poised’).

A smaller number of peaks showed increases in H3K27me3, which could arise from secondary effects of EZH2 inhibition on other processes such as EZH1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen et al., 2008</xref>) or histone turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chory et al., 2019</xref>).

GSK-126-sensitive H3K27me3 promoter peaks were found at genes enriched for GO terms associated with several non-neuronal cell types, consistent with the hypothesis that PRC2 functions in postmitotic cells at least in part to maintain the chosen cell fate by repressing genes that represent alternate fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a large number of H3K27me3 peaks remained unchanged after GSK-126 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that different sites of H3K27me3 are differentially sensitive to EZH2 inhibition during this period of CGN differentiation. To determine how GSK-126 sensitivity relates to differential changes in H3K27me3 during CGN differentiation, we took the three clusters of H3K27me3 peaks we derived in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (H3K27me3 Up DIV1-7, Down DIV 1–7, or Unchanged) and created metagene plots to quantify the average H3K27me3 signal on DIV5 at these promoters in cells treated with the EZH2 inhibitor versus control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Promoters that normally gain H3K27me3 over CGN differentiation were the most strongly affected by GSK-126 treatment, indicating that the activity of EZH2 in postmitotic neurons is required for the de novo acquisition of H3K27me3 peaks at these genes. Promoters where H3K27me3 is unchanged across development also showed some loss of signal, suggesting that EZH2 plays a role in the general maintenance of this repressive mark. By contrast, the set of promoters that normally lose H3K27me3 over the course of CGN development still retained substantial H3K27me3 signal at DIV5 and this was almost entirely unaffected by EZH2 inhibition. Thus, these data show that different classes of promoters are differently sensitive to the inhibition of EZH2 during postmitotic stages of differentiation. Given that we have shown the developmental regulation of H3K27me3 at these promoters to correlate with changes in gene expression, we next asked about the consequence of GSK-126 treatment for gene expression.</p><p>We performed RNA-seq on CGN cultures at DIV5 +/− GSK-126 treatment and compared the effects of EZH2 inhibition to the developmental regulation of these same genes during normal CGN differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Some of the genes that showed higher levels of expression in neurons treated with GSK-126 (e.g. <italic>Mycn, Ebf3</italic>) are normally downregulated as CGNs mature. These genes have EZH2-dependent developmental increases in H3K27me3 at their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and/or enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), suggesting that the developmental gain of this repressive modification facilitates turning these genes off. However, we were surprised to find that GSK-126 treatment also reduced the expression of genes such as <italic>Gabrd</italic> and <italic>Grin2c</italic> that are normally induced as CGNs differentiate, even though the levels of H3K27me3 at these gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) were unaffected by GSK-126 treatment.</p><p>To determine if this relationship held broadly, we again used the gene clusters from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (H3K27me3 Up DIV1-7, Down DIV 1–7, or Unchanged) and determined how gene expression changed across the genes in these clusters following EZH2 inhibition. These data show that, relative to the set of genes where H3K27me3 does not change over development, genes whose promoters normally gain H3K27me3 over development showed increased expression after GSK-126 treatment, whereas genes whose promoters normally lose H3K27me3 during development showed reduced expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref><bold>, left</bold>). To understand why the late genes had reduced expression after EZH2 inhibition despite having normal H3K27me3, we considered the possibility that the elevated expression of the early genes could inhibit late gene expression. To address this possibility, we performed a second experiment in which we added GSK-126 at DIV3, after H3K27me3 has already been added at many of the early-expressed gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). When we ran RNA-seq at DIV5 and repeated the analysis of gene expression by cluster, now we found no significant difference in the expression of the genes that gain H3K27me3 during CGN development compared with the H3K27me3 Unchanged gene cluster, but we still observed a significant reduction in expression of the late-expressed genes that lose promoter H3K27me3 over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref><bold>, right</bold>). These data are important because they show that proper expression of the mature CGN gene expression program requires not only the KDM6B-dependent removal of H3K27me3 at late gene promoters but also the EZH2-dependent addition of H3K27me3 elsewhere in the genome. We discuss possible mechanisms below that may explain this requirement for EZH2 in setting up the mature gene expression program for later induction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the role of H3K27me3 turnover in postmitotic gene regulation, using the maturation of mouse CGNs as a model system. PRC2 activity has long been studied as a mechanism of early cell-fate specification in mammals through the deposition of H3K27me3 and silencing of fate-defining genes during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into other cell types including neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and early neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>). Our study demonstrates that dynamic changes in H3K27me3 continue in postmitotic neurons at specific sites in the genome to coordinate the temporal induction of gene expression programs that underlie functional maturation. Increases in H3K27me3 occurred rapidly after cell cycle exit, whereas demethylation occurred gradually and these turnover kinetics strongly correlated with the kinetics of regulated gene expression. We identified a subset of transcriptional enhancers that show developmental regulation of H3K27me3 but observed a bias in the genomic distribution of regulated sites toward gene promoters, especially for sites of H3K27me3 demethylation. Promoters that gained H3K27me3 after cell cycle exit were enriched for genes involved in proliferation and cell-fate specification such as <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic>. By contrast, developmentally demethylated promoters included those for genes that confer mature function on synapses such as the NMDA receptor subunit <italic>Grin2c</italic> and the metabotropic glutamate receptor <italic>Grm4</italic>. This suggested to us that there are temporally coordinated mechanisms of enzymatic H3K27me3 turnover during CGN maturation, and that postmitotic H3K27me3 demethylation may be a key step for timing functional synaptic maturation.</p><p>Our in vivo cerebellar data show that developmental loss of H3K27me3 from gene promoters is facilitated by KDM6B, and further conditional knockout of KDM6B in CGNs impaired the expression of genes that are induced as CGNs mature. <italic>Kdm6b</italic> expression is upregulated in newborn CGNs in the inner EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijayatunge et al., 2018</xref>), and we speculate that the temporal increase in expression of this enzyme may tip the balance of H3K27me3 regulation to favor histone demethylation at specific target sites. Our evidence that genes with increased H3K27me3 in the <italic>Kdm6b</italic>-cKO mice overlap those that show developmental loss of H3K27me3 is consistent with the possibility that KDM6B functions enzymatically to demethylate histones at these gene promoters. However, chromatin regulators including KDM6B have scaffolding functions as well as enzymatic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohguchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xun et al., 2017</xref>), thus we attempted to use pharmacological inhibition of KDM6B to validate the role of its enzymatic activity in developing CGN gene regulation. The small molecule GSK-J4 is a relatively selective inhibitor of the KDM6 family compared with other histone demethylases, and it was previously demonstrated in primary human macrophages to block LPS-mediated histone demethylation and induction of TNFa expression with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 9 µM and no apparent toxicity up to 30 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kruidenier et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, we found 50% cytotoxicity in CGNs at a GSK-J4 concentration of just 3.1 µM and no evidence by western blot or CUT&amp;RUN for any global or local changes in H3K27me3 when the drug was applied at the non-toxic dose of 1 µM.</p><p>Moving forward, as an alternative to pharmacological inhibition of KDM6B, genetic mutation of the JmjC domain of KDM6B offers an effective means to test its functional requirement in neuronal H3K27me3 demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakka et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, a prior study showed that in a BAC transgene, enzymatically dead KDM6B was unable to rescue perinatal death in KDM6B knockout mice, which is consistent with a requirement for the enzymatic function of KDM6B in the maturation of the respiratory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgold et al., 2012</xref>). Our data now identify a set of genes induced in maturing neurons that function at synapses and require active H3K27me3 demethylation for their induction. Several of the targets of KDM6B-regulated demethylation and induction encode gene products known to play key roles in the functional maturation of synapses. These include the glutamate receptor subunit genes <italic>Grin2c</italic> and <italic>Grm4,</italic> which play important roles in cerebellar motor function and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadotani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pekhletski et al., 1996</xref>), the GABA-A receptor delta subunit gene (<italic>Gabrd</italic>), which modulates the subcellular localization and neurosteroid sensitivity of GABA-A receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vicini et al., 2002</xref>) and the neuronal pentraxin receptor gene <italic>Nptxr,</italic> which promotes the formation and stabilization of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Impaired or delayed induction of these genes in the absence of KDM6B has implications for understanding how mutations in KDM6B may lead to behavioral phenotypes in ASD via altered maturation of neural circuit function. Interestingly, mutations in another ASD-associated chromatin regulator, DNMT3A, that impair DNA methylation-dependent mechanisms of gene repression appear to be partially compensated by changes in H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies will be needed to address whether the modulation of H3K27me3 could function as a point of biological convergence downstream of multiple ASD-associated chromatin regulators.</p><p>Our observation that H3K27me3 removal occurs at only a subset of genes that are developmentally induced during CGN maturation raises the question of how these promoters are marked for methylation and demethylation. Through an unbiased approach, we showed that promoters that lose H3K27me3 during CGN maturation are strongly enriched for binding of the transcription factors ZIC1/2; thus, one possibility is that an interaction between KDM6B and the ZICs selects these genes for induction in maturing neurons. ZIC1/2 are strong drivers of CGN maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>), and mutation of these genes is associated with cerebellar disorders, showing their importance in CGN development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Twigg et al., 2015</xref>). ZIC1 and 2 are zinc-finger binding proteins that exhibit dynamic DNA binding properties during cerebellar maturation, and they regulate the expression of both early and late CGN maturation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>). Given the strong association of H3K27ac enrichment at these promoters, however, it is likely that ZIC1/2 binding is a consequence and not a cause of H3K27-demethylation at promoters. It would, therefore, be essential to measure the genome-wide enrichment patterns of KDM6B during CGN maturation, in order to identify its binding partners and direct targets. Existing literature investigating KDM6B dynamics across the epigenome is sparse owing to the lack of well-validated, commercially available KDM6B antibodies. Nevertheless, KDM6B has been shown to localize to promoters and enhancers of neurogenic genes in NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Estarás et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2014</xref>), and more recently to induce muscle regeneration gene <italic>Has2</italic>, by removing H3K27me3 from its promoter, to initiate muscle repair in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakka et al., 2022</xref>). KDM6B targeting to these specific loci might be facilitated through interactions with TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Estarás et al., 2012</xref>), and chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Santa et al., 2007</xref>). For example, KDM6B has been shown to strongly associate with the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers mSWI/SNF or BAF complex, by interacting with its subunits which in turn potentiate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>). This interaction has been shown to play a role in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we find that maturation of CGN transcriptional programs not only depends on the loss of H3K27me3 at genes that turn on late, but also requires the addition of H3K27me3 at regions that gain this mark in newly postmitotic neurons. Using CUT&amp;RUN in cultured CGNs, we discovered that the rapid increases in H3K27me3 that accumulate in newly postmitotic neurons are highly sensitive to inhibition of EZH2 with GSK-126. Failure to gain H3K27me3 at these sites in differentiating neurons not only prevented the developmental downregulation of CGN progenitor markers like <italic>Mycn, Jag1,</italic> and <italic>Ebf3</italic> but also impaired the developmental induction of late genes like <italic>Gabrd</italic>, <italic>Grm4,</italic> and <italic>Grin2c</italic>. The impact of GSK-126 on the mature CGN transcriptional program, however, was not due to changes in H3K27me3 regulation at promoters of the late genes themselves. This shows that the postmitotic addition of H3K27me3 at specific genomic sites is crucial in regulating the induction of genes that turn on well after neuronal cell fate is determined.</p><p>These data raise the question of how the PRC2 complex function might indirectly regulate the activation of late gene expression programs over a period of days. One prior study that reported the consequences of knocking out EZH2 in postmitotic neuronal cultures showed that this resulted in the loss of H3K27me3 at the promoter of the <italic>Prdm13</italic> gene and enhanced expression of this transcriptional repressor, which they suggested then led indirectly to reduced expression of its target genes in the knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buontempo et al., 2022</xref>). Though a similar mechanism could be at play in our cultures, <italic>Prdm13</italic> expression and promoter H3K27me3 were unaffected by EZH2 inhibition in our DIV5 CGNs, thus we have considered alternative explanations. Notably, developmental gains in H3K27me3 during postmitotic differentiation are relatively equally split between promoters, gene bodies, and distal intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By comparing these sites of H3K27me3 regulation to other chromatin marks, we found that the majority of non-promoter peaks of H3K27me3 do not overlap enhancers. These data raise the possibility that rather than functioning to control transcriptional regulatory elements directly, H3K27me3 might contribute to gene regulation through an alternate mechanisms such as by impacting chromatin architecture. PRC2-dependent deposition of H3K27me3 has been shown in some cases to contribute to physical interactions between enhancers and their target genes by anchoring chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz-Molina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kraft et al., 2022</xref>). These loops may then poise genes for enhancer activation later upon receiving a developmental stimulus. The gain of H3K27me3 in early differentiating CGNs could serve a similar function to establish such enhancer contacts with the promoters of late genes such that when KDM6B demethylates these promoters, the enhancer can permit activation. In the future, investigating dynamics in higher-order chromatin structure through low-input techniques such as HiCAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 2022</xref>) might help inform how H3K27me3 dynamics contribute to gene regulation in postmitotic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>We performed all procedures under an approved protocol from the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. <italic>Kdm6b</italic> floxed mice described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manna et al., 2015</xref> were obtained from Jackson Labs (Stock #029615, RRID #IMSR_JAX:029615).

Western blot signals were detected by Li-Cor Odyssey InfraRed Imaging System (Lincoln, NE) with the secondary antibodies, CF770 goat anti-Rabbit, (Biotium 20078), and CF 680 goat anti-mouse, (Biotium 20065).

Statistics on Western blot quantification were performed using ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The R package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used for read-count normalization and differential binding analysis. R package ChIPseeker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) was used to annotate ChIP-seq peaks using a window of TSS ± 3000. ‘Promoters’ is a group of ChIPseeker terms ‘Promoter ( ≤ 1 kb), Promoter (1–2 kb), and Promoter (2–3 kb). Gene Body is a group of terms including 5’ UTR, 3’ UTR, Intron, and Exon. Statistics for violin plots comparing distributions of Log2 fold changes of DESeq2 normalized read-counts for RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and DNAse-seq data between clusters of genes, were performed using ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test unless not normally distributed, in which case a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors need to expand the narrow focus of the work related to promoter analysis and extend it to include enhancers, using the most recent databases, such as the database for cerebellar enhancers noted in the reviews.</p><p>2) Authors need to provide data in the cultures, or in vivo if relevant databases exist, for the presence/absence of the H3K4me3 modification on early and late promoters, as well as the H3K4me1mark for enhancers. They should also explain/speculate in the discussion why they think there is no phenotype in the KO mice with respect to cerebellar development, despite the findings on changes in the early/late genes? If they have a more detailed time course of changes in late gene expression, when early genes are repressed persistently after treatment with EZH2 inhibitor, they should add this information, otherwise discuss any relevant information from previous studies bearing on this issue.</p><p>3). We are not requesting new experiments related to autism, but if they choose to emphasize this point, authors are requested to discuss how their results with PRC2 provide insight into the epigenetic basis for autism, in the context of previously published studies by others on additional chromatin factors, as mentioned in the reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this work, authors exploit the prolonged in vivo maturation of postmitotic cerebellar granule neurons to test how changes in the chromatin modification, H3K27me3, may coordinate an orderly change in RNA expression profiles during maturation. The authors show that normal in vivo cerebellar development is associated with temporal gains and losses of H3K27me3 at promoters. In a conditional KO mouse for the lysine demethylase, KDM6B, late-expressing CGN genes, encoding mature neuronal functions, are abnormally hypermethylated and repressed. Some of these genes, which lose H3K27me3 during normal development, and are expressed, are shown to be associated with ZIC family transcriptional activators. Conversely, authors treat CGN primary cultures with an inhibitor of the PRC2 catalytic subunit, the lysine methyltransferase, EZH2. As expected, some genes lose H3K27me3 at their promoters with treatment. These genes are found to encode &quot;early&quot; non-neuronal/developmental processes, are repressed during normal maturation, and are up-regulated after treatment compared to controls. Unexpectedly, while there is no change in H3K27me3 methylation of &quot;late&quot; genes, authors observe a decrease in their expression levels with inhibitor treatment. Based on their findings, authors propose a bidirectional regulation by H3K27me3 which coordinates gene expression programs underlying functional neuronal maturation. Because mutations in KDM6B are a risk factor for autism, authors also propose that the work may provide insight into this disorder.</p><p>Exploiting the prolonged maturation in CGN neurons is an elegant way to dissect the regulation of early and late gene expression events over developmental transitions. However, the advance here is somewhat incremental in light of two previous studies by this lab showing effects of CGN maturation and polycomb function in vivo, and in culture, using the same KDM6B animal model (Frank et al., 2015; Wijayatunge et al., 2018). Innovation is also impacted by a wealth of information that exists already for roles for H3K27me3 in both cell fate decisions and maturation, in the nervous system and elsewhere, including a description of waves of H3K27me3 in oligodendrocyte lineage (Bartosovic and Castelo-Branco, 2022). In this work by authors, both early neuronal and non-neuronal genes are also affected. While some of the relevant previous references are cited, it is not in the context of how authors' new work adds to the biological significance of what was already known, or how the current results dramatically alter thinking about the functions of the PRC2 complex or H3K27me3 generally. The bidirectional effect here is interesting but remains unexplored.</p><p>There is also concern about the narrow focus of the work, which is primarily bioinformatics driven. The conclusion in the abstract that they have uncovered gene programs underlying functional neuronal maturation is a bit overstated because there are no functional studies in this work. A previous study by authors cited in the paper indicated that the conditional KO mouse model does not show any effects on the overall development of the cerebellum, and no phenotypes are provided in the current study after the manipulation of the enzymes. Therefore, the biological significance of bidirectionality is not known. The focus of the current work would be broadened by deeper analysis related to the regulation of early and late enhancers. The field of enhancer regulation in the nervous system is getting quite mature, including a resource of dynamic changes in cerebellum enhancers during development (Ramierez et al., 2022). New experiments, and/or a deeper analysis of chromatin events, would increase interest in a general audience. Motif analysis of enhancers could provide clues as to whether other protein factors are recruited in conjunction with H3K27me3 to early genes. The authors use CUT and RUN in the culture system for H3K27me3, but this approach can be used with other histone modification antibodies. The work could be broadened to investigate, for example, whether the promoters are marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. Is the chromatin of slow and fast maturation genes in culture differentially marked? This could also be done in vivo.</p><p>While the cerebellum is a region associated with autism, DNMT3a is also linked to autism, several BAF subunits are mutated in autism, and new enhancers in the cerebellum have been linked to autism recently (Ramierez et al., 2022). Without knowing whether there is a convergence of these other pathways on early or mature genes marked, or not, with H3K27Me3, it is not clear how the present work advances understanding of this complex disorder.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study provides numerous well-controlled experiments to define the dynamics of H3K27me3 in cerebellum development. I have some additional comments on areas that could be addressed:</p><p>– The analysis of the effects of KDM6B deletion on H3K27me3 and gene expression makes a convincing case that the activity of this enzyme is important for the removal of H3K27me3 and gene activation during postnatal maturation, but a direct assessment of the overlaps of the genes that are differentially expressed in development and those that are differentially expressed upon KDM6B deletion is not prominently presented. The degree to which there is overlap between these gene lists, and the identity of these genes could be helpful for understanding the functional importance of KDM6B and H3K27me3 removal during neuronal maturation.</p><p>– Although the analysis of H3K27me3 dynamics at promoters and gene bodies is informative, the authors do not provide any analysis of enhancers in the study. The study would be significantly strengthened if some assessment of H3K27me3 was carried out at these sites. Given that the authors have access to histone modification profiles that would allow them to identify putative enhancers in the cerebellum (H3K27ac Frank et al. 2015), it should be possible for the authors to carry out this analysis without completing additional experiments.</p><p>– The study takes advantage of the CGN culture system in order to do insightful pharmacology experiments. These cells show similar H3K27me3 dynamics as in vivo samples, making it a suitable system for their analyses. However, the authors do not make a direct comparison of the genes that have changes in H3K27me3 and gene expression in this system and the genes that show similar changes in vivo. A direct comparison of the genesets by overlap analysis would be helpful for the reader to know if the same genes are affected in both systems, or if the concept of dynamic H3K27me3 is the same, but the specific loci affected are context dependent.</p><p>– It would be helpful if the authors could better describe how the clusters in Figure 2A were defined. For example, the dendrogram could be included and show the remaining genes, not in the clusters presented. For many &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; peaks the profiles look quite similar. It appears that differences between these clusters in terms of associated gene expression might be more distinct if the slow population was more restricted to the genes at the bottom of that cluster that displays much more clear persistence of methylation through P14.</p><p>– The quantitative analysis of DHS in Figure 4E (left) shows a reduction in DHS signal at P7 to P60 &quot;H3K27me3 up&quot; promoters but the aggregate plot (right) appears to show an increase in DHS signal at these sites. No mention of these contradictory results is made in the text. Do the authors have an explanation for this disparity?</p><p>– The gene ontology analysis that is performed in the study does a convincing job of showing the general classes of molecules affected by H3K27me3 dynamics, but very limited analysis or discussion is made of specific genes that are dysregulated and how they may functionally influence CGN maturation. While the characterization of the functional effects of disrupted expression for these genes may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, the study would be improved if a few examples were noted and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86273.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors need to expand the narrow focus of the work related to promoter analysis and extend it to include enhancers, using the most recent databases, such as the database for cerebellar enhancers noted in the reviews.</p></disp-quote><p>We truly thank the reviewers for the suggestion to assess developmental changes in H3K27me3 at enhancers as marked by non-promoter peaks of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. We feel these analyses have substantially improved the study. We have added these data to a new figure, which is now Figure 3 in the revised manuscript. We have also added data to what is now Figure 3 – supplement 1. These data are presented in the Results section of the manuscript on Page 10.</p><p>These data show that changes in H3K27me3 can indeed be correlated with developmental changes in the activity of a small number (hundreds) of cerebellar enhancers. However, they also show that most non-promoter sites of differential H3K27me3 signal do not overlap chromatin marks of enhancers and most developmentally regulated cerebellar enhancers do not overlap sites of differential H3K27me3 regulation.</p><p>We conclude in the discussion on Pg. 23, “We identified a subset of transcriptional enhancers that show developmental regulation of H3K27me3 but observed a bias in the genomic distribution of regulated sites toward gene promoters, especially for sites of H3K27me3 demethylation.”</p><p>These data also help to deepen our model of the requirement for EZH2 in the expression of CGN maturation genes. On Pg. 27 we say, “Notably, developmental gains in H3K27me3 during postmitotic differentiation are relatively equally split between promoters, gene bodies, and distal intergenic regions (Figure 1D). By comparing these sites of H3K27me3 regulation to other chromatin marks, we found that the majority of non-promoter peaks of H3K27me3 do not overlap enhancers. These data raise the possibility that rather that functioning to control transcriptional regulatory elements directly, H3K27me3 might contribute to gene regulation through an alternate mechanisms such as by impacting chromatin architecture.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors need to provide data in the cultures, or in vivo if relevant databases exist, for the presence/absence of the H3K4me3 modification on early and late promoters, as well as the H3K4me1mark for enhancers.</p></disp-quote><p>The data on H3K4me3 have been added to Figure 2A, B and are presented in the results on Page 9. Because we added this analysis of other chromatin features that co-localize with H3K27me3 at promoters, we also moved the data on H3K27ac and DNAse accessibility at H3K27me3-regulated promoters out of what was Figure 4D-E into what is now Figure 2 – supplement 1 at this point in the text. These data show that H3K4me3 levels (as well as H3K27ac and accessibility) inversely correlate over developmental time with H3K27me3 at promoters. These data support our conclusion that the regulation of H3K27me3 at gene promoters is associated with changes in transcription of the underlying gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should also explain/speculate in the discussion why they think there is no phenotype in the KO mice with respect to cerebellar development, despite the findings on changes in the early/late genes?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not suggest that there is no phenotype in the cerebellar Kdm6b knockout mice. We state on Pg. 5 in the introduction, “We previously showed that loss of <italic>Kdm6a/b</italic> had no effect on postnatal morphogenesis of the cerebellum, demonstrating these enzymes are not required in vivo for regulation of CGN progenitor proliferation (Wijayatunge et al., 2018).” Our data here showing that the loss of Kdm6b predominantly impairs the expression of genes normally induced during maturation of postmitotic CGNs suggests instead that we might see defects in synaptic function in these mice. Notably, germline Kdm6b knockout mice die at birth because they fail to breathe properly, and this phenotype has been traced to failed maturation of a respiratory circuit in the midbrain. In the introduction on Page 4 we state, “Germline knockout of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> does not impair the gross architecture of the embryonic brain, but it does result in perinatal lethality caused by disruption of the functional maturation of a respiratory circuit that is required for proper breathing after birth (Burgold et al., 2012).”</p><p>We refer to these data again in the Discussion section on Page 24 and now relate our current findings to this phenotype, stating, “Indeed, a prior study showed that in a BAC transgene, enzymatically dead KDM6B was unable to rescue perinatal death in KDM6B knockout mice, which is consistent with a requirement for the enzymatic function of KDM6B in maturation of the respiratory circuit (Burgold et al., 2012). Our data now identify a set of genes induced in maturing neurons that function at synapses and require active H3K27me3 demethylation for their induction. Several of the targets of KDM6B-regulated demethylation and induction encode gene products known to play key roles in the functional maturation of synapses.”</p><p>We are currently studying the consequences of Kdm6b knockout for cerebellar synapse formation and function in our laboratory, but reporting those data is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If they have a more detailed time course of changes in late gene expression, when early genes are repressed persistently after treatment with EZH2 inhibitor, they should add this information, otherwise discuss any relevant information from previous studies bearing on this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional time course data to the GSK-126 experiments in Figure 7G as the reviewer suggested. These data are reported in the Results section on Page 21.</p><p>To determine when inhibiting Ezh2 could result in impaired expression of the maturing CGN gene expression program, we added GSK-126 (or DMSO as control) at either DIV1 or DIV3 and then harvested CGNs at DIV5 for RNA-seq (Figure 7G). These data are important because they show that when we inhibit EZH2 at DIV3, which is after the main period when early gene promoters gain H3K27me3, we still impair late gene expression without significant induction of the early genes. The implications of these data are discussed on Pg. 26.</p><p>We have added the following experimental details about the drug treatments to the methods section under “CGN culture” on Page 28. “The KDM6 family inhibitor GSK-J4 (Σ #SML0701) (Kruidenier et al., 2012) and the EZH2-specific inhibitor GSK-126 (Cayman #15415) (McCabe et al., 2012) were first used in a dose response assay to determine IC<sub>50</sub> in CGNs. For this, Cell Titer Glo (Promega #G7570) was performed on CGNs cultured in a 96-well plate at density of 100,000 cells/well, with inhibitors added one time at DIV1 and CGNs processed for downstream assays at DIV5. Further experiments with inhibitors were performed by treating CGNs one time at either DIV1 or DIV3 and processing for downstream assays at DIV5, using doses as specified in the text.”</p><p>We know that Ezh2 inhibition persist over the time course we use the drug in culture because we show in the western blot in Figure 7A that a single dose of GSK-126 delivered at DIV1 is sufficient to result in globally reduced H3K27me3 at DIV5.</p><p>We did not test if the effects of GSK-126 on H3K27me3 or gene expression can be reversed or maintained over longer periods of time because it is challenging to keep mouse CGNs alive in culture for more that 7-10 days. As to data from the literature, to our knowledge only one previous study has specifically examined the functions of EZH2 in postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation (Buontempo et al., 2022) now cited on Pg. 27. This paper used conditional EZH2 knockout in cells that were differentiated from ESCs via neuronal progenitors to glutamate neurons in culture and it also did not address the later time points or reversibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We are not requesting new experiments related to autism, but if they choose to emphasize this point, authors are requested to discuss how their results with PRC2 provide insight into the epigenetic basis for autism, in the context of previously published studies by others on additional chromatin factors, as mentioned in the reviews.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised or added text to the introduction on Page 5 and the discussion on Page 25 to add more information on the ASD relevance of KDM6B in the context of other ASD-associated epigenetic factors.</p><p>As the reviewers are well aware, there are a large number of chromatin regulators that have been implicated as ASD risk genes. To introduce our readers to this idea, and to place KDM6B in context, in the introduction on Page 5 we revised the text to state, “Chromatin regulators are one of the major classes of genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and notably <italic>KDM6B</italic> has been identified as a high confidence ASD risk gene in humans (Satterstrom et al., 2020). <italic>Kdm6b</italic> haploinsufficiency in mice is associated with ASD-like impairments in sociability suggesting its importance for proper social network function in the adult brain (Gao et al., 2022), however the underlying chromatin and transcriptional mechanisms of these Kdm6b mutation phenotypes remain to be elucidated.”</p><p>On Pg. 25 we added text to discuss how our identification of KDM6B target genes may enhance understanding of the relationship between this gene and ASD risk, saying, “Several of the targets of KDM6B-regulated demethylation and induction encode gene products known to play key roles in the functional maturation of synapses. These include the glutamate receptor subunit genes <italic>Grin2c</italic> and <italic>Grm4,</italic> which play important roles in cerebellar motor function and synaptic plasticity (Kadotani et al., 1996; Pekhletski et al., 1996), the GABA-A receptor δ subunit gene (<italic>Gabrd</italic>), which modulates the subcellular localization and neurosteroid sensitivity of GABA-A receptors (Vicini et al., 2002) and the neuronal pentraxin receptor gene <italic>Nptxr,</italic> which promotes the formation and stabilization of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Lee et al., 2017). Impaired or delayed induction of these genes in the absence of KDM6B has implications for understanding how mutations in KDM6B may lead to behavioral phenotypes in ASD via altered maturation of neural circuit function.”</p><p>With respect to biological convergence between KDM6B and other ASD-associated chromatin regulators, a recent study showed that H3K27me3 changes may compensate in part for the loss of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> as a mechanism of gene repression. On Page 25 we cite this work, saying, “Interestingly, mutations in another ASD-associated chromatin regulator, DNMT3A, that impair DNA methylation-dependent mechanisms of gene repression appear to be partially compensated by changes in H3K27me3 (Li et al., 2022). Future studies will be needed to address whether modulation of H3K27me3 could function as a point of biological convergence downstream of multiple ASD-associated chromatin regulators.”</p><p>As to potential links between enhancers and genes associated with ASD risk, which was referenced by one reviewer as mentioned in (Ramirez et al., 2022), it is our opinion that this an interesting area for future study, but well beyond the scope of what we have the space to discuss here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p></disp-quote><p>We have paraphrased many of the reviewer’s comments here for brevity and grouped them into related questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Novelty of this work in the context of prior literature.</p></disp-quote><p>The vast majority of studies in the literature that have addressed functions of H3K27me3 focus on questions of fate commitment in dividing cells. We cite a sampling of those papers here. On Page 3 we state the major difference between the current study and those prior studies of H3K27me3 in development, saying, “Neurons are born very early in their overall lifespan, and they undergo significant transcriptional and functional changes during postmitotic stages of their developmental maturation. The enzymes that write and erase H3K27me3 remain expressed in neurons both during postnatal stages of development and in the adult brain (Wijayatunge et al., 2014; Wijayatunge et al., 2018), suggesting that they have functions beyond fate determination that remain to be understood.” We go on to identify one of these functions as orchestrating the program of mature gene expression that turns on over time in postmitotic CGNs, and we further demonstrate that both H3K27me3 demethylation mediated by KDM6B and H3K27me3 methylation, mediated by Ezh2, contribute to the fidelity of this process. We think the novelty of the work is clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The biological function of the chromatin regulatory pathways studied – the conclusion in the abstract that they have uncovered gene programs underlying functional neuronal maturation is a bit overstated because there are no functional studies in this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we have not demonstrated functional maturation of our neurons. However, we have demonstrated that the chromatin mechanisms studied here do regulate the expression of genes that are known to underlie functional maturation of synapses. One example is the developmental switch in NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits from <italic>Grin2b</italic> to <italic>Grin2c</italic>, which is well established to underlie developmental changes in synaptic function in CGNs (see Kadotani et al., 1996).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern that we do not directly show maturation, we have thus changed the sentence paraphrased above from the abstract to read, “We find that expression of this maturation gene program in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) requires dynamic changes in the genomic distribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), demonstrating a function for this chromatin modification beyond its role in cell fate specification.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results and figures are written somewhat for a neurodevelopmental audience. Acronyms for the early and late genes are not defined, nor do they say how/why the representative genes were selected for certain experiments, or how the time course of events in culture relates to the timing in vivo, other than early or late.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the names of neurobiology-relevant genes may not always been obvious to non-neurobiologists. In addition, in any study that reports genome scale data it is challenging to provide details on every gene shown. To make the manuscript more accessible to all readers, we have spelled out the names and annotate the functional importance of key early (<italic>Myc, Atoh1</italic>) and late (<italic>Grm4, Grin2c</italic>) genes that appear repeatedly in the text and figures. We hope this will help the readability of the study.</p><p>To address the point about how the time course of events in culture relates to the timing in vivo, we have added a rank-rank hypergeometric overlap analysis of the gene expression changes in culture compared with the changes in vivo. This analysis allows for a global view of how two differential gene expression programs relate to one another. This plot has been added as Figure 6A, and the results are presented on Pg. 17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Details of genes in the GO terms and comparison of GO terms between ChIP- and RNA-seq data for related experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have redone the GO analysis with an improved tool described in the methods. We list all the genes used for GO analysis in Table S3. The methods on Pg. 35 now reads, “Gene ontology analysis was performed using the GO consortium GO tool (Ashburner et al., 2000) using terms related to ‘Panther GO biological process slim’ (Mi et al., 2019). Genes used to generate GO terms are provided in Table S3.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Scale indications missing for the ChIP and RNA-seq tracks.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these scale markings to all figures. In every case the scale is the identical for all conditions being compared for a single type of data (e.g. H3K27me3 ChIP-seq at different ages or RNA-seq +/- drug treatment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A statistical analysis section should be included in the methods. Figures often show large statistical differences with multiple *'s, but only &quot;* indicate p&lt; 0.05&quot; in the legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical methods are included in the methods section on Page 34, and additional detail on statistical significance represented by asterisks has been provided in each figure caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Authors should also consider another labeling system for comparing the levels of binding and expression in different contexts rather than up/down, gain/loss, up/down/gain/loss before and after treatment, particularly when referring to previous figures. Authors use &quot;loss&quot; and &quot;gain&quot; exclusively in the text, but in their figures, they use &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, which makes it difficult to track when they introduce the RNA-seq results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text. We appreciate that comparing multiple types of data in this story, as well as the fact that we are usually looking at variation in ChIP signal or gene expression over time, can make the figures complex to follow. We have done our best to synchronize the use of terms such as up and down or gain and loss across the figures and the text. We now refer to H3K27me3 peaks that are lost with the GSK-126 treatment as “sensitive” peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study provides numerous well-controlled experiments to define the dynamics of H3K27me3 in cerebellum development. I have some additional comments on areas that could be addressed:</p><p>– The analysis of the effects of KDM6B deletion on H3K27me3 and gene expression makes a convincing case that the activity of this enzyme is important for the removal of H3K27me3 and gene activation during postnatal maturation, but a direct assessment of the overlaps of the genes that are differentially expressed in development and those that are differentially expressed upon KDM6B deletion is not prominently presented. The degree to which there is overlap between these gene lists, and the identity of these genes could be helpful for understanding the functional importance of KDM6B and H3K27me3 removal during neuronal maturation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added gene expression data from P7, P14 and P60 cerebellum for the clusters in Figure 4 – supplement 2A that show genes upregulated and downregulated due to <italic>Kdm6b</italic>-cKO. Indeed, we see that genes downregulated due to <italic>Kdm6b</italic>-cKO are induced in mature neurons, while genes upregulated due to <italic>Kdm6b</italic>-cKO are repressed in mature neurons. We present the results on Pg. 13 where we added text saying, “Genes that were elevated at P14 in the <italic>Kdm6b</italic>-cKO mice all showed developmentally regulated expression in control mice that was highest at P7 and fell by P60. Genes whose expression was reduced in the <italic>Kdm6b</italic>-cKO mice also showed developmentally regulated expression, but they increased in expression over developmental time. Thus, the deletion of Kdm6b in GNPs appears to slow the transcriptional maturation of CGNs in postnatal life.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although the analysis of H3K27me3 dynamics at promoters and gene bodies is informative, the authors do not provide any analysis of enhancers in the study. The study would be significantly strengthened if some assessment of H3K27me3 was carried out at these sites. Given that the authors have access to histone modification profiles that would allow them to identify putative enhancers in the cerebellum (H3K27ac Frank et al. 2015), it should be possible for the authors to carry out this analysis without completing additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these data as suggested. The changes are detailed in the Essential Revisions section above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The study takes advantage of the CGN culture system in order to do insightful pharmacology experiments. These cells show similar H3K27me3 dynamics as in vivo samples, making it a suitable system for their analyses. However, the authors do not make a direct comparison of the genes that have changes in H3K27me3 and gene expression in this system and the genes that show similar changes in vivo. A direct comparison of the genesets by overlap analysis would be helpful for the reader to know if the same genes are affected in both systems, or if the concept of dynamic H3K27me3 is the same, but the specific loci affected are context dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now added violin plots in Figure 6 – supplement 1E describing H3K27me3 enrichment from P7 to P60 as a function of genes within clusters defined by differential H3K27me3 levels in culture, from Figure 6D (previously Figure 5D). These data show concordant regulation of the same genomic elements in the two system. Presentation of these data have been added to the Results section on Pg. 19.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be helpful if the authors could better describe how the clusters in Figure 2A were defined. For example, the dendrogram could be included and show the remaining genes, not in the clusters presented. For many &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; peaks the profiles look quite similar. It appears that differences between these clusters in terms of associated gene expression might be more distinct if the slow population was more restricted to the genes at the bottom of that cluster that displays much more clear persistence of methylation through P14.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the dendrograms used to hierarchically cluster the peaks in Figure 2A, 3B and 6D. As the reviewer suggests, the dendrogram shows these peaks could be broken down into additional clusters, however this may be at the expense of biologically relevant information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The quantitative analysis of DHS in Figure 4E (left) shows a reduction in DHS signal at P7 to P60 &quot;H3K27me3 up&quot; promoters but the aggregate plot (right) appears to show an increase in DHS signal at these sites. No mention of these contradictory results is made in the text. Do the authors have an explanation for this disparity?</p></disp-quote><p>In what is now Figure 2 – supplement 1 (formerly Figure 4E), we show a distribution of log2 fold changes in H3K27ac and DHS signal between P60 and P7, as a function of genes belong to clusters H3K27me3 Down and H3K27me3 Up. While H3K27me3 Down promoters are associated with a significant increase in DHS signal, and conversely H3K27me3 Up promoters are associated with a significant decrease, the overall log2 fold change signal from P7 to P60 is above 0 in all comparisons, suggesting an overall increase in chromatin accessibility at promoters. So, while the metagene plot on the right shows an increase in DHS signal at P60, this increase is significantly less compared to genes at H3K27me3 Down genes as well as genes with Unchanged H3K27me3 at promoters. We hope this clarifies the data. We felt these data were not as important as some others in the manuscript, thus we moved them to the supplementary files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The gene ontology analysis that is performed in the study does a convincing job of showing the general classes of molecules affected by H3K27me3 dynamics, but very limited analysis or discussion is made of specific genes that are dysregulated and how they may functionally influence CGN maturation. While the characterization of the functional effects of disrupted expression for these genes may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, the study would be improved if a few examples were noted and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section to the discussion on Pg. 25 where we discuss the biological functions of some of the most interesting KDM6B-dependent late genes we identified, <italic>Grin2c</italic>, <italic>Grm4</italic>, <italic>Gabrd</italic>, and <italic>Nptxr.</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
