While SARM1 activation and enzyme function are well defined, the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity but prior to axonal demise are much less well understood. Defects in calcium, mitochondria, ATP, and membrane homeostasis occur in injured axons, but the relationships among these events have been difficult to disentangle because prior studies analyzed large collections of axons in which cellular events occur asynchronously. Here, we used live imaging of mouse sensory neurons with single axon resolution to investigate the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity. Our studies support a model in which SARM1 NADase activity leads to an ordered sequence of events from loss of cellular ATP, to defects in mitochondrial movement and depolarization, followed by calcium influx, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and loss of membrane permeability prior to catastrophic axonal self-destruction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARM1</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>NAD+</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA219866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milbrandt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>DiAntonio</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS087632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milbrandt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>DiAntonio</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1-AG013730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milbrandt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32NS117784</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Devault</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Axon degeneration occurs via an ordered sequence of events downstream of SARM1 that proceeds from ATP loss, to defects in mitochondrial movement and depolarization, followed by calcium influx, phosphatidylserine externalization, loss of membrane permeability, and ending with catastrophic axonal self-destruction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SARM1 is the central executioner of pathological axon degeneration, an early feature of many neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Figley and DiAntonio, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krauss et al., 2020</xref>). SARM1 is the founding member of the TIR-domain family of NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Essuman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>), and a metabolic sensor activated by disrupted NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Figley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Activation of the SARM1 NADase depletes cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and initiates a metabolic crisis that ultimately leads to axon degeneration and/or neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>). SARM1 is a compelling target for therapeutic intervention, as loss of SARM1 is profoundly protective in animal models of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including nerve injury, peripheral neuropathies, traumatic brain injury, glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and Leber congenital amaurosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henninger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sasaki et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turkiew et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, as an enzyme, SARM1 is a druggable target, and both small molecule inhibitors and gene therapeutics effectively block axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosanac et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, there has been tremendous progress in dissecting the structure of SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>), the mechanism by which SARM1 is autoinhibited in healthy neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 2021</xref>) and activated in diseased neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Figley et al., 2021</xref>), and its role as an NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). However, the events downstream of NAD<sup>+</sup> loss but prior to catastrophic axon fragmentation are much less well understood.</p><p>SARM1 and its NADase activity are essential for injury-induced axon degeneration, and the SARM1 enzyme is activated within 1â2 hr after injury in cultured DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sasaki et al., 2020a</xref>). Axonal fragmentation occurs much later in this system, with axons fragmenting approximately 4â6 hr after injury. Numerous molecular and cellular events occur in the time between SARM1 activation and axon loss, including calcium influx, mitochondrial stalling and depolarization, loss of ATP, and disrupted membrane integrity. We reasoned that temporally ordering these events would give insights into causal relationships among these degenerative mechanisms. Unfortunately, studies in bulk culture are not appropriate for assessing the temporal sequence because axon loss is asynchronous, and so this effort requires live imaging. Prior live imaging studies have demonstrated that hours after injury there is a large influx of calcium that precedes axonal fragmentation, and blocking this late calcium entry with EGTA inhibits axon fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adalbert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loreto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yong et al., 2020</xref>). However, no comprehensive live imaging analysis of the cellular and molecular events underlying axon degeneration has been reported.</p><p>Here, we explore the cellular events that occur in injured axons following SARM1 activation. First, we investigate whether changes to mitochondria and calcium require SARM1 NADase activity, as prior studies used a complete knockout and so left open the possibility of NADase-independent functions. Indeed, such an NADase-independent function was recently described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for organelle stalling after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>). Next, we revisit the role of both intracellular and extracellular calcium in axon degeneration. We confirm that blocking extracellular calcium influx blocks axon fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Villegas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Witte et al., 2019</xref>); however, these apparently morphologically intact axons are not metabolically active, as mitochondria are immobile and depolarized. We then develop a live imaging approach in cultured DRG neurons with single axon resolution and assess dynamic changes to calcium, mitochondria, ATP, and the plasma membrane. Our findings describe an ordered series of events in which (1) ATP is lost, (2) mitochondria stop moving and subsequently depolarize, (3) extracellular calcium enters the axons, (4) phosphatidylserine is exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and (5) the membrane loses integrity. This work identifies a stereotyped cascade of dysfunction following SARM1 activation, and highlights ATP loss as the likely key intermediate between NAD<sup>+</sup> cleavage and widespread dysfunction in injured axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SARM1 NADase activity promotes mitochondrial stalling and calcium influx in injured axons</title><p>SARM1 is an injury-activated NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase, and this enzymatic activity is required for injury-induced axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is unclear whether all SARM1-dependent processes require this enzymatic function. Recently, Hsu et al. working in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrated that injury-dependent organelle stalling can be SARM1-dependent but NADase-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>). Previously, Loreto et al presented the even more surprising finding that injury-dependent mitochondrial stalling in superior cervical ganglion axons did not depend on SARM1, although loss of mitochondrial potential did depend on SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loreto et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we test the applicability of these findings to mammalian sensory neurons, assessing mitochondrial movement in cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and assaying the requirement for SARM1 NADase activity. This is of particular interest because SARM1 is a mitochondrial associated protein and so alternate mechanisms of action are plausible. We cultured DRG neurons from SARM1 knockout (KO) embryos and used lentivirus to express either GFP, SARM1, or catalytically inactive SARM1(E642A) together with MitoDsRed (MitoDR) in order to track mitochondria. After 7 days, axons were severed and mitochondrial movement was imaged 0, 2, and 4 hr after injury. In SARM1 KO neurons expressing GFP, mitochondrial movement was unchanged 4 hr after injury. In contrast, the number of motile mitochondria declines precipitously between 2 and 4 hr after injury in SARM1 KO axons re-expressing SARM1. Catalytically inactive SARM1(E642A) is expressed at similar levels to wild-type (WT) SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), but did not result in loss of mobile mitochondria after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Hence, the loss of mitochondrial mobility in injured axons is not only SARM1-dependent, but also SARM1 NADase-dependent. Injury-induced loss of mitochondrial potential is also SARM1-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>), and so here we investigated whether or not this effect also requires a functional SARM1 NADase. The mitochondrial potential is the driving force for ATP production and can be measured with the fluorescent dye TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester). As with mitochondrial dynamics, expression of WT SARM1, but not SARM1(E642A), leads to a dramatic loss of mitochondrial membrane potential after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The finding that SARM1 NADase activity is required for loss of mitochondrial membrane potential suggests that the SARM1-induced decline in cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup> levels either directly or indirectly influences bioenergetics inside the mitochondria.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SARM1 enzymatic activity regulates mitochondrial movement and calcium homeostasis in injured axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative kymograph of injured SARM1 KO axons expressing either GFP, SARM1, or SARM1.E642A (E642A).

Prior studies argued that calcium release through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrientos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Villegas et al., 2014</xref>) or extracellular calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Witte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yong et al., 2020</xref>) are key drivers of axon degeneration. To test whether the MPTP has a role in axon degeneration, we incubated embryonic DRGs neurons with the MPTP inhibitor (Cyclosporin A, CsA), axotomized, and assessed the progression of axon degeneration and the rise in intracellular calcium. In contrast to prior findings, we observed no delay in the timing of axon degeneration with CsA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also assayed the increase in intracellular calcium after injury and again found no significant effect of CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To further explore the role of intracellular calcium, we incubated DRG neurons with 10 ÂµM BAPTA to chelate intracellular calcium for 30 min prior to axotomy. This treatment had no influence on the progression of axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and was also unable to fully buffer the influx of extracellular calcium that occurs hours after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that internal calcium is not a major determinant of injury-induced axon degeneration in this system; however, it may play a role in scenarios where SARM1 is less potently activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While we found no clear role for intracellular calcium, there are numerous studies highlighting the importance of extracellular calcium for injury-induced axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ribas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). As such, we explored the impact of chelating extracellular calcium on the progression of axon degeneration. In agreement with prior studies, we find that pre-incubation with 3 mM EGTA potently blocked injury-induced calcium influx and maintained morphologically intact axons for up to 48 hr after axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To explore when the influx of extracellular calcium is required, we treated with EGTA at the time of axotomy and then performed washout after 2 hr, or added the EGTA 2 hr after axotomy. The presence of EGTA from 0 to 2 hr after axotomy had no impact on the timing of axon fragmentation, while addition of EGTA 2 hr post-axotomy was as protective as treatment at the time of axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Hence, late influx of extracellular calcium is critical for axon degeneration in DRG axons, a finding consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Witte et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While these results are consistent with prior work highlighting the importance of extracellular calcium for axon degeneration, we did observe that severed axons developed prominent axonal swellings following extracellular calcium chelation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, red arrowheads). Moreover, previous work showed that SARM1 is activated within two hours after injury and leads to NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and metabolic catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sasaki et al., 2020a</xref>), raising the question of whether blocking the later influx of calcium maintains axons in a healthy state. To investigate this question, we assessed mitochondrial membrane potential and mobility in injured axons treated with EGTA. We find that mitochondria potential is lost by four hours post-axotomy whether or not EGTA is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Similarly, EGTA treatment fails to maintain mitochondrial mobility after axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Indeed, treatment with EGTA halts mitochondrial movement and disrupts mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) after 4 hr even in the absence of injury, demonstrating that chelating extracellular calcium is not an effective method to maintain healthy axons, and instead disrupts normal axonal physiology. These findings are in contrast to loss of SARM1, which maintains both mitochondrial potential and mobility after axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that prior studies showing protection of axons by blocking the large calcium influx that occurs prior to degeneration were likely maintaining axonal structure but not axonal physiology, and suggest that the key role for calcium influx may be to trigger fragmentation of metabolically non-functional axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Live single axon imaging defines the temporal relationship between calcium influx and axonal fragmentation</title><p>To quantitatively assess the relationship between this late influx of calcium and axonal fragmentation, we developed a live imaging system with single axon resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This allows us to assess temporal relationships of the asynchronous axon degeneration process that is not possible in mass cultures. We used lentivirus to co-express GCaMP6 and mRuby3 in cultured DRG neurons to monitor calcium influx and axon morphology simultaneously. After 7 days in culture, when both proteins were strongly expressed, we performed axotomy by focusing laser light on a 1 Ã 1 Âµm region containing a single axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Images of the distal axon were repeatedly acquired until the injured axon degenerated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> show the progression of calcium influx and axon degeneration for a single axon, features that are representative of all the injured axons analyzed. Immediately after axotomy, a first peak of calcium bidirectionally propagates along the axon from the injury site (white triangle). This elevated intracellular calcium is rapidly cleared, demonstrating that calcium homeostasis functions normally at this time, and is consistent with prior work and the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> that the initial influx of calcium does not contribute to axon fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adalbert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loreto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vargas et al., 2015</xref>). After nearly 4 hours, there is a large second influx of calcium that precedes any obvious change in axonal morphology. Soon thereafter, the axon thins and small swellings appear, then the axon swellings enlarge, and finally the axon fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). From analysis of 22 single axons, we found that the time to the appearance of the second calcium peak varied dramatically, from less than four hours to nearly 10 hr after axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, once the second peak of calcium appeared, the axon fragmented soon thereafter. The correlation between the initiation of the second peak of calcium and axon degeneration was very strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), with degeneration occurring ~100 min after initiation of calcium influx. In contrast, neither the duration nor intensity of the second calcium peak was well correlated with the timing of axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). The very tight correlation between the initiation of the second influx of calcium and axonal fragmentation is consistent with the hypothesis that this calcium triggers the final disintegration of the axon.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Live single axon imaging enables temporal dissection of cellular events in injured axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of laser axotomy in cultured embryonic DRG neurons.

Calcium influx is a potent mechanism for stopping mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>), and so we predicted that calcium influx would occur before mitochondrial stalling. We used lentivirus to express MitoDR and GCaMP6 in DRG neurons and performed laser axotomy. We imaged mitochondrial movement with MitoDR every 5 s for 300 s followed by calcium measurements. Images from MitoDR and GCaMP6 were acquired until mitochondria stopped, at which point only GCaMP6 imaging continued until its level increased more than twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and in contrast to expectations, mitochondrial movement stops before the influx of calcium. Analysis of this single axon shows that fewer mitochondria are moving 3 hr after axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and that all mitochondrial are stalled by 4.4 hr after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, inset). At this point, the GCaMP6 signal is unchanged from baseline, but begins to rise soon thereafter. Quantitative analysis of single injured axons demonstrates that loss of mitochondrial mobility precedes calcium influx in each case, and this occurs ~25 min after mitochondria stop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

Calcium overload can induce loss of mitochondrial potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramov et al., 2007</xref>)âif this occurs in injured axons, then we expect calcium influx to precede mitochondrial depolarization. We expressed GCaMP6 in DRG neurons, incubated the neurons with TMRM to assess mitochondrial potential, and imaged single axons in both channels every ten minutes until axons degenerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This imaging frequency was chosen to avoid photobleaching. The images and analysis from a single axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) demonstrate that the fluorescent intensity of TMRM is fairly stable at baseline, then has an initial drastic drop (dark red dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) followed by a steady decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, red dots). In contrast, calcium has an abrupt rise (dark green dot), quickly reaching a higher steady-state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, green dots). In the example shown, the abrupt drop in mitochondrial potential occurs one frame prior to the large increase in calcium. To assess this across axons, we identified the time at which the TMRM and GCaMP6 signal showed the largest frame-to-frame variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We found that the drastic drop of TMRM intensity occurs one frame prior to the large increase in calcium in five out of seven axons (71.43%), while these changes occurred during the same frame in two out of seven axons. The images are taken ten minutes apart, and so these data indicate that in injured axons mitochondria begin depolarizing prior to the calcium influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Moreover, these data, in conjunction with the analysis of mitochondrial mobility and calcium influx above, demonstrate a sequence of events in which first mitochondria stop, then begin losing their potential, and after that calcium enters the axon which subsequently degenerates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ATP loss precedes mitochondrial stalling</title><p>Calcium influx cannot explain the loss of mitochondrial mobility, so we considered other potential mechanisms. Once the SARM1 NADase is activated, ATP is lost soon thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>) because NAD<sup>+</sup> is required for ATP synthesis via both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. The loss of ATP in injured distal axons is fully SARM1 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Mitochondria are transported by ATP-dependent molecular motors, and so we hypothesized that loss of ATP may cause loss of mitochondrial mobility. To assess this hypothesis, we explored the relationship between ATP loss and mitochondrial stalling. We used lentivirus to express PercevalHR, a sensor of relative ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>), and MitoDR in DRG neurons and performed laser axotomy. For the validation of PercevalHR in axons, we applied CCCP (Carbonyl Cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) to DRG neurons expressing PercevalHR. Using HPLC to measure axonal metabolites, we previously demonstrated that a 2 hr treatment with 50 Î¼M CCCP lowers ATP by ~60 % in DRG axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Summers et al., 2014</xref>). The same CCCP treatment leads to an ~70 % drop in the fluorescence level of PercevalHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that PercevalHR gives a reasonable estimate of changing ATP levels in axons. Upon injury, we found that ATP loss and loss of mitochondrial mobility temporally overlap, and so it was not possible to define a window after which one process was complete and the other had yet to start, as we did with calcium and mitochondrial dynamics above. Instead, we quantitatively assessed the relationship between the degree of ATP loss as defined by loss of the PercevalHR signal and the fraction of mitochondria that stop moving in injured axons. Based on ATP measurements from bulk injured axons, we knew that most ATP loss occurred between 3 and 4 hr after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we imaged baseline mitochondrial mobility and relative ATP levels before injury, and then re-imaged the PercevalHR every 5 min for 3.5 hr after single axon injury. We then calculated the percent change in PercevalHR intensity from baseline. Immediately after the final imaging of PercevalHR at 3.5 hr, we imaged mitochondrial mobility by acquiring images every 5 s for 300 s and calculated the percent drop in the fraction of motile mitochondria compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). In every axon, the percent drop in the ATP sensor was larger than the percent drop in the fraction of mobile mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> left), and there was a strong correlation between the extent of ATP loss and mitochondrial stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> right; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61, n = 9). We continued to measure mitochondrial mobility from 3.5 hr after injury until mitochondrial movement ended. We found a strong inverse correlation between the extent of ATP loss at 3.5 hr and the remaining time until the complete loss of mitochondrial mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76, n = 9). In other words, the extent of ATP loss by 3.5 hr after injury is a strong predictor of when mitochondrial will ultimately stop moving in an injured axon. All these results are consistent with the model that ATP loss causes loss of mitochondrial mobility. We did not repeat these results in SARM1 KO axons because we have already demonstrated that both ATP loss and loss of mitochondrial mobility are fully SARM1 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ATP levels drop before mitochondria stop in injured axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Experimental design for imaging changes to ATP (PercevalHR) and mitochondrial movement (MitoDR) after axonal injury.

In healthy membranes, phosphatidylserine is preferentially found in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. In cells undergoing apoptosis and in degenerating axons, phosphatidylserine is exposed on the outer leaflet where it serves as an âeat-meâ signal to phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sapar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Segawa and Nagata, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shacham-Silverberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wakatsuki and Araki, 2017</xref>).

To assess membrane integrity, we applied fluorescently labeled macromolecules (3 kDa dextran) to neurons expressing cytosolic GFP. In uninjured neurons, cytosolic GFP fills the axon while the dextran is excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). After injury, axon swelling is apparent, and mitochondrial localize to these swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The swellings retain GFP and still exclude dextran. Later, discrete puncta of dextran appear in axonal fragments, and such fragments contain no visible GFP. We interpret this as axon swellings that burst, releasing soluble GFP and allowing entry to the high-molecular-weight dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Next, we compared dextran uptake in injured axons from wild type and SARM1 KO neurons, as well as wild-type neurons treated with EGTA. By 4 hr after axotomy of wild-type neurons, dextran is present throughout the axons, indicative of a loss of membrane integrity. In axotomized SARM1 KO neurons, dextran is excluded from axons for at least 48 hr. Interestingly, when wild-type neurons are incubated with EGTA, injured axons still swell (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), but dextran is excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>).

The data describe an ordered series of events beginning with loss of ATP, and followed by mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium influx, exposure of phosphatidylserine and loss of membrane permeability ultimately resulting in catastrophic axon fragmentation.</p><p>In this study, we used live imaging of single axons to monitor structural and physiological changes during axon degeneration. While the absolute timing of cellular events varied dramatically from axon to axon, the relative timing was quite consistent. Hence, this method allowed us to order cellular events, which is not possible when averaging responses from many axons that are responding asynchronously. Our findings in conjunction with prior studies lead to a simple model of axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Following activation of SARM1, NAD<sup>+</sup> is cleaved and its levels drop rapidly. Upon robust NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation will be impaired, and so ATP production will decline. This loss of ATP will impact molecular motors, leading to the observed halting of mitochondria. Soon after mitochondria halt, they lose their membrane potential. Since this occurs before calcium increases, this cannot be due to calcium overload. Instead, the loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP likely disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis. We next observed influx of extracellular calcium. The loss of ATP is a likely culprit, as ionic pumps require ATP and their loss will lead to disrupted calcium extrusion, membrane depolarization, and calcium influx. Many prior studies have attempted to define the source of calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">George et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stys, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Villegas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), and have provided evidence for many candidates including voltage-gated ion channels, ion pumps, and ion exchangers in both intracellular organelles and the plasma membrane. We speculate that many candidates participate because the loss of ATP disrupts many aspects of calcium homeostasis. Here, we have only focused on the large influx of calcium that occurs soon before degeneration. Our study does not speak to the potential role of smaller fluctuations in calcium that may occur earlier in the process. After this large influx of calcium, the subsequent exposure of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the membrane is likely due to the failure of lipid flippases to maintain asymmetry. Since these flippases are ATP-dependent and can be inhibited by calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bitbol et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soupene, 2008</xref>), loss of ATP and calcium influx may both contribute to the externalization of phosphatidylserine. The ultimate loss of membrane integrity, however, requires influx of extracellular calcium, as EGTA blocks fragmentation of injured axons. Such axons have extensive swellings and completely dysfunctional mitochondria. While calcium influx has long been assumed to the be the essential final step in axon loss, our findings suggest instead that calcium influx is merely leading to the morphological destruction of axons that are already physiologically dead. Instead, our findings highlight ATP loss as the likely point of no return for an injured axon, disrupting mitochondrial, calcium, and membrane homeostasis and thereby triggering axonal demise.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of axon degeneration.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71148-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Mitochondria accumulate in axonal swellings in injured axons.</title><p>(Top) Representative images of injured (<bold>a</bold>) and uninjured (<bold>b</bold>) axons labeled with GFP and MitoDR.

The injury site should be carefully chosen around the middle between the soma and axon terminal. If the injury site is close to soma, cell body death was often observed. If the injury site is too close to the distal axon then the immediate retraction of the injured axon results in too little residual axon for imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mitochondria movement / kymograph analysis</title><p>For consecutive real-time imaging capture of mitochondria, images of MitoDR were recorded at 5 s intervals for a total of 60 frames by 558 (ex) / 583 (em)-nm laser at the designated time before and after laser axotomy.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor.

A central point of argument in this paper concerns the relative changes in calcium influx and how these changes, when they occur, influence the sequence of events leading to mitochondria stalling, lipid exposure and axon catastrophe. The authors appropriately acknowledge that there have been a few studies assessing this issue in vivo and in vitro. But, given this, any apparent differences with the published literature should be resolved, likely with a higher level of imaging that approaches the timescale on which cell biological signaling occurs. This likely means addressing the calcium signals that occur on cell biologically relevant time scales of milliseconds to minutes. In this paper, calcium imaging is based on static images taken at intervals of minutes to hours in most cases. This seems the case for Fluo-4 in Figure one, and also for GCamp6 data. The authors argue that their data differs from published information about the timing and importance of calcium influx. But, it is more than likely that they are missing the most important calcium signaling events. The authors have not attempted to imaging signaling dynamics of calcium on fast time scales. And, when using GCamp6, it is likely that they are missing even potential slow changes in basal calcium in all but the most extreme cases. The authors are referred to : Lock et al., 2015 in which it is demonstrated that GCamp6 cannot resolve shifts in baseline calcium or calcium transients seen with other, faster, calcium indicators. The importance of this topic is emphasized by a central conclusion made by the authors on lines 283 and 284, &quot;Calcium influx cannot explain the loss of mitochondrial mobility, so we considered other potential mechanisms&quot;. The authors may argue that degeneration occurs over a time frame of hours and this precludes fast calcium imaging. However, I see no reason that they authors could not resort to intermittent high-speed sampling of calcium signaling. This might require intermittent sampling over different time windows in different cells to cover the entire 4hr time between axon cut and degeneration.</p><p>2. The authors have focused on metabolic activity of axons by measuring mitochondria voltage and ATP levels. Given that the authors are working in cell culture, shouldn't they take advantage of this system to directly image membrane voltage and assess the integrity of the axonal membrane voltage? This would be a direct assessment of axonal health and an advance beyond what has already by pursued in other systems. It is understood that this would be a novel excursion for the authors, but this would add a new dimension not previously documented and could help define the source of changes in axonal calcium.</p><p>3. How do the authors define mitochondrial mobility? They show the total number of mitochondria that are moving in a given area, but do not specify if they are moving anterogradely or retrogradely, nor the fraction of mitochondria that are moving versus stationary. Mitochondrial movement varies widely between axon type, culture condition, and even time in culture. This speaks to whether comparing other events like mitochondrial membrane depolarization or ATP drop to mitochondrial mobility changes is a valid measure.</p><p>4. The authors use the PercevalHR genetically encoded reporter to compare the percentage drop in ATP with the percentage drop of motile mitochondria (see comment #3 above), but do not calibrate this sensor. In their previous work (Summers et al. 2020, Mol. Neurobiol.) they show that inhibition of glycolysis or oxphos can both cause a ~70% reduction in total ATP levels in these neurons in the absence of overt degeneration. That these axons have an ATP 'buffer' speaks to the need to define the relative range of ATP changes that Perceval is sensitive to in axons using pharmacological methods.</p><p>5. Left uncited are two highly relevant studies showing calcium influx prior to membrane rupture in injured axons (Yong..Deppmann, Sci.Rep 2020), and terminal exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of injured axons (Shacham-Silverbergâ¦Yaron, Cell Death Disease, 2018). Indeed, the Results section should also provide more detail regarding published work from Vargas, Villegas, and Witte, currently cited. By doing a more precise job, the authors can precisely state the nature of their advance and make this clear to the reader.</p><p>6. Figure 2: To directly assess the effects of BAPTA/EGTA on axonal calcium levels it would be helpful to conduct the Fluo-4 experiments with BAPTA and EGTA treatments to show how efficient they are in suppressing calcium rise. More discussion of the different results from EGTA and BAPTA treatments would also be helpful. If EGTA blocks axon degeneration by reducing calcium influx (and therefore intracellular calcium), why does BAPTA has no effect at all, given it chelates elevated intracellular calcium too.</p><p>7. It would also help to include a Sarm1 KO dataset in for the ATP/mito analysis in Figure 5. Also, more information should be provided about how this sensor was imaged and analyzed--was the ration of fluoresence measured?</p><p>8. The authors should define &quot;n&quot; in all figure legends â as written it is unclear whether n represents individual axons, separate cultures, etc.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper addresses the sequence of cellular events that occurs downstream of axon severing and prior to axonal destruction. The authors emphasize the power of their in vitro assay system in which they can optically injure single axons and follow the consequences over time. The authors image ATP use, calcium levels, mitochondria mobility, mitochondria health (voltage) and membrane lipid content. Based on their imaging data, they propose a sequence of cell biological events leading to axonal destruction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Loss of Sarm1 strongly protects injured axons from metabolic collapse and morphological fragmentation. The finding that Sarm1 is an injury-induced NADase has led to a working model in the field that Sarm1 drives down NAD levels, resulting in ATP loss followed by axon fragmentation. Ko, Milbrandt, and DiAntonio seek to define and order the cellular events between Sarm1 activation and axon fragmentation and to determine which require the NADase function of Sarm1. This latter point becomes more important in light of recent work by Marc Freeman's group showing an NADase-independent role for Sarm1 in 'bystander' un-injured neurons.</p><p>The premise of this work is that many of the terminal events in Wallerian degeneration have been identified in other studies (drop in ATP, pausing of mitochondrial movement, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, calcium influx, and phosphatidylserine exposure), but that their relative order has not been established in a single experimental system. The authors rightly point out that a clear ordering of the events in Wallerian degeneration is critical, and the live imaging approach that they develop is well-suited to answer the questions they pose.</p><p>The most pressing issue is whether the findings in this study are sufficiently novel as a stand-alone study. As the authors point out, the majority of their findings have been published in other studies, and in some cases have been ordered with respect to each other. As an example, injury-induced calcium influx has been shown to immediately precede axon fragmentation, which is itself caused by calcium-dependent calpains (Vargasâ¦Sagasti, 2015; Yangâ¦Tessier-Lavigne, 2013; both studies are cited in this manuscript).<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study investigates cellular events downstream of axotomy and SARM1 activation that leads to degeneration with single axon resolution. The authors find that SARM1 NADase activity leads to an ordered sequence of events beginning with loss of ATP, followed by mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium influx, externalization of phosphatidylserine and ending with loss of membrane integrity. Importantly, the findings highlight ATP loss as the point of no return for axotomized axons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71148.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

This might require intermittent sampling over different time windows in different cells to cover the entire 4hr time between axon cut and degeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We take issue with the premise of the concern. We do report any contradictions with prior studies; we report the same basic findings as prior studies such as a late wave of calcium influx precedes axon degeneration. However, we extended these findings in ways never done before, using single axon live imaging to define the temporal relationships among this wave of calcium influx, axon degeneration, and other cell biological events that occur in the injured axon. In addition, we confirm that blocking this late wave of calcium influx inhibits morphological breakdown of axons, but for the first time assess the health of such axons and show that this treatment triggers mitochondrial depolarization and blocks mitochondrial movement. These are new findings, not disagreements with prior work. As such, we donât see the problem that this suggestion is trying to solve.</p><p>Imaging calcium at high temporal resolution in injured axons might finding something new, but that is not the question we are addressing with this paper. For decades it has been known that there is a large and late calcium spike prior to axon degeneration. Here we provide the first quantitative analysis of the relationship between this spike in calcium and a series of cell biological changes occurring in an injured axon. This is the question we set out to address. While potentially interesting, imaging at time frames that are not obviously relevant to the process of axon degeneration is, in our opinion, a large effort that does not test a specific hypothesis.</p><p>Even if such a study would provide useful information, the suggestion of doing high speed calcium imaging is not practical in this system. The reviewers suggested high-speed calcium imaging âduring the 4 hr between axon cut and degeneration.â However, as shown in figure 3, the time between axon cut and degeneration is highly variable between axons, and can occur from 3 to 9 hours after cut. The axons are less than 1 micron in width and repeated high-speed imaging, even if intermittent, will result in dramatic photobleaching over this protracted time frame.</p><p>The reviewers pointed out one sentence in our paper that they found overstated our findings, e.g. &quot;Calcium influx cannot explain the loss of mitochondrial mobility, so we considered other potential mechanisms&quot;. We are happy to clarify this sentence to make clear that we are referring to the large and late influx of calcium that occurs prior to axon degeneration, which certainly cannot explain the loss of mitochondrial mobility since it occurs after mitochondria stop moving (a novel finding reported here for the first time). We will revise that sentence and make clear throughout the text the we are characterizing this previously studied late wave of calcium, and not drawing conclusions about calcium fluctuations that may or may not occur during axon degeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We think that is likely due to these axons being so thin. As the reviewers point out, this would be a novel technique to develop and while it might provide additional information, we would note that it is not necessary to support any of our current conclusions and hence is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How do the authors define mitochondrial mobility? They show the total number of mitochondria that are moving in a given area, but do not specify if they are moving anterogradely or retrogradely, nor the fraction of mitochondria that are moving versus stationary. Mitochondrial movement varies widely between axon type, culture condition, and even time in culture. This speaks to whether comparing other events like mitochondrial membrane depolarization or ATP drop to mitochondrial mobility changes is a valid measure.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to describe our methods more carefully so that it is clear how we defined mitochondrial mobility. While we agree that mobility can vary; we addressed this in figure 4B and 4C by assessing mitochondrial mobility across the entire scope of the experiment in every axon. There is some modest variability (note variability in baseline from 0-3 hrs in fig 4B), but we focused on the dramatic change when mitochondria have completely stopped moving. Even demanding such an all or none response, we still found, and quantified, that this occurred prior to the large influx of calcium that is characteristic of axon degeneration (Fig 4C). In figure 5 the change in mobility vs ATP changes was not all or none, which we freely acknowledge and quantify all of the data that lead to our measured conclusions. We did not quantify anterograde vs retrograde separately. Our observations suggested that both changed very similarly, but since we were focused on the all-or-none response of mitochondria stopping, we did not see the value in quantifying those two separately. Finally, the reviewer was concerned that we did not quantify the fraction of mitochondria moving vs stationery, but we did report the % moving. In the revised text we will make clear that 100% - % moving = % stationery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

That these axons have an ATP 'buffer' speaks to the need to define the relative range of ATP changes that Perceval is sensitive to in axons using pharmacological methods.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we used CCCP to lower ATP and measured the effect on Perceval. In our prior studies we showed that after 2 hours 50 Î¼M CCCP lowers ATP by ~60% in DRG neurons (Summers, 2014, Figure 1). We have now made the same manipulation and quantified Perceval intensity. Following 2 hours of 50 Î¼M CCCP Perceval intensity drops ~70% in axons. This is now included as Figure 5-figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We find that EGTA efficiently blocks the rise in calcium after axotomy, while BAPTA partially reduces this rise. This is consistent with the large rise in calcium being due to influx of extracellular calcium, and supports the model that it is this extracellular calcium that promotes fragmentation of the axon. As requested we have added more discussion of these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
