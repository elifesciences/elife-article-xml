Treatment of <italic>Mab</italic> infections is difficult because the bacterium is intrinsically resistant to many classes of antibiotics. Developing new and effective treatments against <italic>Mab</italic> requires a better understanding of the unique vulnerabilities that can be targeted for future drug development. To achieve this, we identified essential genes in <italic>Mab</italic> by conducting transposon sequencing (TnSeq) on the reference <italic>Mab</italic> strain ATCC 19977. We generated ~51,000 unique transposon mutants and used this high-density library to identify 362 essential genes for in vitro growth. To investigate species-specific vulnerabilities in <italic>Mab</italic>, we further characterized <italic>MAB_3167c</italic>, a predicted penicillin-binding protein and hypothetical lipoprotein (PBP-lipo) that is essential in <italic>Mab</italic> and non-essential in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>). We found that PBP-lipo primarily localizes to the subpolar region and later to the septum as cells prepare to divide. Depletion of <italic>Mab</italic> PBP-lipo causes cells to elongate, develop ectopic branches, and form multiple septa. Knockdown of PBP-lipo along with PbpB, DacB1, and a carboxypeptidase, MAB_0519 lead to synergistic growth arrest. In contrast, these genetic interactions were absent in the <italic>Mtb</italic> model organism, <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, indicating that the PBP-lipo homologs in the two species exist in distinct genetic networks. Finally, repressing PBP-lipo sensitized the reference strain and 11 <italic>Mab</italic> clinical isolates to several classes of antibiotics, including the β-lactams, ampicillin, and amoxicillin by greater than 128-fold. Altogether, this study presents PBP-lipo as a key enzyme to study <italic>Mab</italic>-specific processes in cell wall synthesis and importantly positions PBP-lipo as an attractive drug target to treat <italic>Mab</italic> infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic></kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>cell wall</kwd><kwd>transposon sequencing (TnSeq)</kwd><kwd>PBP</kwd><kwd>antibiotic sensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/NIAID F31AI149932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akusobi</surname><given-names>Chidiebere</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI156772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benghomari</surname><given-names>Bouchra S</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Junhao</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>Ian D</given-names></name><name><surname>Singhvi</surname><given-names>Shreya</given-names></name><name><surname>Dulberger</surname><given-names>Charles L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ioerger</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akusobi</surname><given-names>Chidiebere</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PBP-lipo is an essential cell-wall synthesis enzyme in <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> that localizes to the septum and whose expression is required for normal cell growth and division, as well as mediating sensitivity to several antibiotics including the β-lactams, ampicillin, and amoxicillin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> (<italic>Mab</italic>) is the most common cause of human disease among the rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). It causes a wide range of illnesses including lung, skin, and soft-tissue infections, as well as disseminated disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Primm et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansen et al., 2020</xref>). While the incidence of <italic>Mab</italic> infections is rising worldwide, treating <italic>Mab</italic> infections remains difficult. The bacterium has intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to many classes of antibiotics, including the standard drugs used to treat tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nessar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pang et al., 2015</xref>). The current treatment regimen for <italic>Mab</italic> requires taking a combination of multiple antibiotics for up to 18 months and is often associated with severe toxicity and routinely ends in treatment failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jarand et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need for new and effective drugs to treat the emerging global public health threat of <italic>Mab</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Developing novel antibiotic treatments for <italic>Mab</italic> requires a better understanding of essential biological processes in the bacterium that can be targeted. Identifying essential genes is the first step in this process, and by combining transposon mutagenesis with massive parallel sequencing, transposon sequencing (TnSeq) has been an effective tool in determining gene essentiality on a genome-wide scale in other microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Opijnen and Camilli, 2013</xref>). However, while many TnSeq screens have been conducted in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeJesus et al., 2017</xref>), up until recently, only two <italic>Mab</italic> TnSeq screens have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foreman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laencina et al., 2018</xref>). While both <italic>Mab</italic> TnSeq screens provided tools and important insights into <italic>Mab</italic> biology, neither utilized a mutant library with high enough density to comprehensively identify essential genes. This changed with the recent publication from Rifat et al., who generated robust high-density transposon libraries of <italic>Mab</italic> and identified a comprehensive list of genetic elements essential for in vitro growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rifat et al., 2021</xref>). Identification of these essential genes serves as an excellent starting point to classify attractive targets for drug discovery.</p><p>One major target of antibiotics is the mycobacterial cell wall whose biogenesis is essential for bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 2017</xref>). The structure of the mycobacterial cell wall is unique among bacteria because it is composed of three macromolecules: peptidoglycan (PG), arabinogalactan, and mycolic acids. Together, these layers envelop mycobacteria with a thick, waxy coat that forms a permeability barrier to many drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarlier and Nikaido, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nasiri et al., 2017</xref>). The foundational layer is comprised of PG, which consists of glycan sugars cross-linked by short peptides forming a continuous, net-like structure that maintains cell shape and prevents rupture. Mycobacteria build new PG at the cell poles aided by Class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that perform two reactions: a transglycosylation reaction that polymerizes PG monomers to existing glycan strands and a transpeptidation reaction that cross-links glycan strands to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</xref>). Class B PBPs solely perform the cross-linking reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slayden and Belisle, 2009</xref>). A hallmark of PBPs is that they are inhibited by β-lactam antibiotics; however, these antibiotics are typically not used to treat <italic>Mab</italic> infections due to high levels of resistance and the presence of β-lactamases in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soroka et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To identify essential genes for in vitro growth and classify potential new drug targets in <italic>Mab</italic>, we performed TnSeq. We generated high-density transposon libraries of ~51,000 mutants in the reference strain, <italic>M. abscessus</italic> subsp. <italic>abscessus</italic> ATCC 19977 and identified 362 genes required for in vitro growth. We next identified essential genes in <italic>Mab</italic> that were non-essential in <italic>Mtb</italic> in order to study species-specific vulnerabilities in <italic>Mab</italic>. From this list of genes, we further characterized <italic>MAB_3167c</italic>, which encodes a PBP and hypothetical lipoprotein, PBP-lipo, a conserved Class B PBP. We found that PBP-lipo is required for normal PG synthesis and cell division. Knockdown of PBP-lipo sensitizes <italic>Mab</italic> to commonly used β-lactams and other classes of antibiotics. None of these phenotypes were present in the <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm</italic>) and <italic>Mtb</italic> PBP-lipo knockouts. Thus, we find that PBP-lipo has a unique essential function in <italic>Mab</italic> and is a potential drug target for treating <italic>Mab</italic> infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>Mab</italic> ATCC 19977 essential genes for in vitro growth</title><p>To identify essential genes in <italic>Mab</italic>, we performed TnSeq on <italic>M. abscessus</italic> subsp. <italic>abscessus</italic> ATCC 19977 (hereafter referred to as <italic>Mab</italic>) using the ϕMycoMar T7 phage carrying the Himar1 transposon for transduction.

Therefore, to test whether PBP-lipo is an active PBP in <italic>Mab</italic>, we determined whether PBP-lipo binds bocillin FL, a fluorescent analog of penicillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). Using a strain that constitutively expresses a strep-tagged PBP-lipo, we identified a fluorescent bocillin FL band at the same molecular weight as PBP-lipo, which was confirmed to be PBP-lipo by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These data suggest that PBP-lipo binds bocillin FL in vivo and is an active PBP. Interestingly, in wildtype <italic>Mab,</italic> we did not detect an obvious PBP-lipo band at the predicted molecular weight of PBP-lipo, 63 kDa, suggesting that native expression levels of PBP-lipo is either low or PBP-lipo is expressed at distinct periods during the cell cycle.</p><p>We also tested whether PBP-lipo was indeed a lipoprotein. Based on its amino acid sequence, PBP-lipo has an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the protein for localization to the periplasm. This is followed by a conserved cysteine residue at position 23, which is the canonical site of lipid modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rezwan et al., 2007</xref>). To determine if PBP-lipo is lipidated, we performed a bacterial lipoprotein extraction protocol in <italic>Mab</italic> as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster and Meredith, 2018</xref>. Briefly, cells were lysed and lipoproteins were enriched by TX-114 detergent and later precipitated with acetone. The resulting lipo-protein and non-lipo-protein fractions were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel for further analysis. By Western blot, we detected the presence of PBP-lipo in both the lipoprotein fraction and the non-lipoprotein fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). PBP-lipo being present in the non-lipoprotein fraction is not surprising as this pattern has been observed in early lipoprotein extraction experiments performed in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Young and Garbe, 1991</xref>). Given these results, we describe PBP-lipo as a hypothetical lipoprotein, but further experiments are needed to confirm if the protein is indeed lipidated.</p><p>In mycobacteria, the PG layer is critical for maintaining normal cell shape and altering PBP expression often results in abnormal cell morphology. Thus, we studied the morphology of <italic>Mab</italic> when PBP-lipo was repressed and discovered dramatic morphological changes. <italic>Mab</italic> cells elongate, branch inappropriately, and form ectopic poles of active growth, as evidenced by staining with NADA (3-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-alanine), a fluorescent-D-amino acid (FDAA) that binds areas of active PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuru et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). PBP-lipo knockdown significantly increased the number of cells with ectopic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, during normal growth of <italic>Mab</italic>, a small percentage of cells contain one mid-cell FDAA band, indicating active PG synthesis at the site of septation. However, when PBP-lipo is knocked down, we occasionally find cells with 2 or 3 bands mid-cell, as exemplified in the 2 sgRNA+ panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). PBP-lipo knockdown strains were all significantly longer than their uninduced controls, with the longest average cell length belonging to the strain with the strongest PBP-lipo knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Of note, while the 0 sgRNA+/- cells are morphologically indistinguishable, there is a statistically significant difference in the mean cell lengths, likely due to the effect of ATc on cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, cell width did not change among the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Thus, we hypothesized that PBP-lipo localizes to the septum. To test this hypothesis, we N-terminally tagged PBP-lipo with mRFP, which has been previously shown to function in the mycobacterial periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranowski et al., 2018</xref>). We cloned mRFP after the predicted N-terminal signal sequence of PBP-lipo with linkers on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next validated that this construct produced a full-length fusion protein using Western blot, and detected the correctly sized 91 kDa fusion product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, we tested the functionality of the mRFP-PBP-lipo fusion protein by using recoded and non-recoded versions of the construct. The recoded version had a single sgRNA-binding site on PBP-lipo mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, knockdown of native PBP-lipo lead to growth inhibition while expression of the non-recoded fusion protein partially complemented growth. Reassuringly, the recoded mRFP-PBP-lipo fully complemented the growth defect from the native PBP-lipo knockdown indicating that the fusion protein is indeed functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Given the morphological defects in the PBP-lipo knockdown, we hypothesized that PBP-lipo localized to the septum. To test this, we imaged PBP-lipo simultaneously with FtsZ, which forms the Z-ring at the divisome. FtsZ is the first protein to localize to the septum and recruits other members of the divisome complex to aid in the formation of the septum and eventual division of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Errington, 2009</xref>). To visualize FtsZ, we C-terminally tagged it with mNeonGreen (mNG) and expressed the fusion protein using a weak promoter as higher levels of expression are toxic. After introducing both constructs into wildtype <italic>Mab</italic>, we visualized the fusion proteins, which were expressed in the presence of wildtype PBP-lipo. Using fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that both FtsZ and PBP-lipo localized to the mid-cell, likely in the growing septum.

We first analyzed cells that expressed solely mRFP-PBP-lipo and demonstrated that mid-cell localization of PBP-lipo was only present in the longest cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data demonstrate that as cells elongate, PBP-lipo localizes to the septum and is therefore likely involved in septum formation and cell division. We next applied this analysis to cells that co-expressed mRFP-PBP-lipo and FtsZ-mNeonGreen. We found that FtsZ localizes to the septum earlier in the cell life cycle as demonstrated by the higher septal fluorescence signal intensity in shorter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, PBP-lipo localizes to the septum when cells are longer and after FtsZ has already localized to the septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We hypothesized that this could be due to dysregulated formation of the FtsZ rings responsible for initiating division. To test this hypothesis, we visualized FtsZ in the context of native PBP-lipo knockdown. We used an N-terminal GFP-FtsZ fusion protein expressed off the FtsZ natural promoter to best capture the natural dynamics of expression. Upon PBP-lipo knockdown, we identified cells that formed multiple FtsZ puncta in contrast to the single puncta found in normally growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These multiple FtsZ puncta were distributed across the length of the cell indicating that repression of PBP-lipo disrupts FtsZ localization.

In short, while PBP-lipo is required in the <italic>Mab</italic> PBP network<italic>,</italic> its function is likely redundant in the networks of <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic>. This notion of functionally distinct PBP networks has been previously described in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kieser et al., 2015a</xref>). To interrogate the PBP network of <italic>Mab</italic>, we tested which PBPs genetically interacted with PBP-lipo. To perform this experiment, we cloned CRISPRi constructs with sgRNAs that would weakly knock down each PBP in <italic>Mab</italic> (PBPx), so that growth was not significantly impaired. We also cloned combinatorial CRISPRi constructs where PBP-lipo and another PBP were weakly repressed. Using this dual sgRNA vector, we could simultaneously knock down PBP-lipo and a PBP of interest.</p><p>Using combinatorial knockdowns of each PBP, we compared growth inhibition when a single PBP was knocked down versus when PBP-lipo and a second PBP were jointly repressed. Of the eight combinations we tested, we found that knockdown of three PBPs with PBP-lipo lead to synergistic growth arrest. These genes were <italic>pbpB, dacB1,</italic> and <italic>MAB_0519,</italic> which encodes a protein with a hypothesized carboxypeptidase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This genetic synergy was also observed in liquid culture for <italic>pbpB</italic> and <italic>dacB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The homolog of PbpB is a well-studied enzyme in both <italic>Msm, Mtb,</italic> and the model organisms <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> where it is known as FtsI. In all these organisms, PbpB localizes to the septum and is largely responsible for septal PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slayden and Belisle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wissel and Weiss, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of PbpB rescued the growth defect caused by knockdown of PBP-lipo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Similarly, exogenous expression of PbpB fully reversed the morphological defects of PBP-lipo repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These data indicate that PBP-lipo and PbpB have overlapping functions at the septum in <italic>Mab</italic>. However, because both enzymes are individually essential, PbpB and PBP-lipo must have distinct functions as well.</p><p>To test the importance of the genetic interaction of DacB1 with PBP-lipo, we created a DacB1-GFP fusion, which we validated as being fully intact by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Interestingly, like PbpB and PBP-lipo, DacB1 localizes to the septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). We also observed co-localization of DacB1 and PBP-lipo at the septal region of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Using the MOMIA and GEMATRIA programs, we quantified the fluorescent signal from DacB1 and PBP-lipo at the septum and binned the cells by cell length. These analyses demonstrate that both DacB1 and PBP-lipo localize to the septum as cells elongate, with DacB1 arriving slightly before PBP-lipo to the septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4D</xref>). These data suggest that PBP-lipo genetically interacts with PbpB and DacB1, and that all three enzymes localize to the same region of the cell and could potentially coordinate septal PG synthesis in a complex together.</p><p>The difference in essentiality of PBP-lipo in different species could be due to altered genetic interactions. To test this in <italic>Msm,</italic> we used CRISPRi to knock down <italic>Msm</italic> PBP homologues in the wildtype <italic>Msm</italic> and the PBP-lipo knockout background. In this experiment, genes that interacted with PBP-lipo would show impaired cell growth when repressed in the PBP-lipo knockout. Interestingly, we did not observe genetic interactions between any of the PBPs tested and PBP-lipo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, the level of knockdown for genes that showed synergy in <italic>Mab</italic> was comparable to the level of knockdown in the <italic>Msm</italic> PBP-lipo knockout, as measured by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We also did not detect synergy in additional PBPs present in the <italic>Msm</italic> genome with no known homologs in <italic>Mab</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref>).</p><p>These results might suggest that <italic>Msm</italic> PBP-lipo might have different interacting partners. To test this, we generated high-density transposon mutant libraries in both the wildtype and PBP-lipo knockout strains of <italic>Msm</italic> to identify genes that were conditionally essential in the knockout background. The saturation of the two wildtype libraries were 51.9% and 53.4%, while the saturation of the PBP-lipo knockout library was 62.4%. Using the resampling method in TRANSIT, our TnSeq data revealed that there were no conditionally essential genes in the ΔPBP-lipo <italic>Msm</italic> background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These data strongly suggest that PBP-lipo in <italic>Msm</italic> exists in a robust genetic network with multiple functional redundancies. To uncover PBP-lipo’s function in <italic>Msm</italic>, it is possible that double and triple knockout mutants of PG synthesis enzymes would need to be generated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Repressing PBP-lipo sensitizes <italic>Mab</italic> to a wide range of antibiotics</title><p>Given PBP-lipo’s essentiality in <italic>Mab</italic> and the genetic interactions it has with other PBPs, we hypothesized that repressing PBP-lipo would affect <italic>Mab</italic>’s sensitivity to antibiotics, including β-lactams. To test this hypothesis, we measured the sensitivity of PBP-lipo knockdown cells to 21 antibiotics that target translation, transcription, and DNA replication in both <italic>Mab</italic> and <italic>Msm</italic>.</p><p>Wildtype <italic>Mab</italic> is typically resistant to β-lactams amoxicillin and ampicillin with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) greater than &gt;256 µg/ml. When PBP-lipo is knocked down, the MIC for both antibiotics dropped to 2 µg/ml, indicating a greater than 128-fold sensitization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results indicate a strong chemical-genetic interaction between PBP-lipo and both ampicillin and amoxicillin. Interestingly, not all β-lactams had shifts in their MIC when PBP-lipo was knocked down. This suggests that there is a specific chemical-genetic interaction between PBP-lipo or its partner PBPs and ampicillin and amoxicillin. MIC changes for other β-lactams were less drastic, with a 4- to 8-fold reduction observed for faropenem and cefoxitin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). PBP-lipo knockdown also affects susceptibility to antibiotics that do not target the cell wall. The macrolides, clarithromycin and erythromycin, were 128-fold and 64-fold more potent respectively in the PBP-lipo knockdown cells. A 16-fold reduction in MIC was also observed for RNA polymerase inhibitor, rifampicin.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Minimum inhibitory

and clarithromycin are notable because these antibiotics do not target the cell wall. Thus, the mechanism of synergy between PBP-lipo repression and these antibiotics likely differs from the synergy with ampicillin and amoxicillin. We hypothesized that PBP-lipo repression might increase the permeability of the cell wall, allowing more drug to enter the cell. To test this hypothesis, we measured the accumulation of calcein into <italic>Mab</italic>, which is one proxy for cell permeability. Calcein accumulated more rapidly in PBP-lipo knockdown cells, indicating that PBP-lipo increased the permeability of <italic>Mab</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). This increased permeability might lead to increased antibiotic access to the cell, thus sensitizing the bacteria to the antibiotics.</p><p>When the MICs of the same 21 antibiotics tested in <italic>Mab</italic> were measured in the PBP-lipo knockout in <italic>Msm,</italic> we observed no difference in the MICs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

These data suggest that PBP-lipo’s unique function in <italic>Mab’s</italic> PG synthesis network likely contributes to the species’ sensitivity to antibiotics when the enzyme is repressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Repression of PBP-lipo sensitizes <italic>Mab</italic> clinical isolates to antibiotics</title><p>The antibiotic experiments were conducted on the lab-adapted ATCC 19977 reference strain on <italic>Mab</italic>, after being isolated from a knee abscess in the 1950s and propagated in the lab since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tortoli et al., 2016</xref>).

<italic>Mab</italic> requires a better understanding of the bacterium’s essential processes. This includes identifying essential <italic>Mab</italic> genes for further characterization as potential drug targets. To do this, we generated high-density transposon libraries to identify essential genes in the reference strain, <italic>M. abscessus</italic> subsp. <italic>abscessus</italic> ATCC 19977. Importantly, <italic>Mab</italic> transposon libraries with fewer than 10,000 unique mutants have been previously published, but these studies did not identify the full list of essential genes in <italic>Mab</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foreman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laencina et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, Rifat et al. successfully generated high-density libraries and were the first group to identify essential genes and genomic elements in the <italic>Mab</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rifat et al., 2021</xref>). All together, they identified 326 essential genes and compared this list to essential genes identified in <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic>. Similar to our study, Rifat et al. highlighted uniquely essential genes in <italic>Mab,</italic> which they also state deserve further study as these genes could represent <italic>Mab</italic>-specific drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rifat et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition to identifying essential genes in <italic>Mab</italic>, our study builds upon Rifat et al.’s work by using CRISPRi to repress gene expression and validate predicted essential genes as required for in vitro growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rock et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we found that by targeting genes with multiple sgRNAs, CRISPRi can achieve significant gene repression, allowing for the investigation of essential genes and providing an alternative to gene knockouts. Constructing gene knockouts in <italic>Mab</italic> can be inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Medjahed and Reyrat, 2009</xref>); thus, CRISPRi provides a convenient tool for genetic manipulation in <italic>Mab</italic>. Overall, the newly generated <italic>Mab</italic> transposon libraries can be used to determine genes required for growth in a variety of conditions including infection models, biofilms, and antibiotic stress.</p><p>Both Rifat et al.’s and our TnSeq data identified PBP-lipo as the sole PBP that is essential in <italic>Mab</italic> and non-essential in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rifat et al., 2021</xref>). Using CRISPRi, we demonstrated the necessity of PBP-lipo expression for <italic>Mab</italic> to maintain normal morphology and to divide properly. When PBP-lipo is repressed, cells elongate, branch, and form ectopic poles. We localized PBP-lipo to the subpolar regions of the cell, and as cells elongate and prepare for division, PBP-lipo localizes to the septum. Furthermore, depleting PBP-lipo led to the creation of multiple Z-rings in the cell and likely the aberrant start of cell division and formation of branched cells. Overall, the constellation of PBP-lipo knockdown phenotypes mimics septal-factor depletions observed in <italic>Msm,</italic> which also cause cells to elongate, branch, and form ectopic poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggest that PBP-lipo is involved with PG synthesis at the septum and that depletion of the enzyme leads to dysregulated septal PG synthesis and cell division.</p><p>Given PBP-lipo’s localization and effect on cell division, we propose that PBP-lipo acts as an essential septal PG synthesis enzyme in <italic>Mab</italic>. In <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Msm,</italic> this is accomplished by the enzyme <italic>pbpB</italic>, which is essential for growth. Additionally, when <italic>pbpB</italic> is repressed in these species, cells appear morphologically similar to the PBP-lipo knockdown in <italic>Mab</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slayden and Belisle, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, PBP-lipo knockouts in both <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic> are morphologically identical to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data underscore that biological insights from <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic> should not be de facto applied to <italic>Mab</italic>. We hypothesize that PBP-lipo is a member of the <italic>Mab</italic> divisome complex, a collection of structural proteins and enzymes that coordinates cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</xref>). This hypothesis was supported by the co-localization of PBP-lipo with FtsZ, a key initiating component of the bacterial divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Errington, 2009</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine if PBP-lipo interacts with known septal factors, such as FtsQ and FtsW, whose functions in the divisome have been described in <italic>Msm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rajagopalan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2002</xref>). Future work may also reveal novel PBP-lipo-binding factors that coordinate PG synthesis and cell division in <italic>Mab</italic> specifically.</p><p>Phenotypes characteristic of the PBP-lipo knockdown in <italic>Mab</italic> were absent in the <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Msm</italic> PBP-lipo knockouts. Both <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>Msm</italic> do not have a duplicate copy of PBP-lipo in their genomes. Thus, to explain the differential essentiality of PBP-lipo across these mycobacterial species, one hypothesis we explored was differences in the genetic networks of PG synthesis enzymes. Construction of the PG layer is a complex process that involves a collection of enzymes that work in concert to ensure proper synthesis and remodeling. Previous work has shown that PG synthesis enzymes belong to genetic and spatiotemporal networks that do not necessarily replicate across closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kieser et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botella et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, while the synthetic enzymes to construct the PG layer may be homologous between species, how the enzymes are networked and subsequently function together may differ. We demonstrated that PBP-lipo genetically interacts with <italic>pbpB, dacB1,</italic> and <italic>MAB_0519</italic>. In contrast, TnSeq on the <italic>Msm</italic> Δ<italic>pbp-lipo</italic> strain did not reveal interactions with any other gene in the genome. This demonstrates that despite being homologs, PBP-lipo in <italic>Mab</italic> and <italic>Msm</italic> are incorporated into different PG synthesis networks. In <italic>Mab,</italic> this network renders PBP-lipo’s function as essential for growth and proper cell division, whereas in <italic>Msm,</italic> PBP-lipo is dispensable. Interestingly, in <italic>Mtb</italic> PBP-lipo is required for normal growth in a <italic>ponA2</italic> knockout suggesting that PBP-lipo and PonA2 genetically interact <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kieser et al., 2015a</xref>) <italic>–</italic> a genetic interaction that was not observed in <italic>Mab</italic>. This observation supports the hypothesis that PBP-lipo is incorporated in different PG synthesis in <italic>Mtb</italic> as well.</p><p>While this work demonstrates the essential function of PBP-lipo for growth and division in <italic>Mab</italic> and not in <italic>Msm</italic> or <italic>Mtb,</italic> all the experiments were performed in standard growth conditions. Studies in other bacteria have demonstrated that homologous PBPs that are otherwise non-essential become required under specific growth conditions. For example, in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the Class B homolog of PBP3, PBP3-SAL, was required for cell division in acidified intraphagosomal environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castanheira et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, PBP6, which encodes a carboxypeptidase, was more active at lower pH values compared to five other homologous carboxypeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). These studies demonstrate that some PBPs become more active and their functions more required in specific growth conditions. Future studies could test PBP-lipo’s function under various stress conditions. These experiments may elucidate a condition-specific role for PBP-lipo in <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic> that differs from its central function in <italic>Mab</italic>.</p><p>Not only is PBP-lipo essential in <italic>Mab,</italic> it also genetically interacts with three other PBPs, <italic>pbpB, dacB1,</italic> and <italic>MAB_0519,</italic> which are all hypothesized to be septal associated. PbpB is a D,D-transpeptidase that performs 4,3 cross-linking reactions at the septum. In <italic>Msm</italic>, depleting PbpB leads to cell filamentation and branching reminiscent of the <italic>Mab</italic> PBP-lipo knockdown phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). A potential explanation of this genetic interaction is both PbpB and PBP-lipo perform 4,3-cross-linking at the <italic>Mab</italic> septum. In this model, repressing both enzymes would dramatically reduce 4,3-cross-linking at the septum and lead to cell death. We explored this model by overexpressing PbpB while strongly repressing PBP-lipo. We discovered overexpressing PbpB completely reversed the growth and morphological defect of PBP-lipo knockdown. This data provided evidence that PBP-lipo and PbpB have overlapping 4,3 cross-linking function at the septum, and that by supplying the cell with more D,D-transpeptidation activity via PbpB, the deleterious effects of PBP-lipo repression were reversed. Interestingly, given that both PBP-lipo and PbpB are essential in <italic>Mab</italic>, the enzymes must have overlapping, but distinct functional roles. Their distinct functions could be revealed by identifying unique genetic or physical interactions each enzyme has with other PG synthesis enzymes. Investigating the unique yet overlapping functions of PbpB and PBP-lipo at the <italic>Mab</italic> septum is an intriguing area of future research.</p><p>The two other genes that synergized with PBP-lipo, DacB1 and MAB_0519, are both hypothesized carboxypeptidases that cleave the terminal D-ala-D-ala on the pentapeptide chains of PG monomers forming a tetrapeptide. This substrate is necessary for 3,3 cross-links catalyzed by L-D transpeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ealand et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, DacB1 localizes to the septum in <italic>Mab</italic> and has been described as septally localized in <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorla et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Mab,</italic> DacB1 also co-localizes with PBP-lipo at the septum. Furthermore, the homolog of MAB_0519 in <italic>Mtb</italic>, Rv3627c, is involved in septal PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that DacB1 and MAB_0519 are involved in septal PG synthesis and may work with PBP-lipo to ensure proper PG synthesis and remodeling at the septum. Interestingly, DacB1 and MAB_0519 are not functionally redundant, given that both genes are synergistic with PBP-lipo. Further characterization of the PG enzymes in <italic>Mab</italic> and their genetic networks will uncover species-specific nuances in <italic>Mab</italic> PG synthesis that have the potential to be exploited for drug discovery.</p><p>Knockdown of PBP-lipo dramatically sensitized the reference <italic>Mab</italic> strain and 11 clinical isolates to several antibiotics. The PBP-lipo knockdown was &gt;128-fold more sensitive to the β-lactams, ampicillin and amoxicillin, while other β-lactams such as like cephalexin, ticarcillin, and others showed no difference in MIC. This result indicates a specific chemical-genetic interaction between ampicillin/amoxicillin, and PBP-lipo. Historically, β-lactams have not been used to treat <italic>Mab</italic> infections due to high levels of resistance and the presence of β-lactamases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soroka et al., 2014</xref>). While imipenem and cefoxitin are used with some success, macrolides and aminoglycosides remain the backbone of <italic>Mab</italic> treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Novosad et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, studies have shown dual β-lactam strategies are effective in killing <italic>Mab</italic> both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Story-Roller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pandey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lopeman et al., 2020</xref>). These synergy data suggest that understanding the specific antibiotic targets of β-lactams in <italic>Mab</italic> would augment the design of effective dual β-lactam combinations. At the moment, effective combinations are usually tested empirically with no insight into potential mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pandey et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, a potential mechanism for dual-β-lactam synergy in <italic>Mab</italic> was uncovered by Dousa et al. The group discovered that the novel β-lactamase inhibitor, durlobactam, also inhibited a <italic>Mab</italic> carboxypeptidase and by doing so, greatly enhanced <italic>Mab</italic> sensitivity to amoxicillin and imipenem combination therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dousa et al., 2022</xref>). Another attempt to identify specific targets of PBP targets of β-lactams was conducted by Sayed et al. This group used a combination of a bocillin FL-binding assay to stain all the PBPs in <italic>Mab</italic> followed by proteomics to identify the targets of 12 β-lactams and 2 β-lactamases. Interestingly, in their datasets, PBP-lipo was not identified by mass spectrometry of bocillin FL-bounded PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sayed et al., 2020</xref>). This further supports our hypothesis that PBP-lipo is expressed at low levels in <italic>Mab</italic> and is not identifiable by bocillin FL staining under native expression conditions.</p><p>Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that using a β-lactam or small molecules that target PBP-lipo would not only kill the cell, but also potentiate β-lactams like ampicillin and amoxicillin. In addition, the permeabilizing effect of PBP-lipo inhibition would potentiate drugs by allowing more compound to enter the cell. Crucially, the observed synergy with PBP-lipo knockdown and β-lactams was not only limited to the reference strain, but also present in 11 clinical isolates of <italic>Mab,</italic> indicating that this synergy can be broadly targeted in <italic>Mab</italic> clinical isolates.</p><p>Overall, this work employed TnSeq to identify the uniquely essential gene PBP-lipo in <italic>Mab</italic>. We present PBP-lipo as a promising drug target given both its essentiality in <italic>Mab</italic> cell growth and division and its role in sensitizing <italic>Mab</italic> to a range of antibiotics, including commonly used and accessible antibiotics, ampicillin and amoxicillin. Future studies exploring the PBP networks of mycobacteria can expose further species-specific vulnerabilities in PG synthesis. Finally, identifying chemical inhibitors of PBP-lipo may help form the foundation for new treatments against this emerging and difficult to treat pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A full list of the strains, plasmids, and primers is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7 supp8 supp9">Supplementary files 7–9</xref> respectively.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>All <italic>Mab</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic> strains were grown shaking at 37°C in liquid 7H9 media consisting of Middlebrook 7H9 salts with 0.2% glycerol, 0.85 g/l NaCl, OADC (oleic acid, 5 g/l albumin, 2 g/l dextrose, 0.003 g/l catalase), and 0.05% Tween80. <italic>Mab</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic> were plated on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with 0.5% glycerol. <italic>Msm</italic> was grown shaking at 37°C in liquid on 7H9 media consisting of Middlebrook 7H9 salts with 0.2% glycerol, 0.85 g/l NaCl, ADC, and 0.05% Tween80 and plated on LB agar.

To build the 1, 2, and 3 sgRNA strains, first we built individual CRISPRi plasmids containing single sgRNAs that targeted PBP-lipo. These plasmids were cr25, cr26, and cr56. We then designed primers that amplified the sgRNA targeting region with the appropriate flanking sequences and performed Golden Gate cloning to combine the inserts into one vector.

Afterward, 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> pfu of temperature-sensitive φMycoMarT7 phage carrying the Himar1 transposon were added to bacteria. Phage and bacterial cultures were incubated at 37°C for 4 hr with shaking. The transduced cultures were spun down at RT 4000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 12 ml of PBS-Tween. The cultures were then tittered by plating on 7H10 plates (<italic>Mab</italic>) or LB (<italic>Msm</italic>) supplemented with kanamycin 100 µg/µml (<italic>Mab</italic>) or 20 µg/µl (<italic>Msm</italic>) before freezing the aliquots for future plating. After determining the titer, 150,000 bacterial mutants of each transduced culture were plated onto kanamycin selective plates and grown for 4 days at 37°C. The resulting mutant libraries were harvested and stored in aliquots with 7H9+10% glycerol at –80°C.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Genomic DNA extraction</title><p>To prep libraries for sequencing, we isolated the gDNA of the mutant libraries using a bead-beating protocol developed in the lab. Two to six ml of transposon mutant libraries were thawed and spun down to remove excess glycerol in the sample. Pellets were then resuspended in TE Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA pH 8) and placed in bead-beating tubes with 600 µl of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. The samples were then bead-beat 4× for 45 s at 4000 rpm. Samples were cooled on ice for 45 s between each successive bead-beat round. After bead-beating, the samples were spun down for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to a new falcon tube and incubated with 1:1 volume phenol:chloroform for 1 hr rocking. Samples were then spun down in MaXtract High Density phase-lock tubes (Qiagen) at 1500 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. This separated the aqueous and organic layers. Afterward, ½ volume of chloroform was added to the tube and the contents were spun down at 1500 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and RNAse A (Thermo Fisher) was added to a final concentration of 25 µg/µl. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr with shaking.

Total RNA was extracted using the RNA miniprep (Zymo Research). Residual genomic DNA was digested with TURBO DNase (Ambion), and samples were cleaned with RNA clean-up columns (Zymo Research). cDNA was prepared using random hexamers following manual instructions (Life Technologies Superscript IV). Alkaline hydrolysis was then used to remove RNA. cDNA was purified by spin column (Qiagen) and then quantified by RT-qPCR on a Viia7 light cycler (Applied Biosystems) using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad). All qPCR primer pairs were confirmed to be &gt;95% efficient. The masses of cDNA used were experimentally validated to be within the linear dynamic range of the assay.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. There is no evidence that PBP-lipo is a lipoprotein although the authors presented this as a certainty (lines 143-144). Several PBPs have a cysteine residue within or near the end of the N-terminal TM region, but these are not lipoproteins. For example, <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP3 has a cysteine at position 30 shortly after the TM region, but it does not appear to be a lipoprotein. The authors should either prove that PBP-lipo is a lipoprotein, which has been achieved for lipoproteins in other species by mass spectrometry and/or labelling with radioactive palmitate. If such evidence cannot be provided, they should rename the enzyme, removing 'lipo' from the name, and refrain from presenting the protein as a lipoprotein.</p><p>2. There appears to be a problem with the mRFP-PBP-lipo construct in which mRFP is tagged at the N-terminus of PBP-lipo (line 210). If PBP-lipo is indeed a lipoprotein, as assumed by the authors and perhaps confirmed in the above-mentioned point, then this N-terminal tagging may not be the best approach. Lipoproteins are typically cleaved at the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, which would remove the mRFP tag from the protein and make the cellular localization experiments meaningless. Considering these concerns, the authors should:</p><p>a. Prove that the construct is functional and can complement cells depleted of WT PBP-lipo, and</p><p>b. Subject cell extracts with Bocillin labelling and confirm the presence of an mRFP-PBP-lipo band or</p><p>c. Detect mRFP-PBP-lipo in cell extracts with an antibody against mRFP.</p><p>(A is essential and either b or c would be acceptable)</p><p>Also, in line 211 they should state whether mRFP-PBP-lipo was expressed in the presence (or not) of WT PBP-lipo.</p><p>3. Reviewers appreciated the experiments to investigate the PG networks in Mab and other mycobacteria which revealed, for example, the genetic interactions between the PBP-lipo gene and the dacB1, pbpB and MAB_0519 genes. However, to support the appending conclusions, the authors need to confirm that DacB1 and PBPB were depleted by the CRISPR technology to similar extent in Mab and Msm, to exclude the possibility that differences in genetic interactions were due to different efficiency in the CRISPR gene depletion in the two species. This is particularly important for Msm, as there were no genetic interactions (lines 270-2760). Hence, they should perform Bocillin assays and quantify the depletion of DacB1 and PBPB in both species.</p><p>4. Control experiments to show that the DacB1-GFPmut3 fusion is functional should be added.</p><p>5. To strengthen their model, the authors should co-localize PBPlipo with another divisome component.</p><p>6. The authors should Colocalise mRFP-PBP-lipo (if functional) with DacB1-GFP (if functional).</p><p>7. It is known that several bacteria have homologous PBPs that cannot fully replace each other and have specific roles under different growth conditions. The authors don't present or discuss such examples in their Discussion. The discussion should be expanded beyond mycobacteria to include examples from other species, such as:</p><p>– <italic>Salmonella</italic> has a dedicated class B PBP3 homologue (called PBP3-SAL) next to its 'normal' PBP3 required for cell division. PBP3-SAL is specifically required for cell division in acidified phagosomes (mBio. 2017 Dec 19;8(6):e01685-17. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01685-17).</p><p>– <italic>E. coli</italic> uses a specialised DD-CPase PBP6B to maintain cell morphology when growing under acidic conditions (mBio. 2016 Jun 21;7(3):e00819-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00819-16.).</p><p>Such examples can use used to discuss whether PBP-lipo and its homologue might not be essential under certain growth conditions at which the homologue is highly active.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript was a pleasure to read and easy to evaluate. It is interesting and exceptionally well done.</p><p>Two questions that occurred to me are: (1) is the localisation of PBP-lipo affected in the presence of AMX or AMP, and( 2) is it possible to find a β-lactam that would sensitize WT Mab to AMX or AMP to the same degree as the PBP-lipo knock-down Mab strains.</p><p>The title refers to PBP-lipo as a lipoprotein, but no such evidence that it is indeed a lipoprotein has been provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to ask the authors to address the following points:</p><p>1. There is no evidence that PBP-lipo is a lipoprotein although they presented this as a certainty (lines 143-144). To my knowledge, several PBPs have a cysteine residue within or near the end of the N-terminal TM region, but these are not lipoproteins.

It is known that several bacteria have homologous PBPs that cannot fully replace each other and have specific roles under different growth conditions. Unfortunately, the authors don't present or discuss such examples in their Discussion. I suggest that they expand their discussion beyond mycobacteria to include examples from other species, for example:</p><p>– <italic>Salmonella</italic> has a dedicated class B PBP3 homologue (called PBP3-SAL) next to its 'normal' PBP3 required for cell division.

In my view they cannot exclude such a possibility, as they did not assay growth phenotypes at different growth conditions.</p><p>3. I see a main problem with the mRFP-PBP-lipo construct in which mRFP is tagged to the N-terminus of PBP-lipo (line 210). If PBP-lipo is indeed a lipoprotein, as assumed by the authors and perhaps confirmed in additional experiments (my point 1 above), then this N-terminal tagging cannot work. Lipoproteins are typically cleaved at the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, which would remove the mRFP tag from the protein and make the cellular localization experiments meaningless. Because of these doubts regarding the mRFP-PBP-lipo construct they should:</p><p>– prove that the construct is functional and can complement cells depleted of WT PBP-lipo,</p><p>– subject cell extracts with Bocillin labelling and confirm the presence of an mRFP-PBP-lipo band and</p><p>– detect mRFP-PBP-lipo in cell extracts with an antibody against mRFP.</p><p>Also, in line 211 they should state whether mRFP-PBP-lipo was expressed in the presence (or not) of WT PBP-lipo.</p><p>4. I appreciate the experiments to investigate the PG networks in Mab and other mycobacteria which revealed, for example, the genetic interactions between the PBP-lipo gene and the dacB1, pbpB and MAB_0519 genes. However, in my view they should confirm that DacB1 and PBPB were depleted by the CRISPR technology to similar extent in Mab and Msm, to exclude the possibility that differences in genetic interactions were due to different efficiency in the CRISPR gene depletion in the two species. This is particularly important for Msm, as there were no genetic interactions (lines 270-2760). Hence, they should perform Bocillin assays and quantify the depletion of DacB1 and PBPB in both species.</p><p>5. Figure 10B. They should add control experiments to show that the DacB1-GFPmut3 fusion is functional (Bocillin labelling of extracts; Western Blot with anti-Gfp).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The experiments largely support the conclusion derived. However, I feel the following experiments/clarifications will further strengthen some of the conclusions in the manuscript:</p><p>(i) Colocalization of PBP-lipo with at least one of the divisome components may strengthen the argument that PBP-lipo localizes to the division septa.</p><p>(ii) Similarly the idea that PBP-lipo interacts with PbpB and/or DacB1 can be further strengthened by at least colocalising mRFP-PBP-lipo with DacB1-GFP.</p><p>(iii) Is the localization of PBP-lipo affected in PbpB or DacB1 or MAB_0519 depleted cells? Are the localization of these proteins interdependent?</p><p>(iv) Does depletion of pbpB or dacB1 or MAB_0519 make Mab cells susceptible to antibiotics as during PBP-lipo knockdown?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;High-density transposon mutagenesis in <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> identifies an essential penicillin-binding lipo-protein (PBP-lipo) involved in septal peptidoglycan synthesis and antibiotic sensitivity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Bavesh Kana (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one major concern that needs to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>Reviewers remain concerns about the experiments supporting the annotation of PBP-Lipo as a lipoprotein:</p><p>1. Please provide sufficient detail on the lipoprotein extraction procedure. The information is not available in Ref 26, which also appears to focus on Vibrio, rather than Mycobacteria.</p><p>2. Results of the attempts to verify that PBP-lipo has a lipid modification are shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3B. However, this figure shows that the majority of PBP-lipo (&gt;90%?) seems to segregate into the non-LP fraction. Quantification is not possible because the non-LP lane is overloaded but the results suggest the absence of a lipoprotein modification. The Methods section lacks sufficient information about this experiment (how were the LP and non-LP fractions obtained?), and there is no positive or negative control of a verified lipoprotein or non-lipoprotein. As a result, reviewers indicate that this experiment does not address the issue of the Lipo modification. You should either rename the enzyme, removing &quot;lipo&quot; from the name, or state very clearly in the manuscript that the lipo modification is hypothetical.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>L. 273: insert &quot;genetic&quot; in front of &quot;PG network&quot; in the heading.</p><p>L. 309: format problem.</p><p>Figure 6 —figure supplement 5A. the y-axis should read &quot;log (or ln?) fold change mRNA expression&quot; instead of &quot;fold change mRNA expression&quot;.</p><p>L507: PbpB is 4-3 crosslinking enzyme. It does not necessarily follow that PBP-lipo must have the same activity. The ectopic complementation could be due to other crosslinks that also stabilize PG. Please reconsider this statement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71947.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

If PBP-lipo is indeed a lipoprotein, as assumed by the authors and perhaps confirmed in the above-mentioned point, then this N-terminal tagging may not be the best approach. Lipoproteins are typically cleaved at the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, which would remove the mRFP tag from the protein and make the cellular localization experiments meaningless. Considering these concerns, the authors should:</p><p>a. Prove that the construct is functional and can complement cells depleted of WT PBP-lipo, and</p><p>b. Subject cell extracts with Bocillin labelling and confirm the presence of an mRFP-PBP-lipo band or</p><p>c. Detect mRFP-PBP-lipo in cell extracts with an antibody against mRFP.</p><p>(A is essential and either b or c would be acceptable)</p><p>Also, in line 211 they should state whether mRFP-PBP-lipo was expressed in the presence (or not) of WT PBP-lipo.</p></disp-quote><p>Created Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 to address these revisions.</p><p>– S Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A shows a schematic of the mRFP-PBP-lipo fusion protein. mRFP was inserted after the Cysteine residue and attached to linkers on the 5’ and 3’ region.

Both constructs were strep-tagged.

The recoded construct fully complements the phenotype while the non-recoded version partially complements</p><p>Added text to explain that the mRFP-PBP-lipo fusions are expressed in the context of native PBP-lipo expression that is either unrepressed or repressed with ATc. Also we explicitly mentioned in lines 227-228 that the fusion protein is expressed in the presence of the native PBP-lipo protein</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Reviewers appreciated the experiments to investigate the PG networks in Mab and other mycobacteria which revealed, for example, the genetic interactions between the PBP-lipo gene and the dacB1, pbpB and MAB_0519 genes. However, to support the appending conclusions, the authors need to confirm that DacB1 and PBPB were depleted by the CRISPR technology to similar extent in Mab and Msm, to exclude the possibility that differences in genetic interactions were due to different efficiency in the CRISPR gene depletion in the two species. This is particularly important for Msm, as there were no genetic interactions (lines 270-2760). Hence, they should perform Bocillin assays and quantify the depletion of DacB1 and PBPB in both species.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed qPCR to measure level of repression of <italic>pbpB</italic>, <italic>dacB1,</italic> and <italic>MAB_0519</italic> in both the Mab double knockdown and <italic>Msm</italic> PBP-lipo knockout strains (Figure 6 —figure supplement 5A). The level of knockdown in both species for all three genes were comparable and not statistically significantly different from each other. Since the CRISPR system we use acts at the level of transcriptional repression, this provides better quantitation than protein methods such as Bocillin labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Control experiments to show that the DacB1-GFPmut3 fusion is functional should be added</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a Western Blot on the DacB1-GFPmut3-strep protein and detected the presence of a band ~70kDa, which is the predicted size of the fusion protein (Figure 6 —figure supplement 4A).

To strengthen their model, the authors should co-localize PBPlipo with another divisome component</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a co-localization experiment with mRFP-PBP-lipo and FtsZ-mNeonGreen (mNG). Figure 5A shows co-localization of PBP-lipo and FtsZ in representative cells. In total, we analyzed a total of 100+ cells for each strain.

It is known that several bacteria have homologous PBPs that cannot fully replace each other and have specific roles under different growth conditions. The authors don't present or discuss such examples in their Discussion. The discussion should be expanded beyond mycobacteria to include examples from other species, such as:</p><p>– Salmonella has a dedicated class B PBP3 homologue (called PBP3-SAL) next to its 'normal' PBP3 required for cell division. PBP3-SAL is specifically required for cell division in acidified phagosomes (mBio. 2017 Dec 19;8(6):e01685-17. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01685-17).</p><p>– <italic>E. coli</italic> uses a specialised DD-CPase PBP6B to maintain cell morphology when growing under acidic conditions (mBio. 2016 Jun 21;7(3):e00819-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00819-16.).</p><p>Such examples can use used todiscuss whether PBP-lipo and its homologue might not be essential under certain growth conditions at which the homologue is highly active.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

Results of the attempts to verify that PBP-lipo has a lipid modification are shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3B. However, this figure shows that the majority of PBP-lipo (&gt;90%?) seems to segregate into the non-LP fraction. Quantification is not possible because the non-LP lane is overloaded but the results suggest the absence of a lipoprotein modification. The Methods section lacks sufficient information about this experiment (how were the LP and non-LP fractions obtained?), and there is no positive or negative control of a verified lipoprotein or non-lipoprotein. As a result, reviewers indicate that this experiment does not address the issue of the Lipo modification. You should either rename the enzyme, removing &quot;lipo&quot; from the name, or state very clearly in the manuscript that the lipo modification is hypothetical.</p></disp-quote><p>– Added ‘lipoprotein extraction’ section in the Methods section that details how the lipoprotein and non-lipoprotein fractions were obtained.</p><p>– Included a reference by Young and Garbe (Ref 30) where lipoproteins extracted from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> were present both in the lipoprotein and non-lipoprotein fractions</p><p>– Given the valid critiques of the experiment, we have stated clearly in the manuscript, both in the abstract and during the first mentions of <italic>MAB_3167c</italic> in the introduction and Results sections, that the gene encodes a ‘penicillin binding protein and hypothetical lipoprotein’ (PBP-lipo).
