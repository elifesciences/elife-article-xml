based on visual or analytical detection of asymmetry in funnel plots. We studied the influence of different normalisation approaches, sample size and intervention effects on funnel plot asymmetry, using empirical datasets and illustrative simulations. We found that funnel plots of the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) plotted against the standard error (SE) are susceptible to distortion, leading to overestimation of the existence and extent of publication bias. Distortion was more severe when the primary studies had a small sample size and when an intervention effect was present. We show that using the Normalised Mean Difference measure as effect size (when possible), or plotting the SMD against a sample size-based precision estimate, are more reliable alternatives. We conclude that funnel plots using the SMD in combination with the SE are unsuitable for publication bias assessments and can lead to false-positive results.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>data simulation</kwd><kwd>funnel plot</kwd><kwd>publication bias</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Toxicology Program research funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wever</surname><given-names>Kimberley E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Cardiovascular Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CVON-HUSTCARE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chamuleau</surname><given-names>Steven AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Infrastructure Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sena</surname><given-names>Emily S</given-names></name><name><surname>MacLeod</surname><given-names>Malcolm R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alexander Suerman Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD student Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zwetsloot</surname><given-names>Peter-Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Funnel plots of the Standardized Mean Difference versus the standard error are prone to distortion, leading to false-positive tests for funnel plot asymmetry, and therefore using the Normalised Mean Difference, or a sample size-based precision estimate, are more reliable alternatives.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systematic reviews are literature reviews intended to answer a particular research question by identifying, appraising and synthesizing all research evidence relevant to that question. They may include a meta-analysis, a statistical approach in which outcome data from individual studies are combined, which can be used to estimate the direction and magnitude of any underlying intervention effect, and to explore sources of between-study heterogeneity. Simultaneously, meta-analysis can be used to assess the risk of publication bias: the phenomenon that published research is more likely to have positive or statistically significant results than unpublished experimentsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dwan et al., 2013</xref>). Meta-analyses are routinely used in clinical research to guide clinical practice and healthcare policy, reduce research waste and increase patient safetyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chalmers et al., 2014</xref>). The use of meta-analysis continues to increaseÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bastian et al., 2010</xref>) and it has become more common to apply these approaches to the synthesis of preclinical evidenceÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Korevaar et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, preclinical studies are, generally, individually small, with large numbers of studies included in meta-analysis, and large observed effects of interventions. This contrasts with clinical research, where meta-analyses usually involve a smaller number of individually larger experiments with smaller intervention effects.</p><p>This calls for methodological research to ascertain whether approaches to data analysis routinely used in the clinical domain are appropriate in the pre-clinical domain and for resources that guide and inform researchers, reviewers and readers on best practice. In this light, we present findings which show that the use of the standardized mean difference (SMD) measure of effect size in funnel plots can introduce a risk of incorrect assessment of publication bias, particularly in meta-analyses of preclinical data characterised by a large number of individually small studies with large observed effects.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Formulation of raw mean difference, standardized mean difference and normalized mean difference</title><p>To combine data statistically on <italic>e.g.</italic> the effects of an intervention which has been tested in several studies, outcome measures firstÂ need to be expressed on a common scale.

However, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic> tends to overestimate the âtrueâ SMD and its variance when the sample sizes in the primary studies are small (e.g.Â &lt;10). This bias can be corrected using the approach of Hedges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hedges, 1981</xref>), which adjusts both the SMD estimate and its variance by a correction factor based on the total sample size. The resulting estimate is the unbiased SMD known as Hedgesâ <italic>g</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for full equations).

In the absence of bias and heterogeneity, funnel plots should be funnel-shaped and symmetrically centred around the summary effect estimate of the analysis, since 1) imprecise (smaller) studies will deviate further from the summary effect compared to precise (larger) studies and 2) studies are equally likely to overestimate or underestimate the true effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Assessment of the possible presence of publication bias frequently relies on a visual or analytical evaluation of funnel plot asymmetry. If studies showing small, neutral or controversial effects are more likely to remain unpublished, publication bias may occur. As a result, the funnel plot will become asymmetrical, and the summary effect estimate will shift accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, there are other causes of asymmetry in funnel plots. For instance, the true effect size in smaller (and therefore less precise) studies may be genuinely different from that in large studies (for instance because the intensity of the intervention was higher in small studies). For this reason, funnel plot asymmetry is often referred to as a method to detect small study effects, rather than being a definitive test for publication bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rothstein et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, artefacts and chance may cause asymmetry (as shown <italic>e.g.</italic> in this study).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24260.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical funnel plots in the absence (<bold>A</bold>) and presence (<bold>B</bold>) of bias.</title><p>The precision estimate used is the standard error (SE).

However, the dependency of the SE<sub>SMD</sub> on the observed SMD will impact the appearance of the funnel plot. When we review the equation for the SE<sub>SMD</sub>,Â (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>) theÂ first component on the right of the â=' sign reflects the variance of the difference between the two group means, rescaled into pooled standard deviation units. Consequently, in this first part only <italic>n<sub>ctrl</sub></italic> and <italic>n<sub>int</sub></italic> play a role. The second component includes the squared SMD, and reflects the variation in the within-groups standard deviation as measured by SD<sub>pooled</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>).</p><p>If there is no intervention effect, the SMD (and the second component) will be zero, and the SE will therefore depend solely on the sample size (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). If an intervention effect is present, the SE will increase, as the size of SMD<sup>2</sup> in the equation will increase. This is no problem if the observed SMD is similar to the true SMD. However, a study with an observed SMD larger than the true SMD will have a larger SE. On the other hand, a study with an observed SMD smaller than the true SMD (butÂ &gt;0) will have a relatively small SE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This will cause funnel plot distortion: studies with a relatively small effect size (and associated SE) will skew towards the upper left region of the plot, while studies with a relatively large effect size and SE will skew towards the bottom right region of the plot, as the associated SE of these studies will be relatively large. Because the SMD is squared in the equation for the SE, this holds true for both positive and negative SMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The smaller the first component of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>, the larger the influence of the SMD on the size of the SE, worsening the distortion when sample sizes are small. Of note, this component is smallest when group sizes are unequal. The effect of the second component on the SE, and the resulting distortion, is largest if the sample size is small and the SMD is large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24260.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Step-wise illustration of distortion in SMD versus SE funnel plots.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Depicted are simulated studies with a sample size of respectively 10 (large black circles), 25 (blue squares), 50 (red triangles), 100 (small green circles) and 200 (gold asterisks) subjects per group, and an SMD of zero. The SE of these studies (indicated by the dashed line for studies with nÂ =Â 10) solely depends on their sample size, as SMD<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0 and therefore does not contribute to the equation for the SE. As expected, the SE decreases as the sample size increases. (<bold>B</bold>) Five data points from simulated studies with nÂ =Â 10 and a stepwise increasing SMD are added to the plot. For these studies, the SMD<sup>2</sup> contributes to the equation for the SE, and the SE will decrease even though the sample size is constant. The dotted line represents a hypothetical summary effect of SMDÂ =Â 1 in a meta-analysis. Note that when assessing a funnel plot for asymmetry around this axis, the data points with an SMDÂ &lt;Â 1 have skewed to the upper left-hand region, whereas studies with an SMDÂ &gt;Â 1 are in the lower right region of the plot. This distortion worsens as the SMD increases. (<bold>C</bold>) Because the SMD is squared in the equation for the SE, the same distortion pattern is observed for negative SMDs. Thus, funnel plots will be distorted most when the study samples sizes are small and SMDs are either very positive or very negative. (<bold>D</bold>) The same deviation is observed for simulated studies with larger sample sizes, however, the deviation decreases as the sample size increases, because the sample size will outweigh the effect of SMD<sup>2</sup> in the equation for the SE.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24260-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>In summary, a funnel plot using both the SMD and its SE may become asymmetrical in the absence of publication bias. When funnel plot distortion is assessed by visual inspection, this skewing might cause the plot to be interpreted as being asymmetrical and lead the observer to erroneously conclude that publication bias is present. Furthermore, funnel plot asymmetry is often tested statistically using Eggerâs regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egger et al., 1997</xref>) or Duval and Tweedieâs trim and fill analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duval and Tweedie, 2000</xref>), but neither of these analyses take the phenomenon described above into account, and their use may lead to erroneous conclusions that publication bias is present.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Aim of this study</title><p>We investigated the reliability of RMD, SMD and NMD-based funnel plots for the assessment of publication bias in meta-analyses, using both empirical datasets and data simulations.

We assess whether distortion can be avoided by using a precision estimate based on the sample size of the primary studies, as previously suggested for mean difference outcome measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sterne et al., 2011</xref>). We then use this alternative approach to reanalyse published funnel plots, and show that these systematic reviews may have overestimated the severity of publication bias in their body of evidence.

Trim and fill analysis resulted in on average 7% extra studies filled in preclinical simulation scenarios using the RMD. Adjusting the overall effect estimate based on these filled data points improved the estimation of the simulated RMD in all scenarios. However, when using the SMD, the number of filled studies was much higher in many scenarios (up to 21% extra studies filled). As a result, the adjusted overall effect estimate after trim and fill in SMD funnel plots tended to be an underestimation of the true effect size. Finally, through visual inspection, distortion could be seen in all SMD funnel plots that incorporated a true effect, most prominent in the preclinical (small study) scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>When repeating the simulations using Cohenâs <italic>d</italic> SMD instead of Hedgesâ <italic>g</italic>, or using Begg and Mazumdarâs test, we found highly similar results in all scenarios simulated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and exemplary funnel plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we assessed the impact of censoring non-significant simulated experiments (to simulate publication bias) and the performance of SMD vs. 1/ân funnel plots and NMD funnel plots in the presence of an intervention effect as alternatives to the SMD vs. SE funnel plot.

However, when the precision estimate was changed from SE to 1/ân, the prevalence of false positive results fell to the expected 5% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

This distortion occurs whenever an intervention effect is present, in meta-analyses both with and without publication bias. The severity of distortion and the risk of misinterpretation are influenced by the sample size of the individual studies, the number of studies in the meta-analysis, and the presence or absence of an intervention effect. Thus, the use of SMD vs. SE funnel plots may lead to invalid conclusions about the presence or absence of publication bias and should not be used. Since it is the association between the SMD and its SE that leads to funnel plot distortion, it almost inevitable that the issues described will occur with any test for publication bias that relies on an assessment of funnel plot asymmetry (<italic>e.g.</italic> Begg and Mazumdarâs testÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Begg and Mazumdar, 1994</xref>]). When using trim and fill analysis, funnel plot distortion introduces the risk of incorrectly adjusting the summary effect estimate. Previous reports of the presence of publication bias based on this approach should be re-evaluated, both for pre-clinical and clinical meta-analyses. Importantly, distortion does not occur in NMD vs. SE funnel plots, which formed the basis of a recent analysis showing evidence for substantial publication bias in the animal stroke literatureÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sena et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As the use of meta-analysis to summarize clinical and preclinical data continues to increase, continuous evaluation and development of research methods is crucial to promote high-quality meta-researchÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ioannidis et al., 2015</xref>). To our knowledge (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sterne et al., 2011</xref>), potential problems in tests for funnel plot asymmetry have not been extensively studied for SMDs, and guidance is limited. For instance, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of InterventionsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yan et al., 2015</xref>) states that artefacts may occur and that firm guidance on this matter is not yet available. It is disquieting that publication bias analyses using SMD funnel plots have been published in clinical and preclinical research areas, presumably because both the authors and the peer reviewers were unaware of the risk of spurious publication bias introduced by this methodology. Accepted papers from our group and others using SMDs for publication bias assessments have passed the peer review system, with no additional questions and or comments on this potential problem.</p><p>A similar phenomenon has been reported for the use of odds ratios in funnel plots, which also induces artificial significant results in Eggerâs regressionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peters et al., 2006</xref>). Here, too, an alternative test based on sample size has been proposed to circumvent this problemÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peters et al., 2006</xref>), and we suggest to extend this recommendation to SMDs.</p><p>However, given the relative performance of the RMD, NMD and SMD approaches, it is reasonable to consider whether SMD should ever be used. The RMD approach is limited because there are many instances (for example across species) where, although the same units of measurement are used, a given change may have very different biological importance. The NMD approach is preferred, but â because it expresses the effects of an intervention as a proportion of lesion size â there may be circumstances where outcome in a non-lesioned animal is not reported or cannot be inferred, and here the NMD approach is not possible. Further, the relative performance of RMD, NMD and SMD approaches in identifying heterogeneity between groups of animal studies (partitioning of heterogeneity) or in meta-regression is not known.</p><p>Taken with the increased distortion seen when contributing studies are individually small, this means our findings may be especially relevant for preclinical meta-analyses. The SMD is frequently used in preclinical meta-analyses to overcome expected heterogeneity between data obtained from different animal species. Nevertheless, the SMD is also used in clinical meta-analyses and the degree of distortion cannot be readily predicted. In any case, distortion causes the threshold for determining publication bias to be artificially lowered when using SMDs and their SE, increasing the chance of false-positive results.</p><p>Of note, trim and fill analysis may not always be reliable when the number of studies in a meta-analysis is large; in half of the cases of our unbiased simulations with 300 and 3000 studies, many studies were deemed missing, even if no intervention effect was introduced. Still, the SMD simulations were always more susceptible to the addition of imputed studies if a true effect was introduced, and the effect size reduction was larger compared to RMD measurements.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>We designed our data simulations to closely resemble empirical data in terms of the range of sample sizes, effect sizes and numbers of studies in a meta-analyses. We acknowledge that our current range of simulation scenarios does not enable us to predict the impact of funnel plot distortion in every possible scenario, but we present those scenarios which most clearly illustrate the causes and consequences of funnel plot distortion. Furthermore, our simulations may still be improved by <italic>e.g.</italic> studying the effects of unequal variances between treatment groups, sampling data from a non-normal distribution, or introducing various degrees of heterogeneity into the simulation. However, research on how to optimally simulate these parameters is first needed, and was beyond the scope of this study. instead, we used re-analyses of empirical data to test our proposed solutions on a number of real-life meta-analyses which include all of the aforementioned aspects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Recommendations</title><p>We recommend that, where possible, investigators use RMD or NMD instead of SMD when seeking evidence of publication bias in meta-analyses. Where it is necessary to use SMD, assessment for publication bias should use a sample size-based precision estimate such as 1/ân. In a given analysis it may be possible to calculate an NMD effect size for some but not all studies. In these circumstances there is a trade-off between the reduced number of included studies and an improved estimation of publication bias, and sensitivity analysis may be used to compare the meta-analysis outcome using the NMD versus the SMD. Of note, other methods to investigate publication bias in a dataset may be used in addition to funnel plots (<italic>e.g.</italic> fail-safe N, Excess Significance Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ioannidis and Trikalinos, 2007</xref>], or selection method / weight funcion model approachesÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peters et al., 2006</xref>]), but the performance of these approaches in the context of SMD, RMD and NMD estimates of effect size is not known.</p><p>In conclusion, funnel plots based on SMDs and their SE should be interpreted with caution, as the chosen precision estimate is crucial for detection of real funnel plot asymmetry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><p>We performed data simulations and re-analyses of empirical data using R statistical software (version 3.1.2; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link>) and the most recent MBESS, xlsx, meta and metafor packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rothstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kelley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schwarzer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Viechtbauer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dragulescu, 2014</xref>) (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for all R scripts). For all analyses involving RMD and SMD the primary outcome of interest was the number of asymmetrical funnel plots as detected by Egger's regressionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egger et al., 1997</xref>). As a secondary outcome, we assessed the number of missing studies as imputed by Duval and Tweedieâs trim and fill analysisÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duval and Tweedie, 2000</xref>). This method provides an estimate of the number of missing studies in a meta-analysis, and the effect that these missing studies may have had on its outcome. In brief, the funnel plot is mirrored around the axis represented by the overall effect estimate. Excess studies (often small, imprecise studies with a neutral or negative effect size) which have no counterpart on the opposite side of the plot are temporarily removed (trimmed). The trimmed plot is then used to re-estimate the overall effect estimate. The trimmed data points are placed back into the plot, and then a paired study is imputed with the same precision but reflected to have an effect size reflected around the adjusted overall estimate, and plotted in a different color or symbol from the observed data points. The analysis is re-run and repeated until no further asymmetry is observed. We used trim and fill analysis and a random effects model in R to seek evidence for publication bias overstating the effectiveness of the interventions, based on the proposed direction of the intervention effect. Because of its superior performance in studies with small sample sizes, Hedgesâ <italic>g</italic> was used in the main analyses throughout this manuscript. We considered a p-value ofÂ &lt;0.05 to be significant for Eggerâs regression in individual simulations.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Empirical data published as RMD re-analyzed as SMD</title><p>In our first re-analysis of empirical data from published preclinical meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wever et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zwetsloot et al., 2016</xref>), we constructed funnel plots using the unbiased SMD (Hedgesâ <italic>g</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hedges, 1981</xref>]) vs. SE, and compared these to funnel plots using the RMD vs. SE (as in the original publication).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data simulation methods</title><p>In our first simulation, we tested the estimation of publication bias using the unbiased SMD (Hedgesâ <italic>g</italic>) in simulated data where there was no publication bias. As a sensitivity analysis, all scenarios of simulation 1 were also performed using Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>. We generated simulated meta-analyses by simulating the desired number of individual studies, each with a control group and an intervention group. The control groups were simulated by randomly sampling individual subject data from a normal distribution with a mean (M<sub>ctrl</sub>) of 30 and an SD of 10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>); these values were based on outcome data for functional imaging in myocardial infarction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zwetsloot et al., 2016</xref>). Individual subject data for the intervention group was sampled from a normal distribution with mean M<sub>ctr</sub>Â +ES (effect size). To assess the effect of differences in overall intervention effects on funnel plot distortion, we simulated meta-analyses for an ES of respectively 0, 5, or 10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). To assess the effect of study sample size on funnel plot distortion, we simulated two types of study sizes: small (12â30 subjects per study), as is more common in animal studies, and large (60â320 subjects per study), as is more common in human studies. For each simulated study, we determined the number of subjects by sampling the group sizes from the uniform distribution within the ranges of study sizes given (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Of note, an intervention effect of SMDÂ =Â 1 may appear large to those experienced in meta-analyses of clinical data, but is typical of those observed in animal studies, as are the group sizes reported (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24260.014</object-id><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Simulation characteristics.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="3">Small studies</th><th colspan="3">Large studies</th><th>RMD</th><th>SMD</th><th>NMD</th></tr><tr><th>Experimental groups</th><th><italic>N</italic></th><th><italic>Mean</italic></th><th><italic>SD</italic></th><th><italic>N</italic></th><th><italic>Mean</italic></th><th><italic>SD</italic></th><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intervention 1 (no effect)</td><td>7â14</td><td>30</td><td>10</td><td>40â150</td><td>30</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention 2 (RMDÂ =Â 5)</td><td>7â14</td><td>35</td><td>10</td><td>40â150</td><td>35</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.125</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention 3 (RMDÂ =Â 10)</td><td>7â14</td><td>40</td><td>10</td><td>40â150</td><td>40</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Control</td><td>5â16*</td><td>30</td><td>10</td><td>20â170*</td><td>30</td><td>10</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Sham</td><td>4â6</td><td>70</td><td>4</td><td/><td/><td/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>nÂ =Â sample size; NDÂ =Â normal distribution; SDÂ =Â standard deviation; *control group sample sizeÂ =Â intervention group sample sizeÂ Â±â¤2 (small studies) orÂ Â±â¤20 (large studies).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Simulation and aggregation of individual subject data into study-level data was repeated until the desired number of studies to be included in the meta-analysis was obtained. We assessed the influence of the number of included studies on funnel plot distortion by simulating meta-analyses containing either 30, 300, or 3000 studies. Although there is no consensus on the minimal number of studies required for publication bias analysis, 30 has been previously proposed as the minimal number to obtain sufficient power for asymmetry testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lau et al., 2006</xref>). We chose 3000 studies for the largest meta-analysis as this is substantially larger than any meta-analysis of which we know, and any effects of study number are likely to be saturated at that number of studies. Importantly, we did not introduce publication bias to any of these datasets and the funnel plots should therefore be symmetrical. We repeated each simulation 1000 times, and we compared the effects of expressing the meta-analysis results as RMD or SMD, and used funnel plots with the effects size plotted on the x-axis and the SE as precision estimate plotted on the y-axis (RMD vs. SE and SMD vs. SE plots). As a second sensitivity analysis, we assessed the robustness of our findings using Eggerâs test by re-testing all scenarioâs of simulation 1 using Begg and Mazumdarâs test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Begg and Mazumdar, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Informed by the outcomes of simulation 1, in our second simulation we selected the conditions introducing the most prominent distortion in SMD vs. SE funnel plots to investigate the performance of alternatives including SMD vs. 1/ân funnel plots and NMD funnel plots. Thus, all simulations were performed with a small study sample size, in the presence of an intervention effect (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>) and with 3000 studies per meta-analysis. Under these conditions, we constructed RMD vs. SE and SMD vs. SE funnel plots as described above, as well as funnel plots of the SMD against the inversed square root of the total sample size (1/ân) in each study, and of the NMD against the SE. For the NMD, sham group data were simulated to have a mean of 70 and an SD of 4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Group size was selected to be 4â6 subjects, which is a typical sample size for sham groups in preclinical experiments. We performed the simulations once and compared outcomes across all four funnel plots.</p><p>In our final simulation we investigated the effects of a modelled publication bias on the performance of the SMD vs. SE and alternative approaches. We simulated meta-analyses containing 300 and 3000 studies with a small individual sample size and an intervention effect present (ÎÎ¼Â =Â difference in means between control and intervention groupÂ =Â 10; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). RMD vs. SE, RMD vs. 1/ân, SMD vs. SE, SMD vs. 1/ân and NMD vs. SE funnel plots were constructed and tested for asymmetry using Eggerâs regression. We then introduced publication bias in these meta-analyses using a stepwise method, Publication bias was introduced stepwise, by removing 10% of primary studies in which the difference between the intervention and control group means was significant at p&lt;0.05 (Student-t test), 50% of studies where the significance level was pâ¥0.05 to p&lt;0.10, and 90% of studies where the significance level was pâ¥0.10. Funnel plot asymmetry testing was performed as above, and the results were compared to the unbiased simulations and between different funnel plot types. All simulations were repeated 1000 times. Of note, this simulation was not performed for meta-analyses of studies with a large sample size, since pilot data showed that the large sample size will cause only very few studies to be removed from the âbiasedâ meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Re-analysis of empirical data using an n-based precision estimate</title><p>Finally, to assess the usefulness and impact of using a sample size-based precision estimate in SMD funnel plots of empirical data, we re-analysed data from five published preclinical meta-analyses that used SMD vs. SE funnel plots to assess publication bias.

There were no selection criteria in terms of <italic>e.g.</italic> the number of studies in the analysis, or the outcome of the publication bias assessment. The distribution of the total number of subjects per data point in the selected studies is (in median (min-max): 11.7 (6â38) for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wever et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editorsâ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Standardized mean differences cause funnel plot distortion in publication bias assessments&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, M Dawn Teare (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marcus Munafo (Reviewer #2); Jack Vevea (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have recognised this is an important topic but you have not really presented what the impact of this problem is. There are many queries relating to selection of simulation parameters, choice of statistic and test, and what the impact is in realistic practice.</p><p>Addressing these issues will likely exceed the time span for major revisions in <italic>eLife</italic> (two-three months), so we are rejecting the paper now but would welcome a resubmission in the future, with no guarantees of acceptance or re-review. This should be a de novo submission, and we would endeavour to recruit the same editors to assess the revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript identifies an important potential problem when using the SMD in meta-analyses. When sample sizes are small and effect sizes large, funnel plots using SMD vs. SE can show asymmetry and hence suggest evidence of publication bias when there is none.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that this issue should not be so surprising as the SMD SE is a function of the effect size and hence studies with small sample sizes will tend to show a bias. Meta analyses that contain large numbers of studies are therefore more likely to show this effect. This could be an important issue as the meta-analysis may over correct the SMD and actually lead to an underestimate of an effect size.</p><p>This manuscript has a clear simple message that using funnel plots of the SMD vs. 1/ân do not result in the same bias.</p><p>I do have a number of concerns with the paper especially as they do not tackle the issue of what is the impact on the overall estimate of the effect size resulting from such meta-analyses. My understanding is that the funnel plot, trim and fill is used to estimate corrected effect sizes (so if publication bias is suspected the SMD is adjusted). This manuscript has not really focused on the impact on the overall estimates coming out of meta-analyses.</p><p>1) Hedges' <italic>g</italic> is often reported for studies of small sample size rather than Cohen's <italic>d</italic>, but the authors appear to have not performed their simulations using this version. (Apart from a single figure shown in the supplementary methods). It seems odd not to have fully evaluated the performance of both summary measures.</p><p>2) The simulations have only been performed under quite a limited number of scenarios, the null, for one very large effect size and then for a specific form of publication bias. Though a range of sample sizes has been explored. While this is helpful to show the weakness in the method researchers will want to know when it is important. Is an effect size of 1SD a realistic effect size in practice? Surely if an effect size is so large as that not many studies will be required to confirm it. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> shows scant details of the 5 meta-analyses. It seems intriguing that one of these meta-analyses included almost 1400 studies? I have looked up that reference and while they have looked for evidence of publication bias in all the various studies, it does not seem sensible to have pooled all of the studies for this analysis.</p><p>3) Much more detail on the meta analyses and why they were selected. What was the impact on the estimates of SMD using the different funnel plots? What was the distributions of sample sizes and SMDs in the studies making up each meta-analysis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors highlight an interesting aspect of commonly used tests to assess for the presence of small study bias, which may be caused by publication bias. This is supported by analyses of simulated and real data.</p><p>My main comment is that there are other tests (e.g. Begg and Mazumdar). Do the issues described here apply to all tests, and if so does the extent to which they do so differ (in which case, which is superior)?</p><p>It may also be worth briefly discussing other approaches, such as the Excess Significance Test developed by Ioannidis, that rely on different assumptions and therefore allow triangulation of methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents a simulation study looking at the identification of publication bias for measures of effect size based on the difference between means: standardized mean difference (SMD), raw mean difference (RMD), and normalized mean difference (NMD). Using Egger's regression and Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis to detect funnel plot asymmetry, the authors discover a problem of overidentification for SMD when analysis is based on funnel plots of SMD against standard error. Overidentification of publication bias was found to be much greater for SMD in comparison to RMD and NMD. This problem was found to be mitigated by plotting SMD against 1/ân.</p><p>The authors provide a good description of the different types of measures of effect size. However, they provide only a mention of Hedges' <italic>g</italic> in the fourth paragraph of Section 1.1. Many practitioners incorrectly use the term <italic>g</italic> and <italic>d</italic> interchangeably, and a description of how these two estimates are different will be beneficial. Related to this, in the following sentence the paper describes the shortcomings of SMD when the sample size is small. It would be useful to point out that Hedges' bias-corrected estimate is meant to address bias when sample sizes are small (Hedges, 1981).</p><p>In Section 1.2, the authors describe the relationship between funnel plot asymmetry and publication bias. It would also be worth pointing out that funnel plot asymmetry does not necessarily indicate publication bias. There are other reasons why funnel plots may appear asymmetrical, such as systematic heterogeneity related to the inclusion of two different modes of inquiry that differ both in effect magnitude and in typical standard error.</p><p>There are two sections of the paper with the heading &quot;Data Simulations&quot; (Section 2.2 and Section 4.1). Results of the simulations are in Section 2.2. Section 4.1 is at the end of the paper and describes the process for simulating the data. This organization is confusing. It would be better if the description of the simulation were provided before these results, as it provides context for understanding the outcome of the author's simulation. Also, headings that clearly define these different sections will make it easier for readers to navigate the article.</p><p>In the third paragraph of Section 2.2 the authors state that results were similar for Cohen's <italic>d</italic> and Hedges' <italic>g</italic> effect-size estimates. Based on the information in the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2), it appears that the comparisons for these estimates were only made using large sample sizes. In this case, similar results would be expected. They would be more likely to have different results in cases where sample sizes are small, as <italic>d</italic> and <italic>g</italic> are more-or-less identical for large sample sizes. The authors should address this scenario as well and make it clear that the information provided uses the Hedgesâ <italic>g</italic> bias-corrected estimate of effect size.</p><p>In the fourth paragraph of Section 2.2 the authors use SMD-1/ân to refer to their analysis of funnel plots looking at SMD with 1/ân on the y axis. The hyphen could be interpreted as arithmetic minus sign, so additional clarity of notation is needed.</p><p>In the fourth paragraph of Section 2.2 the authors state that the distortion is not seen in plot D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Visual interpretation of funnel plots is subjective. To some readers, the plot will continue to appear asymmetric, but flatter. The authors should explain what details of the plot lead them to the conclusion that the plot was symmetric as well as plots A and C, which are also described as not indicating distortion.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, the authors of this study operationalize publication bias by removing all studies with a p-value â¥.10. This operation means that studies with a p-value above the cutoff have no chance of being published, and all studies with a p-value below (e.g. p=.09 and p=.01) have equal certainty of publication. This specification is not a good reflection of how publication bias functions in the real world. The authors should provide justification for using a simple cutoff of a p-value, rather than a model with diminishing probability such as a step function or a decaying continuous function. The authors should also include their reasoning for setting the cutoff at p â¥}.10, as well as information on how many studies were excluded based on this cutoff, such as the average number of studies remaining in the analysis.</p><p>In Section 2.3, the authors compare the results of the analyses using examples from real-world studies. Providing this shows how their research may be applicable in real world settings. It would also be useful to report effect-size estimate from the original meta-analysis.</p><p>The Discussion section is missing a discussion of the limitations of the current study. The simulation had a limited number of conditions. Providing limitations identifies the scope of the presented findings. Also, the authors should include a rationale explaining why they got these results Without that, the findings atheoretical; entirely empirical methodological findings are harder to accept with confidence.</p><p>In the first paragraph of Section 4.1, the authors describe the process for obtaining individual study sample sizes in the simulation. They should provide a rationale for sampling study sample sizes from a uniform distribution. Sample sizes typically do not follow a uniform distribution; rather they tend to be positively skewed. This brings into question the relevance of the simulations.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> legend the authors describe the magnitudes for the effect sizes included in the simulation. They should provide a reasoning for using an effect magnitude of SMD=1. By many standards, this would be considered a very large effect. It is possible that the method would perform better (or worse) under conditions where the population magnitude is small or moderate.</p><p>Also, the simulation did not include heterogeneity of studies in the model: all studies were sampled from exactly the same fixed-effect distribution. Studies conducted in the real world tend to have heterogeneity. Conditions of heterogeneity often lead to failure of trim and fill and Eggers regression, and would influence the outcome of an analysis of publication bias.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24260.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] I do have a number of concerns with the paper especially as they do not tackle the issue of what is the impact on the overall estimate of the effect size resulting from such meta-analyses.

We focus on the performance of Eggerâs test since this is the test most commonly used in practice. However, based on our theoretical explanation of how the association between the SMD and its SE leads to funnel plot distortion, it is almost inevitable that the issues described will occur with any test that relies on an assessment of funnel plot asymmetry to detect publication bias (such as the method of Begg and Mazumdar, and others). As an example, we have investigated the performance of Begg and Mazumdarâs test, the results of which are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We found that this test indeed results in overestimation of funnel plot asymmetry, highly similar to Eggerâs regression. It seems to yield slightly lower number of false-positive results in scenarios with few studies, but this is likely due to the fact that Begg and Mazumdarâs test has been shown to have lower power than Eggerâs test when the number of studies is low (Sterne et al. 2000 JCE).

The authors should also include their reasoning for setting the cutoff at p â¥}.10, as well as information on how many studies were excluded based on this cutoff, such as the average number of studies remaining in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our method to introduce publication bias can be refined and have therefore improved this analysis by introducing bias using a step wise function.</p><p>Amendment(s) to the manuscript:</p><p>Added description of step-wise method to section 4.2: âWe then introduced publication bias in these meta-analyses using a stepwise method, Publication bias was introduced stepwise, by removing 10% of primary studies in which the difference between the intervention and control group means was significant at p&lt;0.05 (Student-t test), 50% of studies where the significance level was pâ¥0.05 to p&lt;0.10, and 90% of studies where the significance level was pâ¥0.10.â</p><p>Added R script to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Supplemental figure now shows example plots of the new step function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Section 2.3, the authors compare the results of the analyses using examples from real-world studies.

It would also be useful to report effect-size estimate from the original meta-analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would indeed be helpful to the reader, and have therefore added the original and adjusted effect sizes of the meta-analyses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> (see also reviewer 1, comment 3, second point).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion section is missing a discussion of the limitations of the current study.

Instead, we used re-analyses of empirical data to test our proposed solutions on a number of real-life meta-analyses which include all of these aspects.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors should include a rationale explaining why they got these results Without that, the findings atheoretical; entirely empirical methodological findings are harder to accept with confidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Section 1.3 and a new (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in which we discuss the theoretical rationale of SMD vs. SE funnel plot distortion in more detail. We aim for the theoretical explanation to be suitable for the level of statistical knowledge of our target audience (review authors/ readers of reviews/ reviewers of reviews).</p><p>Amendment(s) to the manuscript:</p><p>Added section 1.3 Theoretical explanation of SMD funnel plot distortion:</p><p>â1.3 Theoretical explanation of SMD funnel plot distortion</p><p>In a meta-analysis using the SMD as effect measure, in the absence of publication bias, observed SMDs in a funnel plot will be scattered around the true underlying SMD. <italic>[â¦]</italic> The effect of the second component on the SE, and the resulting distortion, is largest if the sample size is small and the SMD is large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).âAdded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, visualisation of the theoretical explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the first paragraph of Section 4.1, the authors describe the process for obtaining individual study sample sizes in the simulation. They should provide a rationale for sampling study sample sizes from a uniform distribution. Sample sizes typically do not follow a uniform distribution; rather they tend to be positively skewed. This brings into question the relevance of the simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>As described on in our tenth response to your major comments, we have added a description to Section 3.1 of the limitations of or simulation approach that closely resembles the sample sizes, effect sizes and number of studies of empirical data, but not varying degrees of heterogeneity, unequal variances between groups or sampling from non-normally distributed data. This we feel is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> legend the authors describe the magnitudes for the effect sizes included in the simulation. They should provide a reasoning for using an effect magnitude of SMD=1. By many standards, this would be considered a very large effect.</p></disp-quote><p>This question was also raised by reviewer 1. We kindly refer you to our response to reviewer 1, major comment 2, first point, for an explanation and amendments to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is possible that the method would perform better (or worse) under conditions where the population magnitude is small or moderate.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpreted âpopulation magnitudeâ as the effect size introduced. Although this method might indeed reach significance later, the methodological problem still exists. Slightly more power may be needed to detect it, but chances of false positive claims are still higher than they should be.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the simulation did not include heterogeneity of studies in the model: all studies were sampled from exactly the same fixed-effect distribution. Studies conducted in the real world tend to have heterogeneity. Conditions of heterogeneity often lead to failure of trim and fill and Eggers regression, and would influence the outcome of an analysis of publication bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that heterogeneity in ârealâ meta-analyses may greatly influence the outcomes of Eggerâs regression and trim and fill analyses. However, the goal of our current simulations is to illustrate the cause of the problem (why are SMD vs. SE funnel plots distorted), and how is this influenced by three straightforward variables: sample size, effect size and number of studies in the analysis. We feel that introducing heterogeneity into these simulations will not make the message more clear. Because heterogeneity is such a complex phenomenon, we felt it was more informative to perform re-analyses of empirical datasets, in which heterogeneity and the aforementioned variables are combined and which therefore optimally serve the purpose of showing how relevant our findings are in practice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
