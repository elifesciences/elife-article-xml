variants; an understanding of the unique features of the humoral responses to infection and vaccination, including different vaccine platforms, is needed to achieve this goal.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The epitopes and pathways of escape for Spike-specific antibodies in individuals with diverse infection and vaccination history were profiled using Phage-DMS. Principal component analysis was performed to identify regions of antibody binding along the Spike protein that differentiate the samples from one another. Within these epitope regions we determined potential sites of escape by comparing antibody binding of peptides containing wildtype residues versus peptides containing a mutant residue.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Individuals with mild infection had antibodies that bound to epitopes in the S2 subunit within the fusion peptide and heptad-repeat regions, whereas vaccinated individuals had antibodies that additionally bound to epitopes in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, a pattern that was also observed in individuals with severe disease due to infection. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, mRNA vaccine type, and age did not affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a relatively uniform escape profile across individuals for some epitopes, whereas there was much more variation in escape pathways in mildly infected individuals. In the case of antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region, which was a common response to both infection and vaccination, the escape profile after infection was not altered by subsequent vaccination.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The finding that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination resulted in binding to additional epitopes beyond what was seen after infection suggests protection could vary depending on the route of exposure to Spike antigen. The relatively conserved escape pathways to vaccine-induced antibodies relative to infection-induced antibodies suggests that if escape variants emerge, they may be readily selected for across vaccinated individuals. Given that the majority of people will be first exposed to Spike via vaccination and not infection, this work has implications for predicting the selection of immune escape variants at a population level.</p><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by NIH grants AI138709 (PI Overbaugh) and AI146028 (PI Matsen). Julie Overbaugh received support as the Endowed Chair for Graduate Education (FHCRC). The research of Frederick Matsen was supported in part by a Faculty Scholar grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Simons Foundation.

All samples were de-identified and thus all work was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board as nonhuman subjects research.HAARVI CohortWe obtained plasma samples from individuals enrolled in the Hospitalized or Ambulatory Adults with Respiratory Viral Infections (HAARVI) study conducted in Seattle. Individuals were either enrolled upon PCR confirmed diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection or as control subjects prior to receiving vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna). Electronic informed consent was obtained for every individual, and the study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>We provide a fully reproducible automated workflow which ingests raw sequencing data and performs all analyses presented in the paper.
