thought to play a role in human episodic memory, but the underlying mechanisms mediating this effect are not known. We tested the activity of the murine sequence and found that the ribozyme’s self-scission half-life matches the time it takes an RNA polymerase to reach the immediate downstream exon, suggesting that the ribozyme-dependent intron cleavage is tuned to co-transcriptional splicing of the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> mRNA. Our studies also reveal that the murine ribozyme modulates maturation of its harboring mRNA in both cultured cortical neurons and the hippocampus: inhibition of the ribozyme using an antisense oligonucleotide leads to increased CPEB3 protein expression, which enhances polyadenylation and translation of localized plasticity-related target mRNAs, and subsequently strengthens hippocampal-dependent long-term memory. These findings reveal a previously unknown role for self-cleaving ribozyme activity in regulating experience-induced co-transcriptional and local translational processes required for learning and memory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stored within DNA are the instructions cells need to make proteins. In order for proteins to get made, the region of DNA that codes for the desired protein (known as the gene) must first be copied into a molecule called messenger RNA (or mRNA for short). Once transcribed, the mRNA undergoes further modifications, including removing redundant segments known as introns. It then travels to molecular machines that translate its genetic sequence into the building blocks of the protein.</p><p>Following transcription, some RNAs can fold into catalytic segments known as self-cleaving ribozymes which promote the scission of their own genetic sequence. One such ribozyme resides in the intron of a gene for CPEB3, a protein which adds a poly(A) tail to various mRNAs, including some involved in learning and memory. Although this ribozyme is found in most mammals, its biological role is poorly understood.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that the ribozyme cleaves itself at the same time as the mRNA for CPEB3 is transcribed. This led Chen et al. to hypothesize that the rate at which these two events occur impacts the amount of CPEB3 produced, resulting in changes in memory and learning. If the ribozyme cleaves quickly, the intron is disrupted and may not be properly removed, leading to less CPEB3 being made. However, if the ribozyme is inhibited, the intron remains intact and is efficiently excised, resulting in higher levels of CPEB3 protein.</p><p>To test how the ribozyme impacts CPEB3 production, Chen et al. inhibited the enzyme from cutting itself with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The ASOs were applied to in vitro transcription systems, neurons cultured in the laboratory and the brains of living mice in an area called the hippocampus.</p><p>The in vitro and cell culture experiments led to higher levels of CPEB3 protein and the addition of more poly(A) tails to mRNAs involved in neuron communication. Injection of the ASOs into the brains of mice had the same effect, and also improved their memory and learning.</p><p>The findings of Chen et al. show a new mechanism for controlling protein production, and suggest that ASOs could be used to increase the levels of CPEB3 and modulate neuronal activity. This is the first time a biological role for a self-cleaving ribozyme in mammals has been identified, and the approach used could be applied to investigate the function of two other self-cleaving ribozymes located in introns in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CPEB3</kwd><kwd>ribozyme</kwd><kwd>neuroplasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG051807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Marcelo A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1AG057558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Marcelo A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1804220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luptak</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1330606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luptak</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Claire C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA229696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Claire C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mammalian CPEB3 self-cleaving ribozyme modulates expression of the CPEB3 mRNA and protein, altering translation of plasticity-related proteins and hippocampus-dependent memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding proteins (CPEBs) are RNA-binding proteins that modulate polyadenylation-induced mRNA translation, which is essential for the persistence of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2003</xref>).

The <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme belongs to hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-like ribozymes, which are self-cleaving RNAs widespread among genomes of eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Webb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eickbush and Eickbush, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ruminski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sánchez-Luque et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weinberg et al., 2015</xref>). The biological roles of these ribozymes vary widely and include processing rolling-circle transcripts during HDV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sharmeen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 1989</xref>), 5′-cleavage of retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eickbush and Eickbush, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ruminski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sánchez-Luque et al., 2011</xref>), and in one bacterial example, the HDV-like ribozyme may mediate metabolite-dependent regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Passalacqua et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the genomic locations of these catalytic RNAs suggest that they are involved in many other biological processes. Recent analysis suggests that <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozymes have had a role in mammals for over 100 million years, although their biological function remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendixsen et al., 2021</xref>). In humans, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the ribozyme cleavage site leads to a threefold higher rate of in vitro self-scission, which correlates with poorer performance in an episodic memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vogler et al., 2009</xref>) and suggests that the ribozyme activity may play a role in memory formation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cpeb3</italic> gene structure and activity of its intronic self-cleaving ribozyme.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of mouse <italic>Cpeb3</italic> gene.

Using synthetic ribozymes placed within introns of mammalian genes, previous work showed that splicing of the surrounding exons is sensitive to the continuity of the intron: fast ribozymes caused efficient self-scission of the intron, leading to unspliced mRNA and lower protein expression. In contrast, slow ribozymes had no effect on mRNA splicing and subsequent protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fong et al., 2009</xref>).

Because the distance from the ribozyme cleavage site to the third exon in the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> gene is 9931 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription rate of long mammalian genes is estimated to be ~3.5–4.1 knt/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>), RNAPII should require about 2.5–3 min to travel from the ribozyme to the third exon. The nascent ribozyme thus self-cleaves in about the same time as it takes the RNAPII to synthesize the remaining part of the intron and the next exon, at which point the splicing machinery is expected to mark the intron–exon junction. This observation suggests that the ribozyme activity is tuned to the co-transcriptional processing of the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> pre-mRNA: a significantly faster rate of self-scission would lead to a high fraction of cleaved, unspliced pre-mRNAs, whereas slow self-cleavage rate would have no effect on the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> pre-mRNA splicing.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Kinetic parameters of murine <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme constructs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2"><sup>†</sup></xref>.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Construct<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">A</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">k<sub>1</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">B</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">k<sub>2</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">C</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–10/72</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.72 ± 0.09</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.39 ± 0.09</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.082 ± 0.026</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–49/72/165</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.88 ± 0.02</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.42 ± 0.04</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.013 ± 0.015</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.11 ± 0.03</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.04 ± 0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–233/72/165</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.78 ± 0.04</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.31 ± 0.04</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.035 ± 0.006</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.17 ± 0.02</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">0.029 ± 0.005</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>Construct size is defined as (length of sequence upstream of the ribozyme cleavage site)/[<italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme (72 nts)]/(downstream sequence).</p></fn><fn id="table1fn2"><label>†</label><p>Co-transcriptional self-scission was modeled by a bi-exponential decay model with a residual.

To examine <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme activity, total ribozyme and uncleaved ribozyme levels were measured by qRT-PCR using primers designed to amplify the ribozyme sequence downstream of the cleavage site and across the cleavage site, respectively. We used a standard curve specific for every amplicon to independently determine the levels of every RNA segment (determined by each primer pair) measured by qRT-PCR.

Similarly, glutamate stimulation resulted in increased expression of spliced exons by two- to threefold at 2 hr, with a decrease observed at later time points (exons 2–3: <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,21)</sub> = 5.826, p=0.0016; exons 3–6: <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,22)</sub> = 2.002, p=0.1181; exons 6–9: <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,22)</sub> = 1.763, p=0.1622; one-way ANOVA with Šidák’s <italic>post hoc</italic> tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and increased ribozyme expression correlated with <italic>Cpeb3</italic> mRNA expression (<italic>F</italic><sub>(5,26)</sub> = 4.657, p=0.0036; one-way ANOVA with Šidák’s <italic>post hoc</italic> tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The cleaved fraction of the ribozyme, determined as the difference between the uncleaved fraction and unity, was greatest at the highest point of <italic>Cpeb3</italic> mRNA expression, indicating efficient co-transcriptional self-scission. Furthermore, nuRNA-sequencing analysis of the GSE125068 dataset revealed the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> induction in the mouse hippocampus following kainic acid (KA) administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Albert et al., 2019</xref>).

KA, a glutamate receptor agonist, induces neuronal activation in vivo through membrane depolarization and calcium influx.

To examine whether <italic>Cpeb3</italic> mRNA is modulated by behavioral training, we subjected mice to an object location memory (OLM) task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fioriti et al., 2015</xref>) and isolated hippocampal tissues 1 hr after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The OLM task has been widely used to study hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. The task is based on an animal’s innate preference for novelty and its capability for discriminating spatial relationships between novel and familiar object locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014</xref>).

The distance from the 5ʹ terminus of the pre-mRNA and exon 2 is about 33 kb, whereas exon 6 is more than three times farther (110 kb). As a result, RNAP II and the splicing machinery require at least three times longer to produce the spliced exons 2–6 of the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> mRNA (assuming no significant pausing in transcription and co-transcriptional splicing). Transcription initiation, pre-mRNA production up to exon 2, and splicing would be expected to yield spliced mRNA exons 1–2 after 1 hr, but reaching the sixth exon and splicing the mRNA would likely not happen in that time frame (as evidenced by the GSE125068 nuRNA-seq dataset described above). We therefore believe the results of these two studies are not at odds; rather, these results demonstrate that the detection of new rounds of gene expression should rely on measurements of early segments of activity-induced genes, rather than later segments.</p><p>To assess whether inhibition of the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme improves memory formation, we studied the effect of the ASO on long-term memory formation for object location using the OLM task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

We therefore infused mice bilaterally into the CA1 dorsal hippocampus with the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme ASO, Ctrl-ASO, or vehicle 48 hr prior to OLM training. Mice exhibit no preference for either object, as demonstrated by the absence of significant difference in training discrimination index (DI) (<italic>t</italic><sub>(16.99)</sub> = 0.8967, p=0.3824; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Likewise, during training and testing sessions, similar total exploration times were observed for ASO-infused mice and control mice, demonstrating that both groups of mice have similar exploitative behavior and that the ASO did not simply affect locomotor or exploration performance (train: <italic>t</italic><sub>(17.00)</sub> = 0.2342, p=0.8176; test: <italic>t</italic><sub>(13.48)</sub> = 1.644, p=0.1232; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). During the testing session, both Ctrl-ASO- and ASO-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in DI, suggesting that mice exhibited preference in exploring the novel object (Ctrl-ASO: <italic>t</italic><sub>(14.55)</sub> = 2.913, p=0.0110; ASO: <italic>t</italic><sub>(17.99)</sub> = 8.244, p&lt;0.0001; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

An increased preference for exploring the novel object location indicates successful recognition of the spatial change and demonstrates intact spatial memory. In our OLM task protocol, we measured the exploration time when mouse’s nose is within 1 cm of the object and directed toward the object, whereas other OLM protocols utilize a 2 cm distance from the object to define the exploration time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dix and Aggleton, 1999</xref>), leading to somewhat different exploration times. While different OLM protocols utilize various parameters, and different scoring methods yield different overall exploration times, the calculation of DIs to interpret memory formation from performance remains remarkably stable and the OLM exploration times are similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwapis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kwapis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keiser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2022</xref>).

Studies in hippocampal slices revealed local translation in dendrites following induction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>). Cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation is one of the key steps critical to controlling protein synthesis and neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du and Richter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richter, 2010</xref>), and one of the proteins involved in regulating cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNAs is CPEB3. In <italic>Aplysia</italic> sensory-motor neuron co-culture, application of repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT) induces ApCPEB protein expression at the stimulated synapses and, as a result, LTF, which is a form of learning-related synaptic plasticity that is widely studied in <italic>Aplysia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Si et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Si et al., 2010</xref>). In murine primary hippocampal neurons, the level of CPEB3 protein expression is positively regulated by neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fioriti et al., 2015</xref>) and plays dual roles in regulating mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du and Richter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stephan et al., 2015</xref>): a post-translational modification of CPEB3 (monoubiquitination by Neuralized1) converts it from a repressor to an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pavlopoulos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Polyadenylation-induced translation was first characterized in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes during early development, where untranslated mRNAs possessed short polyA tails; upon exposure to progesterone, the polyA tails were elongated, leading to the initiation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Richter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendez et al., 2000</xref>). In hippocampal neurons, it was suggested that the 3′ untranslated region of mRNA of α-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (α-CaMKII) was regulated by CPEB, undergoing polyadenylation-induced translation upon synaptic activation. Further, light exposure-triggered dark-reared rats exhibit significant experience-dependent activity in the visual cortex, where α-CaMKII mRNA was polyadenylated and translated during visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, activation of CPEB3 through Neuralized1 resulted in polyadenylation and translational activity of GluA1 and GluA2 and dendritic formation, which is important for facilitating synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pavlopoulos et al., 2011</xref>). These studies underscore the significance of understanding the mechanisms governing polyadenylation-induced translation in synaptic plasticity. Because synaptic local translation is essential for LTM, the modulation of translational process serves a pivotal role for the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.</p><p>Several studies have shown that CPEB3 is essential for synaptic strength, regulating mRNA translation of several PRPs at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pavlopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fioriti et al., 2015</xref>). Previous reports have shown that CPEB3 regulates GluA1 and GluA2 polyadenylation: <italic>Cpeb3</italic> conditional knockout mice fail to elongate the poly(A) tail of <italic>Gria1</italic> and <italic>Gria2</italic> mRNA after MWM training, and overexpression of CPEB3 changes the length of the <italic>Gria1</italic> and <italic>Gria2</italic> mRNA poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fioriti et al., 2015</xref>). Hippocampal-dependent learning and memory is modulated by CPEB3 on the level of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pavlopoulos et al., 2011</xref>), but it is unknown whether the CPEB3 expression is modulated by the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme.</p><p>In mammals, the coordination of pre-mRNA processing and transcription can affect gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neugebauer, 2019</xref>). Using long-read sequencing and Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) approaches, measurements of co-transcriptional splicing events in mammalian cells demonstrated that co-transcriptional splicing efficiency impacts productive gene output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reimer et al., 2021</xref>). The temporal and spatial window shows that the splicing and transcription machinery are tightly coupled. Our study is agreement with this co-transcriptional splicing model and shows that inhibition of the intronic <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme leads both to an increase in <italic>Cpeb3</italic> mRNA and protein levels in primary cortical neurons and the dorsal hippocampus upon synaptic stimulation, and subsequently, to changes in the polyadenylation of target mRNAs of the CPEB3 protein.</p><p>Activity-dependent synaptic changes are governed by AMPAR trafficking, and AMPARs are mobilized to the postsynaptic surface membrane in response to neuronal activity in a dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the activation of CPEB3 by neuronal stimulation further facilitates translation of PRPs in vivo. These observations are consistent with a model in which learning induces CPEB3 protein expression, and ablation of CPEB3 abolishes the activity-dependent translation of GluA1 and GluA2 in the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fioriti et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, it has been suggested that CPEB3 converts to prion-like aggregates in stimulated synapses that mediate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and facilitate memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Si and Kandel, 2016</xref>). Because training can produce effective long-term memory, it is likely that increased CPEB3 protein expression due to <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme inhibition further facilitates experience-induced local translational processes.</p><p>ASOs have been used in many studies to inhibit specific mRNAs. A notable example is an FDA-approved ASO that modulates co-transcriptional splicing of the <italic>Smn2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hua et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, Tran et al. demonstrated that ASO can suppress hexonucleotide repeat expansion of the first intron in the <italic>C9ORF72</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tran et al., 2022</xref>). Our work shows that an ASO designed to bind the substrate strand of an endogenous self-cleaving ribozyme (located in an intron) increases the expression of the fully spliced mRNA that harbors the ribozyme. Interestingly, our experiments with inhibitory ASO yielded lower ribozyme levels than control experiments, suggesting that the ASO directs degradation of the target sequence; however, this degradation must occur on a timescale that is longer than the splicing of the mRNA because we consistently measure higher mRNA levels when the ribozyme is inhibited. Given that three endogenous mammalian self-cleaving ribozymes map to introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de la Peña and García-Robles, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perreault et al., 2011</xref>), we anticipate that application of our ASO strategy will help decipher the effect of these self-cleaving ribozymes on their harboring mRNAs and elucidate their biological roles. Considering ASO as a pharmacological intervention, it is evident that the effect size, as observed in the DI of OLM, is smaller when compared to the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fioriti et al., 2015</xref>). This can be attributed to the mechanisms mediated by the ASO or different training session (10 min vs 15 min), suggesting that the ASO effect has subtle impact on cognitive performance compared to complete genetic ablation.</p><p>In summary, our study describes a unique role for the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme in post-transcriptional maturation of <italic>Cpeb3</italic> mRNA and its subsequent translation in mouse CA1 hippocampus. Inhibition of the <italic>Cpeb3</italic> ribozyme by ASO and OLM training induces activity-dependent upregulation of CPEB3 and local production of PRPs. These molecular changes are critical for establishing persistent changes in synaptic plasticity that are required for long-term memory. Thus, our study has identified a novel biological role for self-cleaving ribozymes in the brain. More broadly, we have demonstrated a method for determining the biological roles of self-cleaving ribozymes in both mammals (as shown here) and other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inhibition of CPEB3 ribozyme elevates CPEB3 protein expression and polyadenylation of its target mRNAs, and enhances object location memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all felt that the topic was important and that going from a ribozyme in an interesting gene to behavior was highly significant. There were, however, several questions raised in the discussion about the details of how the data in Figures 2 and 3 supports the model of ribozyme cleavage and activity. Reviewers 1 and 2 suggested that this might be a result of the text overstating the results and that could be fixed by a clearer description of how ribozyme cleavage and activity is interpreted from the data. However reviewer 3 felt strongly that additional experiments were required to support the model.</p><p>Because the measures of ribozyme cleavage and activity are central to the main significance of the study, we did agree that asking for additional experiments would be reasonable in this case if indeed the data provided did not answer these questions. These are the key questions that were raised by all three reviewers and that need to be addressed either by clarification/rewriting or new experiments in the revised version:</p><p>1) Does the behavioral paradigm (without the ASO) alter the ribozyme cleavage and intron 3 splicing? The authors should examine whether the tested behavioral paradigm alters the ribozyme activity and intron 3 splicing.</p><p>2) Are there data to show that the ASO inhibits cleavage of the ribozyme? Reviewer 3 asks, how were total and uncleaved Ribozymes measured by qRT-PCR? Where are the primers' locations? If the two products were amplified using different primers, their subtraction to derive % cleavage would not be appropriate.</p><p>3) What is the evidence for the model of how the ASO works? Reviewer 3 asks, Line 400-403: Shouldn't ribozyme-blocking ASO prevent ribozyme self-cleavage, and as a result should further increase ribozyme levels? This would contradict the result in Figure 3A.</p><p>We have included the full reviews from all three reviewers below and encourage you to consider using their comments to guide any additional revisions you might choose to make.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few suggestions.</p><p>1) Page 18, Line 415 says, &quot;The ASO likely prevents CBEP3 ribozyme from cleaving the intron co-transcriptionally and thereby promotes mRNA maturation.&quot; I found this sentence a bit confusing because of the &quot;likely&quot; and it made me realize that the authors might need to step the reader through the data needed to truly demonstrate this point. It looks like the ASO is shown in Figure 1F,G to prevent ribozyme cleavage and in Figure 3 the authors do a good job of walking through the expression of different exons. If there is a possible experiment in the middle that would measure the intron cleavage or the speed of mRNA maturation that would be stronger.</p><p>2) Ideally to prove that the effects of the ribozyme ASO on expression of PSD95 etc is mediated by CPEB3, the authors would treat CPEB3 knockout/knockdown cells with the ribozyme ASO and show the effect is lost. I do not think this experiment is required but it is what it would take to prove the mechanism so the text should mention this limitation.</p><p>3) In a previous review the reviewers had questioned the behavior data on the grounds that the total exploration time was too short to be meaningful. I searched the literature for examples of OLM tasks and found that most (outside the papers reported by UCI researchers) only report the discrimination index without stating the interaction times. However in the papers that did state interaction times I found one from a group not related to this one that used mice and showed interaction times of 5-10sec. By contrast in the papers that reported times and used rats, I found interaction times of 80-100sec. Thus a possible explanation for why the previous reviewer felt these data were not in line with other studies is because that person was accustomed to rat studies. The authors would be served to do this literature search as well and add some context to the OLM studies to this text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The CPEB3 ribozyme is an intriguing RNA element that is highly conserved in all mammals, suggesting that it has important functions. The authors developed a very nice anti-sense oligo (ASO) approach to probing the function of the ribozyme by blocking its self-cleavage activity and then observing the molecular and behavioral consequences. The ASOs seem to cause no problems with cultured cells or mice, and therefore the results can reasonably be interpreted as an investigation of the effects of ribozyme activity. I think this is a very important paper in the field, and the strongest evidence to date that ribozymes have important functions in humans and other mammals. The data clearly shows that blocking the ribozyme increases CPEB3 mRNA, CPEB3 protein, the expected downstream products of CPEB3 activity and mouse performance in a memory test. I do have some suggestions for improving the manuscript below, and some important questions to address. The authors should certainly explain all the results of all the controls of the OLM task experiment.</p><p>Suggestions</p><p>Paragraph starting line 565 – This paragraph does not describe the results of the Ctrl-ASO, as far as I can tell. This result seems important. Did the scrambled ASO result in increased DI or not? Inconclusive data, or contradictory data would not preclude publication, but it should be disclosed.</p><p>At Line 362, I feel like this subheading might be too strong given the evidence. There isn't strong evidence that the ribozyme activity increases because of the stimulation. It does appear that the fraction cleaved detected was maximal at 1h in both data sets, which coincides roughly with the max expression (2h for KCl, 1h for Glu). But the subheading as worded suggests causation to me. Could it specifically refer to &quot;correlation&quot; instead, i.e. &quot;ribozyme activity and cpeb3 mRNA expression are correlated post stimulation&quot;? Importantly, the data does not show if the uncleaved fraction is accumulating, or if the cleaved fraction is going away. This latter explanation would be expected if the cleaved RNA is less stable than the uncleaved RNA, and degraded at a faster rate, which would not be surprising. If this were true, the subheading could read &quot;cleaved RNA degradation is accelerated in response to stimulation&quot;, but currently, there is no evidence reported in either direction. If the authors relative Ct values could be used to distinguish between these two possibilities, that would be great. If not, it would be nice if the authors could soften the subheading to be more precise about correlation, and add a discussion of possible ways that the ribozyme could be stimulated, that cleaved RNA could be less stable, and other possible explanations to the Discussion section. Or, if my logic is wrong, please correct me!</p><p>Paragraph starting Line 392 – I think this first sentence should say &quot;CPEB3 ribozyme activity is correlated with mRNA expression&quot; (which would be a better subheading, above) not &quot;ribozyme expression&quot;? More generally, referring to &quot;ribozyme expression&quot; is a bit problematic, because every mRNA has a ribozyme, so the expression is identical to the mRNA? Maybe &quot;levels of detected ribozyme&quot; would be more accurate, but this would be hard to fit on the figure legends. &quot;Relative [RNA]&quot; could work too.</p><p>Also, I understand the hypothesis that blocking ribozyme cleavage could lead to different isoform abundances, but I don't see how the correlation between mRNA expression and cleavage is important for this hypothesis, which is how the paragraph was motivated. I find the link back to the correlation on line 392 at the beginning of this paragraph confusing, and unnecessary. The experiments could be easily motivated because the ribozyme is in an intron, and ribozyme self-cleavage could reasonably be expected to alter splicing of that intron. Minor suggestion – The evidence on modulated splicing seems a little weak, and the authors could consider moving this data later in the manuscript as &quot;evidence towards mechanism&quot;, but that is up to the authors about how they would prefer to tell their story.</p><p>Decreased ribozyme levels were detected upon ASO treatment in primary neurons and in the hippocampus. A likely explanation would be that blocked ribozyme would lead to more spliced intron that is then degraded or challenging to detect by qPCR, because it would be in lariat form. Could the authors discuss this? The results show more mRNA, more exon-exon junctions, but less ribozyme. I think some possible explanations should be discussed.</p><p>The reporting of statistics is a bit hard to follow because there are many multi-way hypothesis tests going on.</p><p>The discussion could be improved. I think it contains a little too much introduction and background type material that may not be needed. The section could focus more on interpreting the results, provide possible explanations for results with support from or comparison to the literature.</p><p>1) The paragraphs about polyadenylation-induced translation and synaptic strength could be good, but currently there is no clear connection to the results. I think the connection is implied, but could be clearly stated.</p><p>2) Compare the anti-correlation between activity and memory found here with the previous memory tests in humans – are they in agreement? If not, discuss.</p><p>3) Does fraction cleaved go down after the peak activity because cleaved molecules go down, or because uncleaved molecules accumulate (see above). Discuss these two options and mechanisms for how either of these two things could happen.</p><p>4) Compare the effect size of the ASO on OLM task DI compared to other interventions in the literature – is this a big effect or a small effect? It would be good to compare to different classes of intervention, like diet, drugs, gene knockdowns, etc.</p><p>5) Consider discussing why the ribozyme may have evolved and persisted in mammals, especially when memory is better when the ribozyme is deactivated by the ASOs? It would be nice to at least acknowledge that this leaves open questions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The premise of a comparable timescale between transcription and ribozyme activity as the foundation of the whole thesis was based on in vitro measurement of self-scission half-life and a broadly generalized transcription rate (which actually varies significantly between genes). to strengthen the argument, the authors should provide concrete evidence, for example, determine the cleavage efficiency by altering transcription rates in cells. This can be achieved using CPEB3 mingenes with different promoters and/or polII variants.</p><p>The physiological relevance of the proposed mechanism has yet to be demonstrated without ASO interference. For example, does the behavioral paradigm alter the ribozyme activity and intron 3 splicing?</p><p>Figure 2B: How were total and uncleaved Ribozymes measured by qRT-PCR? Where are the primers' locations? If the two products were amplified using different primers, their subtraction to derive % cleavage would not be appropriate.</p><p>Line 400-403: Shouldn't ribozyme-blocking ASO prevent ribozyme self-cleavage, and as a result should further increase ribozyme levels? This would contradict the result in Figure 3A.</p><p>Figure 2B-d: With KCL treatment, the ASO effects on splicing are inconsistent with different primer pairs. This does not support &quot;At an early time point (2 hours post-KCl induction), the ASO-containing culture displayed an increase of spliced mRNA&quot; (line 404-406)</p><p>And what is the explanation for the lack of ASO effects on exon 6-9?</p><p>Figure 2: The lack of KCL effect under control ASO also appears inconsistent with Figure 2A at 2 hr KCL treatment. Similarly, fig2e-h appears inconsistent with Figure 2A at 24hr KCL treatment. Explanations are needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90116.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all felt that the topic was important and that going from a ribozyme in an interesting gene to behavior was highly significant.

The uncleaved ribozyme levels were measured using oligos that amplify a region of the intron that starts 45 nts upstream and ends 238 nts downstream of the ribozyme cleavage site. We added this information to the Table of primers in the manuscript. For all PCR oligos we established independent standard curves and calculated RNA levels independently of other amplicons, as noted in the Methods section and now specified in the Results section as well (Page 15). The measurements were thus appropriate for the calculation of the cleaved ribozyme fractions in the various experiments. The fraction ribozyme cleaved was calculated from the uncleaved fraction as the difference between uncleaved fraction and unity (1 – fraction uncleaved), now specified on page 16 of the manuscript. Fraction uncleaved was calculated as [uncleaved ribozyme]/[total ribozyme], as was done previously (see Salehi-Ashtiani et al. Science 313:1788-1792 or Webb et al. Science 326:953).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is the evidence for the model of how the ASO works?

This would contradict the result in Figure 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>We showed that the ribozyme is inhibited in vitro (Figure 1F and 1G) and all our data are consistent with ASO inhibition of the ribozyme in cellulo and in vivo. However, we do not have direct evidence for this ribozyme inhibition in vivo, because such an experiment would require a single-molecule FRET-type sensitivity in cells and this assay has not been developed for ribozyme cleavage in cellulo or in vivo. We measured the ribozyme levels by RT-qPCR and observed lower ribozyme levels in presence of ASO in cultured neurons (Figure 3A) as well as in vivo (Figure 5B), which is nominally in contrast to the observations in vitro. However, in these situations we do not measure the co-transcriptional fate of the intron or the ribozyme; rather, we measure the levels of the intron after splicing (evidenced by the increased levels of spliced exons 2–3) when the intron is likely already being degraded. We also do not know what effect the ribozyme ASO has on the intron stability once splicing occurs. Understandably, this is a weakness of the study—and we are fully open about this result— however, given the abundance of evidence that the ribozyme ASO leads to increase of <italic>CPEB3</italic> mRNA under all conditions tested, we feel that there is strong, if indirect, evidence that our model for the ribozyme function is correct. Future studies will examine this issue closer, but a definitive experimental investigation for the mechanism and timing of ribozyme inhibition and intron degradation is out of scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few suggestions.</p><p>1) Page 18, Line 415 says, &quot;The ASO likely prevents CBEP3 ribozyme from cleaving the intron co-transcriptionally and thereby promotes mRNA maturation.&quot; I found this sentence a bit confusing because of the &quot;likely&quot; and it made me realize that the authors might need to step the reader through the data needed to truly demonstrate this point.

We only have indirect evidence that the ribozyme is inhibited through increased levels of spliced exons, but upon mRNA splicing, introns are rapidly degraded and that appears to be the effect we are observing when inhibiting the ribozyme. As noted above, a direct assay (for example a single-molecule FRET-type experiment) for ribozyme inhibition in vivo has not been developed and a detailed mechanistic study of ribozyme inhibition in live cells is out of scope of this study and will be the topic of future experiments. However, we have analyzed a nuRNA-seq dataset that presents new RNAs expressed after treatment of mice with kainate and found that the kinetics of transcription of CPEB3 are on par with our observations and that the CPEB3 ribozyme self-cleaves cotranscriptionally—that is, there is a gap in the RNA reads at the site of the ribozyme cleavage, whereas reads corresponding to upstream and ribozymes sequences are present one hr after kainate treatment. The data are discussed in the manuscript and presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Ideally to prove that the effects of the ribozyme ASO on expression of PSD95 etc is mediated by CPEB3, the authors would treat CPEB3 knockout/knockdown cells with the ribozyme ASO and show the effect is lost.

Our primary focus was to demonstrate the downstream effects of the CPEB3 ribozyme ASO on specific PRPs. However, we agree that addressing the role of CPEB3 in this context would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism. We plan to address these aspects by incorporating further experiments in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In a previous review the reviewers had questioned the behavior data on the grounds that the total exploration time was too short to be meaningful.

However in the papers that did state interaction times I found one from a group not related to this one that used mice and showed interaction times of 5-10sec. By contrast in the papers that reported times and used rats, I found interaction times of 80-100sec. Thus a possible explanation for why the previous reviewer felt these data were not in line with other studies is because that person was accustomed to rat studies. The authors would be served to do this literature search as well and add some context to the OLM studies to this text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments on our previous review. We appreciate the effort in searching the literature for examples of OLM tasks and highlighting the variance in reported interaction times between studies in mice and rats. Indeed, during the novel object preference test, it was observed that mice displayed a shorter exploration time and approached the objects at slower pace compared to rats (Stranahan, 2011). We have added introductory sentences and references to the manuscript on page 23 to better describe the task. The interaction times we measured depend on the distance measured, among other variables; that is, the threshold distance of what is considered an interaction. We used 1 cm cutoff and observed interaction times that are typical for this threshold. The details of the measurement are described in the Methods section. Moreover, we have found that the total exploration time depends on the device used to score the OLM data, although the DI scores do not differ by scoring device. Importantly, we avoid scoring mice with too low exploration times by excluding mice from the study if exploration is less than 2 seconds during training or testing. Mice that showed a preference for either object during training (DI &gt; ± 20) were also excluded. Overall, we have demonstrated rigor and reproducibility using this task and the methods to collect and interpret the data across numerous studies, several labs, adult mice and aging mice, and many different genetic and viral manipulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The CPEB3 ribozyme is an intriguing RNA element that is highly conserved in all mammals, suggesting that it has important functions. The authors developed a very nice anti-sense oligo (ASO) approach to probing the function of the ribozyme by blocking its self-cleavage activity and then observing the molecular and behavioral consequences. The ASOs seem to cause no problems with cultured cells or mice, and therefore the results can reasonably be interpreted as an investigation of the effects of ribozyme activity. I think this is a very important paper in the field, and the strongest evidence to date that ribozymes have important functions in humans and other mammals. The data clearly shows that blocking the ribozyme increases CPEB3 mRNA, CPEB3 protein, the expected downstream products of CPEB3 activity and mouse performance in a memory test. I do have some suggestions for improving the manuscript below, and some important questions to address. The authors should certainly explain all the results of all the controls of the OLM task experiment.</p><p>Suggestions</p><p>Paragraph starting line 565 – This paragraph does not describe the results of the Ctrl-ASO, as far as I can tell. This result seems important. Did the scrambled ASO result in increased DI or not? Inconclusive data, or contradictory data would not preclude publication, but it should be disclosed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have outlined the results of the Ctrl-ASO in the OLM, indicating a notable increase in DI, consistent with previous research. This finding supports the pattern observed in our previous studies (Dong et al., 2022, Keiser et al., 2021, Kwapis et al., 2019, Shu et al., 2018, Kwapis et al., 2018, Vogel-Ciernia et al., 2015), demonstrating a significant increase in DI during the testing session in wild-type mice, compared to the training session.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At Line 362, I feel like this subheading might be too strong given the evidence. There isn't strong evidence that the ribozyme activity increases because of the stimulation. It does appear that the fraction cleaved detected was maximal at 1h in both data sets, which coincides roughly with the max expression (2h for KCl, 1h for Glu). But the subheading as worded suggests causation to me. Could it specifically refer to &quot;correlation&quot; instead, i.e. &quot;ribozyme activity and cpeb3 mRNA expression are correlated post stimulation&quot;? Importantly, the data does not show if the uncleaved fraction is accumulating, or if the cleaved fraction is going away. This latter explanation would be expected if the cleaved RNA is less stable than the uncleaved RNA, and degraded at a faster rate, which would not be surprising. If this were true, the subheading could read &quot;cleaved RNA degradation is accelerated in response to stimulation&quot;, but currently, there is no evidence reported in either direction. If the authors relative Ct values could be used to distinguish between these two possibilities, that would be great. If not, it would be nice if the authors could soften the subheading to be more precise about correlation, and add a discussion of possible ways that the ribozyme could be stimulated, that cleaved RNA could be less stable, and other possible explanations to the Discussion section. Or, if my logic is wrong, please correct me!</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the ribozyme expression is correlated with the rest of the <italic>CPEB3</italic> mRNA and we softened the heading to simply state that the <italic>CPEB3</italic> expression is elevated in response to neuronal stimulation. We provide further evidence for the gene expression induction and co-transcriptional ribozyme self-scission by analyzing a published nuRNA-seq dataset (GSE125068) that mapped new RNA reads post neuronal stimulation. As in our experiments and previously published experiments, the number of reads covering early segments of the gene, including the ribozyme increase 1 hour after administration of kainite to mice. These results are in agreement with our observations in primary neurons stimulated by KCl or glutamate, or in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Paragraph starting Line 392 – I think this first sentence should say &quot;CPEB3 ribozyme activity is correlated with mRNA expression&quot; (which would be a better subheading, above) not &quot;ribozyme expression&quot;? More generally, referring to &quot;ribozyme expression&quot; is a bit problematic, because every mRNA has a ribozyme, so the expression is identical to the mRNA? Maybe &quot;levels of detected ribozyme&quot; would be more accurate, but this would be hard to fit on the figure legends. &quot;Relative [RNA]&quot; could work too.</p><p>Also, I understand the hypothesis that blocking ribozyme cleavage could lead to different isoform abundances, but I don't see how the correlation between mRNA expression and cleavage is important for this hypothesis, which is how the paragraph was motivated. I find the link back to the correlation on line 392 at the beginning of this paragraph confusing, and unnecessary. The experiments could be easily motivated because the ribozyme is in an intron, and ribozyme self-cleavage could reasonably be expected to alter splicing of that intron. Minor suggestion – The evidence on modulated splicing seems a little weak, and the authors could consider moving this data later in the manuscript as &quot;evidence towards mechanism&quot;, but that is up to the authors about how they would prefer to tell their story.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to state both that the ribozyme expression and its activity are correlated with the expression of the mRNA, even though half of the statement is rather obvious. We kept the section in its original place in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Decreased ribozyme levels were detected upon ASO treatment in primary neurons and in the hippocampus. A likely explanation would be that blocked ribozyme would lead to more spliced intron that is then degraded or challenging to detect by qPCR, because it would be in lariat form. Could the authors discuss this? The results show more mRNA, more exon-exon junctions, but less ribozyme. I think some possible explanations should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we do not have a way of detecting the ribozyme inhibition directly in vivo. We agree with the reviewer that the spliced-out intron is likely degraded fast, giving the surprising result that the ribozyme ASO leads to lower overall levels of the ribozyme. We have added a statement describing this model on line 420.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reporting of statistics is a bit hard to follow because there are many multi-way hypothesis tests going on.</p></disp-quote><p>There is little we can do about this since we aim to present the statistics with the experiments.

If not, discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>If the reviewer refers to “activity” as ribozyme activity, i.e. self-scission, that correlation in humans has been suggested based on an association between the episodic memory performance and a SNP in the ribozyme—the faster ribozymes correlate with worse memory in humans. We cite this work in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does fraction cleaved go down after the peak activity because cleaved molecules go down, or because uncleaved molecules accumulate (see above). Discuss these two options and mechanisms for how either of these two things could happen.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 2, the total ribozyme levels go down over time, whereas the uncleaved population is either steady and low (KCl stimulation) or increases slightly (glutamate stimulation). Most of the effect on apparent ribozyme self-scission is due to decrease in total ribozyme levels, as shown in Figure 2B and 2D. The uncleaved ribozymes are low and are in line with what has been observed in the field of self-cleaving ribozymes in vitro over the past 35 years. At this point we do not have a model for how the levels of uncleaved ribozymes might be modulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Compare the effect size of the ASO on OLM task DI compared to other interventions in the literature – is this a big effect or a small effect? It would be good to compare to different classes of intervention, like diet, drugs, gene knockdowns, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a discussion on the effect size of ASO on OLM and compared different ASO and other interventions</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Consider discussing why the ribozyme may have evolved and persisted in mammals, especially when memory is better when the ribozyme is deactivated by the ASOs? It would be nice to at least acknowledge that this leaves open questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose not to go into this discussion. There are many ways to cleave and destroy an RNA. We imagine that an HDV-like ribozyme originating from a retrotransposon (where they are found in many species) might have landed in the intron of the CPEB3 gene in an early mammal, but we do not know why this functional RNA was retained at such high level of sequence conservation and activity. Future studies correlating activity-based induction of the <italic>CPEB3</italic> gene and the ribozyme self-scission in animals where the ribozyme is either much slower or potentially inactive might shed more light on the role of this catalytic RNA in learning and memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The premise of a comparable timescale between transcription and ribozyme activity as the foundation of the whole thesis was based on in vitro measurement of self-scission half-life and a broadly generalized transcription rate (which actually varies significantly between genes). to strengthen the argument, the authors should provide concrete evidence, for example, determine the cleavage efficiency by altering transcription rates in cells. This can be achieved using CPEB3 mingenes with different promoters and/or polII variants.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinetics of transcription of the <italic>CPEB3</italic> gene, as estimated from splicing of its mRNA upon induction, appears roughly to correspond to the speed we cite in the manuscript (Figure 2A and new Figure 6 data). Importantly, we analyzed a dataset of nuRNA-seq performed after administration of kainite to mice (new Figure 2–supplement 1) and find that 1 hr post induction, the reads map to the early segments of the gene, implying the similar kinetics of transcription as discussed in the manuscript and correlating well with the splicing data presented in the manuscript. The nuRNA-seq data show that the ribozyme is synthesized and self-cleaves co-transcriptionally. 6 hrs post-induction all parts of the genes are back to basal levels. Altering transcription rates (and using ribozymes that cleave at different rates) would be an interesting experiment to perform but is out of scope of this work</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The physiological relevance of the proposed mechanism has yet to be demonstrated without ASO interference. For example, does the behavioral paradigm alter the ribozyme activity and intron 3 splicing?</p></disp-quote><p>We tested whether the CPEB3 ribozyme cleavage and splicing of exons 2 and 3 are regulated by behavioral paradigm using the OLM task. We analyzed the CPEB3 ribozyme expression and ribozyme self-scission in the OLM task and found that training induces CPEB3 expression and ribozyme self-scission is high (see new Figure 6 B–E). The tested behavioral paradigm does not appear to alter the ribozyme activity and intron splicing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2B: How were total and uncleaved Ribozymes measured by qRT-PCR? Where are the primers' locations?

The uncleaved ribozyme levels were measured using oligos that amplify a region of the intron that starts 45 nts upstream and ends 238 nts downstream of the ribozyme cleavage site. We added this information to the Table of primers in the manuscript. For all PCR oligos we established independent standard curves and calculated RNA levels independently of other amplicons, as noted in the Methods section and now specified in the Results section as well (Page 15). The measurements were thus appropriate for the calculation of the cleaved ribozyme fractions in the various experiments. The fraction ribozyme cleaved was calculated from the uncleaved fraction as the difference between uncleaved fraction and unity (1 – fraction uncleaved), now specified on page 16 of the manuscript. Fraction uncleaved was calculated as [uncleaved ribozyme]/[total ribozyme], as was done previously (see Salehi-Ashtiani et al. Science 313:1788-1792 or Webb et al.
