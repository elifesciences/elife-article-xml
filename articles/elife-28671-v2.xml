ATP-dependent lipid transporters. Disruption of this asymmetry by ATP-independent phospholipid scrambling is important in cellular signaling, but its mechanism remains incompletely understood. Using MD simulations coupled with experimental assays, we show that the surface hydrophilic transmembrane cavity exposed to the lipid bilayer on the fungal scramblase nhTMEM16 serves as the pathway for both lipid translocation and ion conduction across the membrane. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding stimulates its open conformation by altering the structure of transmembrane helices that line the cavity. We have identified key amino acids necessary for phospholipid scrambling and validated the idea that ions permeate TMEM16 Cl<sup>-</sup> channels via a structurally homologous pathway by showing that

distributed asymmetrically between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane. Dissipation of this asymmetry in response to the elevation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is a ubiquitous signaling mechanism critical for diverse cellular events including blood coagulation, bone mineralization, and cell-cell interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fadok et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fadok et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sahu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bratton and Henson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanyal and Menon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bevers and Williamson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pomorski and Menon, 2016</xref>). Phospholipid scrambling is mediated by phospholipid scramblases, which harvest the energy of the phospholipid gradient to drive the nonspecific and bidirectional transport of phospholipids between leaflets. Proteins responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated lipid scrambling belong to the anoctamin/TMEM16 superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Picollo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2017</xref>). Among the ten mammalian TMEM16 paralogs, TMEM16C, D, F, G, and J have been identified as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated phospholipid scramblases while TMEM16A and TMEM16B are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup><italic>−</italic></sup> channels (CaCCs). The scramblases and ion channels are thought to share a common architecture and mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, but the conduction pathways for ion and lipid transport remain incompletely understood.</p><p>The fungal nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2016</xref>) was recently crystalized and has become an important model for structural and functional investigation of TMEM16s. nhTMEM16 is a homodimer with 10 transmembrane helices in each subunit. The protein exhibits an unusual ~10 Å wide hydrophilic cavity on the surface of each subunit. This subunit cavity is formed by transmembrane (TM) helices TM3-TM7. The helices that border the cavity (TM4 and TM6) are amphipathic, with polar and charged residues facing the cavity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunner et al. (2014)</xref> proposed that the hydrophilic cavity provides a pathway for phospholipid head groups to move between membrane leaflets during scrambling while the fatty acid tails remain in the hydrophobic bilayer. This mechanism is also predicted by molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stansfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>). Because this surface cavity is hydrophilic and involved in transport, we call it the ‘aqueduct’. A highly conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site for two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions is located near the cytoplasmic end of the aqueduct. Equivalent residues are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of both TMEM16 phospholipid scramblases and ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tien et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the structure of the nhTMEM16 aqueduct provides insight into the site of catalysis, the absence of phospholipids in the crystal structure leaves unanswered the question of how both lipids and ions are conducted. Here, we use a combined computational and experimental approach to elucidate mechanisms of phospholipid scrambling and the molecular basis of regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that ions permeate via the same structural path as phospholipids. Furthermore, simulation-guided mutational analysis identifies amino acids crucial for TMEM16 scrambling activity and provides insight into evolutionary relationships of the TMEM16 family members.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lipid bilayer deformation</title><p>Integral membrane proteins contain hydrophobic segments that are in contact with the acyl chains of the lipid bilayer. From an energetic perspective, the length of the lipid-exposed hydrophobic segments would be expected to approximately match the hydrophobic bilayer thickness. However, in nhTMEM16, the aqueduct that faces the membrane bilayer is strongly hydrophilic with polar and charged residues concentrated in the cytoplasmic half of TM4 and the extracellular half of TM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This staggering of the transmembrane protein hydrophobicity causes a distortion in the distribution of bilayer phospholipids due to their tendency to match the hydrophobic surface of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This not only reduces the membrane thickness near the aqueduct but also produces a bend in the bilayer centered on the aqueduct so that the membrane is high on the TM4 side and low on the TM6 side of the aqueduct. To quantify the membrane deformation, the number and distribution of phospholipid phosphorus atoms within 10 Å of the protein that spontaneously penetrate the central core of the membrane were measured during the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). At <italic>t</italic> = 0 the phosphate groups are concentrated in two main peaks corresponding to the inner and the outer leaflets. As the simulation continues, the leaflets become deformed, as indicated by a broader distribution of phosphorous atoms. Because the rate of diffusion of a molecule across the membrane is inversely related to the distance (Fick's Law), membrane thinning will prime lipid translocation by reducing the energy required to move a lipid across the membrane. Membrane bending may also favor non-bilayer phases that facilitate scrambling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28671.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Membrane deformation induced by nhTMEM16.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) nhTMEM16 is shown as a molecular surface (extracellular side up) colored by residue type (blue, basic; red, acidic; green, polar; white, nonpolar) in a phospholipid bilayer composed of POPC and POPS.

At <italic>t</italic> = 0, lipid head groups in the bilayer clustered around z ~ ±18 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). During the simulation, lipid head groups from the inner and outer leaflets were quickly funneled towards the aqueduct entrances through wide vestibules to become concentrated near the aqueduct entrances (z ~ ±12 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As lipids migrated along the aqueduct, a third peak was observed near the center of the membrane (z ~ −3 Å). This site was typically occupied by a single lipid for an extended time (ranging from 350 ns to 900 ns) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). On one occasion, transition of a lipid to the extracellular entrance of the aqueduct from this site was observed after it had dwelled at the central site for ~450 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel, red trace at 600 ns). Concurrently, the head group at the extracellular entrance was knocked away and quickly merged into the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> right panel, cyan trace). As this transition was completed, the lipid following in the queue jumped from the intracellular vestibule to the center of membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> right panel, green trace). While this represents a single observation, it suggests that lipids move along the aqueduct in a highly concerted fashion. Notably, the lipid that translocated from the inner leaflet remained near the extracellular entrance for a few hundred nanoseconds (650 to 945 ns) before eventually diffusing away from the aqueduct and merging into the outer leaflet (not shown) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>, final 2 s). This event represented a full permeation of the lipid from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">2</xref>).

We focused on TM4 and TM5 because we had previously shown that amino acids in this region in TMEM16F are critical for phospholipid scrambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Of the 14 amino acids in TM4 –TM5 that are involved in direct interaction with lipid head groups (filled circles under the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), two amino acids (consensus positions 333 and 378, highlighted in red) were targeted for mutagenesis, since they are similar in nhTMEM16 and TMEM16F but distinctly different in TMEM16A. To improve nhTMEM16 expression, a codon-optimized nhTMEM16 cDNA was synthesized. Although nhTMEM16 tagged on the C-terminus with EGFP did not traffic to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>), nhTMEM16 tagged on the N-terminus with 3X-FLAG or untagged nhTMEM16 did traffic to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Two nhTMEM16 mutants were generated by mutating T333 and N378 to the amino acids corresponding to mouse TMEM16A (T333V and N378K). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was elevated by whole-cell patch clamping with an intracellular solution containing 200 µM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Phospholipid scrambling was assessed by imaging the accumulation of the phosphatidylserine probe Annexin-V-AlexaFluor-568 on the cell surface. Most cells expressing WT nhTMEM16 had scrambled by 15 min after elevating cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> by establishing whole cell recording. This slow time course of scrambling is similar to that previously described for TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). It is explained partly by the sensitivity of the Annexin-V binding assay, but apparently also involves a regulatory step we do not understand. No scrambling was observed with WT nhTMEM16 expressing cells patch clamped with zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the same time period. This result differs from that reported for purified fungal TMEM16 proteins reconstituted in liposomes that show substantial scramblase activity in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>). Less than 20% of untransfected cells scramble under similar conditions, as we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2015</xref>).

This supports the conclusion that these residues are important in the scrambling mechanism. In addition to these residues in TM4 and TM5, we also mutated R505 in TM7 because its charge could potentially interact differently with charged and uncharged phospholipids.

We therefore asked whether TMEM16A could be converted to a scramblase by mutating V543 to the homologous scramblase amino acids (T in nhTMEM16 or S in TMEM16F). Fewer than 20% of the WT TMEM16A-expressing cells exhibited scramblase activity within 15 min of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>), but cells expressing TMEM16A mutants V543T or V543S exhibited robust phospholipid scrambling in the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that this amino acid plays a key role in conducting lipids across the bilayer. Replacing TMEM16A K588 with the corresponding nhTMEM16 amino acid N (K588N) also induced robust phospholipid scrambling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, replacing K588 with the corresponding TMEM16F amino acid Q did not induce scrambling. One possible explanation is that the side chain of N is considerably shorter (3.7 Å) than Q (4.9 Å) or K (6.2 Å). Q and K side chains may be long enough to interact with nearby amino acids to stabilize the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel conformation of TMEM16A, while N may favor a scramblase conformation because it cannot make these interactions. The ability to convert TMEM16A into a phospholipid scramblase by point mutations in each of two major amino acids identified as interacting with translocating lipids in the MD simulation supports the validity of the MD model. Additionally, this result provides support for the idea that the TMEM16 Cl<sup><italic>−</italic></sup> channels and scramblases are structurally and functionally very similar.</p><p>In addition to conferring scramblase activity on TMEM16A, the V543S mutation also changed the ionic selectivity of TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Immediately after initiating whole-cell recording, TMEM16A V543S currents were strongly Cl<sup>-</sup> selective, because switching from extracellular 150 mM CsCl to 10 mM CsCl caused a +45 mV shift of E<sub>rev</sub> corresponding to P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> = 9.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). With time, the reversal potential changed as phospholipid scrambling developed. The ionic current became weakly cation-selective as evidenced by a −17 mV negative shift in E<sub>rev</sub> upon switching from 150 mM CsCl to 10 mM CsCl. This corresponds to a 21-fold decrease in anion selectivity (P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> = 0.45) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, the V543S mutant of TMEM16A appears to function initially as a Cl<sup>-</sup> channel and then becomes less selective as scrambling is activated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The aqueduct also conducts ions in simulations</title><p>To explore the relationship between ionic currents and phospholipid scrambling, we performed additional MD simulations under conditions where various voltages were applied across the membrane (−150 mV, −250 mV, and −500 mV).

Further, Na<sup>+</sup> permeation from the extracellular side to the intracellular side of the membrane was observed to occur through the aqueduct. At −150 mV and −250 mV, Na<sup>+</sup> permeation events occurred in both subunits during the 700 ns simulations. The average coordination number of permeant Na<sup>+</sup> ions during the course of ion translocation was 5.70 ± 0.51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Coordination is supplied mainly by oxygen atoms from water molecules (83.4%). The remainder was split between protein (62.5%) and lipid (37.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

This movement is dramatic: Q468 moves ~15 Å relative to TM7 and TM8 which remain relatively constant. This movement probably comes about as a result of electrostatic changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is removed. In the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liganded conformation, two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are coordinated by E452 in TM6, D503 and E506 in TM7, and E535 and D539 in TM8.

Unlike ion channels that transport small, spherical hydrophilic substrates, scramblases must provide a conduction mechanism that accommodates both hydrophilic head groups and extended hydrophobic tails of phospholipids at the same time. Because it is energetically costly to move the polar head group through the hydrophobic core of the membrane, scramblases must segregate the polar and non-polar regions of the amphipathic phospholipid during transport.</p><p>Even before a lipid scramblase was identified, various mechanisms were proposed for the trans-bilayer movement of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bevers and Williamson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pomorski and Menon, 2016</xref>). One model proposed that transmembrane proteins alter lipid packing in a way that enhances the chance for a lipid to transverse the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kol et al., 2004</xref>). It was suggested that dynamic protein movements induced transient defects in the lipid-protein interface that favored lipids moving between leaflets. In the case of nhTMEM16, the protein clearly disrupts and thins the structure of the bilayer to lower the energy for lipids to translocate between leaflets, but this is more obviously related to hydrophobic mismatch between the transmembrane helices and the bilayer rather than to protein dynamics. Other models have suggested that scrambling could be facilitated by amphiphilic transmembrane helices on the protein surface that provide a hydrophilic surface for the passage of lipid polar head groups sequestered from the unfavorable hydrophobic environment while the lipid tails remain in the hydrophobic phase of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>). This appealing mechanism is strongly supported by the structure of nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>) and one of the main findings of the present study. This model of scrambling shares certain similarities with the proposed mechanism for ATP-dependent flippases. For example, transport of lipid-linked oligosaccharides by the ABC lipid flippase PglK involves interaction of the oligosaccharide moiety with positively charged side chains in a cavity in the protein while the lipidic polyprenyl tail remain exposed to the lipid bilayer during transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perez et al., 2015</xref>).

When charged and hydrophilic residues of the aqueduct are neutralized computationally, they find that the energetic cost of deformation is reduced. However, the reduction is only ~20% (from ~60 to ~48 kcal/mol), suggesting that the deformation requires other parts of the protein in addition to the aqueduct.</p><p>We have concluded that there are three potential binding sites for lipid head groups in the aqueduct and have identified amino acids that interact closely with permeant phospholipid. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe (2016)</xref> identified two sites. One site corresponds to our S<sub>ext</sub> site and the two amino acids they identify (E313 and R432) are also ones that we find are major interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), interacting with lipid head groups for 32.8% and 26.1% of the total simulation time. Their cytoplasmic site, comprised of E352 and K353, is located in the wide cytoplasmic vestibule of the aqueduct at the level of lipid head groups in the inner leaflet. In our simulations, these two residues also interact strongly with lipid head groups (31.8% and 95.8% of the simulation time). In contrast, our sites S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub> are closer to the center of the membrane. The difference between our sites and those of Bethel and Grabe may be explained if these sites are low-affinity, low-selectivity waystations rather than binding sites in the sense of an enzymatic active site. Bethel and Grabe comment that their cytoplasmic (S<sub>C</sub>) site is not an obligate stepping stone for lipids during the scrambling process because some lipids do not visit this site. The S<sub>C</sub> site is located at the very wide cytoplasmic end of the aqueduct, where lipid-protein interactions may be less constrained. Furthermore, the interaction of lipids with the protein may depend on the lipid composition: we performed simulations in a mixture of POPC and POPS, whereas their simulations were performed in pure POPC. The amino acids T333 (TM4) and Y439 (TM6) that we identify in the gate are ones that Bethel and Grabe find form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate group of permeating lipids. We also see evidence of the dipole stacks of phospholipids noted by Bethel and Grabe, but possibly because our simulations included POPS, which do not form dipole-dipole interactions, the dipole stacks are transient. Analysis of the lipid P-N dipole orientation shows that the head group dipoles are organized inside the aqueduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>): the phosphate groups precede the choline (POPC) or amino (POPS) groups in the lower half of the aqueduct (up to 4 Å) with obtuse angles respect to z axis; transition of obtuse angles to right angle was observed at ~5 Å; when the phosphate groups move above 12 Å along the aqueduct, the angles become acute and the phosphate groups thus succeed the choline or amino groups.</p><p>In an aggregate of ~3 µsec of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated simulation, we have observed one complete scrambling event in the absence of voltage and four in the presence of voltage. In comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe (2016)</xref> observed four complete transitions in 4 µsec. Both of these simulations appear to be more than an order of magnitude greater than the 10<sup>4</sup> lipids/sec measured experimentally for the purified fungal afTMEM16 reconstituted into liposomes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>. The difference might be explained by the stochastic nature of individual events or by the fact that the simulations begin with a protein that is initially in an activated state that bypasses other processes that lead up to the active state in a real protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Our model</title><p>Based on all the published data, we propose the following hypothesis for phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). While the data are derived from studies exclusively on nhTMEM16, we expect that the principles apply to other TMEM16 scramblases. First, the structure of the nhTMEM16 protein introduces a bend and a thinning of the lipid bilayer to reduce the energy barrier for hydrophilic head groups to move across the membrane. Intriguingly, our analysis demonstrated that, as the simulation extended, adjacent lipids underwent significant reorientation from a simple bilayer to form a non-bilayer structure that would favor scrambling. Second, the aqueduct itself provides a hydrophilic environment for head groups to translocate between leaflets while the hydrophobic acyl chains are stabilized by interactions with hydrophobic amino acids on the lips of the aqueduct as well as acyl chains of phospholipids in the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer. Phospholipids moving through the aqueduct may be organized by virtue of interactions between head groups, but this organization may depend strongly on the species of lipid present. Third, while phospholipids do not bind strongly to specific amino acids in the aqueduct, they do cluster around specific locations that may be waystations for lipid translocation. Different phospholipids may interact with different sites depending on their charge and dimensions. One site associated with both POPC and POPS is located right above the constriction in the aqueduct. This site was identified both by us and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethel and Grabe (2016)</xref>. We propose that this constriction plays a key role in gating scrambling by Ca<sup>2+</sup> because this region (especially TM4) undergoes significant conformational changes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. In addition, the lipid head group dipole also change its orientation in this area. The key role of T333 in gating phospholipid scrambling is supported by the T333V mutation, which greatly reduces scrambling, presumably by increasing the hydrophobicity in the gate region. This conclusion is also supported by our observation that the hydration of the aqueduct is significantly reduced in the vicinity of the constriction of the aqueduct. In the open conformation in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, water molecules in the gate region fill up the narrowest and deepest parts of the aqueduct and provide a water-filled pathway for spontaneous diffusion of lipid head groups. This model may help explain recent observations that the fungal TMEM16 reconstituted in lipid vesicles can scramble lipids with head groups as large as ~40 Å in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi, 2016</xref>). With voltage, we observe a 3–4 Å dilation of the aqueduct which implies that the aqueduct is flexible. Clearly, our model is a first approximation and will require future simulations and experiments. In particular, simulations with more physiological lipid head group compositions and lipid tail lengths and physiological voltages are needed to fully understand the behavior of nhTMEM16 in complex bilayers. However, the model makes a number of predictions about amino acids implicated in channel gating, lipid permeation, and ion transport that can be tested experimentally.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28671.032</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>A model for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated lipid scrambling.</title><p>Top panels: view from the membrane.

Although TMEM16A and TMEM16B are clearly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), the physiological functions of other members of the TMEM16 family have been dubious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duran and Hartzell, 2011</xref>). For example, although TMEM16F certainly is a phospholipid scramblase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>), it has also been reported to be a non-selective cation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adomaviciene et al., 2013</xref>) and various types of Cl<sup>-</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almaça et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szteyn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grubb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimizu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juul et al., 2014</xref>). The crystal structure of nhTMEM16 does not reveal an obvious alternative pathway for ion permeation through the bilayer other than the path taken by phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartzell and Whitlock, 2016</xref>) and we have proposed that the ion conductance of TMEM16F represents a leak of ions through the aqueduct that occurs during lipid scrambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). This conclusion is based on the observation that the ionic current is relatively ion non-selective and is activated in parallel with scrambling. Initially, one stumbling block to this conclusion was the observation that the purified nhTMEM16 scramblase did not exhibit an ionic conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>), but recently it was found that nhTMEM16 does conduct ions under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Like the afTMEM16 fungal scramblase, the ion channel activity of nhTMEM16 is labile and depends on the composition of the lipids in which it is reconstituted. We show here that nhTMEM16 expressed in HEK cells develops weakly selective cation currents in parallel with phospholipid scrambling. The MD simulations also predict that nhTMEM16 is weakly cation-selective. Although simulations at intermediate voltages captured only Na<sup>+</sup> ion permeation, Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation was observed when high voltage was applied. In the simulations, ion conduction through the aqueous pore formed between the protein and the lipid head groups developed in parallel with phospholipid transport and became more robust as lipids became more tightly packed and organized in the aqueduct as scrambling proceeded. In this flexible pore structure, lipids play a structural role by lining the hydrophilic ion conduction pathway with their head groups. The simulation also shows that the conduction pathway is at least partly hydrated and that permeant ions are coordinated by water molecules a majority of their transit time across the membrane. These data support the hypothesis that ion transport by scramblases is a leak current associated with lipid transport. Because scrambling occurs in the absence of any ionic electrochemical driving force both in our simulations and our experiments, it seems unlikely that ion flux is necessary for phospholipid scrambling. However, the cotransport of ions along with lipids could likely modulate the lipid transport process or play some parallel physiological function.</p><p>It is likely that ion conduction by the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel TMEM16A occurs via a similar pathway to the one that conducts lipids in the TMEM16 scramblases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartzell and Whitlock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, a low-resolution cryo-EM structure of the TMEM16A Cl<sup>-</sup> channel was solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paulino et al., 2017</xref>) which showed that the TMEM16A ion-conducting pore, instead of being an open aqueduct as in nhTMEM16, is enclosed by protein along ~2/3 of its length due to a structural rearrangement that brings TM4 and TM6 closer together to enclose the pore. Otherwise the structures of TMEM16A and nhTMEM16 are very similar. The similarity in structure between TMEM16 scramblases and channels is reinforced by our finding that we can convert TMEM16A into a scramblase by the V543S (or V543T) or the K588N mutations. However, it is not obvious from the cryo-EM structure of TMEM16A how these mutations produce their effects. V543 is located near the extracellular end of TM4 and it is possible that the V543S/T mutation would ‘split open’ the enclosed pore of TMEM16A to convert it to an aqueduct by shifting the position of TM4. While highly speculative, this idea may not be as untenable as it might first seem. It is unclear whether the TMEM16A cryo-EM structure is an open, ion-conducting conformation; the pore is not large enough to accommodate permeant ions except possibly Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fisher and Hartzell, 2017</xref>). It seems likely that the new structure represents the inactivated state that TMEM16A is known to enter in the presence of high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations used to purify the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). In order for the channel to conduct ions as large as I<sup>-</sup> or SCN<sup>-</sup>, the pore would need to dilate by at least a few Å. The V543S/T mutation might destabilize the interactions between TM4 and TM6 to open the pore to create an aqueduct. Testing this speculation will require additional simulations with a higher resolution TMEM16A structure.</p><p>The change in ionic selectivity of the V543S/T mutant from Cl<sup>-</sup>-selective to non-selective as scrambling develops is challenging to explain mechanistically. Before scrambling develops, the TMEM16A V543S mutant behaves like a WT TMEM16A Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, but as scrambling develops, the channel progressively becomes less Cl<sup>-</sup> selective. This observation suggests that there is a slow conformational change in the protein that is associated with scrambling and the non-selective current. We suggest that the appearance of this non-selective current is caused by a slow conversion of the closed pore of TMEM16A into an open aqueduct. However, another possibility is that the Cl<sup>-</sup> current and the non-selective current utilize physically different conductance pathways. Experiments are underway to test these alternatives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of membrane-embedded scramblase</title><p>The X-ray crystallographic structure of fungal nhTMEM16 (4WIT) at 3.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>) was used as the starting structure for simulation.

Relative permeabilities of cations relative to Cl<sup><italic>−</italic></sup> were determined by measuring the changes in zero-current E<sub>rev</sub> using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation when the concentration of extracellular ions was changed (‘dilution potential’ method) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2012</xref>)<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>25.7</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is permeability, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the extracellular cation concentration and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the intracellular cation concentration and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the difference between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> with the test solution <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and that observed with symmetrical solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>HEK-293 cells transiently expressing 3X-FLAG-nhTMEM16 were plated on glass coverslips, fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 1.5% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for two hours at room temperature.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Nir Ben-Tal (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Raimund Dutzler (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Based on our discussion of your manuscript we agree that the study provides an interesting molecular perspective of the mechanisms of lipid and ion transport in the TMEM16 family. While there have been both experimental and simulation studies performed on this system before, the combined approach is a strong point of the work. The manuscript provides a detailed and stimulating view on different aspects of the function and regulation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated lipid scramblase. In general, we feel that it captured the essence of how a lipid scramblase catalyzes the bidirectional diffusion of lipids between both leaflets of the bilayer. Other proposals made in the manuscript, such as the activation of the protein by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the permeation of ions and the conversion of the channel TMEM16A into a scramblase by point mutations are at this stage speculative, but they put forward testable hypotheses that will stimulate further studies. However, there are also a number of potential pitfalls both with simulations and experiments (not to mention models) that we feel should be addressed better.</p><p>We do not think that new simulations or experiments are necessary, but the reviewers and editors would like to see a much more critical distinction between solid and speculative aspects taking potential ambiguities in the results into account, as well as addressing the issues below e.g. with new analysis of existing data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General:</p><p>The manuscript is rather long and a bit tedious to read. Please edit to make more concise so it is easier to read for non nhTMEM16 scramblase fascinados.</p><p>The results on point mutants of TMEM16A that confer scrambling activity to the protein and that changes the apparent selectivity of currents over time from anion selective to non-selective is puzzling, particularly in light of a recent structural investigation that showed a different organization of the ion conduction path compared to scramblases. Please address this in the Discussion.</p><p>The region the authors refer to as aqueduct is equivalent to the region that in the manuscript describing the structure was termed 'subunit cavity'. Please clarify in the manuscript.</p><p>MD simulations:</p><p>Some of the MD simulations rely on very limited data (sometimes only single events) from statistical mechanics, and as the authors cite this system has previously been studied with simulations by other groups. The authors should clearly stress where they agree with previous simulations, what results are new/different, and analyze/comment on the statistical certainty of new results. In light of the high complexity of the system and the extended length of trajectories, it would also be interesting for the reader to know more about the convergence of the system during the simulation and the structural relationships between the observed conformations in the simulated systems compared to the initial crystal structure. This might be particularly relevant for simulations with applied external potential.</p><p>When combined with experimental data, an obvious critical test is to perform additional simulations that include the mutations identified to switch the activity on/off, and show that they have the expected effects. Although we do not require the authors to perform such additional studies, it would be valuable to outline specific predictions about other experimental/simulation results that are expected if this model is correct. Is it possible to confirm other data (such as ion conductance) with experimental results, e.g., by extrapolating the applied voltages to physiologically relevant potentials?</p><p>Although it is common to use higher potentials in simulations, the authors should justify their choice of going up to 500mV, explain to the reader that it is significantly higher than physiological potentials. Are there other potential problems than distortion of the structure?</p><p>The flipping rates observed in the simulations appear to be orders of magnitude higher than the experiments by Malvezzi et al. [Nat Commun 4, 2367] that suggests rates of ~10,000 lipids per minute. This casts some doubt on the qualitative accuracy of simulations; The authors should explain or acknowledge this discrepancy. Are there other features where the simulations are in better quantitative agreement with experimental kinetics?</p><p>Although phospholipids are the most important substrates, there are indications e.g. ceramides (without the phosphate group) can be flipped by these proteins [Suzuki et al., J Biol Chem 288, 13305]. Given that the model reported here appears to rely heavily on electrostatic interactions, how would it explain the activity for these other types of lipids?</p><p>One of the main arguments of the work is that the ion conductance pathway should be identical to the scramblase pathway. However, at least for TMEM16A there is now a recent (low-resolution) structure available [Paulino, <italic>eLife</italic> 2017;6:e26232] where the structure is found to be rearranged compared to nhTMEM16, which creates a mostly occluded ion permeation pathway. There is no question the authors' V543S mutant is interesting, but given the complex interplay with changes in ion selectivity after phospholipid scrambling is initiated, would this not rather suggest potential structural transitions that open/close the ion pore vs. creating the surface necessary for scrambling? Obviously, this structure was not available when the authors performed their work, but even with limited resolution it appears to be in partial conflict with the present statement that there is no difference in ion permeation pathways from that taken by phospholipids. For the readers' sake, the model should be compared to these results and the differences discussed.</p><p>What is the connection between the absence of bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the conformational change closing the lipid pathway?</p><p>Why did the authors observe permeation of Na<sup>+</sup> but not Cl<sup>-</sup> ions? This is in conflict with the poor current selectivity observed in experiment.</p><p>Cellular assays:</p><p>It would be interesting to learn more about the technical limitations of the cellular assay used in this study. The authors apply Ca<sup>2+</sup> present in their patch pipette to the cytoplasm after establishing a whole-cell patch. It is expected that the equilibration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration with cytosol would proceed within a minute. The cellular response indicating lipid scrambling was obtained after 6 minutes and the measurement lasted 14 minutes. It would be interesting to learn more about any non-specific cellular response to high (200 µM) Ca<sup>2+</sup> from mock-transfected cells. How long would it take before cellular artifacts become apparent and how would these look like with respect to AnnexinV-binding and patch-clamp experiments.</p><p>The accumulation of phosphatidyl-serine on the outside of the plasma membrane, which is a prerequisite for the detection by AnnexinV, takes time, but what is the underlying cause for the delay in the activation of currents? The anticipation is instantaneous activation of the scramblase, and currents.</p><p>Have the authors considered an increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores instead of a patch pipette? If so, did these experiments show a similar result with respect to scrambling?</p><p>Why was the codon optimized, N-terminally-tagged construct of nhTMEM16 used for experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> not used for experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>?</p><p>In vitro assays have previously indicated a basal activity of nhTMEM16 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Do the authors have evidence for such activity in their assays?</p><p>The results describing the behavior of TMEM16A mutants are puzzling. Why do 20% of cells expressing WT show scrambling? What is the evidence that the currents measured from cells transfected with the TMEM16A mutant V543S after 15 min are still mediated by this protein? How would WT currents measured under the same conditions look like?</p><p>Why does the mutant K588N but not K588Q confer scrambling activity to TMEM16A given that, according to a recent structure at low resolution, the residue might not be exposed to the membrane?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28671.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General:</p><p>The manuscript is rather long and a bit tedious to read.

For the single events (lipid scrambling under equilibrium condition, and ion conduction under low transmembrane potentials) observed in the MD simulations, multiple occurrences were captured after transmembrane potential was added (for lipid scrambling) or increased (for ion conduction). Those repeated events were analyzed statistically, in addition to the individual analysis of the single events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We have also added a section in Discussion entitled “Comparison to previous studies” comparing our results to those of other groups.

Is it possible to confirm other data (such as ion conductance) with experimental results, e.g., by extrapolating the applied voltages to physiologically relevant potentials?</p></disp-quote><p>While we have not explicitly proposed predictions of our models, we hope that the re-writing of the manuscript has addressed these concerns. (Please also see answer to “General Question” 2, above.)</p><p>Currently, there are no experimental data for ion conductance in nhTMEM16. The ion conductance for afTMEM16 is ~300 pS (Malvezzi et al. (2013)). Based on the simulation performed under -500 mV membrane potential, the ion conductance (24 conduction events) over the whole trajectory (700ns) is ~11 pS, and ~32 pS for the dilated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, we performed a 90-ns simulation at -1V, in which 38 Na<sup>+</sup> influx and 8 Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux were captured. Based on this short simulation, the ion conductance is ~82 pS over the whole trajectory, and ~235 pS during the highly conductive phase (t=60-90 ns, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although it is common to use higher potentials in simulations, the authors should justify their choice of going up to 500mV, explain to the reader that it is significantly higher than physiological potentials. Are there other potential problems than distortion of the structure?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed:</p><p>“These large non-physiological voltages were used to increase the frequency of permeation events during the 700 ns simulations by increasing the driving force for ion flux. […] At -150 mV and -250 mV, the TM4-TM6 COM distances are very similar to those in the crystal structure and simulation at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>); the average COM distances in simulation at -500 mV is slightly larger, due to the transient dilation phase; the “normal state”, which takes the major length of the simulation, is very similar to that in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>(A)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The flipping rates observed in the simulations appear to be orders of magnitude higher than the experiments by Malvezzi et al. [Nat Commun 4, 2367] that suggests rates of ~10,000 lipids per minute. This casts some doubt on the qualitative accuracy of simulations; The authors should explain or acknowledge this discrepancy. Are there other features where the simulations are in better quantitative agreement with experimental kinetics?</p></disp-quote><p>Paragraph added to Discussion:</p><p>“In an aggregate of ~3 µsec of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated simulation, we have observed 1 complete scrambling event in the absence of voltage and 4 in the presence of voltage. […] The difference might be explained by the stochastic nature of individual events or by the fact that the simulations begin with a protein that is initially in an activated state that bypasses other processes that lead up to the active state in a real protein.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although phospholipids are the most important substrates, there are indications e.g. ceramides (without the phosphate group) can be flipped by these proteins [Suzuki et al., J Biol Chem 288, 13305]. Given that the model reported here appears to rely heavily on electrostatic interactions, how would it explain the activity for these other types of lipids?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer may have misunderstood our model. The confusion may have originated from our use of the phosphate group for the analysis and for the figures when trying to describe the motion of the lipids. Our model does not depend heavily on what is described in the comment as electrostatic interactions (net charges). Indeed, most of the residues that interact with permeant POPC head groups are not charged. In the case of POPS, however, there is more interaction with basic amino acids. We have added a section in the Discussion that clearly outlines the essential features of our model. Any polar groups, such as hydroxyl and amino groups present in ceramides, can use the aqueduct to permeate.</p><p><bold>“</bold>Our model. Based on all the published data, we propose the following hypothesis for phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16 proteins. […] Different phospholipids may interact with different sites depending on their charge and dimensions.<bold>”</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• One of the main arguments of the work is that the ion conductance pathway should be identical to the scramblase pathway. However, at least for TMEM16A there is now a recent (low-resolution) structure available [Paulino, eLife 2017;6:e26232] where the structure is found to be rearranged compared to nhTMEM16, which creates a mostly occluded ion permeation pathway. There is no question the authors' V543S mutant is interesting, but given the complex interplay with changes in ion selectivity after phospholipid scrambling is initiated, would this not rather suggest potential structural transitions that open/close the ion pore vs. creating the surface necessary for scrambling? Obviously, this structure was not available when the authors performed their work, but even with limited resolution it appears to be in partial conflict with the present statement that there is no difference in ion permeation pathways from that taken by phospholipids. For the readers' sake, the model should be compared to these results and the differences discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>A section has been added to Discussion addressing these issues (subsection “Mechanisms of Ion Transport”, last two paragraphs).

However, we do not think that this is the “gate”. Rather, a smaller conformational change in the outer region of TM4 near T333 pinches the aqueduct closed. We have expanded our analysis of the conformational changes associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and have added a discussion of these findings in the section &quot;Our model&quot; in Discussion.</p><p>“The mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating of the channel was explored by computing the RMSD values for each residue in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free states by least squares fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9(A</xref>)). […] If this region is indeed the gate, the observation that the gate is closed less than 50% of the time in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free state is consistent with reports that the purified fungal nhTMEM16s exhibit significant scrambling in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.”</p><p>“We propose that this constriction plays a key role in gating scrambling by Ca<sup>2+</sup> because this region (especially TM4) undergoes significant conformational changes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding.

This is in conflict with the poor current selectivity observed in experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We find nhTMEM16 is weakly cation-selective (P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> &gt;2), so it is not surprising that we see more Na<sup>+</sup> than Cl<sup>-</sup>.

The authors apply Ca<sup>2+</sup> present in their patch pipette to the cytoplasm after establishing a whole-cell patch. It is expected that the equilibration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration with cytosol would proceed within a minute. The cellular response indicating lipid scrambling was obtained after 6 minutes and the measurement lasted 14 minutes. It would be interesting to learn more about any non-specific cellular response to high (200 µM) Ca<sup>2+</sup> from mock-transfected cells. How long would it take before cellular artifacts become apparent and how would these look like with respect to AnnexinV-binding and patch-clamp experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The limitations of the assay have been discussed to some degree previously in Yu et al., 2015. The reason for the lag is puzzling, but a consistent feature that is discussed in our response to the next question. We do not see scrambling or currents activated in untransfected cells and this has also been shown previously in Yu et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The accumulation of phosphatidyl-serine on the outside of the plasma membrane, which is a prerequisite for the detection by AnnexinV, takes time, but what is the underlying cause for the delay in the activation of currents? The anticipation is instantaneous activation of the scramblase, and currents.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a consistent observation and was also reported in our paper on TMEM16F (Yu et al. <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015). TMEM16F currents are activated very quickly in excised patches (Yang et al., 2012) and we have confirmed this. However, in whole cell recording the currents and scrambling activate slowly even though global Ca<sup>2+</sup> equilibrates quickly. Under similar conditions, TMEM16A activates almost instantly, yet TMEM16F takes minutes to activate. We believe that there is an endogenous inhibitor that must be removed for the current – and scrambling – activate. We are working on this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors considered an increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores instead of a patch pipette? If so, did these experiments show a similar result with respect to scrambling?</p></disp-quote><p>We find that scrambling induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the patch pipet is more reproducible than elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by ionomycin. However, initial experiments were performed on cell monolayers expressing the V543S/T mutations stimulated with ionomycin and similar results were obtained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why was the codon optimized, N-terminally-tagged construct of nhTMEM16 used for experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> not used for experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>?</p></disp-quote><p>The same construct was used in all experiments.

Do the authors have evidence for such activity in their assays?</p></disp-quote><p>In the cellular assays, ATP-dependent flippases and floppases would presumably oppose and cancel out any slow scrambling. In any case, we have not studied this experimentally. In the simulations, we comment in several places that our data may be consistent with a certain level of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent scrambling:</p><p>“On average only 1.8 lipids were present in the aqueduct in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free state compared to 3.3 the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). […] The observation that some lipids are located in the aqueduct even in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformation may be consistent with the observation that nhTMEM16 and afTMEM16 reconstituted into liposomes exhibit significant phospholipid scrambling in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Malvezzi et al., 2013; Brunner et al., 2014).”</p><p>“This close contact between residues in the outer portions of TM4 and TM6 in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformation would be expected to sterically prevent lipids from penetrating into the aqueduct.

Why do 20% of cells expressing WT show scrambling?

How would WT currents measured under the same conditions look like?</p></disp-quote><p>The 20% scrambling of ANO1-expressing cells is a consistent observation. We do not know the explanation for this, but it may be related to endogenous scramblases (both TMEM16 and XKR8 -mediated). We have previously published (Yu et al. 2015) that there is neither scrambling nor currents develop in untransfected cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why does the mutant K588N but not K588Q confer scrambling activity to TMEM16A given that, according to a recent structure at low resolution, the residue might not be exposed to the membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know, but one possible explanation is that the sidechain of N is considerably shorter (3.7 Å) than Q (4.9 Å) or K (6.2 Å). While K and Q might be capable of interacting with other residues (for example E555 in TM4) to stabilize a pore-like structure, N might be incapable of this because of its smaller size. A statement has been added:</p><p>“One possible explanation is that the side chain of N is considerably shorter (3.7 Å) than Q (4.9 Å) or K (6.2 Å).
