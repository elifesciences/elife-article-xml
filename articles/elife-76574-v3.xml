evolutionarily conserved sensory process required for the survival of living organisms. Previous studies have revealed much about the neural circuits and sensory molecules in mechanical nociception, but the cellular mechanisms adopted by nociceptors in force detection remain elusive. To address this issue, we study the mechanosensation of a fly larval nociceptor (class IV da neurons, c4da) using a customized mechanical device. We find that c4da are sensitive to mN-scale forces and make uniform responses to the forces applied at different dendritic regions. Moreover, c4da showed a greater sensitivity to localized forces, consistent with them being able to detect the poking of sharp objects, such as wasp ovipositor. Further analysis reveals that high morphological complexity, mechanosensitivity to lateral tension and possibly also active signal propagation in dendrites contribute to the sensory features of c4da. In particular, we discover that Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26, two key mechanosensory molecules, make differential but additive contributions to the mechanosensitivity of c4da. In all, our results provide updates into understanding how c4da process mechanical signals at the cellular level and reveal the contributions of key molecules.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Being able to sense harm is essential for survival. Animals have to be able to tell the difference between a gentle touch and a dangerous pressure. They do this using nerve cells called mechanical nociceptors which switch on when the body feels a potentially painful pressure, such as a sharp object poking the skin. Once activated, the nerves send outputs to other parts of the central nervous system which coordinate the motions needed to escape the source of the pain.</p><p>One popular model to understand harm-sensing is the larvae of fruit flies which automatically roll back and forth when they sense the pointy sting of a wasp. This process is initiated by sensory nerve cells called class IV dendritic arborization neurons (or c4da for short) which sit under the fly’s skin. However, it is still not fully understood how these mechanical nociceptors detect the poking forces of the wasp’s tail.</p><p>To investigate, Liu, Wu et al. built a device that could poke sections of fly larvae under a microscope so they could see how different types of pressure affected the activity and shape of c4da cells. This revealed that c4da nerves were most sensitive to sharp objects that illicit a more localized force, which may explain why these cells are so good at responding to wasp attacks.</p><p>Further analysis showed that this sensitivity was due to the high number of branches, or dendrites, protruding from the body of c4da nerves. Liu, Wu et al. discovered that the dendrites were coated in a touch-sensitive protein that can sense and amplify both squashing and pulling, resulting in a signal that activates c4da nerves to send outputs to other parts of the central nervous system. This mechanism increases the likelihood that a c4da cell will detect a mechanical pressure even if it is far away from the body of the nerve.</p><p>These findings shed light on how sensory cells like c4da are optimized to carry out specific roles. This could be important for understanding other nerve systems which sense mechanical pressure, such as those involved in touch or auditory processes. However, further work is needed to see whether the molecules and mechanism identified by Liu, Wu et al. are also present in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nociception</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>dendritic morphology</kwd><kwd>Ppk1/Ppk26</kwd><kwd>piezo</kwd><kwd>Ca-α1D</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31922018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fly larval mechanical nociceptor develops dedicated neuronal mechanisms to support its sensory preference in detecting localized poking forces, and this sensory feature well supports the physiological function of the nociceptor in sensing the physical attack of its natural enemy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanosensation is a physiological process that transduces mechanical stimuli into neural signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chalfie, 2009</xref>). It underlies the perception of gentle touch, sound, acceleration and noxious force. To cope with manifold environmental forces, mechanoreceptor cells are diversified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lumpkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>). Among different types of mechanoreceptor cells, those activated by noxious forces, that is mechanical nociceptors, are of particular importance because they are one of the sensory organs that are essential for the survival of living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lumpkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tracey, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Much effort has been made to understand mechanical nociception in several model organisms. In mammals, free nerve endings of nociceptive neurons penetrate the keratinocyte layer of skin and serve as the primary nociceptors. The axons of these neurons output to neural circuits in the spinal cord, which then transmit pain signals to local interneurons or up to the brain to initiate neural reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tracey, 2017</xref>). At the molecular level, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, Piezo and other channels are found to be involved in mechanical nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tracey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>). In invertebrates (such as worms and flies), mechanical nociception has also been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tracey, 2017</xref>). A widely used model is fly larval mechanical nociception mediated by class IV dendritic arborization neurons (c4da). C4da are polymodal nociceptors that can be activated by light, thermal and mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terada et al., 2016</xref>). The axon of c4da synapses to several targets in the ventral nerve cord, which then output signals to trigger the rolling behavior, a stereotyped locomotion in escaping from nociceptive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grueber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gerhard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burgos et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, two parallel molecular pathways in c4da, one mediated by Ppk1/Ppk26 and the other by Piezo, are proposed to be responsible for the behavioral responses in mechanical but not thermal nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorczyca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An intriguing question is whether c4da neurons are optimized at the cellular level for its function as mechanical nociceptor? A recent study shows that the nociceptive response of c4da to thermal stimuli depends on the dendritic calcium influx through two TRPA channels and the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, suggesting the presence of neuronal processing of heat-induced responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terada et al., 2016</xref>). In a more general sense, it is also intriguing how mechanoreceptor cells are optimized for their specific stimuli. An interesting study reports unique neuronal mechanisms in the mechanosensory neurons in tactile-foraging birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>), also demonstrating the presence of cellular mechanisms that facilitate the response to specific stimuli. So far, how c4da process mechanical inputs in nociception at the neuronal level remains unclear.</p><p>To address this issue, we build a ‘mechanical-optical’ recording system that is able to measure the in vivo sensory response of c4da to controlled forces. We find that c4da are sensitive to mN-scale forces and use the entire dendritic territory (including the non-neuronal part of the epidermis) as the force-receptive field. In particular, c4da show greater responses to smaller probes, suggesting their sensory preference to localized forces. Further analysis reveals the cellular mechanisms that facilitate the sensory features of c4da and the contributions of key molecules. In all, these findings update the current model for the c4da-mediated mechanical nociception and provide novel insights into how mechano-nociceptor cells process force signals at the cellular level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mechanical recording and the ‘sphere-surface’ contact model</title><p>We set out by building a mechanical device that was able to exert and measure compressive forces onto fly larval fillets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This device contained three parts: a piezo stack actuator, a metal beam coupled with a strain gauge and a glass force probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To record the force-evoked response of sensory neurons, freshly prepared larval fillet was spread and mounted on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pad (thickness: 1 mm) with the exterior surface of the cuticle accessible to the force probe and the interior surface visible to the confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When the force probe, driven by the piezo actuator, delivered compressive forces onto the larval fillet, the strain gauge converted the deflection of the metal beam into an electrical signal. The electrical signal could be translated into a force signal using the calibration curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, see <bold>Materials</bold> and <bold>methods</bold>). By making spherical probes in different diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we can study how mechanoreceptor cells respond to the probes of different sizes.

Note that to guarantee the accuracy of the contact model, the indentation depth (<italic>d</italic>) needs to be smaller than the radius of the spherical probe (<italic>r</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This prerequisite is acceptable for our measurements because our pilot experiments showed that when the step distance (<italic>D</italic>) of the piezo actuator was greater than <italic>r</italic>, the force probe often penetrated the cuticle and caused tissue damage. The small deformation constraint would naturally minimize tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and allow us to focus on mechanical nociception (i.e. no major interference from chemo-nociception due to tissue damage).

By simultaneously monitoring the position of the probes and neuronal morphology, we ensured that the probe made direct compression onto the dendrites. Force titration experiments using a 60 μm probe showed a half-activation force (<italic>f</italic><sub>50</sub>) of ~3 mN and a full-activation force (<italic>f</italic><sub>90</sub>) of ~4 mN, while those using a 30 μm probe showed a <italic>f</italic><sub>50</sub> of ~0.7 mN and a <italic>f</italic><sub>90</sub> of ~1.5 mN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). This observation suggests that the mechanosensitivity of c4da is dependent on probe size.

C1da showed no responses to compressive forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with their function being a proprioceptor rather than a tactile receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2019</xref>). C3da showed a much smaller threshold of activation, suggesting a higher sensitivity in detecting tactile forces (using both 30 and 60 μm probes). This is consistent with their known function as a larval gentle touch receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsubouchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The observation of different responses of c4da to the 30 and 60 μm probes suggests that c4da are more sensitive to smaller probes. To test this idea, we stimulated c4da using probes of different diameters (30, 60, 100, and 200 μm) at the distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We found that c4da made stronger responses (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>) to smaller probes at the same force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In addition, the slope of the force-Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> curve increased as the probe became smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), reflecting an enhanced mechanosensitivity to the change in stimulating force. To further understand this result, we calculated central pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>) and contact area (<italic>A</italic><sub>c</sub>) based on the ‘sphere-surface’ model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4 equ5 equ6 equ7">Equations 4–7</xref>, see <bold>Materials</bold> and <bold>methods</bold>), and then plotted the responses against these two parameters separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In the <italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>-Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> plots (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), we found that increasing contact area decreased the threshold of cell activation but had only a minor impact on the slopes of the curves, suggesting that c4da have a robust sensitivity to the change in pressure. Similar observations were obtained when the pressures at other positions (<italic>P</italic><sub>x μm</sub>) were plotted against the responses (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the <italic>A</italic><sub>c</sub>-Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> plots (right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), when the contact area was the same, higher pressure led to stronger responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), also consistent with c4da being a pressure sensor. The comparison of the Δ<italic>P</italic> (the change of pressure) and Δ<italic>A</italic><sub>c</sub> (the change of contact area) of different probes showed that for a given change of forces, the smaller probes caused a smaller Δ<italic>A</italic><sub>c</sub> but a greater Δ<italic>P</italic> in comparison to the larger probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), explaining the higher sensitivity of c4da to the smaller probes.</p><p>To further understand how the sensory preference of c4da to localized poking contributes to the behavioral response of larvae in nociception, we performed the behavior assay of mechanical nociception using a modified Von Frey fiber. To test the effect of different probe sizes, we attached the glass probes (shorter than 1 mm) of different diameters (from 30 to 200 μm) to the end of a Von Frey fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Using these modified fibers, we were able to deliver poking forces of 15–20 mN to fly larvae. Note that mean value and variation of the stimulating forces were independent on the probe size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The defensive rolling behaviors were recorded and scored to reflect the sensory response of c4da. We found that fly larvae showed stronger behavioral responses to smaller probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), in agreement with our observations on the cellular level.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that c4da are sensitive to mN-scale compressive forces applied onto their dendrites. In particular, c4da are more sensitive to smaller probes, consistent with c4da acting as a larval nociceptor to sense mechanical poking or sting from sharp objects, for example the wasp ovipositor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cerkvenik et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Morphological complexity likely contributes to the sensory features of c4da</title><p>Having characterized the mechanosensory responses of c4da, we wondered what could be the cellular mechanisms underlying the sensory preference of c4da to small probes. The key thing is to ensure that an adequate number of mechanosensory molecules can be activated upon a localized force. Intuitively, a densely distributed dendritic arbor would be helpful. We tested this hypothesis by studying the sensory responses of a knock-down mutant of <italic>cut</italic> (<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup>), a key transcription factor underlying the high morphological complexity of c4da (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grueber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jinushi-Nakao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>C4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> neurons showed a sparser dendritic morphology than c4da-<italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To explore the effects of these potential factors, we performed several control experiments. First, we checked the expression level and subcellular localization of two mechanosensory molecules, that is Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26, in c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup>. They showed similar expression and localization as in c4da-<italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, the changes in dendritic cytoskeleton might indirectly affect mechanosensation by altering the mechanical homeostasis of the dendrites, so we checked the dendritic signals of F-actin and microtubules. No significant difference was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These two observations suggest that although the reduction in the expression level of Cut decreases the number of dendritic branches, the expression and localization of mechanosensory molecules and cytoskeletal elements are nearly unchanged in the existing dendrites of c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup>. Third, we also performed the same set of mechanical recording experiments on c3da-<italic>wt</italic>, in which there is no additional manipulation at the genetic level, but the dendritic density differs from that of c4da-<italic>wt</italic> in the way as in the case of c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The responses of c3da-<italic>wt</italic> to the distal stimuli were significantly weaker than those to the proximal stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, no preference to small probes was found in c3da-<italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These sensory features were markedly different from those in c4da-<italic>wt</italic>, but similar to those in c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup>. In all, our observations are consistent with the dendritic morphology making a direct contribution in supporting the sensory features of c4da. Note that the potential contributions of other unknown factors cannot be absolutely excluded (see <bold>Discussion</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mechanosensitivity to lateral tension expands the force-receptive field</title><p>An unexpected finding in studying c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup>, primarily due to the sparse dendritic morphology, was that when the force probe was not directly placed on a dendrite but on an adjacent region without any dendrite (i.e. the ‘dendrite-off’ mode, denoted as ‘<bold><italic>d</italic>-off</bold>’ in the plots), the response of c4da was nearly unchanged, as if the force was directly applied on the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

By simulating tissue mechanics of the larval fillet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, also see <bold>Materials</bold> and <bold>methods</bold>), we calculated the distribution of <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>L</sub> as a result of the poking stimuli from the 30 and 60 μm probes (indentation depth: 20 μm).

However, if c4da were also sensitive to Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>L</sub>, the increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>L</sub> would compensate for the reduction in <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub>.

To examine how the sensitivity to <italic>T</italic><sub>L</sub> promotes the likelihood of cell activation, we overlaid the 2D profiles of <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>L</sub> to the dendrites of c4da at random positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and calculated the probability of cell activation. Note that the calculations were made based on two assumptions. First, we assumed 10% of the peak value of <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> or <italic>T</italic><sub>L</sub> as the activation threshold of a dendritic segment. Second, we assumed a dendritic coverage threshold (<italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub>), i.e. the minimal amount of excited dendritic segments that would lead to neuronal excitation. To explore the parameter space, we tested three values for <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub>, i.e. 0.1% (20 μm) (low threshold), 1% (200 μm) (intermediate threshold) and 2% (400 μm) (high threshold) of the total dendritic length (mean ± std: 19560±1667 μm, n=5 cells). We considered three scenarios in our simulations, in which the cell is sensitive to either <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> or <italic>T</italic><sub>L</sub> or both. Simulation results showed that with the lower threshold assumption (e.g. <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> = 20 μm), the cells could be activated in all three conditions. However, if the threshold was of intermediate (e.g. <italic>C</italic><sub>d =</sub> 200 μm) or high (e.g. <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> = 400 μm) level, lateral mechanosensitivity could largely enhance the probability of neuronal excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>), consistent with our hypothesis. Therefore, our analysis suggests that the sensitivity to lateral tension enhances the sensitivity of c4da in force detection, especially when dendritic coverage is small.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26 differentially contribute to the mechanosensitivity of c4da</title><p>We then wondered what is the molecular basis underlying the mechanosensitivity of c4da, especially the sensitivity to lateral tension? Previous behavior assays suggest that Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo mediate two parallel mechanosensory pathways in c4da (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorczyca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mauthner et al., 2014</xref>). This remains to be confirmed at the cellular level. Moreover, it is also unclear how Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo contribute to the mechanosensitivity of c4da, respectively.</p><p>We first confirmed that the dendritic morphologies of c4da-<italic>piezo</italic><sup>KO</sup>, c4da-<italic>ppk26</italic><sup>1</sup> (a null mutant) and c4da-<italic>piezo</italic><sup>KO</sup>, <italic>ppk1</italic><sup>Δ5</sup> (a double null mutant) were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), excluding the potential effect of morphological changes. We then measured the force-evoked responses of these mutants using two types of probes (30 and 60 μm) and at different dendritic regions. In all conditions, the responses of c4da-<italic>ppk26</italic><sup>1</sup> were significantly reduced and the sensory preference to small probes was completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). In contrast, the response of c4da-<italic>piezo</italic><sup>KO</sup> was changed in a different way. C4da-<italic>piezo</italic><sup>KO</sup> showed a mildly reduced response to the large probe (60 μm) but a significantly lower response to the small probe (30 μm). This phenotype was more prominent for the distal stimuli than for the proximal stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). As a result, the preference to small probes was only attenuated for the proximal stimuli but completely lost for the distal stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>).

This hypothesis predicts that when the dendritic signal propagation, if any, is weakened, the cellular response of c4da to smaller probes would be affected to a greater extent. We then tested this hypothesis.</p><p>Previous studies showed that Ca-α1D, a voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC), contributes to the somatic and dendritic calcium transient evoked by heat or laser stimulation of c4da (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting its function in facilitating dendritic signal propagation.

In all, our genetic and functional analysis suggests that Ca-α1D, as a subunit of VGCC, contributes to the sensory preference of c4da, likely by facilitating dendritic signal propagation. Further expression analysis using the existing sequencing datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2022</xref>) showed that Ca-α1D had a broad expression in various types of neurons, including those expressing <italic>ppk1</italic>/<italic>ppk26</italic> (e.g. c4da) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, despite much effort, all of our further attempts to visualize the subcellular localization of Ca-α1D at both endogenous and over-expression conditions were so far not successful, possibly due to the low expression level as shown in the analysis on the sequencing datasets or other unknown technique reasons, for example that the tagged-Ca-α1D may not be stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In particular, c4da appear to be more sensitive to small probes, given that the applied forces are the same. We reveal three cellular mechanisms that could facilitate the sensory features of c4da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, the high dendritic complexity ensures dense and uniform distribution of mechanosensory molecules. Second, the mechanosensitivity to lateral tension, which depends on both Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo, expands the force-receptive field of the dendrites. Third, the active signal propagation in the dendrites, possibly mediated by a voltage-gated calcium channel subunit Ca-α1D, promotes the overall sensitivity of c4da and has a more prominent effect on the sensory preference to small probes. We now discuss the potential implications of our findings in understanding the mechanosensory and nociceptive functions of c4da.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The cellular mechanisms that facilitate the mechanosensory features of c4da.</title><p>Left panel: c4da showed a greater sensitivity to localized poking forces and made uniform responses to the forces applied at different dendritic regions (<bold>p</bold>) proximal stimuli.

However, it should be noted that the mechanics of our semi-intact fillet preparation is different from that of the intact animal, which is mainly reflected in two aspects. First, the fillet used in the present study is a tissue composite of cuticle, epidermis, neuron, extracellular matrix and muscle. In intact animals, this tissue composite is stretched and the tissular tension contributes to the mechanical homeostasis of c4da. In our semi-intact preparation, the tissue composite is also stretched when mounted on the PDMS pad. However, the resulting tissular tension is unlikely to be the same as that in the intact animals. This may change the mechanosensitivity of c4da. In addition, the change in the mechanical properties of tissue would alter the deformation of the fillet caused by the same force, which could also affect apparent force-dependent mechanosensitivity of c4da. Second, intact larvae are filled with the hemolymph but the fillet in our preparation is laid on a PDMS pad. The mechanical rigidity provided by the internal liquid pressure (from the hemolymph) and the muscle layer in the intact animals is possibly lower than that of the PDMS pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohane et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, the same force may cause different tissue deformations and in turn excite the neurons to a different level. These differences may explain the apparent discrepancy between the lower force used in the present work (&lt;5 mN) in comparison to the higher forces used in the behavioral assays in the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez-Bellido et al., 2019</xref>). Although these mechanical differences may affect the range of forces required to excite c4da in different studies, we do not think that they would significantly affect the way of how c4da encode the spatial parameters of stimulating forces because the overall dendritic morphology and the expression of key sensory molecules are not affected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for the mechano-nociceptive functions of c4da</title><p>C4da were first implicated as mechanoreceptor cells using the behavior assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorczyca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mauthner et al., 2014</xref>). Cellular responses to force stimuli were observed on isolated <italic>ppk1</italic>-positive cells and whole mount larval fillet preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsubouchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walcott et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we provide quantitative characterizations on the responses of c4da to controlled forces. Our results add to the current model of understanding how c4da act as a mechanical nociceptor in the following two aspects.</p><p>First, at the cellular level, we find that c4da are more sensitive to smaller probes. This provides a cellular basis to understand the physiological function of c4da in sensing mechanical poking from sharp objects, for example the ovipositor of wasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>). From mechanical perspective, the geometry of the force probes (spherical in the present study) determines that for a given change of force, smaller probes caused a smaller Δ<italic>A</italic><sub>c</sub> but a greater Δ<italic>P</italic> in comparison to larger probes. Because c4da are pressure sensors, the greater Δ<italic>P</italic> would elicit a greater change in the neuronal response. Meanwhile, c4da need to ensure that the Δ<italic>P</italic> over a small contact interface could be detected, integrated and amplified in order to excite neuronal responses. For this purpose, c4da develop several optimization mechanisms at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, complex dendritic morphology allows small probes to have a high dendritic coverage. Second, lateral mechanosensitivity expands the force-receptive field of dendrites, thereby acting as a mechanical amplifier. Third, active signal propagation, as an intracellular electrochemical amplifier, could compensate for signal attenuation in the dendrites. Altogether, these mechanisms optimize the mechanosensitivity of c4da by increasing the probability of activating the mechanosensory pathways that are required to excite neuronal responses.</p><p>An recent study reported that c4da can be excited by focal laser ablation through a noncontact pathway, namely that when the laser stimuli were not directly applied onto the dendrites, the neuronal responses could only be observed in axon but not in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2021</xref>). This pathway is thought be mediated by extracellular molecules released from damaged cells and implies that at least in some signaling processes of c4da, the axon has a lower threshold of activation than the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2021</xref>). In the present work, we did not observe noncontact responses, including those using the <bold><italic>d</italic>-off</bold> stimuli. We think that there are mainly two reasons for this difference. First, in our experiments, the small deformation constraint minimizes tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, in our semi-intact preparation, the tissue was bathed in the insect hemolymph-like buffer, so the extracellular signaling molecules, if any, might be rapidly diluted and are unlikely to reach the effective working concentration. Therefore, we argue that mechanical stimulations used in our study primarily stimulate the contact pathway, in which the dendrites are activated in the first place. This is also supported by two additional observations. First, we note that the force-evoked neuronal responses are dependent on Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo channels. These channels have clear dendritic localizations and are expected to contribute to the dendritic responses. Second, although the dendritic localization of Ca-α1D is still required to be clarified, the dependence of dendritic responses on VGCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) suggests that an active signal propagation mechanism is involved in the force-evoked dendritic responses. Comparatively speaking, we think that the previous study provides novel insights into how c4da respond to local tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2021</xref>), while our study advances the model of how c4da detect forces as a mechanoreceptor cell. These two studies, in a complementary way, promote our understanding of the function and working mechanism of c4da as a nociceptor.</p><p>Second, at the molecular level, we find that Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26 make differential contributions to the mechanosensitivity of c4da. Previous behavior assays suggest that Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo in c4da mediate two parallel pathways in mechanical nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorczyca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mauthner et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the question of why c4da need two sets of mechanosensory pathways. Furthermore, patch clamp recordings showed that the force-evoked electrical response of isolated <italic>ppk</italic>-positive cells is entirely dependent on Piezo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), which contradicts the result from the behavior assay. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo contribute to the in-vivo mechanosensitivity of c4da. Here, we discover that Piezo is particularly important for c4da to detect localized forces but plays a relatively minor role in sensing large probes. In contrast, the loss of Ppk1/Ppk26 reduces the responses of c4da to the entire range of stimulating forces used in our experiments, suggesting the contribution of Ppk1/Ppk26 to the overall mechanosensitivity. In addition, the lack of responses in the double knockout mutant strain confirms that the contributions of Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo are additive, as suggested by the previous behavior assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, our findings add to the current model by showing the differential roles of Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo in mechanosensation, and in particular, Piezo seems to act as a functional module to specifically enhance the mechanosensory features of c4da. Furthermore, we also show that Ppk1/Ppk26 and Piezo both contribute to the sensitivity of c4da to lateral tension. Consistent with this idea, members in the Piezo and the DEG/ENaC channel families have been proposed to be gated by the changes in lateral membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cueva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang and Howard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unclear how Piezo could facilitate the greater sensitivity to localized forces. We think that the underlying molecular mechanisms may reside in the gating property of Piezo, such as gating sensitivity, conductance and the property of the gating force.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Contribution of dendritic morphology to the function of c4da</title><p>Based on the observations in the <italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we argue that the morphological complexity is a key factor in supporting the sensory features of c4da. Because Cut is a transcription factor that contributes to the morphological determination of c4da, it is formally possible that the altered mechanosensory responses observed in the <italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> mutant is due to other downstream changes. While this possibility cannot be absolutely excluded, we think that the contribution of dendritic morphology is likely valid based on several lines of evidence and thoughts. First, the responses of c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> to the stimuli on the proximal dendritic region, where the dendritic density is similar to that of c4da-<italic>wt</italic>, is comparable to those of c4da-<italic>wt</italic>, suggesting that the essential mechanosensory elements are fairly normal in the existing dendrites of c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Second, the expression and localization of mechanosensory molecules (Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26) and cytoskeletal elements (F-actin and microtubule) in c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> are comparable to those in c4da-<italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), although it is possible that the fine organization of these molecular components could still be different in c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup>. Third, at least in terms of how a cell responds to different probe sizes and to the stimuli at different dendritic regions, c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> are similar to c3da-<italic>wt</italic>, whose morphological pattern is markedly different from c4da-<italic>wt</italic> but close to c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Assuming that the spatial parameters of forces are primarily encoded at the cellular level, the similarity between c3da-<italic>wt</italic> and c4da-<italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> would reflect the contribution of dendritic morphology. Therefore, our observations are consistent with the idea that the dendritic complexity is a contributing parameter underlying the force-encoding mechanism of c4da.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>All flies were maintained on standard medium at 23–25℃ in 12:12 light-dark cycles. <italic>20×uas-ivs-gcamp6s</italic> (BL42746, BL42749), <italic>ppk-gal4</italic> (BL32078, BL32079), <italic>uas-cd4-tdTom</italic> (BL35837, BL35841), <italic>ppk-cd4-tdtom</italic> (BL35845), <italic>ppk-cd4-tdgfp</italic> (BL35842, BL35843) <italic>uas-lifeact-rfp</italic> (BL58715), <italic>Ca-α1D</italic><sup>X10</sup> (BL25141) and <italic>Mi{ET1}Ca-α1D</italic><sup>MB06807</sup> (BL25527) were from Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC). <italic>Gal4-19-12</italic> was from the Jan Lab (UCSF). <italic>ppk26-gfp</italic> was from the Tracey Lab (Indiana University). <italic>Uas-mcherry-jupiter</italic> was from the Han Lab (Cornell University). <italic>Tmc-gal4</italic>, <italic>gfp-piezo</italic>, <italic>piezo</italic><sup>KO</sup>, <italic>uas-gfp-piezo</italic>, <italic>ppk26</italic><sup>1</sup> and <italic>piezo</italic><sup>KO</sup><italic>, ppk</italic><sup>Δ5</sup> and were from Wei Zhang (Tsinghua University). <italic>tub-gal4</italic> was from Bing Zhou (Tsinghua University). <italic>ct</italic><sup>i</sup> (THU1309), <italic>Ca-α1D</italic><sup>i</sup> (THU0766) and the control strains were from Tsinghua Fly Center. <italic>Ca-α1D</italic><sup>AR66</sup> was from Daniel Eberl (University of Iowa).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Larval fillet preparation</title><p>Third instar larvae were dissected on a 35 mm dish coated with a PDMS pad (thickness: 1 mm) in the insect hemolymph-like (HL) buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stewart et al., 1994</xref>).

(Dassault Systèmes, France). Due to symmetry of the load and the geometry, an axisymmetric mechanical model was established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The model includes the spherical probe and the underlying composite that consists of two layers of materials: (1) i.e. the cuticle layer (thickness 10 μm, elastic modulus <italic>E</italic><sub>cuticle</sub> = 1–10 MPa, Poisson’s ratio ν<sub>cuticle</sub>=0.45); (2) the underlying PDMS substrate (thickness 1000 μm, elastic modulus <italic>E</italic><sub>PDMS</sub> = 2.6 MPa, Poisson’s ratio ν<sub>PDMS</sub>=0.45). Because the muscle layer (elastic modulus <italic>E</italic><sub>muscle</sub> = 10 kPa) was much more compliant than cuticle and PDMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kot et al., 2012</xref>), it is expected to make little contribution to the force distribution. Therefore, we omitted the muscle layer in our finite element model for simplicity. The probe was treated as a rigid object, while the cuticle layer and PDMS substrate were assumed to be linearly elastic. Displacement load in the vertical direction was applied to the probe. The lower surface of the cuticle layer and the upper surface of the PDMS substrate were assumed to be tightly coupled. Fixed boundary conditions were applied to the bottom surface of the PDMS substrate. The compressive pressure (perpendicular to cuticle surface) and lateral (parallel to cuticle surface) tension were both calculated. The simulation of random positioned stimuli was performed using Matlab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image analysis</title><p>GCaMP6s signal was measured using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> Mechanical Nociceptors Preferentially Sense Localized Poking&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Göpfert (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed at length their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers were generally very impressed by the quality of your study and the novelty of your results. Nonetheless, a series of significant technical concerns were raised. We are confident that you will be able to address these concerns, and ask that you do so in a revised manuscript. Although the proposed revisions will entail additional work and new data, we encourage you to build on existing results. Specially:</p><p>1. Please check if dendrite/epidermal breakage occurs with the used probes. Ruling out such breakages is important to evaluate the data and its interpretation both at the level of the calcium signals and behavior. You should use ppk-tdtomato or ppk-mCD8GFP for this to make sure dendrites are bright enough and visible. Also, magnification higher than 20X is probably needed.</p><p>2. Please use the existing set of recordings to evaluate the possibility of dendritic calcium signals. The idea is to analyze the spatial distribution of dendritic calcium responses to the pokes. If no or very weak dendritic calcium signals are found, this observation should be stated in the manuscript. If significant dendritic calcium signals are observed, you should determine the dependence of these signals on Ca-alpha1D.</p><p>3. Please validate the RNAi knockdown and mutant results, particularly for Ca-alpha1D and piezo. For the RNAi lines used, qPCR data on the knockdown-efficiency should be added. If the qPCR do not work, you should consider using piezo-GFP as a readout for assessing the knockdown efficiency. For Ca-alpha1D, you should check the relevant mutants that could be used to provide better genetic evidence in support of a role for Ca-alpha1D. Data on protein localization is presented for the mechanosensitive channels, but not for Ca-alpha1D. Knowing the distribution of the Ca-alpha1D subunit is critical to the interpretation of the rest of your data. To do this, we recommend you use an antibody against Ca-alpha1D that was generated in I-Uen Hsu et al., PNAS 2020, PMID:33168737. Confirming expression, localization and RNAi knockdown should be feasible if the antibody proves to be specific enough. If the antibody's specificity is insufficient, you should check whether Ca-alpha1D is expressed in the cell using e.g. Mi{ET1}Ca-α1D[MB06807] that is available at Bloomington. For mutant alleles of Ca-alpha1D, combinations of available reagents were used in a previous study cited by the author (Terada et al. <italic>ELife</italic> 2016): Ca-α1DX7/AR66 and Ca-α1DX10/AR66. While we realize these extra experiments represent substantial work, their results will be important to clarify the role of Ca-alpha1D and piezo to support several or your statements. In case the experiments listed above are unsuccessful, we ask you to tone down the interpretation of your results, which would be unfortunate.</p><p>4. Please check/redo the calculations related the elastic modulus (PDMS vs. larval cuticle) and clarify the differences in the mechanical properties of the open filet preparation vs. the intact animal. In particular, transferring the elastic modulus of muscles characterized in humans to flies does not seem to be legitimate. The modeling should be repeated with a realistic value for the elastic modulus of the larva, along with an improved discussion of how the force distributions would compare to those in an intact larva. In the discussion, you should address the apparent discrepancy between the force used in your work (&lt;5 mN) compared to the 5-10x higher forces typically used in previous publications studying rolling responses in live larvae.</p><p>5. Please provide a minimal set of controls for behavioral data. This should include the driver control for the RNAi, the driver alone, and the driver plus RNAi. You have conducted these controls for the experiments related to cut but you are missing driver alone for Ca-alpha1D.</p><p>6. Please address the points raised by the reviewers regarding the interpretation of the results, the statistics and grammatical errors. Among the missing references, it would be important to incorporate into the discussion the following paper from the Howard lab: Focal laser stimulation of fly nociceptors activates distinct axonal and dendritic Ca 2+ signals by Basak, Sutradhar and Howard (PMID: 34175294, DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2021.06.001). This paper shows that axonal activation of the c4da neurons can happen even in the absence of any dendritic calcium signals. This argues that any active properties of the dendrites only occur with very strong activation. In the methodology, you should provide details about the creation of the piezo-GFP line (along with better imaging of its distribution in the dendrites). You should also add missing information about the regions of interest in which calcium responses were measured.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Liu et al. present findings that significantly extend the understanding of molecular and cellular pathways of mechanical nociception in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. They present a detailed analysis of the mechanical response properties of the nociceptors that is performed using a newly developed preparation for optical recordings from these cells. Using mechanical probes of varying tip diameters they are able to investigate the responses as they relate to force and pressure. Mutants in the cut gene, which show reduced branching of the nociceptors, are used to interrogate how the dendritic morphology structure might relate to their physiological responses. As well, the response profiles of the neurons that are mutant for mechanosensory channels ppk-26 and piezo are investigated. The ppk-26 mutant shows a more strongly impaired deficit in comparison to piezo mutants and double mutants show a nearly abolished mechanical response. The mechanosensory neurons are also found to respond to mechanical forces that are outside of the main dendritic fields which suggests that they are able to detect forces that are viscoelatically coupled through the overlying epidermis. Finally, a voltage activated calcium channel is found to be important which suggests that the dendrites of the nociceptive neurons are &quot;active&quot; (as opposed to passive). Overall, the study significantly advances our understanding of the response properties of the mechanical nociceptors of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva.</p><p>Questions for the authors:</p><p>The duration of the calcium responses long outlasts the force application. It has been previously proposed that dendritic breakage could be a contributing factor in the transduction mechanism in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nociceptive neurons (Tracey, 2017). What is the relationship of dendritic breakage occur with the various force stimuli and probe sizes in the imaging setup? Sharp probes (smaller probes) may be more likely to break dendrites. Similarly, do the sharp probes that trigger rolling in Figure 2J break dendrites?</p><p>The results of experiments with cut are very interesting, and the authors are open and cautious in their interpretation when they state the caveats of unknown epistatic effects that may result from removal of a transcription factor. Even with the stated caveats, the unknown effect of cut removal causes the results to be very difficult to interpret. It cannot be concluded that the deficits are a consequence of reduced branching. For example, perhaps calcium-alpha1d is a target.</p><p>Equation 3 assumes that the glass rod is completely rigid, if the rod bends during the stimulus then then d becomes on overestimate. Does the glass rod bend in this setup?</p><p>Are force measurements in figure 1i made with a larval filet in the setup? Or is this the force applied to PDMS alone?</p><p>Where are the values for the elastic modulus for larval cuticle coming from in line 543? Experimental measurements of the stiffness of larval cuticle come in at 0.39 +/- 0.01 MPa which is an order of magnitude lower than the values input to the model (10Mpa).

J Biomed Mater Res A. 2003 Sep 1;66(3):633-42. doi: 10.1002/jbm.a.10028</p><p>Third instar larval cuticle is closer to 20 microns thick according to experimental measurements. (Christine E. Kaznowski, Howard A. Schneiderman, Peter J. Bryant, &quot;Cuticle secretion during larval growth in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>&quot;, Journal of Insect Physiology, Volume 31, Issue 10, 1985, Pages 801-813, https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1910(85)90073-3).</p><p>The reference provided for elastic modulus of muscle comes from a study on human muscles and is therefore not valid for a study performed on <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae.</p><p>Is the force probe is compressing the entire larval filet such that there is an indentation into the PDMS (as depicted in figure 1A)? If so, then isn't it true that the forces on the filet (dendrites) are not coming solely from the force probe itself? If the larva is being squished between the probe and the PDMS, then the larva is also being exposed to an opposing force that is coming from the PDMS.</p><p>Figure 4D. Why &quot;dendritic coverage threshold&quot; instead of distance from dendrite? How do the predictions from this figure relate to real response data?</p><p>Could differences in distribution of Ca-alpha1D along the dendrite explain differences in proximal/distal sensitivities (ie. inhibition has less effect at proximal, maybe channels are less expressed/less important there?) Checking Ca-alpha1D localization would seem to be important.</p><p>Figure 6A, the top soma trace seems really low, compared to the responses shown earlier with this probe size and force.</p><p>Please provide details of the creation of the piezo::GFP line and better imaging of the distribution in the dendrites.</p><p>What is the frame rate of image acquisition? Are data from a single z-slice? Is pinhole wide open?</p><p>In Line 75 please do not refer to flies and worms as &quot;lower animals.&quot; Recommend substituting a term such as &quot;invertebrates. &quot;</p><p>In line 85 cite Zhong et al. 2010.</p><p>In lines 152-153 it is stated that the c4da neurons use their entire dendritic field as the force-receptive field. However, the later experiments show that forces are detected through the viscoelastic coupling of the dendrites to the rest of the epidermis therefore this statement is not supported.</p><p>In line 163 Cite Cynthia Hughes et al. and he et al.</p><p>In line 166 please cite Tsubouchi et al. 2012 (which precedes Yan et al. 2013 in the demonstration of the gentle touch function for cIIIda neurons).</p><p>In Line 201 cite Robertson JL et al. 2013.</p><p>In line 296 cite Zhong et al. 2010, Mauthner et al. 2014, Gorczyca DA et al. 2014.</p><p>In line 385 calcium α 1- D is more precisely described as a calcium channel subunit.</p><p>Figure 1a cuticle is misspelled.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The citations are in some instances used somewhat loosely and do not appropriately reflect the literature. This should be amended in a revised version:</p><p>Lines 88-89: The selection of references cited for the downstream circuitry of c4da neurons seems random. Grueber et al. 2007 characterized axonal projections of c4da only, Burgos et al. and Yoshino et al. each described a class of c4da second order neurons that have not been characterized in regard to mechanical stimuli. If the authors wish to cite all studies then critical ones are missing including Ohyama et al. (Nature 2015), Kaneko et al. (Neuron 2017), Hu et al. (Nat Neurosci 2017) and Takagi et al. (Neuron 2017). The latter two studies actually characterized the c4da circuitry in regard to noxious mechanical stimuli, which seems most relevant here. Alternatively, Gerhard et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2017) provides the most complete description of the c4da second order circuitry.</p><p>Lines 201 and 230: Grueber et al. (Cell 2003) was the first study to show that cut determines c4da neuron morphology and should be cited here.</p><p>2. Some discussion is warranted regarding the force used here (&lt;5 mN) compared to the 5-10x higher forces typically used in previous publications studying rolling responses in live larvae (e.g. Kim et al. Nature 2012, Zhong et al. Curr. Biol. 2012, Gorczyca et al. Cell Rep. 2014, Guo et al. Cell Rep. 2014, Hu et al. Nat Neurosci 2017, Lopez-Bellido J Neurosci. 2019). While this is likely in part linked to the small diameter probes here vs. the typically larger probes utilized in previous studies, both the neuronal as well as behavioral responses to low mN stimuli seem to be extremely strong. For the neuronal activation, this might be linked to several features unique to the semi-intact preparation used by the authors vs. an intact animal. For example, the PDMS stiffness is much higher than that of a larval body filled with hemolymph, which will resist force manipulation much less, i.e. indentation depth is likely higher for a given force/pressure. This point should be adequately discussed and put into context with the literature.</p><p>3. Relating to point 2, measuring larval rolling behavior using their different sized probes is interesting, yet the methodology was not so clearly explained in the methods or results. The authors indicate that the probes exerted a force between 10-20 mN, but do not indicate if the variability of individual probes depends on the diameter of the glass probe. As the pressure on the animal depends on probe size it might make sense to check if the measured force is dependent on the probe diameter and/or if response rates are just variable within the same range independently of the probe size.</p><p>4. Figure 2J: The legend is a bit confusing as the categories listed are &lt;1, &gt;1 and &gt;2 turns. Previous studies typically identified a single roll while multiple rolling indicates severe tissue damage. Some of the tissue damage effects by different probe sizes and pressures have been studied in more detail suggesting that tissue damage is actually required for defensive behavior (Lopez-Bellido et al. J Neurosci 2019 and J Vis Exp 2020). The authors should check for tissue damage under their experimental conditions to exclude that excessive rupturing of the epidermis causes the observed strong behavioral reactions.</p><p>5. In line 195 and 717, the labeling for this panel should be &quot;J&quot; instead of G.</p><p>6. It should be considered that the relative contributions of ppk/ppk26 and piezo might not exclusively reflect their function in c4da neurons alone. While ppk/ppk26 expression is cell type-specific, piezo is widely expressed in multiple tissues. Using a piezoko allele thus does not allow to draw conclusions on its function in c4da neurons. This would require either a cell type-specific manipulation or a c4da neuron specific rescue experiment. It would help if the authors can model lateral tension and perpendicular pressure for the 30 micron probe. This might help to explain the different defects described in ppk26 vs. piezo loss of function. Correlating the differential reliance of ppk26 and piezo on Ca-alpha1D function might be another interesting aspect, given that distal function of piezo to some extent resembles the one of Ca-alpha1D.</p><p>7. The model in Figure 7 could be improved as the color code and labels are not intuitive and the assignment of piezo vs ppk function is not clear to me. The model might also have to be revised according to the criticism regarding the assigned functions of ppk26 vs piezo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 2, legend: (G) should read (J).</p><p>– Line 160: &quot;To further justify the validity&quot; – change to &quot;To further test the validity&quot;.</p><p>– Line 66: not sure whether e.g. proprioceptors controlling locomotion aren't equally important for the survival of an organism.</p><p>– Line 390 ff: use past tense when reporting on earlier findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76574.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed at length their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers were generally very impressed by the quality of your study and the novelty of your results. Nonetheless, a series of significant technical concerns were raised. We are confident that you will be able to address these concerns, and ask that you do so in a revised manuscript. Although the proposed revisions will entail additional work and new data, we encourage you to build on existing results. Specially:</p><p>1. Please check if dendrite/epidermal breakage occurs with the used probes. Ruling out such breakages is important to evaluate the data and its interpretation both at the level of the calcium signals and behavior. You should use ppk-tdtomato or ppk-mCD8GFP for this to make sure dendrites are bright enough and visible. Also, magnification higher than 20X is probably needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. In our experiments, we always recorded the dendritic morphology before and after the force stimulation to control dendritic breakage. To make this point clearer, we made two changes in the revised manuscript. First, in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we showed that in the condition of using a saturation force, no significant damage of dendritic morphology was observed. Second, we made it clearer now that it was our intention to stay with the small deformation constrain to focus on mechanosensory responses of c4da (see page 5, second paragraph, line 124-130).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please use the existing set of recordings to evaluate the possibility of dendritic calcium signals. The idea is to analyze the spatial distribution of dendritic calcium responses to the pokes. If no or very weak dendritic calcium signals are found, this observation should be stated in the manuscript. If significant dendritic calcium signals are observed, you should determine the dependence of these signals on Ca-alpha1D.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we included the data on the dendritic calcium signal and showed that the dendritic signal was reduced when the activity of VGCCs were inhibited or in the Ca-α1D knockdown mutant (see Figure 6 A-B in the original manuscript). Inspired by the suggestion from the reviewers, we had a closer look at our data and performed additional experiments. In the revised Figure 6 A-B, we showed that the mechanical stimuli could evoke calcium responses not only in the soma, but also in the homolateral (i.e. between the soma and the force probe) and contralateral (i.e. opposite side of the force probe) dendrites, suggesting that the dendritic signals are propagating within the dendritic arbors. Moreover, in the revised Figure 6 A-B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1, we showed that these dendritic signals were reduced in the mutant strains of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> or if the fillet preparation was treated with nimodipine, demonstrating a clear dependence on the activity of VGCCs. However, because our imaging speed is not fast enough to capture the dendritic flow of calcium signals, the dynamics of signal propagation remains undefined. This would be an interesting issue to study in the future. Along with the revised Figure 6, we also revised the text and legends accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please validate the RNAi knockdown and mutant results, particularly for Ca-alpha1D and piezo. For the RNAi lines used, qPCR data on the knockdown-efficiency should be added. If the qPCR do not work, you should consider using piezo-GFP as a readout for assessing the knockdown efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we did not use RNAi mutant for Piezo. The <italic>Piezo</italic><sup>KO</sup> line is a genomic mutant strain<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Second, for <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>, because there are only a small number of c4da in each animal and Ca-α1D has a quite broad expression in various types of neurons (see our revised Figure 6—figure supplement 2), we expected that the reduction in the expression level of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> in c4da would be very difficult to detect. Therefore, we knocked down the expression of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> in the whole animal using the same <italic>uas-Ca-α1D<sup>i</sup></italic> strain and the <italic>tub-gal4</italic> strain. Using RT-PCR, we showed that the expression level of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> was significantly reduced (revised Figure 6—figure supplement 2). In fact, the same RNAi strain was also used in other functional studies<sup>2,3</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Ca-alpha1D, you should check the relevant mutants that could be used to provide better genetic evidence in support of a role for Ca-alpha1D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now performed additional functional experiments on <italic>Ca-α1D</italic><sup>X10/AR66</sup>, a genomic mutant strain used in previous studies on Ca-α1D<sup>2,4</sup>. As said by the reviewer, the additional data strengthens the genetic evidence to support the role of Ca-α1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data on protein localization is presented for the mechanosensitive channels, but not for Ca-alpha1D. Knowing the distribution of the Ca-alpha1D subunit is critical to the interpretation of the rest of your data. To do this, we recommend you use an antibody against Ca-alpha1D that was generated in I-Uen Hsu et al., PNAS 2020, PMID:33168737. Confirming expression, localization and RNAi knockdown should be feasible if the antibody proves to be specific enough. If the antibody's specificity is insufficient, you should check whether Ca-alpha1D is expressed in the cell using e.g. Mi{ET1}Ca-α1D[MB06807] that is available at Bloomington. For mutant alleles of Ca-alpha1D, combinations of available reagents were used in a previous study cited by the author (Terada et al. ELife 2016): Ca-α1DX7/AR66 and Ca-α1DX10/AR66. While we realize these extra experiments represent substantial work, their results will be important to clarify the role of Ca-alpha1D and piezo to support several or your statements. In case the experiments listed above are unsuccessful, we ask you to tone down the interpretation of your results, which would be unfortunate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions and agree that it is important to determine the cell biological properties of Ca-α1D. We performed all suggested experiments and additional ones to examine the expression and localization of Ca-α1D. However, most of the results are unfortunately negative, and we now summarize these results.</p><p>First, we performed the expression analysis using the existing RNA sequencing data. Our analysis showed that <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> had a broad expression in various types of neurons, including those expressing <italic>ppk1</italic>/<italic>ppk26</italic> (e.g. c4da) (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). From the sequencing data, we noted that the expression level of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic> was generally low (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). To further confirm the expression of Ca-α1D in c4da, we used the <italic>Mi{ET1}Ca-α1D</italic><sup>MB06807</sup> line as suggested by the reviewers. However, no clear signal was observed.</p><p>Second, we generated the transgenic strain that could express mcherry-Ca-α1D under the endogenous promoter of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>. However, no clear signal was observed. We also used the antibody as suggested by the reviewer <sup>5</sup> and no clear signal was observed in any part of c4da. We thought that it might be due to the low expression level of Ca-α1D, so we generated a <italic>uas-mcherry-Ca-α1D</italic> strain. Using the c4da specific ppk-gal4 strain to drive the expression of mCherry-Ca-α1D, we still could not see any signals. Because Ca-α1D is a subunit of the voltage-gated channel, we speculate that mCherry-Ca-α1D is probably not stable or is not able to assemble with the other subunits to form a functional VGCC. Future work is required to explore a good construct or other strategies to clarify the subcellular localization of <italic>Ca-α1D</italic>.</p><p>In all, although the cell biological evidence is lacking, we think that there is still good evidence from sequencing analysis and functional experiments to support the expression and the role of Ca-α1D in c4da. We have now summarized all our analysis of Ca-α1D in the revised manuscript (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), including all negative results, which would be useful not only as a set of supporting data but also for the information of other researchers. Finally, we also have added discussions on this issue and modified the text to ensure that the interpretation on the role of Ca-α1D is precise (see page 10, fourth paragraph, line 340-352, page 11, second paragraph, line 369-392 and the revised Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please check/redo the calculations related the elastic modulus (PDMS vs. larval cuticle) and clarify the differences in the mechanical properties of the open filet preparation vs. the intact animal. In particular, transferring the elastic modulus of muscles characterized in humans to flies does not seem to be legitimate. The modeling should be repeated with a realistic value for the elastic modulus of the larva, along with an improved discussion of how the force distributions would compare to those in an intact larva. In the discussion, you should address the apparent discrepancy between the force used in your work (&lt;5 mN) compared to the 5-10x higher forces typically used in previous publications studying rolling responses in live larvae.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we have now added a paragraph in the Discussion to clarify the mechanical differences between the semi-intact fillet preparation and the intact animal, in which we also discuss the possible reason underlying the discrepancy between the forces used in different studies (see Discussion, second paragraph, page 11). Second, we have checked the values for elastic modulus of insect muscle cells<sup>6</sup>, and it is similar to that of human muscle cells. We have now changed the reference for this point in the Methods. Moreover, because the muscle layer is expected to make little contribution to the force distribution, it is actually omitted in our simulations. Third, after looking into the literatures on the cuticle stiffness (including the one that the reviewer suggested), we think that there was still uncertainty on the modulus of insect cuticle (see below our discussion in the responses to the suggestion of reviewer 1). Therefore, we explored the parameter space by performing additional simulations using a lower value for the cuticle modulus (1 MPa). We showed that whether this modulus being 1 or 10 MPa had no effects on our conclusions. The new simulation results (<italic>E</italic><sub>cuticle</sub>=1 MPa) were now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 for comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please provide a minimal set of controls for behavioral data. This should include the driver control for the RNAi, the driver alone, and the driver plus RNAi. You have conducted these controls for the experiments related to cut but you are missing driver alone for Ca-alpha1D.</p></disp-quote><p>All checked and the missing controls were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please address the points raised by the reviewers regarding the interpretation of the results, the statistics and grammatical errors. Among the missing references, it would be important to incorporate into the discussion the following paper from the Howard lab: Focal laser stimulation of fly nociceptors activates distinct axonal and dendritic Ca 2+ signals by Basak, Sutradhar and Howard (PMID: 34175294, DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2021.06.001). This paper shows that axonal activation of the c4da neurons can happen even in the absence of any dendritic calcium signals. This argues that any active properties of the dendrites only occur with very strong activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for all the suggestions. We have tried our best to improve the manuscript in these aspects. In particular, we have now added a paragraph to incorporate the discussion on the paper from the Howard lab (see Discussion, Line 457-481).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the methodology, you should provide details about the creation of the piezo-GFP line (along with better imaging of its distribution in the dendrites). You should also add missing information about the regions of interest in which calcium responses were measured.</p></disp-quote><p>The Piezo-GFP line has been published<sup>7</sup>. We have now added information about how and where we measured the calcium responses in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Liu et al. present findings that significantly extend the understanding of molecular and cellular pathways of mechanical nociception in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. They present a detailed analysis of the mechanical response properties of the nociceptors that is performed using a newly developed preparation for optical recordings from these cells. Using mechanical probes of varying tip diameters they are able to investigate the responses as they relate to force and pressure. Mutants in the cut gene, which show reduced branching of the nociceptors, are used to interrogate how the dendritic morphology structure might relate to their physiological responses. As well, the response profiles of the neurons that are mutant for mechanosensory channels ppk-26 and piezo are investigated. The ppk-26 mutant shows a more strongly impaired deficit in comparison to piezo mutants and double mutants show a nearly abolished mechanical response. The mechanosensory neurons are also found to respond to mechanical forces that are outside of the main dendritic fields which suggests that they are able to detect forces that are viscoelatically coupled through the overlying epidermis. Finally, a voltage activated calcium channel is found to be important which suggests that the dendrites of the nociceptive neurons are &quot;active&quot; (as opposed to passive). Overall, the study significantly advances our understanding of the response properties of the mechanical nociceptors of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva.</p><p>Questions for the authors:</p><p>The duration of the calcium responses long outlasts the force application. It has been previously proposed that dendritic breakage could be a contributing factor in the transduction mechanism in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nociceptive neurons (Tracey, 2017). What is the relationship of dendritic breakage occur with the various force stimuli and probe sizes in the imaging setup? Sharp probes (smaller probes) may be more likely to break dendrites. Similarly, do the sharp probes that trigger rolling in Figure 2J break dendrites?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the first point in the above Editor’s summary. Briefly, within the range of forces and probe sizes used in this study, we did not observe significant dendrite breakage in both calcium imaging experiments and in the rolling behavior assays. We have now added data to make this point clearer (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript). In addition, we showed that the responses of c4da to the force probes depends on Piezo and ppk1/ppk26, suggesting that mechanosensation, rather than chemosensation, is the major pathway underlying the calcium responses observed in this work.</p><p>We also noted that the duration of calcium responses was longer than that of force application. Our preliminary data suggest that intracellular calcium release (e.g. from ER) contributes to the calcium signal after the force application. The key molecule in this process is the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the membrane of ER. Drug treatment or knocking down the expression of the RyRs in c4da significantly could reduce the amplitude and duration of the force-evoked calcium responses (data not shown). This issue is currently under further investigation and we hope to clarify it in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results of experiments with cut are very interesting, and the authors are open and cautious in their interpretation when they state the caveats of unknown epistatic effects that may result from removal of a transcription factor. Even with the stated caveats, the unknown effect of cut removal causes the results to be very difficult to interpret. It cannot be concluded that the deficits are a consequence of reduced branching. For example, perhaps calcium-alpha1d is a target.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the potential contribution of the unknown effect as a result of cut knockdown cannot be absolutely excluded. We now made this point clear in the revised Results and Discussion. On the other hand, the observations on the <italic>cut</italic> mutant are consistent with idea of the dendritic complexity being a contributing parameter underlying the signal-encoding mechanism of c4da. This argument is also supported by the observations in c3da. We have made open discussion on this issue (see Discussion, page 14-15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Equation 3 assumes that the glass rod is completely rigid, if the rod bends during the stimulus then then d becomes on overestimate.

First, the two ends of the larvae were not fixed during the force application, which would lead to underestimation of cuticle stiffness.

Based on these considerations, we decided to explore the parameter space of <italic>E</italic><sub>cuticle</sub> by performing additional simulations using a lower value for the cuticle modulus (1 MPa). We showed that whether this modulus being 1 or 10 MPa had no effect on our conclusions because the cuticle is thin in comparison to the PDMS pad.

Some discussion is warranted regarding the force used here (&lt;5 mN) compared to the 5-10x higher forces typically used in previous publications studying rolling responses in live larvae (e.g. Kim et al.

While this is likely in part linked to the small diameter probes here vs. the typically larger probes utilized in previous studies, both the neuronal as well as behavioral responses to low mN stimuli seem to be extremely strong. For the neuronal activation, this might be linked to several features unique to the semi-intact preparation used by the authors vs. an intact animal. For example, the PDMS stiffness is much higher than that of a larval body filled with hemolymph, which will resist force manipulation much less, i.e. indentation depth is likely higher for a given force/pressure.

The authors indicate that the probes exerted a force between 10-20 mN, but do not indicate if the variability of individual probes depends on the diameter of the glass probe. As the pressure on the animal depends on probe size it might make sense to check if the measured force is dependent on the probe diameter and/or if response rates are just variable within the same range independently of the probe size.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the corresponding part in Methods. We now included the data to show that the stimulating force was independent on the probe size (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and page 6, line 189-191). Because the glass probes were all very short, they would not be deformed during the poking experiments. Therefore, all forces are reflected in the form of the bending of the Von Frey fiber, which are the same for all the probes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2J: The legend is a bit confusing as the categories listed are &lt;1, &gt;1 and &gt;2 turns. Previous studies typically identified a single roll while multiple rolling indicates severe tissue damage. Some of the tissue damage effects by different probe sizes and pressures have been studied in more detail suggesting that tissue damage is actually required for defensive behavior (Lopez-Bellido et al. J Neurosci 2019 and J Vis Exp 2020). The authors should check for tissue damage under their experimental conditions to exclude that excessive rupturing of the epidermis causes the observed strong behavioral reactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used the same way as the previous studies to quantify the behavior responses. We have accordingly modified the figures and the texts in the Methods. Furthermore, we have checked the dendritic damage for both imaging and behavior experiments. Within the range of forces and probe sizes used in this study, we did not observe significant dendrite breakage (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In line 195 and 717, the labeling for this panel should be &quot;J&quot; instead of G.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It should be considered that the relative contributions of ppk/ppk26 and piezo might not exclusively reflect their function in c4da neurons alone. While ppk/ppk26 expression is cell type-specific, piezo is widely expressed in multiple tissues. Using a piezoko allele thus does not allow to draw conclusions on its function in c4da neurons. This would require either a cell type-specific manipulation or a c4da neuron specific rescue experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now performed c4da-specific rescue experiments for <italic>piezo</italic> to strengthen our conclusions (see revised Figure 5G and page 9, line 315-328).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would help if the authors can model lateral tension and perpendicular pressure for the 30 micron probe. This might help to explain the different defects described in ppk26 vs. piezo loss of function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed the additional simulations and the new data were now in the revised Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Correlating the differential reliance of ppk26 and piezo on Ca-alpha1D function might be another interesting aspect, given that distal function of piezo to some extent resembles the one of Ca-alpha1D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and feel that this is a very interesting issue to follow up. One key piece of information to understand this issue is the subcellular localization of Ca-α1D and the mutual dependence between Piezo and Ca-α1D. However, as we described in the responses to Editor’s summary, the subcellular localization of Ca-α1D in c4da was still not clear. Therefore, this issue would need to be further explored in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The model in Figure 7 could be improved as the color code and labels are not intuitive and the assignment of piezo vs ppk function is not clear to me. The model might also have to be revised according to the criticism regarding the assigned functions of ppk26 vs piezo.</p></disp-quote><p>In this model figure, what we would like to point out is that both Piezo and ppk1/ppk26 contribute to the mechanosensitivity to lateral tension. To make this point clear, we have modified this figure. In particular, we simplified the colors to avoid misunderstanding. We also edited the legends and the corresponding texts in Discussion accordingly. With respect to the roles of Piezo and ppk1/ppk26, we discussed their differential contributions in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Figure 2, legend: (G) should read (J).</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 160: &quot;To further justify the validity&quot; – change to &quot;To further test the validity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 66: not sure whether e.g. proprioceptors controlling locomotion aren't equally important for the survival of an organism.</p></disp-quote><p>Edited to be more precise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 390 ff: use past tense when reporting on earlier findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Checked.</p><p>References</p><p>1 Kim, S.
