children. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of congenital cataract remain incompletely defined. Through whole-exome sequencing of a Chinese family with congenital cataract, we identified a potential pathological variant (p.G1943E) in <italic>PIKFYVE</italic>, which is located in the PIP kinase domain of the PIKFYVE protein. We demonstrated that heterozygous/homozygous disruption of PIKFYVE kinase domain, instead of overexpression of <italic>PIKFYVE<sup>G1943E</sup></italic> in zebrafish mimicked the cataract defect in human patients, suggesting that haploinsufficiency, rather than dominant-negative inhibition of PIKFYVE activity caused the disease. Phenotypical analysis of <italic>pikfyve</italic> zebrafish mutants revealed that loss of Pikfyve caused aberrant vacuolation (accumulation of Rab7<sup>+</sup>Lc3<sup>+</sup> amphisomes) in lens cells, which was significantly alleviated by treatment with the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1). Collectively, we identified <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> as a novel causative gene for congenital cataract and pinpointed the potential application of Baf-A1 for the treatment of congenital cataract caused by PIKFYVE deficiency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PIKFYVE</kwd><kwd>congenital cataract</kwd><kwd>gene</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>Baf-A1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GJHZ20180420180937076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20180228164400218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012151</institution-id><institution>Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SZSM201812090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deleterious genetic variants in the PIP kinase domain of PIKFYVE are directly associated with the occurrence of congenital cataract in human and zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital cataract is partial or complete opacification of the lens that occurs at birth or during the first decade of life. It is a common ocular abnormality that causes visual impairment and blindness during infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khokhar et al., 2017</xref>), accounting for 5–20% blindness in children worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sheeladevi et al., 2016</xref>). According to the location and shape of the lens opacities, congenital cataract can be divided into seven clinical types: nuclear cataract, polar cataract, lamellar cataract, nuclear with cortical cataract, cortical cataract, sutural cataract, and total cataract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>). Different types of cataracts cause different levels of visual impairment in patients. A variety of factors, including gene variants that affect lens metabolism. are closely associated with cataract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2020</xref>), and autosomal dominant congenital cataract is the most common mode of inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2020a</xref>). To date, the occurrence of congenital cataract has been linked with genetic variants in at least 50 genes involved in lens structure and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shiels and Hejtmancik, 2017</xref>), including crystallin genes (<italic>CRYAA</italic>, <italic>CRYAB</italic>, <italic>CRYBB1</italic>, <italic>CRYBB2</italic>, <italic>CRYBB3</italic>, <italic>CRYBA1/A3</italic>, <italic>CRYBA2</italic>, <italic>CRYBA4</italic>, <italic>CRYGC</italic>, <italic>CRYGD,</italic> and <italic>CRYGS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhat, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhuang et al., 2019</xref>), membrane protein genes (<italic>GJA3</italic>, <italic>GJA8</italic>, <italic>MIP,</italic> and <italic>LIM2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pei et al., 2020</xref>), growth and transcription factor genes (<italic>PITX3</italic>, <italic>MAF,</italic> and <italic>HSF4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anand et al., 2018</xref>), beaded filament structural protein genes (<italic>BFSP1</italic> and <italic>BFSP2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song et al., 2009</xref>), and other genes (<italic>CHMP4B</italic> and <italic>EPHA2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dave et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shiels et al., 2007</xref>). Although these findings have made tremendous contributions to our understanding of the genetic etiology of congenital cataract, new causative genes as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified a missense genetic variant (p.G1943E) in the phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK) domain of PIKFYVE (phosphoinositide kinase, FYVE-type zinc finger containing) from a Chinese cataract family. The human <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> gene encodes a large protein consisting of 2098 amino acids, which contains six evolutionarily conserved domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawasaki et al., 2012</xref>), including zinc finger phosphoinositide kinase (FYVE) domain, plextrin homology domain, β-sheet winged helix DNA/RNA-binding motif, cytosolic chaperone CCTγ apical domain-like motif, spectrin repeats (SPEC), and C-terminal fragment PIPK domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shisheva, 2008</xref>). The N-terminal FYVE domain can bind to PtdIns3P on the membrane, while the C-terminal is the kinase domain which has the catalytic function for the production of PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shisheva et al., 1999</xref>). The in-vivo function of PIKFYVE in the development of lens and its association with congenital cataract have not been documented. Different from previously reported <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> variants affecting the chaperonin-like domain that cause fleck corneal dystrophy (CFD), a disease characterized by tiny white flecks scattered in corneal stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2005</xref>), the p.G1943E variant in the kinase domain of PIKFYVE was revealed for the first time to cause congenital cataract in human patients. Using zebrafish models, we demonstrated that disruption of the PIPK domain in Pikfyve caused early-onset cataract defect (aberrant accumulation of Rab7<sup>+</sup>Lc3<sup>+</sup> amphisomes in the lens) and treating the <italic>pikfyve</italic>-deficient embryos with V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) significantly alleviated the vacuolation defect in the lens of zebrafish mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The congenital cataract family and clinical characteristics</title><p>We recruited a large Chinese Korean family affected with congenital cataract, which consists of 31 family members including 12 affected individuals across four generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All the family members were Chinese Korean except one married-in individual (III-8) who was Han Chinese. There was no consanguineous marriage in this family. Bilateral cataract was observed in every generation of the pedigree and affected parents transmitted the disease to both males and females, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance. No other ocular and systemic abnormalities were found in these patients. Clinical information was obtained from all patients except two deceased individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Seven of the 10 living patients were diagnosed as cataract in their first decade of life, with the smallest age of diagnosis at 2 years old. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of these patients ranged from 20/125 to 20/20. The proband (III-9) showed nuclear pulverulent cataract in both eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with vision loss (OD: 20/40, OS: 20/66) since childhood. The mother (II-4) of the proband also had nuclear pulverulent cataract in both eyes, while his father (II-3) had no cataract in either eye. The son (IV-5) of the proband had Y-sutural cataract. Among the other affected members of this family, individuals II-8, III-5, III-6, and IV-3 presented nuclear pulverulent opacity in both eyes, whereas individual III-1 and his son (IV-1) showed peripheral cortical punctate opacity in both eyes. All patients of this family did not show any abnormities in fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pedigree structure and ocular manifestations of the cataract family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pedigree of the family with congenital cataract.

Overall, 101,852–102,401 sequence variants were identified in each individual. Nonsynonymous or splicing-site variants, of which the minor allele frequencies were less than 1% in the genome aggregate database (gnomAD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/">https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>) and were shared among all three affected members but were absent from the unaffected member were filtered and retained. Then we focused on variants in known cataract genes but did not find any disease causative variants in this family. Further filtering based on in-silico prediction of pathogenicity refined the candidates to three genes (<italic>PIKFYVE</italic>, <italic>NPHS1,</italic> and <italic>FPR1</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We then verified and evaluated these candidate variants in the whole family using Sanger sequencing. Among them, only the <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> variant completely segregated with the disease in the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, in contrast to the healthy control, the <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> gene in the cataract patients carried a G to A heterozygous substitution in the 39th exon, which leads to the replacement of a highly conserved amino acid glycine (G) by glutamate (E) at position 1943 in the PIPK domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). To investigate the possible roles of PIKFYVE in the development of cataracts, we first confirmed its expression in human anterior lens capsules by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <italic>B</italic>). Then to interpret how p.G1943E variant altered the function of PIKFYVE, we determined the protein stability of PIKFYVE<sup>WT</sup> and PIKFYVE<sup>G1943E</sup> by Western blot analysis of <italic>pCS2(+)-CMV-PIKFYVE<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>pCS2(+)-CMV-PIKFYVE<sup>G1943E</sup></italic> transfected HEK293T cells at 34 and 44 hr post-transfection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the expression level of PIKFYVE<sup>G1943E</sup> was comparable with that of PIKFYVE<sup>WT</sup>, suggesting that the p.G1943E variant has little or no effect on the protein stability of PIKFYVE. Recently, a middle-to-low resolution structure of PIKFYVE was resolved by cryo-EM (PDB ID:7K2V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lees et al., 2020</xref>). Using this structure as template, we predicted the structure of the p.G1943E variant form of PIKFYVE PIPK domain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, the p.G1943E sits in a linker connecting the N-lobe (gold) and the C-lobe (cyan) of PIPK domain. This loop (red) acts as a hinge between N-lobe and C-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and forms a highly restricted conformation. However, the p.G1943E variant introduces a negatively charged residue to the loop. This negatively charged residue not only changes the surface electrostatic potential of PIPK domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), but also generates charge repulsions between the loop and N-lobe (D1872 and D1871) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), thereby potentially affecting the kinase activity of PIKFYVE.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> variant identified from the congenital cataract family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sanger sequencing chromatogram showing the cDNA sequences from a healthy control and a cataract patient.

In this experiment, six affected loci from seven age-related or complicated cataract patients were identified. Among them, two variants in exon 36 (c.5399A&gt;C, p.Q1800P) and exon 37 (c.5594C&gt;T, p.A1865V) are located in the PIP kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s2sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>).

To directly demonstrate that heterozygosity of the p.G1943E variant caused haploinsufficiency rather than dominant-negative inhibition of PIKFYVE activity in human patients, we generated <italic>pikfyve</italic>-deficient zebrafish mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9-directed gene editing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shankaran et al., 2018</xref>). To maximally mimic the p.G1943E variant in human patients, we designed single-guide RNA (sgRNA) in exon 40 to target the C terminal PIPK domain and screened out the <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> allele, which harbored an 8 bp deletion and a 112 bp insertion in the cDNA of <italic>pikfyve</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, this insertion/deletion in <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> allele introduced a premature stop codon immediately downstream of the insertion site, thereby presumably generating a truncated Pikfyve protein that lacks the kinase activity. Phenotypical analysis revealed that <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> homozygous mutants developed normally before 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), but later showed severe developmental defects and all died by 9 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Under stereomicroscope, we noticed that compared to siblings (<italic>sib</italic>), the lens of <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutants was less transparent at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To characterize this phenotype in details, we followed up the development of lens in all genotypes at different stages under differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope. Our results showed that bubble-like vacuoles first appeared in the developing lens of <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> homozygous mutants at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Strikingly, the number and size of vacuoles both increased drastically by 5 dpf and almost dominated the lens of mutants. Notably, compared to the wild-type (WT) control, <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> heterozygous mutants also manifested significantly higher number of vacuoles in their lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), suggesting that normal development of lens highly depends on the activity of Pikfyve and heterozygous disruption of Pikfyve is sufficient to cause cataract phenotype. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PIKFYVE activity by inhibitor YM201636 also induced aberrant vacuolation in human lens epithelial cells HLEB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), suggesting that the function of PIKFYVE in the regulation of cataract formation is highly conserved across species and our zebrafish cataract model would potentially be an excellent system for further preclinical study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Disruption of the PIPK domain of Pikfyve in zebrafish caused early-onset cataract.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram showing the generated <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutant allele.

Previous work has shown that the vacuole phenotype induced by PIKFYVE deficiency in COS-7 cells could be rescued by Baf-A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compton et al., 2016</xref>). We thus investigated whether the vacuolation defect in the lens of <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish could also be attenuated by Baf-A1. Indeed, we found that vacuole number in the lens of Baf-A1-treated <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutants was significantly lower than that in the control group treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). To further validate that Baf-A1 could directly alleviate cataract defect, rather than just delay the phenotype, we imaged the lens of the same mutant zebrafish before and after Baf-A1 treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, while vacuole numbers of all the mutant embryos showed a slight increase after DMSO treatment or without treatment, we observed significant decrease of vacuole numbers in all <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutants. On the other hand, a previous study also showed overexpression of transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) could partially rescue the vacuole phenotype in PIKfyve<italic>-</italic>deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krishna et al., 2016</xref>).

This variant is very rare in the general population. In the gnomAD database, only four individuals (including three East Asians and one Latino/Admixed American) carry the p.G1943E variant, representing an extremely low allele frequency of 0.00002 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2020b</xref>), the degree and morphology of lens opacity in the cataract family were phenotypically heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While most of the patients in this family developed cataract and vision loss in their childhood, some cases were diagnosed quite late. Meanwhile, the majority of patients had nuclear pulverulent cataract, while the others had nuclear Y-sutural cataract or peripheral cortical punctate cataract (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This heterogeneity in clinical manifestations might be ascribed to interactions between genetic and environmental factors during lens development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>Variants in <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> have been reported to be associated with CFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kotoulas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2005</xref>). However, except that two of the CFD patients showed cataract formation at 66 and 58 years old, respectively, none of these <italic>PIKFYVE</italic> variants in these studies caused congenital cataract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kotoulas et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we also did not observe any corneal defect in patients with congenital cataract in this study. It is noted that all CFD-related mutations in <italic>PIKFYVE</italic>, either homozygous or heterozygous, are distributed in two regions (i.e., amino acids 667–843 and 1490–1538), corresponding to cytosolic chaperone CCTγ apical domain-like motif and SPEC domains, respectively. By contrast, the p.G1943E variant identified in this study is located in the C-terminal PIPK domain. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that different domains of PIKFYVE might exert different functions by binding with different partners. This hypothesis is further supported by other evidences. First, the predicted protein structure suggested that, instead of gross disruption of PIKFYVE protein structure, the p.G1943E variant only mildly altered the 3-D conformation of PIPK domain by changing its surface electrostatic potential and generating charge repulsions between the loop and N-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and F</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that this mutation in PIPK domain may specifically alter its kinase activity or change the binding surface with other proteins, while keep the N-terminal cytosolic chaperone CCTγ apical domain-like motif and SPEC domains functional intact. Second, in our <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> zebrafish mutants, while the C-terminal PIPK domain was truncated in Pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup> protein, the N-terminal cytosolic chaperone CCTγ apical domain-like motif and SPEC domains were not affected. Accordingly, we did not observe any cornea defect in the zebrafish mutants either.</p><p>Inhibition of PIKFYVE in COS-7 cells had been shown to induce large vacuoles through promoting the enlargement of both early and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ikonomov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rutherford et al., 2006</xref>). Further studies revealed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> releasing channel endolysosome-localized mucolipin TRPML1 acts downstream of PIKFYVE to trigger membrane fusion/fission process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2010</xref>) or promote lysosome/phagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dayam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, while overexpression of TRPML1 partially alleviated the vacuole phenotype in PIKFYVE-deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krishna et al., 2016</xref>), the rescue effect was not observed in the lens of <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> zebrafish mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that PIKFYVE might function in a context-dependent manner. Consistent with this idea, we also noted that vacuoles in microglia (the brain-resident macrophages) and lens cells of <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutants were differently stained by lysosome marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, vacuole formation in PIKFYVE-deficient COS-7 cells and macrophages could also be inhibited by a drug called Baf-A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Isobe et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we found that Baf-A1 could partially rescue the vacuole defect in the lens of <italic>pikfyve<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Baf-A1 is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits V-ATPase, the ATP-dependent proton pump located on the membrane of organelles. The cellular acidification process mediated by V-ATPase may affect many basic biological processes, including membrane trafficking (in particular endosome maturation and fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamamoto et al., 1998</xref>), protein degradation, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamamoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshimori et al., 1991</xref>). Interestingly, several works in yeast also identified mutations in V-ATPase that did not affect proton pump function, but indeed caused defects in vacuole fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strasser et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, another study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrated that inhibition of vesicle fusion by Baf-A1 did not depend on V-ATPases, but relied on Ca<sup>2+</sup> sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) pump, the secondary target of Baf-A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauvezin et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the target of Baf-A1 and underlying mechanisms still need to be further investigated. These mechanisms will finally contribute to the potential clinical application of the drug in the treatment of congenital cataract caused by PIKFYVE deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

development and pathology and ocular geneticists. Using a zebrafish model, the authors have identified a new autosomal dominant mutation in the kinase domain of the human phosphoinositide kinase gene PIKFYVE and assessed its impact on congenital cataract (clouding of the lens). They demonstrated that heterozygous or homozygous disruption of the PIKFYVE kinase domain, but not the overexpression of PIKFYVE G1943E, led to a cataract defect, suggesting the mechanism of haploinsufficiency rather than dominant-negative inhibition of PIKFYVE activity. The authors have presented strong evidence that mutations in the PIKFYVE kinase domain could lead to congenital cataract. Overall, the same pipeline of in vitro and in vivo genetic approaches could be applied to other human genetic disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71256.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Audrey M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>State University of New York Upstate Medical University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mutations in PIKFYVE cause autosomal dominant congenital cataract&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There were a number of major strengths in the paper. Highlighted below are some essential points of revision in addition to the others listed by the reviewers.</p><p>1) A major issue is the replication of these genetic mutations in other cataract patients, even just another small family or a few more sporadic cases.

This manuscript describes a missense mutation (p.G1943E) in the human phosphoinositide kinase gene, PIKFYVE, in a family with autosomal dominant congenital cataract and examines its role in lens pathology using a zebrafish animal disease model – which is the strength of the work. However, another PIKFYVE mutation (although not in the kinase domain as described in the present work) has been previously linked to cataract in humans. This, along with the lack of assessment of the newly identified PIKFYVE (p.G1943E) mutation or other deletions/point mutations in the kinase domain's ability/inability to rescue lens defects in pikfyve-deficient zebrafish, reduces the overall novelty of these findings. Further, while Baf-A1 treatment is shown to rescue vacuole defects in pikfyve-deficient zebrafish here, certainly an encouraging finding from the therapeutic point of view, it should be noted that Baf-A1 had been previously described to rescue vacuole defects in COS-7 cells. Finally, the abstract/Discussion sections give the impression that Baf-A1 can be generally used in the treatment of congenital cataract – however, this conclusion cannot be drawn broadly because congenital cataract is a multifactorial disease.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The PIKFYVE mutation (p.G1943E) in the kinase domain is novel and it is described in a multi-generational family with autosomal dominant bilateral congenital cataract, with no detected impact on cornea (as previously described PIKFYVE mutations have been linked to corneal dystrophy).</p><p>The demonstration that pikfyve-deficient zebrafish exhibit lens defects is novel.</p><p>Characterization of vacuoles in pikfyve-deficient zebrafish lens to demonstrate that they are likely amphisomes (that arise from fusion of autophagosome and late endosome) is new.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Previously, the PIKFYVE mutation (p.P968Vfs23) in two individuals of a family has been described to develop &quot;early&quot; (albeit not congenital) cataract (PMCID: PMC3209427 – indeed, the authors acknowledge this in Discussion). However, this means that the association of a mutation in the PIKFYVE gene with cataract is not entirely novel. Thus, the novelty here principally lies in the nature of the mutation, i.e. impacting kinase domain, and the nature of the cataract, i.e. congenital cataract.</p><p>The rescue experiments should be further extended to characterize in detail the impact of PIKFYVE (p.G1943E) mutation (other PIKFYVE kinase domain deletions/mutations) in pikfyve-deficient zebrafish.</p><p>HLEB3 cells are lens epithelial in origin, and there is no discussion on their significance in modeling the defects that appear to be in the fiber cells in the lens. For example, it can be asked, how specific is the vacuole-defect with regards to the use of a particular cell line, i.e. will YM201636 induce this defect in multiple cell lines (as previously described, it does seem to have this effect in COS-7 cells) – and if so, what is the significance of these findings specifically in the context of lens cells.</p><p>While it is acknowledged that the following is challenging, identifying multiple families or multiple novel mutations in the PIKFYVE kinase domain (in human or other animal models) will serve to further strengthen the work.</p><p>Rescue assays involving the PIKFYVE (p.G1943E) mutation in pikfyve-deficient zebrafish would shed more light on the impact of the mutation. Or alternately, if the PIKFYVE (p.G1943E) mutation rescues the lens defects in pikfyve-deficient zebrafish to similar extents as the wild-type – how would this be interpreted. Similarly, rescue by other (non-kinase domain) mutations of PIKFYVE could be evaluated, this would help to strengthen the case that specific domains of PIKfyve might exert different functions and therefore are associated with different defects.</p><p>While Figure 3C, D suggest that pikfyve(delta8) heterozygote mutants exhibit higher number of vacuoles as compared to the wild-type at 5 dpf, it is not clear whether they also exhibit cataract as observed in the human cases.</p><p>There is no quantification of vacuoles in HLEB3 cells treated with YM201636 in Figure 3E.</p><p>Higher magnification images of Figure 4B, C would help evaluate the pikfyve-deficient lens defects.</p><p>Further screening in humans to increase the number/type of independent cases of PIKFYVE mutations (not necessarily PIKFYVE (p.G1943E), since that is established to be rare).</p><p>While it is acknowledged that the authors used zebrafish as a model, their claim of haploinsufficiency as the cause of pathology would be further strengthened by studies using multiple animal models. For example, a Pikfyve knockout mouse model have been generated and heterozygous animals have been shown to survive (PMCID: PMC3075686). For example, but not limited to, overexpression of PIKFYVE (p.G1943E) mutation in Pikfyve heterozygous mice could be informative in further discerning the haploinsufficiency vs. dominant negative impact of the mutation in a mammalian model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript aimed to determine and characterize the genetic causal factor of autosomal dominant congenital cataract in a large, multi-generational Chinese Korea pedigree. The authors performed whole exome sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis in three affected and one unaffected individuals and identified a potential pathological non-synonymous variant in the PIKFYVE gene. This novel variant could affect the PIP kinase domain of the protein. The authors demonstrated that heterozygous or homozygous disruption of the PIKFYVE kinase domain, but not the overexpression of PIKFYVE G1943E, in zebrafish led to cataract defect in early stage, suggesting the mechanism of haploinsufficiency rather than dominant-negative inhibition of PIKFYVE activity. The zebrafish model with the loss of PIKFYVE function led to aberrant vacuolation – cataract related phenotype in lens cells. This aberrant vacuolation phenotype could be significantly alleviated by Baf-A1 by inhibiting V-ATPase. The authors have presented strong in vitro and in vivo evidence that mutations in the PIKFYVE kinase domain could lead to congenital cataract. Overall, the same pipeline of in vitro and in vivo genetic approach could be applied to other human genetic disorders.</p><p>Strength</p><p>This article comes with several strengths. First, the article is written clearly and easy to follow. Second, the experimental design and sample selection for whole exome sequencing is simple and clear. The bioinformatics pipeline is relatively clear, leading to the successful identification of the novel variant. Third, this study presented both in vitro cell culture and in vivo zebrafish-based functional validation to determine the pathological effect on cataract development. Fourth, the transgenic zebrafish model with the loss of kinase activity presented convincing cataract-related clinical phenotype data. Overall, this is a strong study to indicate the potential genetic cause of the identified potential pathological variant in the PIKFYVE gene.</p><p>Weakness</p><p>Despite the strength of this study, several weaknesses have been noticed as well. First, the authors need to establish the expression of PIKFYVE gene and protein in human lens capsules or lens cells. Second, the potential impact of the identified variant on the PIP kinase domain was mostly based on in silico prediction with protein structure. Additional data could be included to support the potential impact of this novel variant on the kinase activity in vitro. Third, the loss of PIP kinase activity via CRISPR needs to be confirmed using protein/mRNA expression data or kinase activity measurement in vitro. Fourth, the clinical phenotypes of transgenic zebrafish were only examined in early development and could be followed up for longer time past 7-dpf. Five, the identified rare variant has only been reported in one family. It will be more helpful to check whether other similar variants could be present in additional patients with congenital cataract.</p><p>1.

Indeed, 6 affected loci in PIKFYVE from 7 patients were identified and two variants (p.Q1800P and p.A1865V) were found to be located in the PIP kinase domain of PIKFYVE (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2 supplement 2-source data 1). We have included these data in the result of revised manuscript (Line 129-135 on Page 7 and 8).
