Closely related species may have very different regeneration capabilities. This has led some researchers to propose that higher animals, such as mammals, still possess the ancient genes that allow entire body parts to regenerate, but that somehow the genes have been disabled during their evolution. Studying animals that can regenerate large parts of their bodies may therefore help scientists understand what prevents others, including humans, from doing so.</p><p>An animal that is particularly useful for studies into regeneration is called <italic>Hydractinia echinata</italic>. These tiny marine animals make their homes on the shells of hermit crabs. They are small, transparent and stay fixed to one spot, making it easy for scientists to grow them in the laboratory and closely observe what is going on when they regenerate.</p><p>Bradshaw et al. genetically engineered <italic>Hydractinia</italic> individuals to produce a fluorescent protein in their stem cells; these cells have the ability to become one of several kinds of mature cell, and often help to repair and grow tissues. This allowed the stem cells to be tracked using a microscope.</p><p>When the head of <italic>Hydractinia</italic> was cut off, stem cells in the animals' mid body section migrated to the end where the head used to be and multiplied. These stem cells then created a bud (known as a blastema) that developed into a new, fully functional head within two days, allowing the animals to capture prey. Reducing the activity of certain stem cell genes prevented the new head from growing, but the bud still formed.</p><p>Next, Bradshaw et al. removed a structure from the opposite end of the animal, called the stolon, which normally helps <italic>Hydractinia</italic> attach to hermit crabs shells. Stolons regenerated in a completely different way to heads. No bud formed. Instead, the remainder of the animal's body, which included the head and the body column, gradually transformed into a stolon rather than regenerating this structure, and only then grew a new body column and head. Therefore, different tissues in the same animal can regenerate in different ways. Understanding the ‘tricks’ used by animals like <italic>Hydractinia</italic> to regenerate may help translate these abilities to regenerative medicine.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05506.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05506.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Hydractinia echinata</italic></kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>cnidaria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11/PI/1020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Irish Higher Education Authority</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Kerry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stem cell migration underlies head regeneration in the cnidarian (jellies and their kin) <italic>Hydractinia</italic>, but the regeneration of other body parts is based on the gradual transformation of one tissue type into another.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cnidarians are renowned for their remarkable ability to regenerate any missing body part. Classical work on the freshwater polyp <italic>Hydra</italic> has shown that both head and foot regeneration can occur without a significant contribution from cell proliferation (i.e., through morphallaxis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marcum and Campbell, 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1978b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummings and Bode, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dübel and Schaller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holstein et al., 1991</xref>). In planarians, by contrast, proliferation of pluripotent stem cells (called neoblasts) and formation of a mass of undifferentiated cells (called blastema) are required for head, tail, and pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reddien and Sanchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baguñà, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reddien, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>). The establishment of a blastema in regeneration has been observed in other taxa including annelid worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bely, 2014</xref>) and echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Candia Carnevali, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Akasaka, 2010</xref>), but the nature of the cells involved is unclear. Urodele amphibians are the only vertebrate tetrapods that can regenerate amputated limbs as adults. They are similar to planarians in their requirement for cell proliferation and blastema formation to complete regeneration, but the cellular source for urodele regeneration is different. In newts, dedifferentiation of cells in the stump provides progenitor cells, but in the axolotl, resident stem cells fulfill the same task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sandoval-Guzman et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, amphibian blastema cells are lineage restricted rather than being pluripotent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The ability to regenerate varies greatly among animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sánchez Alvarado and Tsonis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galliot and Ghila, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>), with substantial differences sometimes found between closely related taxa: Amphibians, urochordates, planarians, and cnidarians all include both groups or species with excellent regenerative capabilities and their poorly regenerating close relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galliot and Ghila, 2010</xref>). One possible explanation for these observations is that the basic genetic toolkit for regeneration is primitive and present in all animals, but that modulation or loss of some components can modify the ability of a given taxon to regenerate. This has recently been shown to be the case in planarians where changes in canonical Wnt signaling underlie differences in regenerative ability between closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sikes and Newmark, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Umesono et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, studying regeneration in a broad variety of animal models might reveal both regeneration mechanisms that are primitive and widely shared among animals as well as evolutionarily derived ones and could assist in addressing a major question in regenerative medicine, namely why humans are not capable of regenerating many tissues.</p><p>A specific difficulty in the study of tissue and organ renewal in higher animals is the fact that, like embryonic development, regeneration is a dynamic process. Therefore, understanding regeneration requires the analysis of individual cells over long time periods covering the duration of the regenerative process. The large size and opaque nature of many animals impede in vivo regeneration research at such resolution in most model organisms.</p><p>In this study, we show that <italic>Hydractinia echinata,</italic> which is a common colony-forming cnidarian in the European North Atlantic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), provides a powerful model system to study the cellular and molecular basis of animal regeneration. Indeed, <italic>Hydractinia</italic> is easy to culture in the lab and allows whole mount gene expression analysis, cellular analyses, transgenesis, and gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plickert et al., 2012</xref>). The animal reproduces sexually on a daily basis, but also grows clonally by elongation of gastrovascular tubes, called stolons, and asexual budding of new polyps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, they are small and optically translucent, and post-metamorphic animals are sessile and can grow on microscope slides enabling in vivo imaging of cellular processes. Like many cnidarians, <italic>Hydractinia</italic> displays a remarkable regenerative ability and growth plasticity, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these capabilities are not well understood. We have studied both oral (i.e., head) and aboral (i.e., stolon) regeneration in <italic>Hydractinia</italic> and show that stem cell migration and proliferation underlie head regeneration in this animal. Surprisingly, stolon regeneration is achieved through a fundamentally different cellular and morphogenetic process, demonstrating that a single species can apply different mechanisms to regenerate different tissues or body parts.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05506.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Hydractinia</italic> life cycle and colony structure.</title><p>Scale bar 200 μm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05506.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05506.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05506-fig1-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Head regeneration in <italic>Hydractinia</italic></title><p>Our first aim was to characterize <italic>Hydractinia</italic> head regeneration. For this, polyps were isolated from their colony by a transverse cut close to the polyp-stolon boundary and decapitated (n &gt; 300; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The remaining cylinder-like body column was then followed until a new head developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the animals regained the ability to feed. Lesion closure by stretching out of epidermal epithelial cells occurred at both cut ends within 6 hr following decapitation in all cases. No further development occurred at the aboral end where the stolons were removed (see section below). About 24 hr later, a dome-like tissue appeared at the oral pole. This was followed by the development of a new mouth and tentacles 48–96 hr post decapitation (in over 95% of cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Anti-acetylated tubulin antibody staining confirmed that the nervous system had completely regenerated with both neurons and nematocytes (cnidarian-specific mechanosensory/effector cells) appearing normal as in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). The polyps regained the ability to catch prey about two to 3 days post decapitation when a new head fully formed, but tentacle elongation sometimes continued for an additional few days. The time course of head regeneration (n &gt; 300) was variable among polyps, lasting between 1 and 4 days, depending on age (young post metamorphosis animals may regenerate faster), genetic background (we use a polymorphic wild type laboratory population), and general state of health (malnourished or otherwise unhealthy animals may display delayed regeneration). No indications for stolon regeneration were observed within the time course of head regeneration. Regeneration of decapitated polyps that remained attached to their colonies was indistinguishable from isolated polyps within the natural variability stated above.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05506.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Head regeneration in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup.

We therefore decided to analyze cell proliferation in <italic>Hydractinia</italic> head regeneration. In intact <italic>Hydractinia</italic> polyps, cell proliferation was almost exclusively restricted to a band at the lower part of the polyp body column, with little or no proliferating cells outside of this band. This was shown with both EdU incorporation as well as anti-phospho-Histone 3 (pH3) antibody labeling to visualize mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then decapitated polyps and allowed them to regenerate. During the course of regeneration, we incubated the polyps in EdU for 40 min at different times following decapitation. Animals were immediately fixed and processed for EdU visualization or anti pH3 staining. These experiments showed, first, that wound closure was not associated with enhanced cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, a striking shift in the spatial distribution of cycling cells was evident 24–48 hpd (hours post-decapitation). In contrast to the lower body column band-fashion distribution of cycling cells in intact polyps, the post decapitation distribution of cycling cells concentrated at the oral pole where the new head was about to form (n = 100; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Intact polyps that were labeled by EdU while still connected to their stolonal network showed the same pattern of S-phase cell distribution as polyps with intact heads isolated from their colonies (n = 20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Cells were spread on glass slides and stained with anti pH3 antibodies. Cnidarians have relatively few cell types including epidermal and gastrodermal myoepithelial cells, several types of neurons, stinging cells (nematocytes), gland cells, and stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hydrozoan stem cells are called interstitial cells, or i-cells for short. In <italic>Hydractinia</italic>, i-cells reside in interstitial spaces between epithelial cells (mostly epidermal), and at a population level are thought to be pluripotent life long, giving rise to all somatic lineages as well as germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2004</xref>). This is very different from <italic>Hydra</italic> where i-cells do not contribute to the two self-renewing epithelial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bode, 1996</xref>).

Briefly, polyps were removed from their colony and were then decapitated. Following decapitation the cylindrical body columns were incubated in seawater containing 30–50 ng/μl double stranded RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to 200 bp coding sequence of <italic>Piwi1, Vasa, Pl10</italic> and <italic>Ncol1</italic>. Control experiments were performed with dsRNA corresponding to the backbone sequence of the pBlueScript cloning vector, which is not encoded by the <italic>Hydractinia</italic> genome. qPCR analysis of <italic>Piwi1</italic> RNAi treated regenerating animals revealed a significant reduction in <italic>Piwi1</italic> mRNA levels comparing to control RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Regeneration in animals in which <italic>Piwi1, Vasa, Pl10</italic> or <italic>Ncol1</italic> were knocked down was compromised, with the frequency of regenerating RNAi animals significantly different from the control RNAi (chi-square test, p = 0.00001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Animals treated with control (i.e., non-coding) dsRNA regenerated normally. The experiments were repeated four times with 10 animals for each treatment. To address the role of these genes in i-cell proliferation, we treated regenerating animals with dsRNA as described above. Twenty-four hours after decapitation we incubated them in EdU for 20 min followed by fixation and EdU visualization. We found that knockdown of <italic>Piwi1, Vasa, Pl10,</italic> or <italic>Ncol1</italic> had no visible effect on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In these RNAi animals the head blastema formed normally yet regeneration was significantly affected, suggesting that these genes are required for differentiation. The specificity of the RNAi treatment was further confirmed by knockdown of histones H2A or H4 which strongly reduced EdU incorporation in regenerating animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, <italic>Piwi1, Pl10,</italic> and <italic>Vasa</italic> expression is not required for i-cell proliferation and for the formation of the head blastema. <italic>Ncol1</italic>, which is a nematogenesis marker, is not expressed in cycling i-cells and its downregulation is therefore not expected to affect S-phase cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The cellular source of head blastema is migration of stem cells</title><p>The experiments described above show that decapitation results in head blastema formation that includes numerous proliferating i-cells. In fully grown, intact animals, i-cells are more or less restricted to the band area in the lower polyp body column, and are nearly absent from the head, which also does not include significant numbers of proliferating cells (n = 75/83). We therefore reasoned that in the near absence of resident stem cells in the intact head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the source of stem cells in the head blastema could either be migration, that is, i-cells moving from the band in the lower polyp body column, or dedifferentiation of local differentiated cells in the stump. To discriminate between these two options, we performed two types of experiments. First, we pulse-labeled intact polyps with EdU for 60 min, followed by decapitation. The animals were intensively washed to remove EdU and left to initiate head regeneration. They were fixed and processed for EdU visualization at 6 and 24 hpd. We found that animals fixed 6 hpd had a strong signal in the band at the lower body column and only a few EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were scattered at more oral positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, those animals fixed 24 hpd had also a strong EdU signal in the developed blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because no EdU could be incorporated after washing the animals, the EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the blastema must have been the very same cells that were in S-phase in the lower band 24 hr earlier and had migrated to the stump following decapitation. Analysis of pH3 immunoreactivity in EdU pulse chased animals revealed double positive cells in the blastema, indicating that S-phase cells in the band continued to proliferate even after reaching the stump and contributed new cells to the blastema through mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05506.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The cellular source for head regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) EdU pulse-chase.

Based on these experiments and the EdU pulse-chasing, we conclude that the primary cellular source for establishing the head blastema and, subsequently, head regeneration is migration of i-cells from the band in the polyp lower body column to the prospective head area.

Hence, we hypothesized that a polyp to stolon transformation should be reflected by a spatial change in i-cell marker expression from restricted band-like to ubiquitous. Indeed, in situ hybridization of <italic>Piwi1, Vasa, Pl10, Myc2</italic> and <italic>Ncol1</italic> on isolated polyps that lost head structures showed a stolon-like expression pattern of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To summarize this point, <italic>Hydractinia</italic> aboral regeneration is not direct and proceeds through three stages: First, loss of anterior-posterior polarity; second, full transformation of the polyp into a stolon; third, budding new polyps and regaining oral-aboral polarity. Hence, <italic>Hydractinia</italic> polyps can regenerate a head through i-cell migration and blastema formation, but they cannot directly regenerate stolons; they can transform into stolonal tissue instead.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have studied both head and stolon regeneration in the cnidarian <italic>Hydractinia.</italic> Decapitation was followed by rapid wound healing that primarily involved stretching of epithelial cells without the requirement for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thereafter, we monitored the migration of stem cells (i-cells) from their normal position in the band area at the lower polyp body column to the prospective head, and their proliferation to form a head blastema. Of note, our data show that not all i-cells migrate to the stump, consistent with migratory vs non-migratory i-cell sub-populations. New head structures developed within 2–3 days, after which most i-cells disappeared from the head area and resumed their normal position in the band. Gamma irradiation abolished blastema formation and regeneration altogether. By contrast, individual knockdown of each one of the i-cell genes <italic>Piwi1, Vasa</italic> and <italic>Pl10,</italic> and the early nematogenesis marker <italic>Ncol1</italic> did not prevent blastema formation, but did inhibit regeneration. Hence, the role of these genes might be related to the ability of i-cells to differentiate rather than to keeping them undifferentiated. Similar results were obtained with <italic>Smedwi2</italic> (a <italic>Piwi</italic> homologue) knockdown in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>), but knocking out a different stem cell gene, <italic>Sox2</italic>, in axolotl inhibits proliferation of neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fei et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A common view in the literature has been that cnidarians can regenerate through morphallaxis, that is, without contribution from cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marcum and Campbell, 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1978b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holstein et al., 1991</xref>). More recent studies conducted on <italic>Hydra</italic> and on the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, however, have shown that cell proliferation accompanies the regeneration of cnidarian heads under normal circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19a">Govindasamy et al., 2014</xref>), but the necessity of proliferation was only demonstrated in <italic>Nematostella</italic> decapitation and <italic>Hydra</italic> bisection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miljkovic-Licina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Passamaneck and Martindale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DuBuc et al., 2014</xref>). Our results support the new emerging view on head regeneration in the Cnidaria and are consistent with Passamaneck and Martindale's hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Passamaneck and Martindale, 2012</xref>) that <italic>Hydra'</italic>s ability to regenerate a head in the absence of cell proliferation is evolutionarily derived within this phylum. This scenario suggests that blastema formation is an evolutionarily primitive hallmark of distal regeneration in animals.</p><p>Isolated polyps were unable to directly regenerate stolons from their aboral end like they do following decapitation from the oral end, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Putnam Hazen, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Müller et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2010</xref>), and no blastema formed at the aboral stump following removal of the stolons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead of regenerating stolons, isolated polyps lost oral-aboral polarity, and polyp identity altogether, and transformed into stolons. This process lasted for many weeks, thereby demonstrating their remarkable growth plasticity. Polyp to stolon transformation was preceded by loss of oral <italic>Wnt3</italic> expression and oral-aboral polarity, and acquisition of a ubiquitous, stolon-like distribution of i-cells, as opposed to the band like distribution typical of polyps. The newly transformed stolons budded new polyps and became fully functional, sexually mature colonies. These data, therefore, show that <italic>Hydractinia</italic> polyps possess tissue pluripotency. For now, however, we cannot discriminate between the scenarios of pluripotent i-cells vs several self-renewing, but lineage restricted, progenitors. So why do polyps not directly regenerate stolons? We suggest that tissue polarity along the oral-aboral axis prevents direct stolon regeneration. In a previous study, it has been shown that Wnt signaling promotes oral structures in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>, but represses stolons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2010</xref>). Downregulation of <italic>Wnt3</italic> or <italic>Tcf</italic> in decapitated polyps induces phenotypes reminiscent of polyp to stolon transformation in the present study, but requires shorter time to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2010</xref>). We show that in the absence of experimental manipulation, <italic>Wnt3</italic> expression and oral-aboral polarity are lost spontaneously in isolated polyps, enabling the transformation of the polyp into stolonal tissue that can bud new polyps. Possibly, <italic>Wnt3</italic> not only maintains oral- but also polyp- identity, and stolons develop by default in its absence. A summary of the two distinct regenerative processes in <italic>Hydractinia</italic> is schematically illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05506.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A summary of <italic>Hydractinia</italic> regeneration.</title><p>Red dots represent proliferating i-cells.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript characterizes the stem cells for regeneration in the cnidarian model <italic>Hydractinia echinata</italic>. This is perhaps the first time a detailed study of regenerative processes has been carried out in this marine colonial hydrozoan polyp. The authors report on the cellular and molecular processes underlying two distinct regenerative processes that take place in the same animal: 1) oral regeneration after decapitation of the head of the polyps; and 2) aboral regeneration when the polyps are detached at their aboral pole from the colony. An important aspect of this work is the establishment that <italic>Piwi</italic>-expressing i-cells migrate from the i-cell belt to the anterior amputation plane to participate in regeneration. The authors pioneer live imaging of the i-cells in <italic>Piwi</italic>:GFP transgenic reporters to establish this phenomenon. They also use irradiation to establish that proliferative cells are required for regeneration in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>. In addition they use RNAi of several stem cell associated factors and show that while EdU incorporation does not seem to be affected, regeneration is suppressed. This work is a major step in the dissection of molecular processes underlying regeneration in cnidarians. As such, we would like the authors to fully address the following comments:</p><p>1) The phenotypes shown by the authors are quite convincing but the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> should be supported by quantitative data and statistical analysis regarding the different morphological and cellular phenotypes and kinetics of regeneration are missing. Similarly results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> could be more precise, as deduced from the combination of EDU pulse chase labeling to PH3 detection that could provide a temporal analysis of the contribution of cycling cells in blastema formation. In fact the pattern of cycling cells on detached but intact polyps appears variable, in some cases forming a clear and unique band relatively low along the body column with sharp boundaries (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), while in other cases, it appears rather spread all along the body column of the polyps as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> (panels B and C). As this band pattern is quite important in the blastema formation mechanism proposed by the authors, this variability should be quantified and discussed by the authors. Chiefly, we would like to see a more rigorous quantification of the cell cycle parameters measured during regeneration.</p><p>2) It seems important to the arguments made by the authors to be able to monitor the interstitial to epithelial transition in the blastema. We would like to suggest that the authors monitor the appearance of epithelial markers in cells that are still GFP positive at the protein level but no longer at the transcript level. That way the authors could show that i-cells from the blastema differentiate into epithelial cells when the <italic>Piwi</italic> promoter becomes inactive. To get this result, the GFP protein should persist at least one or two days after transcripts disappear, that way the <italic>Piwi</italic>:GFP(+) i-cells would lose their interstitial GFP signature at the time they gain the epithelial one.</p><p>3) Some specificity controls for the RNAi experiments need to be presented. Since RNAi of the stem cell factors all have the same phenotype, it is suggested to knockdown a key cell cycle regulator and show that this affects EdU. It is also suggested to knockdown a gene that is not expressed in the i-cells and show that it has a different phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05506.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The phenotypes shown by the authors are quite convincing but the results shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>should be supported by quantitative data and statistical analysis regarding the different morphological and cellular phenotypes and kinetics of regeneration are missing.

Chiefly, we would like to see a more rigorous quantification of the cell cycle parameters measured during regeneration</italic>.</p><p>Regeneration experiments as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> have been carried out in our lab hundreds of times over the past years. These experiments have established that over 90% of healthy <italic>Hydractinia</italic> polyps regenerate their heads following decapitation within two-three days, but regeneration times in unhealthy or malnourished animals may last substantially longer. By contrast, very young polyps (i.e. shortly post metamorphosis) may regenerate an amputated head even faster, perhaps because at this stage they contain many more i-cells than fully grown ones. We have added some clarification statements to the text to address this point (in the first Results section).</p><p>As suggested, we performed anti-pH3 analysis of EdU pulse chased cells during head regeneration. Our results, presented in a new supplemental figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>), show that the blastema includes double positive cells, i.e. cells that were in S-phase in the band before decapitation, and in mitosis in the head blastema 24 and 48 hours later. These cells had migrated from the i-cell band to the blastema within this time frame.</p><p>The distribution of cycling cells in <italic>Hydractinia</italic> polyps largely depends on developmental stage and state of health. In young, post metamorphosed polyps one can find cycling cells throughout the body column and tentacles although the majority is still found in an aboral band. This is also true for newly growing, clonal polyps in a sexually mature colony. However, fully-grown polyps generally display a clear proliferation ‘band’ at the lower polyp body column, co-localizing with cells expressing stem cells associated genes. The width of the ‘band’ is variable, but cycling cells are only rarely observed in the head area or tentacles. As requested, we have now quantified it in an additional experiment and found that over 90% of all randomly selected polyps had displayed this pattern of proliferating cells. This is now also mentioned in the text.</p><p><italic>2) It seems important to the arguments made by the authors to be able to monitor the interstitial to epithelial transition in the blastema. We would like to suggest that the authors monitor the appearance of epithelial markers in cells that are still GFP positive at the protein level but no longer at the transcript level. That way the authors could show that i-cells from the blastema differentiate into epithelial cells when the</italic> Piwi <italic>promoter becomes inactive. To get this result, the GFP protein should persist at least one or two days after transcripts disappear, that way the</italic> Piwi<italic>:GFP(+) i-cells would lose their interstitial GFP signature at the time they gain the epithelial one</italic>.</p><p>Evidence for interstitial to epithelial transition in <italic>Hydractinia</italic> has been provided in at least two publications in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al. 2004</xref>, Dev Biol 275, 2015-224; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Künzel et al. 2010</xref>, Dev Biol 348, 120-129). Therefore, demonstrating that <italic>Piwi1</italic>+ i-cells can give rise to epithelial cells would not constitute a major scientific novelty in our opinion. In the regenerative context, however, we agree that we cannot exclude that epithelial cell proliferation and/or transdifferentiation had also contributed to the new head. Unfortunately, in the absence of a verified, exclusive marker for <italic>Hydractinia</italic> epithelial cells we are, at present, unable to perform the suggested experiments. Furthermore, we feel that the question of possible contribution of differentiated epithelial cells to head regeneration is not central to the point we are making in our paper. We have therefore toned-down our statement on the role of epithelial cells in head regeneration in the manuscript and hope to address this question in a future study.</p><p><italic>3) Some specificity controls for the RNAi experiments need to be presented. Since RNAi of the stem cell factors all have the same phenotype, it is suggested to knockdown a key cell cycle regulator and show that this affects EdU. It is also suggested to knockdown a gene that is not expressed in the i-cells and show that it has a different phenotype</italic>.</p><p>To strengthen our claim of RNAi specificity we used two new approaches in addition to the non-coding dsRNA (control RNAi) that has already been presented as control at first submission.</p><p>First, we performed qPCR on <italic>Piwi1</italic> RNAi animals to confirm a specific reduction of <italic>Piwi1</italic> transcript level (normalized to 18S). Second, as suggested, we knocked down two additional genes we expected to be important for cell cycle progression: histone H2A and histone H4. Indeed, treatment with H2A or H4 dsRNA almost completely abolished EdU incorporation comparing to non-coding dsRNA we used as control. These new results are now presented in a new supplemental figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Knocking down of any confirmed non-i-cell gene during regeneration might very well result in compromised regeneration. In particular, <italic>Ncol1</italic> (an exclusive nematoblast marker) knockdown did affect regeneration as we have shown and this would probably also be true for neural genes because <italic>Hydra</italic> head regeneration requires de novo neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miljkovic-Licina et al. 2007</xref>, Development 134, 1191-1201). Hence, it would be difficult to <italic>a priori</italic> select a gene that does not have a role in head regeneration since this complex process probably involves many genes.</p><p>We would also like to add that in the past we have used RNAi to knockdown various <italic>Hydractinia</italic> genes in various contexts and monitored distinct phenotypes for each knocked down gene (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al. 2010</xref>, Development 137, 3057-3066; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duffy et al. 2011</xref>, Dev Biol 362, 271-281; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Millane et al. 2011</xref>, Development 138, 2419-2439).</p><p>We therefore suggest that the new experiments described above, together with our published work, provide strong evidence for the specificity of RNAi in <italic>Hydractinia</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
