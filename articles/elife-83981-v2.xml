However, their characteristics in the pathological process of oral lichen planus (OLP) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in the process of OLP. By using single-cell RNA sequencing profiling and spatial transcriptomics, we revealed that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells were predominantly located in the lamina propria adjacent to the basement membrane and were significantly increased in patients with erosive oral lichen planus (EOLP) compared to those with non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP). Furthermore, these cells displayed enhanced cytokine production, including IFN-γ (Interferon-gamma, a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule), TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, a cytokine regulating inflammation), and IL-17 (Interleukin-17, a cytokine involved in immune response modulation), in patients with EOLP. And our clinical cohort of 1-year follow-up was also supported the above results in RNA level and protein level. In conclusion, our study provided a novel molecular mechanism for triggering OLP erosion by CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells to secrete multiple cytokines, and new insight into the pathological development of OLP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells</kwd><kwd>oral lichen planus</kwd><kwd>oral mucosal erosion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81730030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qianming</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CD8+ Trm cells' erosion role in oral lichen planus via IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL17 cytokines has been revealed, addressing a gap in recurrent erosion studies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease on the oral mucosa of unknown etiology mediated by T cells with a 1.01% global prevalence rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">González-Moles et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2022b</xref>). Its clinical manifestations are varied and chronic non-healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Radwan-Oczko, 2013</xref>). Especially, recurrent erosion or ulcers in patients with erosive oral lichen planus (EOLP) were mostly accompanied by pain and discomfort, which worsen when eating or speaking, and adversely affect the physical and mental health of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rotaru et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, EOLP has a significantly higher risk of malignant transformation than non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arduino et al., 2021</xref>). To reduce the psychological and economic burden of OLP patients, improve their quality of life, and decrease the risk of cancer, it is crucial to maintain the disease in a relatively stable non-erosive stage for as long as possible. However, clinical experience suggests that OLP often exhibits a prolonged and recurrent disease course, with alternating periods of non-erosive and erosive lesions. Despite this, the underlying causes and mechanisms of lesion type switching remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorouhi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The pathological feature of OLP is characterized by dense infiltration of T cells in the lamina propria, disruption of the basement membrane, and degeneration of basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies have shown that OLP patients have immune function disorders both locally and systemically, with the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the OLP lamina propria near the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Neppelberg et al., 2001</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are related to the liquefaction of basal cells, and it is believed that the immune microenvironment of OLP lesions has changed, especially in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which produce a complex network of cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL1α, and IL17, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Firth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Piccinni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shaker and Hassan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Viguier et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells are a recently described population of terminally differentiated T cells, which are crucial for local immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mueller et al., 2014</xref>). Trm cells are mainly present in various barrier tissues, where CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells can persist locally for a long time in the absence of relevant antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Szabo et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies had revealed that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells play important roles in the occurrence and development of many chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and vitiligo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eberle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Richmond et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Watanabe, 2019</xref>).</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells are considerable components of local immunity, yet their presence, distribution, and function in OLP are poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the presence and spatial distribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in different clinical manifestations of OLP, and to determine their functional role, especially in the context of the heterogeneity observed between NEOLP and EOLP. Additionally, the study aims to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of erosive lesions in OLP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the cell composition of OLP with different clinical subtypes</title><p>To investigate the cellular composition and comprehensive transcriptional effects of OLP, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of NEOLP (NEOLP, <italic>n</italic> = 3) and EOLP (EOLP, <italic>n</italic> = 2). The final dataset comprised 46,377 cells, with an average of 1743 genes per cell. Visualization using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) revealed 47 distinct cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that were annotated as 8 major cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although there was no significant difference in T cell proportion between NEOLP and EOLP, T cell was still the major cell proportion in EOLP. Surprisingly, although T cells, the hallmark cells of OLP, constituted the highest proportion of all samples, the proportion of cells in EOLP-2 was the lowest at 47.47%, while the proportion of T cells in the NEOLP-3 case is the highest at 71.93%. The cell composition analysis also revealed an increase in the proportion of B cells and myeloid cells in EOLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Our analysis of myeloid cells revealed some interesting findings. We observed that neutrophils were significantly more abundant in EOLP than NEOLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> ). Similarly, plasmacytoid (pDC) were also more common in EOLP compared to NEOLP. However, NEOLP had a higher number of myeloid (mDC) than EOLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Upon conducting GO analysis, we found that neutrophil cells in EOLP were significantly enriched in defense response and positive regulation of cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oral lichen planus (OLP) tissue transcription atlas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of 46,377 cells colored by cell type (erosive oral lichen planus, EOLP) (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP) (<italic>n</italic> = 3).

It may have contributed to the worsening of the clinical manifestations of OLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Further analysis of the significantly different genes between NEOLP and EOLP indicated that B2M, closely related to the stability of MHC class I molecules and antigen presentation, and HIF1A, which regulates immune cell function and inflammation, were found to be significantly expressed in EOLP. Moreover, the EOLP expressed a number of markers involved in the differentiation and function of Trm cells, including CD69, IL7R, CD7, FOS, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the difference between CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in EOLP and NEOLP, we performed differential expression analysis and found that the CD8<sup>+</sup>Trm marker gene CD69, GNLY which can play a cytotoxic role, and multiple pro-inflammatory factor-related genes, such as GZMB, IFNG, TNF, and PRF1, were significantly increased in the CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm subgroup in EOLP. These findings suggest that the CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm activity in EOLP may be significantly enhanced than NEOLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p><p>GO enrichment analysis indicated that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EOLP between NEOLP were more significantly enriched in pathways such as positive regulation of cytokine production, regulation of T cell activation, and positive regulation of cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). It shows that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm subsets in EOLP have a different state and expressions compared with NEOLP subsets, and may have a more active state and a greater ability to produce cytokine. The pseudotime analysis also suggests that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells may represent one of the terminal states of T cell differentiation and development in OLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), which may have a profound relationship with their clinical manifestations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spatial transcriptomics revealed CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells were adjacent to the epithelium of OLP and its products may induce epithelial erosion and promote the development of disease</title><p>Cell types, relative positions among cells, and the levels of gene expression of cell populations together determine their function in biological tissues.

Our findings suggest that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells play a crucial role in the pathological process of OLP and contribute to the erosion of OLP by secreting multiple cytokines.</p><p>We utilized scRNA-seq combined with spatial transcriptome to summarize the immune microenvironment of normal oral mucosa and OLP with different clinical subtypes. This study displayed that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells exist in OLP and normal tissues and the content of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in normal mucosa, NEOLP, and EOLP increased gradually. Compared with NEOLP, CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in EOLP were more extensive, especially in the epithelial deletion area. Pseudo-time analysis revealed that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells represent one of the terminal states of T cells in OLP.</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells may affect the biological process of OLP by releasing cytokines such as TNF, IFN, IL17, and the activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells was enhanced in EOLP. It is suggested that the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells may be strongly correlated with the clinical type of OLP. Previous studies have found that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells can produce IFN-γ, which is a key cytokine in response to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheuk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guidotti et al., 1996</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> Trms can also produce perforin and granzyme B upon IL15 stimulation to mediate cytotoxic responses that respond to infections by enhancing local immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheuk et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, IFN-γ upregulates the production of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, which recruits central memory T cells (TCM) and B cells to the site of Trm cell localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we constructed an OLP clinical follow-up cohort and performed bulk RNA-seq of local lesions in patients to further investigate the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in OLP progression. We found that compared with NEOLP, CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells marker genes and related factors were significantly increased in EOLP. Moreover, follow-up analysis revealed that the recurrent erosion group had significantly higher expression levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cell marker genes and related immune factors than the persistent non-erosion group, consistent with the EOLP results, which validated the accuracy and consistency of our findings. Multiple regression analyses based on OLP clinical cohort showed that multiple core genes of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm were closely related to OLP outcomes, which may be a significant factor leading to the deteriorative clinical outcome of OLP by causing repeated erosive lesions through local activation. Similarly, CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells also play a crucial part in the recurring aggravation of psoriasis. Even after the psoriatic skin lesions have disappeared, CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells can still be detected in the skin that seems normal. These cells have the potential to escalate local inflammation over time, trigger recurrent attacks at the same site, and generate a domino effect of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Owczarczyk Saczonek et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the distribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells was closely related to the erosion of epithelial tissue, and its content in EOLP was significantly higher than that in NEOLP. An ELISA test confirmed that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in EOLP tissue have enhanced ability to produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ compared with NEOLP, which may be an important promoting factor of epithelial erosion. Previous evidence suggests that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells protect the host against viruses by producing IFN-γ in lung tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2022a</xref>). Immune and inflammatory factors are considered to play an important role in the development of OLP, and cytokines IFN-γ may contribute greatly to the immune pathogenesis of OLP.</p><p>Recurrent episodes of autoimmune diseases are believed to be due, in part, to the persistence of local Trm cells that are difficult to eliminate entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Owczarczyk Saczonek et al., 2020</xref>). Immunosuppressive medications and local, or systemic corticosteroids are the main treatments for symptomatic OLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">García-Pola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Raj et al., 2021</xref>). We discovered that there was no statistically significant difference between medication therapy and repeated degradation of OLP in our cohort analysis. This might be because CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm is difficult for the present medications to entirely eradicate. Therefore, through a series of studies, we have confirmed that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells are not only increased in number but also functionally active in EOLP. These cells are primarily distributed in the lamina propria close to the basement membrane and release a variety of inflammatory factors. The release of excess cytokines such as IFN-γ may influence the clinical types and outcomes of OLP, making CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells an important promoting factor for the recurrent erosion of OLP. CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells may be a great important promoting factor for the recurrent erosion of OLP, which may become a potential immunotherapy target and provide new ideas for the treatment of OLP.</p><p>Our study has two limitations. Firstly, scRNA-seq was not performed on normal oral mucosal tissue to explore the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in the pathogenesis of OLP. Secondly, since there is currently no animal model for OLP, a cell co-culture model involving CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells could provide more evidence in further studies. Despite these limitations, our findings support that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells play a considerable role in the disease process of OLP and a critical factor in the worsening of its clinical manifestations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human samples</title><p>All individuals provided written informed consent and this study was supported by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University [WCHSIRB-2019-167].

And then normalized the data used the NormalizeData function. The canonical correlation analysis was performed using the normalized expression levels, the batch effect was corrected, and the data were integrated. <italic>Z</italic>-score normalization is performed on the integrated data, and principal component analysis (PCA) is performed using the normalized expression. The goal of PCA is to reduce the dimension of feature vectors by compressing the scale of the original data matrix, representing the most important features with the least dimension, and the new variable is a linear combination of the original variables, reflecting the comprehensive effect of the original variables. Dimensionality reduction through PCA reduced variables and finally clustered the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell-type subclustering and cell trajectory analysis</title><p>The prevalent cell types underwent subclustering.

Indeed, CD8<sup>+</sup> TRM was found in our study to be an important cause of changes in the local presentation of OLP (erosions), rather than a clear driver of disease; this has been revised and emphasized in the text.</p><p>“The purpose of writing in the introduction part of the article is changed as follows:</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells are considerable components of local immunity, yet their presence, distribution, and function in OLP are poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the presence and spatial distribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in different clinical manifestations of OLP, and to determine their functional role, especially in the context of the heterogeneity observed between NEOLP and EOLP. Additionally, the study aims to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of erosive lesions in OLP.” (Page 5, lines 8-14)</p><p>And the first paragraph of the Discussion section is then amended to read as follows:</p><p>“This study is the first to describe provide a comprehensive characterization of the presence, spatial distribution, and heterogeneity of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in OLP tissues in with different clinical manifestations, revealing possible regulatory mechanisms of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in OLP pathology. and to explore the regulatory mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in OLP pathology. Our findings suggest that CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells play a crucial role in the pathological process of OLP and contribute to the erosion of OLP by secreting multiple cytokines.” (Page 12, lines 4-10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please clarify why erosive vs. non-erosive is a critical distinction in light of data suggesting it is more of a spectrum.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Erosion is an important factor affecting the quality of life of patients and the frequency of visits to the doctor. OLP with repeated erosion is more likely to develop cancer, and OLP cannot be cured. Therefore, it is particularly important to minimize the occurrence of erosion in clinical practice. We have revised and emphasized in the text.</p><p>The modified description in introduction is as follows:</p><p>“Notably, EOLP has a significantly higher risk of malignant transformation than non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP) (Danielsson et al., 2013). To reduce the psychological and economic burden of OLP patients, improve their quality of life, and decrease the risk of cancer, it is crucial to maintain the disease in a relatively stable non-erosive stage for as long as possible. However, clinical experience suggests that OLP often exhibits a prolonged and recurrent disease course, with alternating periods of non-erosive and erosive lesions. Despite this, the underlying causes and mechanisms of lesion type switching remain unclear (Husein-ElAhmed and Steinhoff, 2022).” (Page 4, lines 13-21)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify the source of IL-23 as its unconventional interpretations of IL-23 biology are mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out our mistake. We made a mistake in the article writing. In our study, IL23A was not produced by T cells, but was significantly increased in erosive OLP, and IL-23A has the function of to receptors to activate memory T cells, so we analyzed that this may be one of the reasons for the increased Trm in erosive OLP, which has been modified in the text.</p><p>The reviewer pointed out that our erosive OLP sample was relatively weak in the single-cell part, so we added another case of erosive OLP later. After completely reanalyzing the single-cell part, the expression of IL23A in NEOLP and EOLP. The difference is not as good as other factors, The results of the redone analysis no longer involve IL23A, so we deleted it in the text and rewrote this part.</p><p>The modified description in this part is as follows:</p><p>“Further analysis of the significantly different genes between NEOLP and EOLP indicated that B2M, closely related to the stability of MHC class I molecules and antigen presentation, and HIF1A, which regulates immune cell function and inflammation, were found to be significantly expressed in EOLP.

We added the single-cell data of a patient with EOLP, and re-did the results of this part of the single-cell analysis. There is a good improvement in the quality of the article itself.</p><p>These include the first three sections of the results part.</p><p>“The number of cells contained in the final data set increased from 31,330 to 46,377, and the average number of genes per cell increased from 1470 to 1743. Visualization using Unified Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) showed a rise from 28 to 47 cell clusters annotated with 8 dominant cell types. Compared with previous studies, with the addition of new samples, our research conclusions have not changed significantly.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I don't understand the value of comparing NEOLP and EOLP lesions. EOLP is likely to be a more severe presentation of the same disease. Perhaps the data for NEOLP and EOLP could be pooled and compared with healthy oral mucosa to yield greater insight into OLP pathogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. OLP is a very complex immune-related disease, and its pathogenesis is very complicated. Therefore, there is no corresponding animal model at present. The focus of this study is not the cause of the disease, but the relationship between different clinical manifestations of the disease. At the same time, there are ethical issues, healthy people are not convenient to access their oral tissue. Therefore, this study did not involve normal tissue research controls. Due to the complex etiology of OLP, it may be the result of a multi-factor effect, and currently there is no cure. Erosion is an important factor affecting the quality of life of patients and the frequency of visits to the doctor, and OLP with repeated erosion is more likely to develop cancer, and OLP cannot be cured, so minimizing the occurrence of erosion is particularly important in clinical practice. In response to these problems, we have made modifications and clarifications in the article.</p><p>The modified description in introduction is as follows:</p><p>“Notably, EOLP has a significantly higher risk of malignant transformation than non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP) (Danielsson et al., 2013).

In this part, the difference analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> TRM core genes and inflammatory factor genes is carried out.

However, it is unclear to me what the impact of each indicated gene is on the clinical type and clinical outcome. In the Results section text, the authors state that &quot;CD69, Itga1, LITAF, SKIL, and cytokine-related genes such as… Were associated with two clinical outcomes of persistent non-erosion and recurrent erosion.&quot; Can the authors give more detail on how they reached this conclusion and how the data in Table 3 can be used to describe an association with a specific outcome or clinical type?</p></disp-quote><p>Our study correlated the expression of the core genes of CD8<sup>+</sup> TRM with the clinical diagnoses of OLP and the clinical outcomes of the cohort follow-up using regression analysis to exclude other interfering factors.</p><p>After modified and tweaked, the section as following:</p><p>“Through differential gene analysis, it was found that in NEOLP and EOLP, the expression of multiple core factors and effector cytokines or their receptor transcription factors of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells, including ITGA1, LITAF, SKIL, etc., and related immune factor receptors such as TNFRSF6B, IL17RA, IFNAR1, etc., were significantly increased in the EOLP than in the NEOLP (Figure S4A and S4B; Table 3). To further investigate the clinical relevance of these findings, we divided the clinical cohort into two groups based on the 1-year follow-up: the recurrent erosion (RE) group (the interval between erosions &lt;3 months) and the persistent non-erosion (PNE) group (≥3 months without any form of erosion). In addition to the above clinical factors being included in the two groups for statistical comparison, the diagnosis (NEOLP or EOLP) and medication (divided into three groups: local glucocorticoids, local glucocorticoids + immunosuppressant, and other drugs) were analyzed (Table 2), in which glucocorticoids were all used for local and external use. Differences in clinical information other than diagnosis were still not statistically significant for the clinical outcome of OLP. Moreover, the multiple core factors and effector cytokines of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells were found to be consistently upregulated in the recurrent erosion group, further supporting the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells in OLP progression (Figure S4C and S4D).</p><p>To mitigate confounding factors and minimize systematic bias, we employed multivariate logistic regression to analyze patients with different clinical types and outcomes of OLP. The multivariate logistic model was used to perform regression analysis on the effects of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm-related factors on the clinical manifestations and clinical outcomes of OLP after adjusting for clinical factors such as age, gender, smoking, and drinking. We found that the core genes of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells are closely related to the clinical manifestations of OLP, and the expression differences of marker genes such as ITGA1, LITAF, SKIL, and cytokine-related genes such as IL17RA, IFNG41, IFNAR1, and TNFRSF6B were statistically significant between the two clinical types. The core genes of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trm cells are also closely related to the erosion of OLP. Marker genes such as CD69, ITGA1, LITAF, SKIL, and cytokine-related genes such as IL17RA, IFNG41, IFNAR1, and GZMB are associated with two clinical outcomes of persistent non-erosion and recurrent erosion. The differences in expression were statistically significant and were significantly increased in the recurrent erosion group (Table 3).” (Page 9, lines 33-Page 11, lines 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Gating strategy is unclear, one cannot interpret these data without them.
