We explore how <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> utilises amino acids as nitrogen sources, using a combination of bacterial physiology and stable isotope tracing coupled to mass spectrometry metabolomics methods. Our results define core properties of the nitrogen metabolic network from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, such as: (i) the lack of homeostatic control of certain amino acid pool sizes; (ii) similar rates of utilisation of different amino acids as sole nitrogen sources; (iii) improved nitrogen utilisation from amino acids compared to ammonium; and (iv) co-metabolism of nitrogen sources. Finally, we discover that alanine dehydrogenase is involved in ammonium assimilation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, in addition to its essential role in alanine utilisation as a nitrogen source. This study represents the first in-depth analysis of nitrogen source utilisation by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and reveals a flexible metabolic network with characteristics that are likely a product of evolution in the human host.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41129.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. It is currently the leading cause of death by a single microbe worldwide, claiming the lives of 1.5 million people annually. The disease is difficult to cure, as many strains of the bacterium have developed resistance to the main drugs used to treat the infection. This leaves physicians with few options to treat tuberculosis and control its spread. The spread of these drug-resistant strains is a major global public health problem.</p><p>New strategies that do not lead to drug resistance are needed. One possibility would be to starve the bacterium. Like all living things, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> must eat to survive and spread. Right now, scientists do not know much about how this microbe eats. However, they do know that it needs nitrogen – an essential part of DNA, RNA, and proteins – to survive. Most bacteria like to consume ammonium as their main nitrogen source, but they may also use select amino acids as a nitrogen source.</p><p>Now, Agapova et al. show that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is not a picky eater. In the experiments, the bacteria were fed different nitrogen sources. Then, they tracked how well the bacteria grew. The experiments showed that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> happily eats many different amino acids and may use more than one as a nitrogen source at a time. It does not tightly control its stockpile of nitrogen sources the way other bacteria do, or use ammonium very efficiently.</p><p>This suggests that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has evolved to be very flexible in its dietary habits, which may explain why these bacteria can thrive in the varied environments within the human body. Knowing exactly how <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> acquires and uses nitrogen may help scientists design ways to thwart the process and starve the bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>nitrogen metabolism</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>stable isotope labelling</kwd><kwd>amino acid metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104785/B/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agapova</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Serafini</surname><given-names>Agnese</given-names></name><name><surname>Petridis</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>Luiz Pedro Sório</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Francis Crick Institute Core funding (10060)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>Debbie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Garza-Garcia</surname><given-names>Acely</given-names></name><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>Luiz Pedro Sório</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Francis Crick Institute Core funding (10060)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>Debbie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Garza-Garcia</surname><given-names>Acely</given-names></name><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>Luiz Pedro Sório</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Francis Crick Institute Core funding (10060)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>Debbie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Garza-Garcia</surname><given-names>Acely</given-names></name><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>Luiz Pedro Sório</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolomics and stable isotope labelling studies of virulent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> reveal a de-centralised metabolic network able to utilise various amino acids as nitrogen sources to a better extent than ammonium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human tuberculosis, caused by the bacillus <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, is now the greatest cause of death by a single infectious agent, surpassing deaths caused by HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">WHO, 2017</xref>). Tuberculosis is a complex and unique disease, whereby <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> evades eradication by the immune system and often by chemotherapy with antibiotics. As with other bacterial diseases, tuberculosis is increasingly drug resistant, with strains resistant to two front-line drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin (multi-drug resistant), and additional resistance to an injectable antibiotic and a quinolone (extensive-drug resistant) killing now over 500 thousand patients out of a total of 1,800,000 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">WHO, 2017</xref>). Although novel first-in-class antitubercular agents have been discovered in the last 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tiberi et al., 2018</xref>), resistance to these agents and important side effects might preclude their widespread utilization and hence the reversal of the epidemic.</p><p>We and others believe that failures in drug discovery programmes aimed at finding transformative antitubercular agents are in large part caused by our incomplete understanding of bacterial phenotypic diversity in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2009</xref>). Bacterial metabolic flexibility is thought to be essential for growth and survival in a variety of niches, where low pH, low oxygen tension, presence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and scarcity of nutrients are commonly found. Although we are aware and partially understand some of the effects of low oxygen and mild acidic pH on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eoh and Rhee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eoh et al., 2017</xref>), we clearly do not know the full complement of conditions and niches occupied by <italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic> In addition, we do not understand more fundamental aspects of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> nutrition and metabolism even in pure cultures devoid of host cells.</p><p>Despite all research carried out with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the last decades, we still lack fundamental understanding on how its unique metabolic network promotes survival in the human host, pathogenesis, and long-term persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rhee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ehrt et al., 2018</xref>). Most current knowledge of host-relevant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> metabolism spans central carbon metabolism (e.g. glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate bypass) (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ehrt et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, very little is known about nitrogen metabolism, in particular, we do not understand what are the essential features of nitrogen metabolism in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gouzy et al., 2014a</xref>). For example, while we understand how post-translational regulation of nitrogen metabolism operates in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carroll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O'Hare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pashley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Read et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rieck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parish and Stoker, 2000</xref>), transcriptional regulation of nitrogen metabolism in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is largely unknown. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lacks homologues for nearly all known bacterial transcriptional factors involved in nitrogen metabolism in other bacteria <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and the transcriptional factor <italic>GlnR</italic> does not perform canonical functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, it appears that <italic>GlnR</italic> regulates ammonia and nitrate uptake in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). Simple comparison of growth kinetics in identical culture medium reveals that <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth differs significantly, not only due to inherent growth rate differences, but also lag phase and final biomass achieved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, points to species-specific variations in nitrogen metabolism. Importantly, the vast majority of studies to date focused exclusively on either ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole physiologically relevant nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petridis et al., 2015</xref>) or employed surrogate fast-growing species such a <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> instead of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petridis et al., 2015</xref>). For example, <italic>GlnR</italic> of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is evolutionarily closer to the homologues present in <italic>Nocardia farcina</italic> and <italic>Rhodococcus sp.</italic> RHA1 than those found in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>M. bovis</italic> and <italic>M. avium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amon et al., 2009</xref>), which could indicate different functions of <italic>GlnR</italic> within the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> genus. This discrepancy indicates that <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> cannot be used as a model of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with regards to nitrogen metabolism.</p><p>A number of studies were published at the time the now common culture media for in vitro growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> were developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Proskauer and Beck, 1894</xref>). These studies provided rigorous and systematic analysis of the effect of amino acids as growth promoters for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In spite of this, four main issues preclude a deeper interpretation of the results obtained. First, cultures were not pre-adapted in the amino acids tested as sole nitrogen sources, leading to results that are likely partially distorted due to the nitrogen sources in the prior culture media. Second, cultures often contain multiple nitrogen sources, which complicate the analysis. Third, only recently nitrogen tracing was made possible by the use of modern high-resolution mass spectrometers and the use of labelled and position-specific labelled nitrogen sources. Finally, in a number of studies, qualitative results were reported instead of doubling times or growth rates, precluding direct comparisons between studies, conditions and/or species. In 2013–2014, two key studies unveiled an important aspect of host-relevant nitrogen metabolism in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, namely that host amino acids such as L-aspartate (Asp) and L-asparagine (Asn) are important sources of nitrogen during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gouzy et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gouzy et al., 2013</xref>). These findings open a new avenue in host-<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> relevant metabolism, revealing the use of organic nitrogen sources by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> during infection.</p><p>Although genomic data can be used to construct plausible sets of reactions that might form the core nitrogen metabolic network in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (such as the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), these models are to some extent incomplete and inaccurate. Utilization of host amino acids as nitrogen sources requires some distinct characteristics from the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> metabolic network, which have neither been described or formally investigated to date in model organisms and hence cannot be modelled based on such systems. Another important metabolic network property to be considered is the ability to co-metabolise multiple nutrient (nitrogen) sources.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41129.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Scheme of the core nitrogen metabolic network of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</title><p>1 – Glutamine synthetase (<italic>glnA</italic>1); 2 – glutamate synthase (<italic>gltBD</italic>); 3 – glutamate dehydrogenase (<italic>gdh</italic>); 4 – glutamate/oxaloacetate transaminase (<italic>aspB</italic>); 5 – glutamate/pyruvate transaminase (<italic>aspC</italic>); 6 – alanine dehydrogenase (<italic>ald</italic>); 7 – glutamate decarboxylase (<italic>gadB</italic>); 8 – aspartate/pyruvate transaminase (<italic>aspC</italic>); 9 – asparaginase (<italic>ansA</italic>).

We therefore decided to explore the structure and operation of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> core nitrogen metabolic network with amino acids as nitrogen sources, employing a combination of bacterial physiology, metabolomics and stable isotope labelling experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can take up all proteinogenic amino acids.</title><p>As a first investigation on amino acid uptake and utilization by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, we transferred bacteria-laden filters after 5 days’ growth on 7H10 media to individual fresh 7H10 agar plates containing 1 mM of each of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Cells were harvested 17 hr after transfer. Metabolites were extracted, separated, identified and quantified by liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, following procedures described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larrouy-Maumus et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of amino acid intracellular pool sizes vary only modestly when <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is grown in media containing sole nitrogen sources different to NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). However, an increase in intracellular pool size is observed for Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, Met, Pro, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Ser, Thr, Arg, and His when <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was cultured with the cognate amino acid as sole nitrogen source (highlighted in the diagonal of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Importantly, all amino acids present as sole nitrogen source alter the pool size of the cognate amino acid and/or other amino acid in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, demonstrating that they are taken up. On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> are replotted to illustrate individual amino acids changes obtained with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> grown with different amino acids as sole nitrogen sources. These data show the final concentrations in samples, not fold-change, compared to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> conditions. With few exceptions (Met and Trp) no change is observed in the summed amino acid pool size, when <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is incubated with different amino acids as the sole nitrogen source. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> contains the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> replotted as summed fold-change versus NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Trp and His as sole nitrogen sources display significant effects on the summed abundance, but most of the other amino acids do not significantly affect overall pool size. In other words, Trp and His are readily taken up by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and stored at high concentrations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> shows data for all amino acids, independent of nitrogen source. It is apparent that most amino acid concentrations are not significantly altered in different nitrogen sources. Also, it is noteworthy that some amino acid concentrations vary considerably in different nitrogen sources, (e.g. Pro, Asp, Gln, Glu and Ala). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> illustrates amino acid levels observed when the cognate amino acid or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl were used as sole nitrogen source. Data further illustrate that nearly all amino acid pool sizes are altered when the cognate amino acid is present in the growth medium, as sole nitrogen source. This data is also highlighted on the diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. Curiously, no change is observed in Leu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu and Lys when the respective cognate amino acid was added to the growth medium. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> illustrates the concentrations of Gln in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> when different amino acids or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl are present in the growth medium.

Pre-culture medium composition has been shown to affect carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>). We ‘pre-cultured’ <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in either standard Middlebrook 7H9 broth (containing Glu and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) or a 7H9<sup>NH4+</sup> broth (a synthetic version of Middlebrook 7H9 broth, with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as sole nitrogen source), prior to the experiment in 7H9<sup>NH4+</sup> broth.

Therefore, without pre-adaptation in the nitrogen source that will be tested, such experiments will likely always overestimate the potential of nitrogen sources. This is particularly problematic when working with compounds that are not able to serve as sole nitrogen source, or are poor sole nitrogen source. Based on these results, all experiments were carried out with cultures that were pre-adapted in a medium of identical composition to the test medium for at least 3 days (unless otherwise stated). Of note, a potential confounding factor in our experiments is the presence of carbon-containing nitrogen sources, such as amino acids, and carbon-free, such as NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which could lead to faster grown. However, our media contains an excess of carbon sources (2 g/L glucose and 2.52 g/L glycerol), and therefore it is unlikely that additional carbon in the form of amino acids can account for the results described below.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> shows representative growth curves obtained in Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, as sole nitrogen sources. All four amino acids were superior nitrogen sources to NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, at all concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>), both in terms of doubling rate and final biomass generated. It is noteworthy that pre-adaptation in medium with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl as sole nitrogen source shows that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can only optimally utilise NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as sole nitrogen source until up to 0.25 g/L (4.67 mM). Higher concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl lead to less growth, indicating that high concentrations of ammonium are toxic. Based on these results the following order represents the preferential utilisation of sole nitrogen sources (considering final biomass): Glu &gt; Asp &gt; Asn &gt; Gln &gt; NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, when pre-adapted cultures were grown in medium containing no nitrogen source, growth persisted in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). This limited growth is likely due to the low levels of ferric ammonium citrate (0.04 g/L) added to the medium as an iron source. Moreover, this growth was different, depending on nitrogen source: cells pre-adapted to Asp, Asn and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl allowed growth to an OD ~1.0, while those pre-adapted to Glu and Gln grew to OD ~0.2. To confirm the ‘metabolic conditioning effect’ induced by the pre-adaptation medium, we sub-cultured cells after 15 days into fresh medium (with only ferric ammonium citrate). Pre-adaptation with Glu and Gln again led to poor growth, while cells derived from medium containing Asp, Asn and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl grew to an OD ~1, in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). In similar experiments, where ferric citrate was used instead of ferric ammonium citrate, negligible growth was observed in derived from media containing Glu and Asp, while slightly better growth was observed with cells derived from media containing Gln, Asn and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).

To confirm which metabolic reactions are likely taking place, we performed labeling experiments with position-specific labelled Gln and Asn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>R</italic> values varied considerably, depending on the sole nitrogen source present and reactions needed to transfer the <sup>15</sup>N atom to individual metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).

As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, very little changes in the pool sizes of key metabolites from glycolysis and Krebs cycle are observed and those do not correlate with nitrogen source usage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Co-catabolism of amino acids does not improve growth</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has been shown to be able to co-catabolise carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>), resulting in a better growth than the one observed in individual carbon sources. Co-catabolism of carbon sources is a metabolic feature highly unusual in bacteria, which usually catabolise carbon sources sequentially, displaying biphasic (diauxic) growth kinetics. In the case of host-adapted pathogens, co-catabolism is thought to contribute to improved survival, although no direct knowledge of co-catabolism of nitrogen sources exists at present. To investigate the potential for this in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, we grew cells in media containing the following combinations of nitrogen sources: <sup>15</sup>N-Glu+<sup>14</sup>N-Gln, <sup>14</sup>N-Glu+U<sup>15</sup>N-Gln, <sup>15</sup>N-Asp+<sup>14</sup>N-Asn, or <sup>14</sup>N-Asp+U<sup>15</sup>N-Asn. All nitrogen source combinations lead to robust labelling of Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is indeed able to take up and co-metabolise nitrogen sources. Extracted ion chromatograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) show significant <sup>15</sup>N metabolism in all conditions (i.e. high levels of labelled metabolites in the absence of labelled nitrogen sources). Mass spectral data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) show that Gln (initially labelled or unlabelled) has been metabolised extensively, generating all three isotopologues (<sup>14</sup>N<sub>2</sub>, <sup>14</sup>N<sup>15</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>). Mass spectral analysis further confirms that no Asn is being synthesised in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, as no labelled Asn (<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> or <sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>) is found when <sup>15</sup>N-Asp is used as nitrogen source and no <sup>15</sup>N-Asn is present when <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-Asn is provided as nitrogen source. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> provides average values and errors for labelling of Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn and Ala, in dual nitrogen sources. Interestingly, Ala labelling appears to derive mainly from Asn, rather than Asp. This suggests that Asn is being hydrolysed to Asp and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and likely that Ala is either a main entry point for <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or it serves as nitrogen storage. This result is in strict agreement with the very fast and extensive label incorporation of Ala when using <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or <sup>15</sup>N-Asn as sole nitrogen sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and h</xref>).

Genetic disruption of <italic>ald</italic> completely abolished the ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to grow when Ala was the sole nitrogen source, with no effect when NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or Gln were sole nitrogen sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). These results demonstrate that alanine dehydrogenase is essential for assimilation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> from Ala, as shown elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giffin et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, growth was also significantly diminished in the <italic>ald</italic>-knockout strain when Asp was the sole nitrogen source; however, only partial complementation was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Growth of parent, <italic>ald</italic>-knockout and complemented strains was indistinguishable in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as sole nitrogen source, confirming that <italic>ald</italic> is not the main route for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. This secondary role of alanine dehydrogenase in assimilation is further supported by lack of changes in label incorporation into Glu, Gln and Ala when parent, <italic>ald</italic>-knockout, and complemented strains were grown with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>Cl or <sup>15</sup>N-Gln (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Final evidence for the essentiality of alanine dehydrogenase in nitrogen assimilation from Ala and secondary role during <sup>15</sup>N assimilation was obtained using the inhibitors of alanine dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, bromo-pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellion and Tan, 1987</xref>) and methionine sulfoximine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harth and Horwitz, 1999</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e and f</xref>). Bromo-pyruvate partially inhibits growth when NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, Ala and Glu are used as sole nitrogen source, but not in Gln. In addition to alanine dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase is likely also partially inhibited at the concentrations tested, leading to the phenotype observed with bromo-pyruvate in Glu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, top panels). Methionine sulfoximine completely abrogated growth in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and to a less extent in Ala and Glu but not in Gln as the sole nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, bottom panels). Together, these results demonstrate that alanine dehydrogenase is essential for utilisation of Ala as sole nitrogen source, but not the main route for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation, a task undertaken primarily by glutamine synthetase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite knowing that amino acids can be used by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in vitro for over one hundred years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Proskauer and Beck, 1894</xref>) only in 2013 and 2014 the first two reports of amino acid utilisation as nitrogen sources by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> during infection were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gouzy et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gouzy et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these studies, we set out to evaluate how <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> utilises nitrogen derived from amino acids in comparison to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.</p><p>An unbiased parallel analysis of amino acid uptake and metabolism reveals for the first time that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can uptake all 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Of interest, it seems that several amino acids can be stored in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, leading to a significant increase in pool size. Such dramatic increase in pool size indicates that the levels of certain amino acids are not homeostatically controlled, but might partially reflect the composition of the medium where bacteria grow. These results coupled with growth kinetic analysis indicates that Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn, Ala are taken up and rapidly metabolised, as sole nitrogen sources, while all the remaining proteinogenic amino acids are taken up by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, but are not utilised as sole nitrogen sources. This accumulation indicates that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> metabolic network is adapted to uptake all amino acids, but not necessarily utilise their carbon and nitrogen atoms. For example, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome lacks genes commonly utilised to degrade histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole et al., 1998</xref>). The α amino group from these amino acids could in theory be transferred and serve as a nitrogen source, however as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cannot catabolise the residual α-keto acid this would likely lead to their intracellular accumulation which in turn would acidify the cytosol, in addition to affect other cellular processes. In contrast, the inability to extract nitrogen from valine, isoleucine and threonine cannot be easily explained, as these amino acids can be degrade or re-routed. Likely the overall architecture of the nitrogen metabolic network, kinetic properties of each of its enzymes, and actual pool size of its key metabolites has a dominant effect on directionality of reactions and actual metabolic flux.</p><p>One of the most important results we obtained is that several amino acids are superior nitrogen sources, compared to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. These results indicate that the vast majority of studies carried out to date on nitrogen metabolism of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> using NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as sole nitrogen source are likely not relevant to physiologic conditions found in the host. More emphasis should be put into microbiological research with amino acids and complex mixtures, as oppose to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, as sole nitrogen sources. Of note, similar experiments carried out with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic> (doubling time ~once per 20 min) revealed first-order labelling rates of 14.9, 0.8, &gt;1.6 and 2.8 min<sup>−1</sup> for Gln, Glu, Ala and Asp, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>). Our results with <italic>M. tuberculosis, which doubles every 20 hr,</italic> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> are: 9.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, 3.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, 7.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and 3.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> for Gln, Glu, Ala and Asp, respectively. These labelling rates are approximately 1500-, 216-, &gt;213-, and 800-fold slower than in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Therefore, it seems that <italic>E. coli</italic> takes and utilises nitrogen from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> between 3- and 26-fold faster, taking into account the doubling rate. Labelling of Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn, Ala and GABA in amino acids as sole nitrogen sources is up to 10-times faster than in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>as sole nitrogen source, which supports our hypothesis that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has evolved to utilise preferentially host amino acids as nitrogen sources, and to a lesser extent NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.</p><p>Nitrogen sources containing more than one nitrogen atom, such as Gln and Asn, were for the first time evaluated with respect to the mobilisation of individual nitrogen atoms. This can only be directly investigated using position-specific labelled Gln and Asn. Our metabolomics results reveal that both nitrogen atoms from Gln and Asn are utilised by <italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic> This result is not easily predicted, as the ability of these to serve as a sole nitrogen sources cannot be deduced from growth kinetics alone. In fact, analysis of position-specific nitrogen utilisation reveals how misleading growth kinetics alone might be as surrogate of uptake/utilization of nutrients. Both Glu and Asp, containing a single nitrogen atom, lead to greater biomass, than Gln and Asn, containing two nitrogen atoms.</p><p>Kinetic analysis of nitrogen metabolism employing <sup>15</sup>N-labelled single nitrogen sources (Gln, Glu, Asn, Asp and Ala) reveals that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> metabolic network appears to be highly evolved to use very well a number of nitrogen sources, despite <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ability to biosynthesise all amino acids. All nitrogen sources tested are able to ‘donate’ their nitrogen atoms relatively fast, compared to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.</p><p>Co-metabolism of nitrogen sources has never been directly evaluated in any mycobacteria, and only modestly explored in other bacteria. Employing a <sup>15</sup>N-labelled nitrogen source in combination with a <sup>14</sup>N-containing nitrogen source, we demonstrate that at least Glu/Gln and Asp/Asn are simultaneously used by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. As we have suggested for carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>), this is a characteristic that is likely important during growth under low nutrient levels, such as when <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is found in nutrient-restricted reservoirs intra- or extracellularly. Co-metabolism must lead to a more compartmentalised/optimised used of the metabolic network. Contrary to the results obtained with carbon sources which clearly indicate an advantage of co-metabolism, no growth advantage (doubling-rate and final biomass) is observed with the combined nitrogen sources tested.</p><p>Of interest, Ala appears to be labelled faster than Glu, using a number of sole nitrogen sources. This behaviour could not be expected or explained based on our current understanding of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> metabolism. Employing <italic>ald</italic> knockout and complemented strains, labelled nitrogen sources, and inhibitors of key nitrogen metabolic enzymes we show that this behaviour is likely due to the reversal of reaction catalysed by alanine dehydrogenase (reductive amination of pyruvate). Our data also reveal that alanine dehydrogenase is absolutely essential for utilisation of Ala as sole nitrogen source, in agreement with the result from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giffin et al. (2012)</xref>. Given that the Ala pool size dramatically increases during growth in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and in Gln, but the enzyme is not essential for growth in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and in Gln as sole nitrogen source it is likely that Ala represents a quickly accessible route to store nitrogen in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Nitrogen is thought to ‘freely’ move between molecules once it has been assimilated into Gln and Glu. The latter, is thought to be able to donate its nitrogen atom via a number of transaminases encoded in the genome. Our data does not support such an unregulated and freely reversible exchange. Although transamination reactions are usually fast and have equilibrium constants close to unit, large disparities in the pool sizes of amino acids and related α-keto acids likely impart a single viable direction of nitrogen flow. For example, alanine dehydrogenase is not essential for Ala biosynthesis in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, given that the <italic>ald</italic> knockout strain is not an Ala auxotroph. This supports the existence and functioning of a <italic>bona fide</italic> glutamate/pyruvate transaminase in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and/or the presence of another alanine synthesising pathway/enzyme which can provide enough Ala to support cell wall and protein biosynthesis. Our data unambiguously demonstrates that Ala cannot donate its nitrogen to α-KG, producing Glu and pyruvate. If this is true for other transaminases, it would indicate that Glu is the source of nitrogen for transaminations in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, but only made from glutamate synthase and/or glutamate dehydrogenase, instead of by transamination of amino acids and α-KG. Consequently, amino acids that do not possess alternative enzymatic systems able to remove the α nitrogen, such as dehydrogenases, will likely not serve as nitrogen sources.</p><p>Together, these results reveal a number of cellular and molecular details about nitrogen metabolism in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> which have escaped detection over the last few decades. Some of these behaviours and characteristics are unique and are likely the results of tens of thousands of years of adaptation to optimise grow and persist in humans as the sole or principal natural reservoir. This extreme ecologic adaptation appears to have shaped <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> into an ‘opportunistic’ nutritional generalist. That is, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is able to synthesise every molecule required for its survival but also able to uptake and metabolise a number of different carbon and nitrogen sources from the host.</p><p>The ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to uptake and utilise a number of proteinogenic amino acids as nitrogen sources likely makes nitrogen uptake an uninviting target for the development of novel antitubercular agents. On the other hand, the ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to uptake amino acids which cannot serve as nitrogen sources and might be toxic will likely teach us the true biochemical and metabolic constraints of this pathogen, some of which might find application in drug discovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Solvent A was acetonitrile with 0.2% acetic acid and solvent B was ddH2O with 0.2% acetic acid. Reference mass solution (G1969-85001, Agilent Technologies) was used for continuous mass axis calibration. Analytical amino acids standards (Fluka A9906) was used for retention time match. Ions were identified based on their accurate mass, retention time and spectral information, yielding errors below five ppm. Spectra were analysed using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B.07.00 and MassHunter Profinder B.08.00 software.

Cells were harvested at an OD<sub>600</sub> between 0.8 and 1.0. RNA was extracted using Fast RNA Pro Blue kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was removed by treatment with 3 U RNase-free DNase using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions and cleaned following RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The concentration of the RNA was determined using a NanoDrop One (Thermo) (Promega) spectrophotometer. Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed using SuperScript IV (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions for cDNA synthesis. After cDNA synthesis, qPCR was carried out using the PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix with ROX (Applied Biosystems) on a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System. SigE (Rv1221) was used as an internal standard, and the ddCt method was used for the calculation of gene expression ratios. Error bars represent standard deviations from three biological replicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr James McRae (TFCI) for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Voskuil (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The submission by de Carvalho and colleagues reports a comprehensive analysis of nitrogen assimilation into amino acids in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The study demonstrates that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has the ability to import all 20 proteinogenic amino acids and unlike <italic>Escherichia coli, M. tuberculosis</italic> does not retain homeostatic control over amino acid pools. This work further shows that Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn and Ala can serve as nitrogen sources in contrast to other amino acids and are superior nitrogen sources when compared to free ammonium. The enzymatic mechanisms underlying the nitrogen transfer between Glu, Gln, Asp and Asn are demonstrated using stable isotope labelled amino acids and it is further demonstrated that these amino acids can be co-metabolized as nitrogen sources. An intriguing pattern of transfer of nitrogen to alanine is observed, which demonstrates that this amino acid is central in nitrogen metabolism, with alanine dehydrogenase playing a critical role in nitrogen assimilation. The data argue against Glu/Gln being the starting point for downstream free exchange of nitrogen between various amino- and ketometabolites. Instead, there is a very specific directionality with respect to nitrogen transfer. Overall, this is an in-depth thorough study of nitrogen assimilation and incorporation into key metabolites in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> showing aspects of nitrogen assimilation and control of biosynthesis of key amino acid that differs significantly from model bacteria.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) The demonstration that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has the capacity to import all 20 amino acids and that intracellular pools are not homeostatically controlled but rather depend on extracellular abundance.</p><p>2) Using preconditioned cultures, Glu, Gln, Asp and Asn emerge as good nitrogen sources to support growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> when compared to ammonium. Both nitrogen atoms from Gln and Asn are used by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>3) The demonstration that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can co-catabolize two nitrogen sources however, this does not lead to a growth advantage as has been previously established for carbon co-catabolisation.</p><p>4) The authors resolve seemingly paradoxical observation regards Ala metabolism by demonstrating that alanine dehydrogenase is required for metabolism of Ala as a sole nitrogen source.</p><p>5) The demonstration of directionality with respect to nitrogen transfer, for example, the data showing that alanine cannot be transaminated directly with ketoglutarate as co-substrate.</p><p>Major Comment:</p><p>1) One of the most interesting findings from this study is the fact that pre-growth in Asp, Asn and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl allowed for much more growth after removal of nitrogen sources compared to pre-growth with Glu or Gln. Unfortunately, this finding was not pursued. There is a possibility that trace ammonium from the iron source of ferric ammonium citrate, was responsible for this. This experimental design introduces an unnecessary confounder to an otherwise carefully conducted study. A preferable approach would be to use an iron source that does not contain ammonium for this experiment to demonstrate if different nitrogen sources may allow for differences in nitrogen storage.

Unfortunately, this finding was not pursued. There is a possibility that trace ammonium from the iron source of ferric ammonium citrate, was responsible for this.

We initially thought that the trace ammonium derived from ferric ammonium citrate would not be a problem. In fact, it is only a problem under “no nitrogen” conditions. We carried out the experiment requested by the reviewers twice, independently, and we show that under strict “no nitrogen” only very slight growth is observed, now shown in Figure 3F. We opted to keep the data shown in Figure 3E, as that is a better mimic of the standard 7H9 broth used by many labs. But clarified in the text that the experiment in Figure 3F is the correct “no nitrogen” one.</p><p>The text now reads “In similar experiments, were ammonium citrate was used instead of ferric ammonium citrate, negligible growth is observed in derived from media containing Glu and Asp, while slightly better growth was observed with cells derived from media containing Gln, Asn and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (Figure 3F). These results indicate that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> does not store nitrogen to any major extent.” And “When traces of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> are present but no added nitrogen sources have been included, prior sole nitrogen exposure does have an effect on growth, likely indicative of complex metabolism which probably also involves carbon metabolism.<italic>”</italic> </p></body></sub-article></article>
