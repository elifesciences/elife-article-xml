In particular, light-controlled protein degradation is a valuable mechanism of regulation because it can be highly modular, used in tandem with other control mechanisms, and maintain functionality throughout growth phases. Here, we engineered LOVdeg, a tag that can be appended to a protein of interest for inducible degradation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using blue light. We demonstrate the modularity of LOVdeg by using it to tag a range of proteins, including the LacI repressor, CRISPRa activator, and the AcrB efflux pump. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of pairing the LOVdeg tag with existing optogenetic tools to enhance performance by developing a combined EL222 and LOVdeg system. Finally, we use the LOVdeg tag in a metabolic engineering application to demonstrate post-translational control of metabolism. Together, our results highlight the modularity and functionality of the LOVdeg tag system and introduce a powerful new tool for bacterial optogenetics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>protein engineering</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0019387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunlop</surname><given-names>Mary J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CBET-1804096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunlop</surname><given-names>Mary J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI102922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunlop</surname><given-names>Mary J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM130546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coriano-Ortiz</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 EB006359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheets</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The LOVdeg tag is a versatile tool for bacterial optogenetics, offering modular, blue light-inducible protein degradation for a range of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Currently, the most widely used optogenetic systems in bacterial synthetic biology rely on transcription to modulate gene expression. Light-responsive transcription factors allow genes of interest to be controlled modularly without having to re-engineer promoters. These tools have provided a valuable means to probe regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dessauges et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harrigan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lugagne and Dunlop, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olson et al., 2014</xref>). However, these networks can be governed by complex control, where post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms work in concert with transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chubukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Link et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mahmoud and Chien, 2018</xref>). Light-responsive regulators that act beyond transcription are necessary to more fully mimic natural biology and have the potential to improve upon current deficits of transcriptional control. In synthetic contexts, transcriptional regulation suffers from limited response dynamics. For example, in the case of gene deactivation, decreasing protein abundance is limited by cell division-based dilution or natural protein half-lives, which are in the range of 5–20 hr for the majority of proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maurizi, 1992</xref>). When cells are growing in exponential phase, the effective degradation rate of these long-lived proteins is controlled by the cell cycle time, which is on the order of 0.5 hr. However, at high cell densities, such as during stationary phase, slow growth rates result in protein half-lives on the scale of tens of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maier et al., 2011</xref>). Subpopulations of cells in stationary phase have been reported to proliferate; however, these growing subpopulations are small compared to non-growing cells and add to heterogeneous protein half-lives within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jõers et al., 2020</xref>), making it challenging to reliably remove proteins. It should be noted that a proportion of proteins are actively degraded during slow growth, but these represent the minority in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>). This is a critical issue for metabolic engineering where chemical production is typically carried out at stationary phase in two-stage fermentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lalwani et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Post-translational optogenetic control has the potential to address some of the shortcomings of transcriptional regulation because post-translational control mechanisms can function independently of growth-based dilution. Existing approaches to post-translational optogenetic control include the use of light-inducible dimers in split protein systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumschlager et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nihongaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tague et al., 2023</xref>), domain insertions with light-controlled allosteric domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>), and membrane-confined functional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These approaches, however, suffer from a lack of modularity, which is a key benefit of the transcriptional control approaches. Split protein systems and domain insertions can require significant engineering for each protein of interest and solutions for a given protein are unlikely to map to proteins with different structures. Likewise, localization-based approaches are only applicable to a small subset of proteins that have position-dependent function, such as transcription factors that require nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yumerefendi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Protein degradation offers potential as a modular post-translational mechanism of control. Endogenous proteolytic machinery is necessary for proteome homeostasis and acts as a global regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mahmoud and Chien, 2018</xref>). Targeted proteolysis has proven useful in many synthetic biology applications in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron and Collins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGinness et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morreale et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trauth et al., 2019</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, light-dependent protein degradation has been demonstrated using various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Renicke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xue et al., 2019</xref>). For example, Bonger et al. utilized the LOV2 domain of <italic>Avena sativa</italic> phototropin 1 (<italic>As</italic>LOV2) to achieve light-dependent protein degradation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonger et al., 2014</xref>). LOV2 is a blue-light-responsive protein that is widely used in optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pudasaini et al., 2015</xref>). LOV2 contains a core Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain surrounded by N- and C-terminal α-helices. Upon blue light illumination, the LOV2 protein undergoes a conformational change where the C-terminal Jα helix reversibly unfolds and becomes unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halavaty and Moffat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>). Incorporation of a degradation-targeted peptide sequence into the C-terminal results in light-dependent protein degradation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Renicke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, the bacterial proteasome differs from the eukaryotic proteasome in many ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mahmoud and Chien, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schrader et al., 2009</xref>). The bacterial proteasome includes several proteases with divergent targeting behaviors and does not utilize ubiquitin as a generalized modification to trigger degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Finley, 2009</xref>). In bacteria, protein targeting for degradation is predominantly dependent on primary amino acid sequence as opposed to a ubiquitin-like appendage and, apart from certain well-studied cases, the rules governing sequence recognition of bacterial degrons are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Sauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Striebel et al., 2009</xref>). Because of these complexities, light-dependent degradation systems for bacteria have lagged behind their eukaryotic counterparts, where interaction of a ubiquitin ligase with a defined degron can be used as a control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondeson et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, optogenetic degradation remains a key target for bacterial synthetic biology applications. In principle, an optogenetic degradation system could be fast-acting, modular, and interface with endogenous proteasome machinery. These features would provide a straightforward way of adding dynamic control to a protein of interest, complementing existing transcriptional tools for optogenetic control of gene expression. One recent system developed by Komera et al. utilizes a light-responsive split TEV protease to expose or remove constitutively active degradation tags in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Komera et al., 2022</xref>). Although this system achieves protein degradation in response to light, it acts indirectly through activation of an exogenous protease. A simpler approach where the degradation tag itself is light responsive would streamline this by eliminating the need for multiple exogenous components.</p><p>Here, we develop LOVdeg, a modular protein tag based on the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 protein that is conditionally degraded in response to blue light in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We demonstrate that attaching this tag to a protein of interest confers light-dependent protein instability. We show the modularity of the LOVdeg tag by incorporating it into multiple proteins with widely varying function, converting them all into optogenetically controlled systems. In addition, through photocycle-stabilizing mutations, we create a version of the LOVdeg tag that responds to infrequent exposure to blue light. We also demonstrate that our degradation tag can be used in concert with other optogenetic systems for multilayer control by using EL222, a blue-light-responsive system for transcriptional control, together with LOVdeg. Lastly, we incorporate optogenetic degradation into a metabolically engineered strain to control production of octanoic acid. Overall, this work introduces a new bacterial optogenetic tool that overcomes several drawbacks of transcriptional control by providing post-translational degradation, while avoiding the need for substantial protein engineering that can be required for alternative post-translational control mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and characterization of the <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based degradation tag</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> proteasome consists of five AAA+ proteases and is continuously active, either degrading misfolded proteins for quality control or balancing regulatory protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mahmoud and Chien, 2018</xref>). We set out to exploit the endogenous proteasome activity in order to design a light-responsive protein tag. To do this, we took insight from studies related to native protein quality control. In bacteria, peptides from stalled ribosomes are targeted for degradation through interaction with a tmRNA that appends a short amino acid sequence, known as an SsrA tag, to the C-terminal end of the incomplete protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keiler, 2015</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> SsrA tag has been studied extensively and is known to interact with the unfoldases ClpX and ClpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flynn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gottesman et al., 1998</xref>). Addition of the SsrA peptide sequence to exogenous proteins targets them for degradation by the host proteasome. SsrA-mediated degradation has proven useful in synthetic gene circuit function and biochemical production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elowitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gurbatri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stricker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Torella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). A recent structural study of ClpX interacting with the SsrA tag from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fei et al., 2020</xref> demonstrated that in order for ClpX to unfold a tagged protein, the C-terminal tail needs to be unstructured and sufficiently long to fit into the ClpX pore. We reasoned that the mechanism of <italic>As</italic>LOV2, in which the C-terminal Jα helix becomes unstructured upon blue light absorption, could be utilized to provide light-inducible protein degradation.</p><p>Biochemical studies have probed the amino acid sequence of the SsrA tag and its role in degradation targeting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flynn et al., 2001</xref> demonstrated that ClpA and ClpX unfoldases interact with overlapping residues within the SsrA sequence and that the last three amino acids (L-A-A) are particularly important for successful degradation. Importantly, they also showed that mutation of the leucine in the C-terminal ‘L-A-A’ lowers unfoldase affinity but does not hinder degradation completely. We noticed that the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domain, comprised of residues 404–546 of <italic>Avena sativa</italic> phototropin 1, are ‘E-A-A’ at positions 541–543 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The dark state structure of the native <italic>As</italic>LOV2 domain (PDB: 2V1A) shows that these three amino acids and K544 complete the folded Jα helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). A truncation of residues 544–546 leaves the Jα helix largely intact and the resulting C-terminal ‘E-A-A’ remains caged as part of the folded helix as seen upon examination of the dark state structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We hypothesized that this truncation would be stable in the dark state as a consequence of ‘E-A-A’ caging and unstable in the light state due to Jα helix unfolding and exposure of an unstructured degradation tag.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based degradation tag.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Primary sequence of <italic>As</italic>LOV2(546) C-terminal sequence.

To the best of our knowledge, wild-type or truncated <italic>As</italic>LOV2, with its C-terminal end exposed, have not been used for proteolytic degradation in bacterial cells. To test the stability of C-terminal <italic>As</italic>LOV2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> in response to light, we constructed a plasmid where we used an IPTG-inducible promoter to control the expression of mCherry translationally fused to <italic>As</italic>LOV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In this construct, the full C-terminal sequence is intact so unfoldases are not expected to have good access for protein degradation. Consistent with this, induction of mCherry-<italic>As</italic>LOV2(546) with IPTG increased expression of the fusion construct, and 465 nm blue light induction resulted in only a modest decrease in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Next, we tested a version of the construct where three amino acids were truncated to expose the C-terminal ‘E-A-A’, <italic>As</italic>LOV2(543). This construct destabilized the protein fusion as predicted, resulting in significantly lower protein expression compared to the non-truncated version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). However, counter to our expectations, we observed only a modest decrease in protein levels upon blue light induction.</p><p>While <italic>As</italic>LOV2 switches from mostly folded in the dark state to mostly unfolded in the light state, both states are present at an equilibrium with or without light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Due to the suboptimal equilibrium of native <italic>As</italic>LOV2, dark state undocking and unfolding of the Jα helix is a common issue in <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based optogenetic tools, and many studies have aimed at improving the dynamic range of <italic>As</italic>LOV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lungu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strickland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Guntas et al. performed phage display on an <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based protein that incorporates a caged peptide sequence in the Jα helix. They identified a variant with 11 amino acid substitutions with much tighter dark state caging, called iLID. Interestingly, several of these mutations do not have a direct interaction with the caged peptide, but instead are located at the hinge loop connecting the PAS domain to the Jα helix or in the PAS domain itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Guntas et al. further characterized amino acid substitutions and determined several that did not affect caging or dynamic range if reverted (F502Q, H521R, and C530M). We focused on the mutations found to result in tighter dark state caging (L493V, H519R, V520L, D522G, G528A, E537F, N538Q, and D540A) and reasoned that this set should stabilize the Jα helix irrespective of the caged peptide. Thus, we next constructed a variant of <italic>As</italic>LOV2 with these eight mutations, which we denote as <italic>As</italic>LOV2*.</p><p>To test whether these mutations are beneficial in the context of protein stabilization, we fused <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(546) or <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(543) to mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). mCherry with non-truncated <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(546) expressed highly with the addition of IPTG, but blue light did not result in a decrease in mCherry levels, consistent with lack of access by proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In contrast, the truncated version containing the mutations, <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(543), displayed the desired light-induced degradation, expressing highly in the dark and exhibiting 11.5× lower expression in response to blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We also confirmed that <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(543) expression was decreased in response to light without any IPTG induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(543) is degraded more in response to light relative to <italic>As</italic>LOV2(543). We conducted experiments to identify the mechanism underlying <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(543) degradation and found evidence that ClpA is involved, and other proteases and unfoldases play complementary roles (Supplementary text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). We also verified that light exposure itself did not affect mCherry protein levels or growth by conducting experiments with an IPTG-inducible mCherry without any <italic>As</italic>LOV2 variant fused and exposing cells to blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). We chose to move forward with the <italic>As</italic>LOV2*(543) variant due to its light-inducible properties, and we denoted this variant as the ‘LOVdeg’ tag.</p><p>Next, we used the LOVdeg tag to test the impact of light intensity and the timing of light exposure. We found that the LOVdeg tag is destabilized in proportion to light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), making it straightforward to tune degradation by adjusting light levels. In addition, a key advantage of protein degradation-based mechanisms is that they should function at a range of growth phases. We tested this by varying when we applied blue light, ranging from early exponential to stationary phase. We found that light-dependent decreases in protein levels can be achieved at various stages of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>To benchmark the degradation capacity of the LOVdeg tag, we compared it to protein levels of mCherry subject to constitutive degradation via addition of an SsrA tag. In order to maintain comparable transcription and translation, we appended an iLID <italic>As</italic>LOV2 derivative, which was modified to contain a full-length SsrA sequence, to the IPTG-inducible mCherry. As expected, mCherry-iLID-SsrA expressed poorly independent of IPTG induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). To quantify the light-dependent degradation of the LOVdeg tag, we compared its dark state expression level to that of mCherry-iLID-SsrA. Using this comparison, light-induced degradation of the LOVdeg tag reached 6× degradation compared to 14× for the SsrA tag. However, the comparison between these two is convoluted by the time required to degrade the protein in response to light, making it challenging to directly compare these numbers.</p><p>A potential concern is that light-induced disorder of the Jα helix could result in a decrease in solubility and aggregation of the LOVdeg tag. To rule this out as the cause of the fluorescence decrease, we captured microscopy images of cells in dark and light conditions. The imaging confirmed a light-dependent decrease in mCherry expression without the formation of visible protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>). Thus, the LOVdeg tag variant provides blue light-dependent protein degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modularity of the LOVdeg tag</title><p>Post-translational control of protein function can require significant protein engineering for each use case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sheets et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tague et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). Degradation tags, by contrast, offer post-translational control that theoretically requires little to no protein engineering and is protein agnostic. To test the modularity of the LOVdeg tag, we incorporated optogenetic control into three systems with highly diverse functions and relevance to synthetic biology and biotechnology applications: the LacI repressor, CRISPRa activation, and the AcrB efflux pump.</p><p>First, we sought to test whether the LOVdeg tag could be fused to transcription factors to enable light-dependent regulation. The LacI repressor is a widely used chemically inducible system in synthetic biology. We translationally fused the LOVdeg tag to LacI and paired it with a reporter where the LacUV5 promoter controls expression of mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Our results show that light exposure successfully increased mCherry expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Light-induced mCherry expression did not achieve the full levels provided with saturating IPTG induction; however, we still observed a notable increase. We tested an alternative strategy for further improving de-repression, which suggested that the discrepancy between IPTG versus light-dependent induction likely stems from the delay in LacI degradation compared to the rapid allosteric action of IPTG (Supplementary text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Incorporating light responsiveness into diverse proteins with the LOVdeg tag.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Control of mCherry repression using a LacI-LOVdeg fusion.

In this system, a scaffold RNA, which is a modified gRNA containing an MS2 stem loop, is used to localize dCas9 and the transcriptional activator SoxS, which is fused to an MS2 coat protein (MCP). We translationally fused the LOVdeg tag to the MCP-SoxS protein, such that in the dark CRISPRa will be active and light exposure relieves activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In the original system, MCP-SoxS expression is anhydrotetracycline (aTc) inducible. This induction system in not amenable to blue light stimulation because aTc is photosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumschlager et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we changed the MCP-SoxS construct to an IPTG-inducible promoter prior to blue light experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). We confirmed that the promoter switch maintained CRISPRa activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Fusing the LOVdeg tag to the activator component indeed relieved CRISPRa activity, resulting in a decrease in expression under blue light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). However, reversal of activator activity was not complete and expression during light stimulation remained above the baseline levels from the reporter-only control, which could be due to the presence of low levels of the MCP-SoxS activator.</p><p>We also added the LOVdeg tag to the endogenous membrane protein AcrB. This represents a challenging test case for degrading a native protein. The AcrAB-TolC complex is a multidrug efflux pump with clinical relevance due to its role in antibiotic tolerance and resistance acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">El Meouche and Dunlop, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lizarralde-Guerrero and Taraveau, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Okusu et al., 1996</xref>). AcrAB-TolC has also been utilized in metabolic engineering as a mechanism to pump out toxic chemical products and boost strain performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunlop et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fisher et al., 2014</xref>). However, inducible control of AcrB is challenging because cell viability is sensitive to overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turner and Dunlop, 2015</xref>). Optogenetic transcriptional control systems have high dynamic ranges but do not operate in the low expression ranges relevant to very potent protein complexes such as AcrAB-TolC. Light-based degradation is well suited for this challenge because it works by decreasing protein levels, allowing the upper bound of expression to be determined by the promoter.</p><p>Previous work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chai et al., 2016</xref> demonstrated that AcrB can be targeted for proteolysis by fusing an SsrA tag to the C-terminus. Degradation is possible because the C-terminal end of AcrB is on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and can interact with cytoplasmic unfoldases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that fusing the LOVdeg tag to AcrB would result in light-inducible degradation that disrupts activity of the AcrAB-TolC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). To determine whether activity of the AcrAB-TolC complex was successfully disrupted by light, we performed an antibiotic sensitivity test using chloramphenicol, which is a known substrate of the AcrAB-TolC pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Okusu et al., 1996</xref>). We transformed a construct containing AcrB-LOVdeg into cells lacking the endogenous <italic>acrB</italic> gene (Δ<italic>acrB</italic>). When kept in the dark, Δ<italic>acrB</italic> cells with AcrB-LOVdeg showed comparable chloramphenicol tolerance to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and g</xref>). Blue light stimulation, in contrast, sensitized the Δ<italic>acrB</italic> + AcrB-LOVdeg strain to chloramphenicol compared to both wild-type and Δ<italic>acrB</italic> + AcrB-LOVdeg kept in the dark. This suggests that the LOVdeg tag successfully targets AcrB for degradation in a light-dependent fashion. The blue light-exposed cells still retain modest levels of chloramphenicol sensitivity when compared to Δ<italic>acrB</italic> cells without any AcrB complementation, likely due to basal levels of efflux pump expression from AcrB-LOVdeg relative to the knockout. As a point of comparison, we also tested chloramphenicol sensitivity of Δ<italic>acrB</italic> cells with IPTG-inducible AcrB expression (<italic>ΔacrB</italic> + AcrB) without IPTG. With no induction, this represents the lowest expression levels that can be achieved with a traditional IPTG-inducible system. The uninduced <italic>ΔacrB</italic> + AcrB cells displayed significantly higher tolerance to chloramphenicol when compared to wild-type and other experimental groups. This underscores the challenge of controlling potent complexes like AcrAB-TolC through the use of chemical inducers alone and demonstrates how post-translational control, such as that provided by LOVdeg, is a viable and necessary strategy to decrease expression to levels approaching those in the <italic>ΔacrB</italic> knockout strain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tuning frequency response of the LOVdeg tag</title><p>Light-inducible systems have the potential to respond to the frequency of light exposure. Frequency-dependent tools can allow optogenetic circuits to be multiplexed beyond limited wavelength options or to add a layer of logic to optogenetic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benzinger et al., 2022</xref>). With added logic operations, optogenetic circuits could perform complex signal processing, analogous to those demonstrated with multiplexed chemically inducible circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2020</xref>), while allowing dynamic light inputs. Additionally, higher sensitivity LOVdeg tags would also be useful in bioreactor settings, where poor light penetration into dense cultures is a feasibility concern. With these use cases in mind, we sought to characterize and alter the LOVdeg frequency response.</p><p>LOV domains utilize a flavin cofactor to absorb light. In the case of <italic>As</italic>LOV2, the cofactor responsible for light absorption is flavin mononucleotide (FMN). A cysteine residue in <italic>As</italic>LOV2 forms a reversible covalent bond with FMN, which initiates broader conformational change. A full photocycle of <italic>As</italic>LOV2 consists of absorption of a photon, covalent bond formation with cysteine 450, Jα helix destabilization and unfolding, decay of the cysteine-FMN bond, and Jα helix refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swartz et al., 2001</xref>). Previous studies have determined the dynamics of bond formation and the time delay of Jα helix refolding. Further, mutations have been found that stabilize or destabilize the light state conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zayner et al., 2013</xref>). In the context of the LOVdeg tag, the time needed for the Jα helix to refold, known as the reversion time, likely determines degradation characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In principle, the time spent in the light state dictates the amount of time the protein is susceptible to degradation and, therefore, would impact the frequency response given variable light inputs.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Modulating LOVdeg frequency response with photocycle mutations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photocycle of <italic>As</italic>LOV2.

While holding the blue light duration fixed, we tested dark periods ranging from 475 s (5:475 s on:off, frequency of 0.002 s<sup>–1</sup> since there is one pulse every 480 s) to 5 s (5:5 s on:off, frequency of 0.1 s<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We used 5 s for the pulse length because it is markedly shorter than the overall degradation dynamics for the LOVdeg tag, which ensures that a single pulse is not long enough to induce significant degradation. We first tested the frequency response of the original LOVdeg tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The response is in line with known refolding dynamics of <italic>As</italic>LOV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020</xref>), where over 50% degradation is only achieved at high frequencies (0.1 s<sup>–1</sup>). Next, we tested a LOVdeg tag variant that contains a slow-photocycle mutation, V416I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zoltowski et al., 2009</xref>). This amino acid substitution has been shown to increase the dark state reversion time from 8 s to 84 s in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, for LOVdeg tag (V416I) over 50% degradation was achieved at medium frequencies (0.008 s<sup>–1</sup>, which corresponds to 5:120 s on:off) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This variant offers the potential for better performance in settings where increased light sensitivity is preferred, such as within bioreactors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Integrating LOVdeg with EL222 for multilayer control</title><p>Another attractive aspect of post-translational optogenetic control is that it can integrate with existing systems that act at the transcriptional or translational level.

We tested the light response of mCherry-LOVdeg expression with and without EL222 present, as well as including EL222 control of mCherry without the LOVdeg tag fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). As expected, mCherry-LOVdeg expression decreased in response to light even without EL222 present, representing the sole action of the degradation tag. Similarly, EL222-only mCherry decreased in response to light due to repression by EL222. However, multilayer control resulted in a faster decrease in expression in response to light and reached lower levels compared to either LOVdeg or EL222 alone. The fold change decrease in expression was improved from 7× and 6× for just the LOVdeg or EL222, respectively, to 23× when both systems were combined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Optogenetic control of octanoic acid production</title><p>We next sought to apply the LOVdeg tag to a metabolic engineering task as we envision that post-translational control will be especially advantageous in these biotechnology applications. Transcriptional control alone is particularly problematic in a metabolic engineering setting because chemical production is typically carried out at stationary phase with slow growth rates, meaning that proteins expressed at basal levels will accumulate in production settings. Therefore, dynamic control using transcriptional optogenetic systems alone will only allow protein levels to increase or plateau. However, a prerequisite for dynamic control of metabolic pathways is that enzyme levels can be modulated to turn off production.</p><p>As a proof of concept, we chose to control the enzyme <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1 with LOVdeg, EL222, or the EL222-LOVdeg circuit. <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1 is an acyl-ACP thioesterase from <italic>Cuphea palustris</italic> that primarily catalyzes octanoyl-ACP to produce octanoic acid. Octanoic acid is a valuable medium-chain oleochemical with limited natural sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarria et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, we expressed the catalytically enhanced mutant from Hernandez-Lozada et al., <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1.2-M4-287, which we denote here as <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hernández Lozada et al., 2018</xref>). This enzyme interfaces with the endogenous fatty acid synthesis pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic> to produce free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In this pathway, the carbon tail of an acyl-ACP moiety is elongated two carbons at a time. <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1* specifically catalyzes C8-ACPs, which results in production of free octanoic acid. Importantly, since <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1* is very catalytically active, low levels of expression are optimal for production and strains with high expression exhibit a growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hernández Lozada et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, to dynamically regulate <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1* activity in cells, expression must be controlled in a low range, which is particularly challenging in stationary phase.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic control of octanoic acid production.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of fatty acid synthesis in <italic>E. coli.

Octanoic acid is quantified by GC-MS. Strains were kept either in the dark or with continuous blue light exposure for the duration of the production period. Error bars show standard deviation around the mean (****p&lt;0.0001; ***p&lt;0.0001; ns, not significant; two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; n = 3 biological replicates).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87303-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A first step toward optogenetically controlling this metabolic pathway is to demonstrate that enzyme levels can be modulated between protein levels that are relevant to endpoint titers. If expression can only oscillate between high and medium protein levels, dynamic light control will not be effective. To test whether we could effectively stunt <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1* activity, we controlled enzyme expression using only LOVdeg tag degradation, only EL222 repression, or combined LOVdeg and EL222 throughout at 24 hr fermentation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). LOVdeg alone successfully decreased octanoic acid in the light condition. The EL222-only condition did not significantly decrease octanoic acid production with light compared to conditions in the dark, demonstrating the shortcomings of solely transcriptional control at stationary phase. In contrast, the LOVdeg tag with EL222 resulted in a significant decrease in octanoic acid in the continuous light condition. Thus, protein degradation is needed to effectively shunt the metabolic pathway during stationary phase.</p><p>Interestingly, the LOVdeg-only strain, in which <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1*-LOVdeg is expressed through the IPTG-inducible LacUV5 promoter, exhibits higher dark state octanoic acid production compared to <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1* expressed under the EL222 promoter. The dark state production of the LOVdeg-only strain is similar to that of <italic>Cp</italic>FatB1* without the LOVdeg tag, both expressed via the same LacUV5 promoter. This is likely due to limited constitutive expression from P<sub>EL222</sub>. This limitation further demonstrates the utility of post-translational control where the promoter is not involved in the light response. Previous efforts aimed at increasing the strength of EL222 responsive promoters have been carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2020</xref>), and further promoter engineering would be needed to increase EL222 promoter strength to increase octanoic acid production in the dark state. Clearly, decreasing titers is not the overall goal in metabolic engineering. However, the ability to control expression at relevant ranges throughout stationary phase represents an important stepping stone to investigate dynamic control schemes or feedback control that may lead to enhanced strain performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we developed and characterized the LOVdeg tag, which provides blue light-inducible protein degradation, offering unique advantages as a tool for bacterial synthetic biology. Protein degradation offers a mode of control that is currently limited in the bacterial optogenetic toolkit. The bacterial light-responsive degradation system from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Komera et al., 2022</xref> accomplishes protein degradation indirectly through an exogenous split protease. In comparison, in our approach the degradation tag itself is light responsive and does not require extra components, making it straightforward to incorporate. In this study, we showed that the truncated <italic>As</italic>LOV2 protein can be fused to the C-terminal end of various proteins to destabilize them and then target them for degradation. The addition of stabilizing mutations from iLID (to create <italic>As</italic>LOV2*) results in low basal activity in the dark, with strong switching in response to light. Aside from creating a light-responsive degradation tag, the effectiveness of these stabilizing mutations may serve to improve the switch-like behavior in many other <italic>As</italic>LOV2-based systems.</p><p>We demonstrated the modularity of the LOVdeg tag by incorporating it into three distinct contexts with little to no fine-tuning. Each system, the LacI repressor, CRISPR activator, and the AcrB efflux pump, was converted to optogenetically controlled by simply tagging the protein with LOVdeg. This modularity mimics the ease of use of transcriptional optogenetic systems, which only require a change of the promoter. However, incorporating light control at the protein level simplifies this process because protein levels can remain in their native, or previously fine-tuned, context. This configuration is especially beneficial for proteins that require low expression as transcriptional optogenetic systems often suffer from leaky basal expression. The LOVdeg tag provides a design that can work with endogenous protein levels, circumventing this issue. In this study, we focused on proteins encoded on plasmids expressed from synthetic promoters. However, we anticipate the LOVdeg tag can be useful in systems biology contexts where natural promoters linked to endogenous gene networks are best left untouched. In this case, the LOVdeg tag can add the ability to optogenetically manipulate genes while keeping them in their native gene regulatory context.</p><p>Since degradation occurs post-translationally, the LOVdeg tag can easily be integrated with existing optogenetic systems to enhance their function. We demonstrated this by combining the LOVdeg tag with the EL222 repression system, showing that the synergistic action of transcriptional repression and degradation results in an increase in the dynamic range, owing to the lower off-state under light illumination. In this configuration, EL222 and the LOVdeg tag work coherently to decease expression. However, the LOVdeg tag can potentially be incorporated into activating systems incoherently to create dynamic functionality, such as pulse generators and inverters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benzinger et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Throughout this study, we performed experiments using low copy number plasmids that result in moderate levels of a given protein of interest. While this is a common use case for synthetic biology, degradation as the sole mode of gene expression control may be limiting when proteins are at very high levels. As an ATP-dependent process that utilizes a finite pool of proteolytic machinery, degradation rates can saturate at sufficiently high protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cookson et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, using protein degradation as the sole mode of gene expression control is wasteful in some contexts. Constitutive transcription and translation of a gene followed by degradation utilizes valuable cellular resources, which is an important consideration in metabolic engineering. To avoid this type of energetic waste, we envision the LOVdeg tag could be used in concert with other modes of regulation, as we demonstrated with EL222. In addition, it is unclear whether the LOVdeg tag is compatible with other prokaryotic (including mitochondrial) proteasomes. Future studies focused on the portability of the LOVdeg tag may address this question and potentially lead to further mechanistic insight.</p><p>In summary, the LOVdeg tag offers a straightforward route for introducing optogenetic control of protein degradation in <italic>E. coli</italic>. By lowering the barrier to entry for incorporating light responsiveness into a protein of interest, we envision that systems typically studied with chemical induction or constitutive expression can now be controlled optogenetically without extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, the LOVdeg tag can act as a circuit enhancer when incorporated into existing optogenetic systems to increase functionality and robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>We used <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 as the wild-type strain.

<italic>E. coli</italic> proteasome</title><p>Based on the exposed C-terminal amino acids in the LOVdeg (E-A-A), we anticipated that degradation would be primarily mediated by ClpXP because the C-terminal alanines, when on an unstructured peptide of sufficient length, are known to be adequate for ClpX targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fei et al., 2020</xref>). However, degenerate degradation from multiple endogenous proteases is common in <italic>E. coli</italic> and has been demonstrated with SsrA-tagged substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flynn et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, ClpX is the most extensively studied unfoldase, meaning the rules governing other endogenous unfoldases are less understood and their action should not be ruled out. ClpA, ClpX, and HslU unfoldases utilize protease counterparts to perform protein degradation with ClpAP, ClpXP, and HslVU complexes, respectively. In contrast, Lon performs both unfoldase and protease activity. To understand the endogenous unfoldase(s) responsible for degradation of the LOVdeg tag, we expressed the mCherry-LOVdeg construct in several unfoldase knockouts, including those deleting the genes that encode ClpA, ClpX, HslU, or Lon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). FtsH, the last of the five unfoldase-proteases in <italic>E. coli</italic>, was not included in the knockout study because it is an essential gene and could not be knocked out.</p><p>We measured reductions in mCherry in response to blue light induction in the different knockout backgrounds. In each knockout, we expressed mCherry-LOVdeg under a constitutive promoter. We also expressed the non-truncated counterpart for a degradation-resistant comparison. Protein expression was decreased in light for all knockout strains; however, the degree of reduction varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). The fold change of degradation was reduced relative to wild type in Δ<italic>clpA</italic>, Δ<italic>clpX</italic>, and Δ<italic>hslU</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>). To further test which of these unfoldases was responsible for LOVdeg tag degradation, we created plasmids expressing each unfoldase exogenously under an arabinose-inducible promoter to see whether excess unfoldase would increase degradation of mCherry. ClpA was the only one to display increased degradation when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3d</xref>). With ClpA expressed from plasmid in addition to endogenous ClpA, the half-life of mCherry-LOVdeg was decreased from 74 to 38 min. Given the fold change decrease we observed in Δ<italic>hslU</italic>, we were surprised that strains overexpressing HslU did not increase their degradation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The lack of enhanced degradation when HslUV is overexpressed suggests that it is not the primary source of LOVdeg tag degradation. It is possible that the decreased degradation fold change seen in Δ<italic>hslU</italic> can be attributed to broader systemic changes in this knockout strain. Although the Δ<italic>clpX</italic> strain showed a reduced fold change, this is likely due to generalized changes in expression, which we observed with mCherry with no degradation tag in this strain as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Our initial assumption that ClpXP would be the primary source of degradation was incorrect. The data instead show that ClpA is involved in LOVdeg tag degradation; however, it is likely a single unfoldase-protease is not entirely responsible for degradation.</p><p>Since ClpA was implicated in degradation, we also tested knockouts of ClpP and ClpS. ClpP is responsible for proteolysis of substrates unfolded by ClpA, and ClpS is an adaptor protein for ClpAP that alters targeting specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Sauer, 2006</xref>). mCherry was degraded efficiently in both the Δ<italic>clpP</italic> and Δ<italic>clpS</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Because ClpA is implicated in degradation, we initially expected ClpP, the protease counterpart to ClpA, would be necessary. However, studies examining degradation of SsrA-tagged substrates have shown that substrates can still be degraded efficiently, even in Δ<italic>clpP</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farrell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lies and Maurizi, 2008</xref>). For example, Lies et al. found that SsrA-tagged substrates can be degraded in Δ<italic>clpP</italic> strains but accumulate in Δ<italic>clpP</italic> Δ<italic>lon</italic> strains. They concluded that in the absence of ClpP, ClpA and ClpX continue to unfold substrates and Lon carries out proteolysis on the unfolded substrates. A similar mechanism may be at play with the LOVdeg tag in Δ<italic>clpP</italic> cells.</p><p>By knocking out exogenous <italic>E. coli</italic> unfoldases, we gained partial insight into the mechanism of LOVdeg tag destabilization. The Δ<italic>clpA</italic> knockout exhibits decreased degradation in response to light, while complementing cells with <italic>clpA</italic> increases degradation speed, demonstrating the involvement of the ClpA protease in LOVdeg tag destabilization. However, other proteolytic activity is also involved, as degradation could still be achieved, albeit to a lesser extent, in the Δ<italic>clpA</italic> strain. Further, full degradation was maintained in its partner Δ<italic>clpP</italic> strain. It remains unclear whether the LOVdeg tag is targeted due to specific amino acid sequence interactions with a given unfoldase or if the general disorder induced at the C-terminal end of the protein is sufficient for recognition by the proteasome. The non-truncated versions of <italic>As</italic>LOV2 and <italic>As</italic>LOV2*, which maintain light-dependent C-terminal disorder, are stable, suggesting that it is a mix of sequence and C-terminal peptide disorder. The full mechanism of LOVdeg tag destabilization is a topic for future investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Adding decoy sites to reduce impact of basal LacI does not improve LacI-LOVdeg response</title><p>We sought to further investigate why LacI-LOVdeg responded with higher mCherry expression under IPTG induction than light induction. One possibility is that low levels of LacI are escaping degradation and causing basal repression. To address this, we added LacI decoy binding sites that work by binding excess LacI, following a method we developed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). With the decoy present, light-induced expression was only slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that low levels of LacI are not the primary explanation for the discrepancy between IPTG induction and light induction. We hypothesize that the lowered expression with light exposure stems from the time delay inherent in protein degradation compared to allosteric binding of IPTG to LacI.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87303.3.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Landry</surname><given-names>Christian R</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Université Laval</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Convincing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Valuable</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study reports on a new tool that allows for light-controlled protein degradation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

While there are several established methods for regulating transcription or translation of proteins with light, optogenetic protein degradation has so far not been established in bacteria. In this paper, the authors present a degradation sequence, which they name &quot;LOVdeg&quot;, based on iLID, a modified version of the blue-light-responsive LOV2 domain of Avena sativa phototropin I (AsLOV2). The authors reasoned that by removing the three C-terminal amino acids of iLID, the modified protein ends in &quot;-E-A-A&quot;, similar to the &quot;-L-A-A&quot; C-terminus of the widely used SsrA degradation tag. The authors further speculated that, given the light-induced unfolding of the C-terminal domain of iLID and similar proteins, the &quot;-E-A-A&quot; C-terminus would become more accessible and, in turn, the protein would be more efficiently degraded in blue light than in the dark.</p><p>Indeed, several tested LOVdeg-tagged proteins show clearly lower cellular levels in blue light than in the dark. Depending on the nature and expression level of the target protein, protein levels are reduced modestly to strongly (2 to 20x lower levels upon illumination). Accordingly, the authors propose to use their system in combination with other light-controlled expression systems and provide data validating this approach. The LOVdeg system allows to modulate protein levels to a similar degree and with comparable kinetics as optogenetic systems controlling transcription or translation of protein, and can be combined with such systems.</p><p>The manuscript and the figures are generally very well-composed and follow a clear structure. The schematics nicely explain the underlying principles. Besides the advantages of the LOVdeg approach, including its complementarity to controlled expression of proteins, the revised version of the manuscript also highlights the limitations of the method more clearly, e.g., (i) the need to attach a C-terminal tag of considerable size to the protein of interest, (ii) the limited efficiency (slightly less efficient and slower than EL222, a light-dependent transcriptional control mechanism), and (iii) the incompletely understood prerequisites for its application. Taken together, this manuscripts describes the LOVdeg system as a valuable addition to the tool box for controlling protein levels in prokaryotic cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87303.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript the authors present and characterize LOVdeg, a modified version of the blue-light sensitive AsLOV2 protein, which functions as a light-inducible degron in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Light has been shown to be a powerful inducer in biological systems as it is often orthogonal and can be controlled in both space and time. Many optogenetic systems target regulation of transcription, however in this manuscript the authors target protein degradation to control protein levels in bacteria. This is an important advance in bacteria, as inducible protein degradation systems in bacteria have lagged behind eukaryotic systems due to protein targeting in bacteria being primarily dependent on primary amino acid sequence and thus more difficult to engineer. In this manuscript, the authors exploit the fact that the J-alpha helix of AsLOV2, which unwinds into a disordered domain in response to blue light, contains an E-A-A amino acid sequence which is very similar to the C-terminal L-A-A sequence in the SsrA tag which is targeted by the unfoldases ClpA and ClpX. They truncate AsLOV2 to create AsLOV2(543) and combine this truncation with a mutation that stabilizes the dark state to generate AsLOV2*(543) which, when fused to the C-terminus of mCherry, confers light-induced degradation. The authors do not verify the mechanism of degradation due to LOVdeg, but evidence from deletion mutants contained in the supplemental material hints that there is a ClpA dominated mechanism. The LOVdeg is able to target mCherry for protein degradation across different phases of bacterial growth, which is important for regulating processes at stationary phase and a potential additional advantage over transcriptional repression systems. They demonstrate modularity of this LOVdeg by using it to degrade the LacI repressor, CRISPRa activation through degradation of MCP-SoxS, and the AcrB protein which is part of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump. In all cases, measurement of the effect of the LOVdeg is indirect as the authors measure reduction in LacI repression, reduction in CRISPRa activation, and drug resistance rather than directly measuring protein levels. Nevertheless the evidence is convincing, although seemingly less effective than in the case of mCherry degradation, although it is hard to compare due to the different endpoints being measured. The authors further modify LOVdeg to contain a known photocycle mutation that slows its reversion time in the dark, so that LOVdeg is more sensitive to short pulses of light which could be useful in low light conditions or for very light sensitive organisms. They also demonstrate that combining LOVdeg with a blue-light transcriptional repression system (EL222) can decrease protein levels an additional 23-fold (relative to 7-fold with LOVdeg alone). Finally, the authors apply LOVdeg to a metabolic engineering task, namely reducing expression of octanoic acid by regulating the enzyme CpFatB1, an acyl-ACP thioesterase. The authors show that tagging CpFatB1 with LOVdeg allows light induced reduction in octanoic acid titer over a 24 hour fermentation. In particular, by comparing control of CpFatB1 with EL222 transcriptional repression alone, LOVdeg, or both the authors show that light-induced protein degradation is more effective than light-induced transcriptional repression. The authors suggest that this is because transcriptional repression is not effective when cells are at stationary phase (and thus there is no protein dilution due to cell division). Overall, the authors have generated a modular, light-activated degron tag for use in Escherichia coli that is likely to be a useful tool in the synthetic biology and metabolic engineering toolkit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87303.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors present the mechanism, validation, and modular application of LOVtag, a light-responsive protein degradation tag that is processed by the native degradosome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

While there are several established methods for regulating transcription or translation of proteins with light, optogenetic protein degradation has so far not been established in bacteria. In this paper, the authors present adegradation sequence, which they name &quot;LOVtag&quot;, based on iLID, a modified version of the blue-light-responsive LOV2 domain of Avena sativa phototropin I (AsLOV2). The authors reasoned that by removing the three C-terminal amino acids of iLID, the modified protein ends in &quot;-E-A-A&quot;, similar to the &quot;-L-A-A&quot; C-terminus of the widely used SsrA degradation tag. The authors further speculated that, given the light-induced unfolding of the C-terminal domain of iLID and similar proteins, the &quot;-E-A-A&quot; C-terminus would become more accessible and, in turn, the protein would be more efficiently degraded in blue light than in the dark.</p><p>Indeed, several tested proteins tagged with the &quot;LOVtag&quot; show clearly lower cellular levels in blue light than in the dark. While the system works efficiently with mCherry (10-20x lower levels upon illumination), the effect is rather modest (2-3x lower levels) in most other cases. Accordingly, the authors propose to use their system in combination with other light-controlled expression systems and provide data validating this approach. Unfortunately, despite the claim that the &quot;LOVtag&quot; should work faster than optogenetic systems controlling transcription or translation of protein, the degradation kinetics are not consistently shown; in the one case where this is done, the response time and overall efficiency are similar or slightly worse than for EL222, an optogenetic expression system.</p><p>The manuscript and the figures are generally very well-composed and follow a clear structure. The schematics nicely explain the underlying principles. However, limitations of the method in its main proposed area of use, protein production, should be highlighted more clearly, e.g., (i) the need to attach a C-terminal tag of considerable size to the protein of interest, (ii) the limited efficiency (slightly less efficient and slower than EL222, a light-dependent transcriptional control mechanism), and (iii) the incompletely understood prerequisites for its application. In addition, several important controls and measurements of the characteristics of the systems, such as the degradation kinetics, would need to be shown to allow a comparison of the system with established approaches. The current version also contains several minor mistakes in the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for the feedback and suggestions to strengthen the manuscript. We have addressed these comments in the points that follow and now include important controls and benchmarks for our molecular tool.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points</p><p>1. The quite generic name &quot;LOVtag&quot; may be misleading, as there are many LOV-based tags for different purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that it would be beneficial to have a more specific name. We have updated the name to “LOVdeg” tag, which captures both the inclusion of LOV and the degradation function of the tag.</p><p>Updated throughout the manuscript and figures</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Throughout the manuscript, the authors use &quot;expression levels&quot;. As protein degradation is a post-expression mechanism, &quot;protein levels&quot; should be used instead.</p></disp-quote><p>We have transitioned to using “protein levels” at many points in the manuscript.</p><p>Updated throughout the manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Degradation dynamics (time course experiments) should be shown. The only time this is done in the current version (in Fig. 4), degradation appears to be in the same range (even a bit slower) than for EL222, which does not support the claim that the &quot;LOVtag&quot; acts faster than other optogenetic systems controlling protein levels.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, time course data are now shown at multiple points. These include new data in Fig. 1f and Fig. S8 that demonstrate degradation at various stages of growth. Fig. S4 also shows the dynamics of degradation when comparing to the addition of exogenously expressed ClpA. We have added text in the results section to point the reader to these data. In addition, we have made minor modifications to the text in the Introduction to avoid making claims about speed comparisons.

A series of 5 seconds on, 5 seconds off corresponds to a frequency of 0.1 Hz (1 illumination round / 10 s), not of 0.5 Hz. What the authors indicate as &quot;frequency&quot; is the fraction of illumination time. However, the (correct) frequency should be given, as this is likely the more important factor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed how we calculate frequency to use the proposed definition of one pulse per time period. We updated the values in the text and in the figure. Fig. 3c</p><p>Results: Tuning frequency response of the LOVdeg tag</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. To properly evaluate the system, several additional controls are needed:</p><p>a. To test for photobleaching of mCherry by blue light illumination, untagged controls should be shown for the mCherry-based experiments. Fluorescence always seems to be lower upon illumination, except for the AsLOV2*(546) data, where it cannot be excluded that fluorescence readings are saturated. Relatedly, the raw data for OD and fluorescence should be included. Showing a Western blot against mCherry in at least one case would allow to separate the effects of photobleaching and degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and have conducted these important controls. We now include new data demonstrating that light induction does not change fluorescence levels using an untagged mCherry control, nor does it significantly affect endpoint OD levels. Based on these results, we did not perform a Western blot because there were no effects to separate. Fig. S7</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. In Fig. 2b, light + IPTG should be shown to estimate the activity of the system at higher expression levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these to the figure. Light + IPTG modestly increases expression compared to IPTG only, likely due to the saturating level of IPTG added, which achieves near full induction. Fig. 2b</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. In Fig. 4, EL222 alone should be shown to allow a comparison with the LOVtag. From the data presented, it looks like EL222 is both slightly faster and more efficient than the LOVtag.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the EL222-only case for comparison with LOVdeg only and EL222 + LOVdeg. We note that Reviewer #3 raised a similar concern. Fig. 4b</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The effect of the used light on bacterial viability under exponential and stationary conditions should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revision, we have added new data on light exposure at various points during exponential and stationary phase (Fig. 1f, Fig. S8). These OD data show that growth curves are similar for all cultures, regardless of the time light is applied during the growth phase. Additionally, we also now include ODs for the photobleaching experiments. These data also show that growth is not significantly altered under continuous light exposure. Figure 1f, Fig. S7b</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The claim that &quot;Post-translational control of protein function typically requires extensive protein engineering for each use case&quot; is not correct. The authors should discuss alternative options, e.g. based on dimerization, more extensively and in a less biased manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down the language in this location and at other points in the manuscript. However, we maintain that other types of post-translational control, such as dimerization or LOV2 domain insertion, require more protein engineering than inserting a degradation tag. For example, we and others have directly demonstrated this in previous work (e.g. DOI:10.1021/acssynbio.9b00395, 10.1101/2023.05.26.542511, 10.1038/s41467-023-38993-6), where numerous split site or insertion variants need to be screened and fine-tuned for successful light control. In contrast, a degradation mechanism has the potential to require less fine tuning to achieve a light response. We have included the above sources to clarify this point.

Also, the alterations in iLID (compared to AsLOV2) that are not used in &quot;LOVtag&quot; appear to be missing and the iLID sequence incorrect, as a consequence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this. The number indices in Fig. S1 have been corrected. We also realized we were reporting the iLID(C530M) variant in our amino acid sequence and have reverted the 530M back to C.

Light has been shown to be a powerful inducer in biological systems as it is often orthogonal and can be controlled in both space and time. Many optogenetic systems target regulation of transcription, however in this manuscript the authors target protein degradation to control protein levels in bacteria. This is an important advance in bacteria, as inducible protein degradation systems in bacteria have lagged behind eukaryotic systems due to protein targeting in bacteria being primarily dependent on primary amino acid sequence and thus more difficult to engineer. In this manuscript, the authors exploit the fact that the J-alpha helix of AsLOV2, which unwinds into a disordered domain in response to blue light, contains an E-A-A amino acid sequence which is very similar to the C-terminal L-A-A sequence in the SsrA tag which is targeted by the unfoldases ClpA and ClpX. They truncate AsLOV2 to create AsLOV2(543) and combine this truncation with a mutation that stabilizes the dark state to generate AsLOV2*(543) which, when fused to the C-terminus of mCherry, confers light-induced degradation. The authors do not verify the mechanism of degradation due to LOVtag, but evidence from deletion mutants contained in the supplemental material hints that there is a ClpA dominated mechanism. They demonstrate modularity of this LOVtag by using it to degrade the LacI repressor, CRISPRa activation through degradation of MCP-SoxS, and the AcrB protein which is part of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump. In all cases, measurement of the effect of the LOVtag is indirect as the authors measure reduction in LacI repression, reduction in CRISPRa activation, and drug resistance rather than directly measuring protein levels. Nevertheless the evidence is convincing, although seemingly less effective than in the case of mCherry degradation, although it is hard to compare due to the different endpoints being measured. The authors further modify LOVtag to contain a known photocycle mutation that slows its reversion time in the dark, so that LOVtag is more sensitive to short pulses of light which could be useful in low light conditions or for very light sensitive organisms. They also demonstrate that combining LOVtag with a blue-light transcriptional repression system (EL222) can decrease protein levels an additional 269-fold (relative to 15-fold with LOVtag alone). Finally, the authors apply LOVtag to a metabolic engineering task, namely reducing expression of octanoic acid by regulating the enzyme CpFatB1, an acyl-ACP thioesterase. The authors show that tagging CpFatB1 with LOVtag allows light induced reduction in octanoic acid titer over a 24 hour fermentation. In particular, by comparing control of CpFatB1 with EL222 transcriptional repression alone, LOVtag, or both the authors show that light-induced protein degradation is more effective than light-induced transcriptional repression. The authors suggest that this is because transcriptional repression is not effective when cells are at stationary phase (and thus there is no protein dilution due to cell division), however it is not clear from the available data that the cells were in stationary phase during light exposure. Overall, the authors have generated a modular, light-activated degron tag for use in Escherichia coli that is likely to be a useful tool in the synthetic biology and metabolic engineering toolkit.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the constructive feedback. In the updated manuscript, we now include data demonstrating degradation at different growth stages and address other points brought up in the review to improve understanding of the degradation tag.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the authors present a well written manuscript that characterizes an interesting and likely very useful tool for bacterial synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. I have a few suggestions that could improve the presentation of the material.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>• Could the authors clarify, perhaps through OD measurements, that the cultures in the octanoic acid experiment are actually in stationary phase during the relevant light induction. It isn't clear from the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Methods to clarify that the cells are entering stationary phase (OD600 = 0.6) when light is either kept on or turned off for production experiments. Production is continued for the following 24 hours. Note that we now show OD measurements in a separate set of experiments (Fig. 1f, Fig. S8).</p><p>Methods: Octanoic acid production experiment. Fig. 1f, Fig. S8</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Can the authors clarify why there is an overall decrease in protein in the clpX deletion? And is it this initial reduction that is the source of the change in fold in 1C? Similarly, for hslU is it because overall protein levels are higher with the tag? In general, I feel that the interpretation of Supplemental Figures S6-S10 could be moved in more detail to the main text, or at least the main takeaway points. But this is a personal preference, and not necessary to the major flow of the story which is about the utility of the LOVtag tool.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Fig. S5, expression of mCherry without any degradation tag is decreased in a clpX knockout strain compared to wild type. This difference may be the result of reduced cell health, and we now note this in the text. The strains shown in Fig. 1c are in wild type cells with normal expression, so this is not the source of the fold change. As for hslU, we agree it is interesting that expression seems to increase. However, the increase is modest and could stem from gene network regulation differences in that strain compared to wild type and may not be related to LOVdeg tag degradation. Each endogenous protease is involved in a wide range of functions within the cell, and it is unknown how global gene expression is impacted. We acknowledge the suggestion of moving the protease results to the main text, but we have ultimately elected to keep these data in the Supplementary Information to maintain the flow in the manuscript. However, we have added additional text pointing the reader to the Supplemental Text and include a brief summary of the findings in the main text.</p><p>Results: Design and characterization of the AsLOV2-based degradation tag</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• What is the source of the poor repression in Figure 2D?</p></disp-quote><p>Presumably, this stems from low levels of the CRISPRa MCP-SoxS activator, even in the presence of light.

We have now included light-only data for a strain containing IPTG-inducible mCherry without the LOVdeg tag (Fig. S7). These data show that light itself, at the levels used in this study, does not affect mCherry expression or cell growth. This strain serves as a direct control for data presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2b, as the systems are identical except for the addition of the LOVdeg tag onto either mCherry or the LacI repressor. Additionally, the control translates to other experiments since mCherry is used as a reporter for other systems in this study.

We have added an experiment that tests the LOVdeg tag at different phases of growth (Fig. 1f, Fig. S8).

Upon exposure to blue light, the c-terminal alpha helix unfolds, essentially marking the protein for degradation. The authors demonstrate the engineered tag is modular across multiple complex regulatory systems, which shows its potential widespread use throughout the synthetic biology field. The step-by-step rational design of identifying the protein that was most dark stabilized as well as most light-responsive for degradation, was useful in terms of understanding the key components of this system. The most compelling data shows that the engineered LOVTag can be fused to multiple proteins and achieve light-based degradation, without affecting the original function of the fused protein; however, results are not benchmarked against similar degradation tagging and optogenetic control constructs. Creating fusion proteins that do not alter either of the original functions, is often difficult to achieve, and the novelty of this should be expanded upon to drive further impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the feedback from Reviewer #3 to improve the manuscript.

The differences in degradation efficiency between the SsrA degradation tag and LOVtag are not shown, and benchmarking against SsrA would be a valuable way to demonstrate the utility of this construct relative to an established protein tagging tool.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting an experiment to benchmark performance. We have added new experimental data where a full length SsrA tag is added to a fusion protein of nearly identical size (mCherry-iLID), allowing us to directly compare performance to mCherryLOVdeg (Fig. S9). These results show that light inducible control with LOVdeg tag decreases protein expression levels to near those achieved with the native SsrA tag. Fig. S9.</p><p>Results: Design and characterization of the AsLOV2-based degradation tag</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, there is a lack of an EL222-only control presented in Figure 4b and in the results section beginning with &quot;Integrating the LOVtag with EL222...&quot;. Without benchmarking against this control the claim that &quot;EL222 and the LOVtag work coherently to decrease expression&quot; is unsubstantiated. No assumptions of synergy can be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and note that Reviewer #1 raised a similar concern. We have added data to Fig. 4b with an EL222-only control for comparison. Fig. 4b</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The dramatic change in dark octanoic acid titer between the EL222, LOVtag and combined conditions are surprising, especially in comparison to the lack of change in the dark mCherry expression shown in Figure 4b. This data is the only to suggest that LOVtag may perform better than EL222. However, the inconsistencies in dark state regulation presented in the two experiments, and between conditions in this experiment bring the latter claim to question. A recommendation is that the authors either repeat this experiment, or comment on the observed discrepancy in dark state octanoic acid titers in their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>First, a key difference between the data presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 is that the production experiment is conducted over a long time period (24 hours) and the EL222/LOVdeg reporter experiment is conducted over 5 hours. Likely, performance differences between EL222 and the LOVdeg tag become more pronounced as protein accumulation occurs. Second, the LOVdeg only construct is expressed from a non-EL222 promoter which is able to achieve higher expression (see response to Reviewer #1, Minor point #3). Lastly, a convoluting factor is that the relationship between expression of CpFatB1* and octanoic acid production is not completely linear, and there are likely thresholds or expressions windows that result in similar endpoint titers. We agree a more detailed examination of how CpFatB1* changes over the course of the production period would be very interesting. However, this is beyond the scope of the present study, whose goal is to introduce and showcase the utility of the LOVdeg tag as a tool. We have added new discussion on this in the Results section to clarify some of these points. We have also repeated all experiments in Fig. 4 and consistently see the LOVdeg tag performing as well as or better than EL222. As noted in the remarks to all reviewers, these data have been updated in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Results: Optogenetic control of octanoic acid production.

The on/off, for example in Figure 4b, is either all light or all dark, but they claim that their system is beneficial especially at stationary phase. The authors should consider showing the effects of shifting from dark to light at set intervals.

First, the agreement with known mutations validates the unfolding-based mechanism for degradation control. Second, degradation that is contingent on unfolding of LOV2 offers a direct actuating mechanism of photocycle properties. Other systems, like that in Zoltowski et al., examine properties of purified proteins but lack the mechanism to translate its effect in live cells. This figure demonstrates how degradation can do so and lays the groundwork for degradation-based frequency processing circuits. Last, there are discrepancies between photocycle kinetics in situ, as reported by Li et al. (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-020-18816-8), and in cell-free studies such as in Zoltowski et al. The studies use different methods of measuring photocycle kinetics (in situ vs cell-free). This dataset substantiates relaxation times from Li et al. and suggests cell-free relaxation time constants are over estimated relative to our live cell results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 4:</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>There is a lack of an EL222-only control presented in Figure 4b.

More data or rationale may need to be introduced to support the overall hypothesis presented in this paragraph.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We determined this by examining the crystal structure which shows that the E-A-A sequence is part of the folded helix. As seen in Fig. 1b, addition of amino acids after the EAAKEL sequence would not be part of the folded helix which ends prior to the terminal leucine.
