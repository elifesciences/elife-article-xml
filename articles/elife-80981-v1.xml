However, identifying the characteristics of such lineages that underpin resistance to therapy has remained challenging. Here, we utilise clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq; <bold>W</bold>holistic <bold>I</bold>nterrogation of <bold>L</bold>ineage <bold>D</bold>ynamics by <bold>seq</bold>uencing, in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to understand response and resistance to therapy, including BET bromodomain inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy. These analyses revealed oxidative stress protection by NRF2 as a major mechanism of taxane resistance and led to the discovery that our tumour models are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation therapy using the clinical stage drug L-asparaginase after frontline treatment with docetaxel. In summary, clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq identifies mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy that are also operative in patients and pin points asparagine bioavailability as a druggable vulnerability of taxane-resistant lineages.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer begins when a cell multiplies again and again to form a tumour. By the time that tumour measures a centimetre across, it can contain upwards of a hundred million cells. And even though they all came from the same ancestor, they are far from identical. The tumour's family tree has many branches, and each one responds differently to treatment. If some are susceptible to a drug the cells die, the tumour shrinks, and the therapy will appear to be successful. But, if even a small number of cancer cells survive, they will regrow, often more persistently, causing a relapse.</p><p>Identifying resistant cells, their characteristics, and how to kill them has been challenging due to a lack of good animal models. One way to keep track of a cancer family tree is to insert so-called genetic barcodes into the ancestral cells. As the tumour grows, the cells will pass the barcodes to their descendants. Scientists do this by using viruses that naturally paste their genes into the cells they infect. Applying this technique to an animal model of cancer could reveal which genes allow some cells to survive, and how to overcome them.</p><p>Wild, Cannell et al. developed a genetic barcoding system called WILD-seq and used it to track all the cells in a mouse tumour. The mice received the same drugs used to treat patients with breast cancer. By scanning the genetic barcodes using recently developed single cell sequencing technologies, Wild, Cannell et al. were able to identify and count each type of cancer cell and work out which genes they were using. This revealed which cells the standard treatment could not kill and exposed their genetic weaknesses. Wild, Cannell et al. used this information to target the cells with a drug currently used to treat leukaemia.</p><p>The drug identified by this new genetic barcoding approach is already licensed for use in humans. Further investigation could reveal whether it might help to shrink breast tumours that do not respond to standard therapy. Similar experiments could uncover more information about how other types of tumour evolve too.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tumor heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>cancer therapy</kwd><kwd>lineage tracing</kwd><kwd>single cell genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C14303/A21143 C14303/A19926 C14303/A19927 C9545/A24042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009794</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Now</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021JulyPCC1459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lineage resolved single-cell RNA-seq of mammary carcinoma models uncovers a metabolic vulnerability of taxane-resistant clones.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intra-tumoural heterogeneity (ITH) is thought to underlie tumour progression and resistance to therapy by providing a reservoir of phenotypically diverse clonal lineages on which selective pressures from the microenvironment or therapeutic intervention exert their effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turajlic and Swanton, 2016</xref>). Inference of clonal composition from bulk sequencing has elucidated the breadth of ITH across tumour types and suggests that often rare pre-existing clones can resist therapy-induced killing to drive relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dentro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerlinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Landau et al., 2013</xref>). However, such methods are limited by their inability to characterise such resistant clones beyond genotype and how their properties change over time and in response to therapy. Recently, several lineage tracing approaches have emerged that are able to link clonal identity with gene expression by utilising expressed genetic barcodes that are read-out by single cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biddy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simeonov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). These powerful methods allow deconvolution of complex mixtures of clones while simultaneously providing a gene expression profile of those cells that can indicate the pathways on which they depend. However, to date in solid tumours these technologies have mostly been used to study drug response in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oren et al., 2021</xref>) or metastatic dissemination in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simeonov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2022</xref>) and have not been utilised to study therapeutic response in immune-competent models.</p><p>A thorough understanding of the biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy is essential if we are to improve patient outcomes. Most existing combination cancer therapies are not rationally designed but were instead empirically optimised to avoid overlapping toxicities. More recently alternative therapeutic strategies have emerged including synthetic lethality, drug synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AlLazikani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">ONeil et al., 2017</xref>), and collateral sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mueller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pluchino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) that aim to leverage selective vulnerabilities of tumour cells while minimising toxicity. Of particular promise is collateral sensitivity, in which as a tumour becomes resistant to one drug it comes at the cost of sensitivity to a second drug. Since many modern clinical trials occur in the context of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, the identification of frontline therapy-induced collateral sensitivities to second line therapy would have the potential to be rapidly translated into improved outcomes for patients.</p><p>Here, we describe WILD-seq (<bold>W</bold>holistic <bold>I</bold>nterrogation of <bold>L</bold>ineage <bold>D</bold>ynamics by <bold>seq</bold>uencing), an accessible and adaptable platform for lineage tracing at the single-cell transcriptomic level that facilitates in vivo analysis of clonal dynamics and apply it to the study of syngeneic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models. Our optimised pipeline ensures recurrent representation of clonal lineages across animals and samples, facilitating analysis of clonal dynamics under the selective pressure of therapeutic intervention. Importantly, analysis of response of TNBC models to frontline taxane-based chemotherapy revealed an enrichment of clones with high levels of NRF2 signaling, implicating defense against oxidative damage as a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy. Building on the work of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeBoeuf et al., 2020</xref>), we show that these NRF2-high, taxane-resistant lineages are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation as a result of L-asparaginase treatment and that they adapt to this second line intervention by up-regulating de novo asparagine synthesis by increasing asparagine synthetase (<italic>Asns</italic>) expression. Together these data indicate that high levels of NRF2 signaling, which is also observed in patients following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, promotes both resistance to chemotherapy and sensitivity to asparagine deprivation and warrant the exploration of L-asparaginase as a therapeutic modality in solid tumours.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of an expressed barcode system to simultaneously detect clonal lineage and gene expression</title><p>WILD-seq uses a lentiviral library to label cells with an expressed, heritable barcode that enables identification of clonal lineage in conjunction with single cell RNA sequencing.

A heterogeneous cell line is transduced with a barcode library at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to ensure that each cell receives a maximum of one barcode. An appropriate size pool of barcoded clones is selected and stabilised in culture. Empirically, we have found that three separate pools each established from 250 individual clones, that are maintained separately and combined immediately prior to implantation, works well to provide effective representation of the diversity within the cell lines used herein, while also enabling recurrent representation of the same clones across animals and experiments. Once stabilised in culture, the pool of WILD-seq clones can be analysed directly by single-cell sequencing or injected into a recipient animal for in vivo tumour growth. WILD-seq single-cell sequencing libraries can be prepared using a standard oligo-dT-based protocol and addition of an extra PCR amplification step can be used to increase coverage of the barcode region and aid cell lineage assignment.</p><p>We first established a WILD-seq clonal pool from the mouse 4T1 cell line, a triple negative mammary carcinoma model that can be orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pad of a BALB/c syngeneic host, which we have previously shown to be heterogeneous with distinct sub-clones having unique biological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagenblast et al., 2015</xref>). We performed single-cell sequencing of the in vitro WILD-seq pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and in vivo tumours derived from this clonal pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Over the course of our studies, we injected multiple cohorts of mice with our WILD-seq 4T1 pool as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, some of which were subjected to a specific drug regime. All tumours were harvested at humane endpoint, as determined by tumour volume unless otherwise stated and immediately dissociated for single-cell sequencing.</p><p>For the purpose of characterising the baseline properties of our clones, we performed an in-depth transcriptomic analysis of all tumours from vehicle-treated animals. A WILD-seq barcode and thereby clonal lineage could be unambiguously assigned to 30–60% of cells per sample within the presumptive tumour cell/mammary epithelial cell cluster. A total of 132 different WILD-seq barcodes were observed in vitro and in total 94 different WILD-seq barcodes were observed across our in vivo tumour samples. Our in vivo tumour samples comprised both tumour cells and host cells of the tumour microenvironment including cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, enabling simultaneous profiling of the tumour and its microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Clustering was performed after removal of reads mapping to the WILD-seq vector, to avoid any influence of the WILD-seq transcript on clustering, and the WILD-seq barcode assignment subsequently overlaid onto these data. The tumour cell clusters were clearly identifiable by the high expression of the barcode transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Occasionally a barcode was observed in cells which clustered according to their transcriptome outside of the main tumour cluster. Since this could be the result of sequencing or technical error causing a mismatch between the WILD-seq barcode and the cell of origin, only barcoded cells that clustered within the main tumour/mammary epithelium cell cluster were included in our analysis.</p><p>We reproducibly observed the same clonal populations across animals and independent experiments which is critical to our ability to examine the effects of different interventions and treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). The relative abundance of clones was similar in tumours grown in NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunodeficient and BALB/c immunocompetent mice but was drastically different to that found in the in vitro cell pool from which they were established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting that clones that show greatest fitness in cell culture do not necessarily show fitness in vivo. Therefore, in vitro clonal lineage tracking experiments are likely to capture a different collection of clones and have the potential to identify sensitive or resistance clones that are not represented in vivo. Pseudo-bulk analysis of the major clonal lineages revealed that the composition of the tumour microenvironment has a dramatic effect on the transcriptome of the tumour cells for all clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Comparison of in vitro culture, tumours from NSG mice, and tumours from BALB/c mice by principal component analysis (PCA), showed clear separation of the tumour cells depending on their environment, with differences in interferon gamma signaling, TNF-alpha signaling, and cell cycle being most prominent between cells grown in vivo and in vitro (PC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Differences in gene expression between tumours growing in immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts were related to changes in the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and changes in interferon gamma and Il-2 signaling, consistent with the differences in T-cell abundance (PC2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). These data highlight the importance of the host immune system in sculpting the transcriptome and provide cautionary context for the analysis of tumour gene expression in immune-compromised hosts. Although there were large differences between clonal gene expression patterns across hosts, the clones showed consistent differences in gene expression across all settings, reflective of intrinsic clonal properties, with the biggest variation in gene expression across the clones being related to their position along the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) axis (PC3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). In particular, Clone 679 is the most distinct and the most mesenchymal of the clones.</p><p>To further characterise the major clones in our tumours, we performed gene set expression analysis using AUCell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) to identify pathways that are enriched in cells of a specific clonal lineage. Analysis was performed across four independent experiments each with three vehicle-treated animals and for the majority of clones we were able to identify distinct gene expression signatures that were reproducible across animals and experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simultaneous detection of changes in clonal abundance, gene expression, and tumour microenvironment in response to BET bromodomain inhibition with WILD-seq</title><p>Having established that we can repeatedly observe the same clonal lineages and their gene expression programs across animals and experiments, we next sought to perturb the system. We chose the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 for our proof-of-principle experiments to assess the ability of the WILD-seq system to simultaneously measure changes in clonal abundance, gene expression and the tumour microenvironment that occur following therapeutic intervention. JQ1 competitively binds to acetylated lysines, displacing BRD4 and thereby repressing transcription at specific loci. A large number of studies have indicated that BET inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumours including breast cancer, possibly by inhibiting certain key proto-oncogenes such as MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Treatment of our 4T1 WILD-seq tumour-bearing mice with JQ1 caused an initial suppression of tumour growth but with only a small overall effect on time to humane endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

To analyze this further, we computationally extracted these cells from the single cell data, reclustered them and performed differential abundance testing using Milo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Milo detects sets of cells that are differentially abundant between conditions by modeling counts of cells in neighborhoods of a KNN graph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dann et al., 2022</xref>).

Differential expression analysis was performed for each clonal lineage and experiment independently. As expected, given its mode of action, we identified significant down-regulation of a wide range of genes with consistent changes across clonal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

JQ1 has previously been reported to directly inhibit transcription of IFN-response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibbons et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gusyatiner et al., 2021</xref>) suggesting this may be due to the direct action of JQ1 within our tumour cells; however, JQ1-dependent changes to the tumour microenvironment may also influence these expression pathways.</p><p>Our barcoded 4T1 clones showed varied sensitivity to JQ1, with treatment causing reproducible changes to clonal proportions within the tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> shows the proportions of clones in vehicle or JQ1 treated tumours from a representative experiment. We classified one of the most abundant clones, clone 473, as highly sensitive to JQ1 treatment and three clones as being resistant to JQ1 treatment, clones 93, 439, and 264 based on these clones showing consistent behavior across two independent experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> for a side-by-side comparison of experiments). These resistant clones which together make up less than 5% of the tumour in vehicle treated mice constitute on average 12.8% of the JQ1-treated tumours. To correlate the baseline transcriptomic signatures of clones with JQ1-sensitivity and resistance, we derived a log<sub>2</sub> fold change value for each clone using data from two independent experiments, each consisting of 3 vehicle and 3 JQ1 treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). We used these fold change values as a measure of JQ1 response to investigate transcriptomic characteristics that are correlated with sensitivity and resistance, an approach that obviates the need for binary classification of clones as sensitive and resistant and takes into account all the available data. We identified gene sets whose expression in vehicle-treated tumours was highly correlated with response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Interestingly, interferon signaling which is significantly attenuated in our JQ1-treated tumours is highly correlated with sensitivity to JQ1, suggesting a possible higher dependence of the sensitive clones on these pathways.

As with JQ1, docetaxel treatment resulted in an initial, modest reduction in tumour growth followed by relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

To understand the properties of these clones, we analysed the baseline gene expression characteristics of clones in vehicle-treated tumours. The gene expression of cells from a clone of interest was compared to all tumour cells to which a WILD-seq barcode could be assigned from the same sample, and clonal signatures identified that were significantly enriched across animals.

Due to the low abundance of cells in vehicle-treated samples, cells belonging to all three clones were pooled to analyse their baseline gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Among the gene sets differentially expressed between resistant and sensitive clones, were a number of breast cancer amplicons indicating that there may be specific copy number variations associated with these clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and h</xref>).

While informative, these studies cannot differentiate between changes in bulk gene expression that arise due to clonal selection and changes that are induced within a clonal lineage as the result of drug exposure. Even with single-cell sequencing, definitive identification of the same clonal population across treatment conditions is impractical as it relies upon gene expression to group and cluster the cells, and if gene expression changes identifying the same subtypes of tumour cells with and without treatment is technically challenging. Our method alleviates these difficulties by enabling the direct comparison of clones of the same lineage under different conditions.</p><p>To examine the relative contribution of clonal selection and transcriptional reprogramming to changes in gene expression upon chemotherapy, we compared analysis of gene expression within each clone individually to a combined analysis of all pooled tumour cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). Consistent with their mode of action, docetaxel had relatively little effect on the transcriptome of individual clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>) while JQ1 caused substantial changes to the transcriptome predominantly down-regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Genes were identified under all treatments that were altered within the tumour as a whole but as a result of clonal selection rather than intra-clonal changes in gene expression, with the biggest effects being observed with docetaxel treatment in D2A1-m2 tumours, in agreement with this condition inducing the largest changes in relative clonal abundance. To confirm that changes in gene expression detected in bulk tumour analysis but not the clonal analysis could be attributed to differences in clonal sensitivity to chemotherapy, we analysed baseline expression of these genes across the major clonal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d, e and f</xref>). As expected, we found that genes upregulated only in bulk tumour analysis had significantly higher expression in clones resistant to chemotherapy (that increase in abundance with treatment) and genes only down-regulated in bulk tumour analysis had significantly lower expression in these resistant clonal lineages.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Delineating the contribution of clonal abundance to gene expression changes upon drug treatment.</title><p>(<bold>a and b and c</bold>) Comparison of differential gene expression analysis in bulk tumour cells and intra-clonal changes in gene expression.

Alternatively differential gene expression was performed for each individual clone separately and the results combined to identify genes which robustly undergo intra-clonal changes in expression (analysis by clone). Whereas bulk tumour cell analysis will identify changes in overall gene expression due to both changes in clonal abundance and changes within the cells, analysis by clone enables us to delineate exclusively induced cellular changes in gene expression.

This metabolic dependency can be targeted therapeutically using L-asparaginase (ASNase from <italic>E. coli</italic>), which is deployed in the clinical management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<italic>ALL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batool et al., 2016</xref>), and catalyzes the conversion of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To ascertain whether docetaxel-resistant clones were collaterally sensitive to ASNase, we treated D2A1-m2 WILD-seq tumours initially with docetaxel to select for resistant clones and then began daily treatment with L-asparaginase one week later. This dosing regime was chosen as we found that with the dose of docetaxel used in this study, co-administration of the 2 drugs or treatment with ASNase immediately following docetaxel was poorly tolerated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, treatment with ASNase arrested tumour growth and led to a ~40% increase in time to endpoint (relative to vehicle) in this highly aggressive model, although the tumours did acquire resistance and regrew after approximately one week of treatment. Importantly, ASNase alone had no significant effect on tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), suggesting that docetaxel-dependent expansion of NRF2-high clones is required for ASNase treatment to induce a change in bulk tumour growth. To determine the response of individual clonal lineages within the bulk tumour to ASNase treatment, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on vehicle treated tumours (day 21), as well as docetaxel treated tumours before the start of ASNase treatment (day 21) and after 4 doses of ASNase (day 25). As before, our docetaxel-resistant clones, 751, 1197 and 1240, which have high levels of NRF2 signaling all exhibited a dramatic increase in their abundance with docetaxel treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Excitingly, clones 751 and 1197 were sensitive to ASNase returning to baseline levels. Clone 1240 decreased in abundance in 2 of the 3 mice analysed so is likely to also be sensitive to ASNase and further experiments confirm this (see below). As predicted, our NRF2-high resistant clones were selectively targeted by amino acid deprivation as other clones such as 2323 were unchanged in their relative abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Taxane-resistant, NRF2-high clones are inherently sensitive to amino acid deprivation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Docetaxel-resistant tumours are collaterally sensitive to L-asparaginase.

Genes which consistently changed in expression after ASNase treatment across clonal lineages are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>. Many of the genes found to be differentially expressed in our tumour cells following L-asparaginase treatment are either directly related to protein synthesis (<italic>Eif3c</italic>, <italic>Gars</italic>, <italic>Eif3g</italic>, <italic>Eif5a</italic>) or are consistent with changes in gene expression reported in cell lines following amino acid deprivation including <italic>Atf5</italic>, <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Egr1,</italic> and <italic>Asns</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pohjanpelto and Hölttä, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shan et al., 2010</xref>). Of specific interest is the up-regulation of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>) which catalyses the de novo biosynthesis of L-asparagine from L-aspartate and is therefore a potential mediator of ASNase resistance. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<italic>ALL</italic>), low levels of ASNS resulting in a dependence on extracellular asparagine are considered an important biomarker for L-asparaginase treatment. Moreover, the importance of ASNS overexpression in conferring asparaginase resistance has been well documented and is frequently seen in <italic>ALL</italic> patients that develop drug-resistant forms of the disease following treatment with ASNase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</xref>). The stress responsive transcription factor ATF4 is a well-known regulator of ASNS expression under conditions of amino acid deprivation. To determine whether ATF4 activity was associated with <italic>Asns</italic> induction in our model, we utilised a gene set indicative of ATF4 transcriptional activity, from which we removed <italic>Asns</italic> itself. AUCell analysis revealed a strong correlation between <italic>Asns</italic> and ATF4 activity across clones in ASNase treated tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>. <italic>R</italic>=0.817, p=6.3 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) but not in vehicle (<italic>R</italic>=0.131, p=0.758) or DTX (<italic>R</italic>=0.397, p=0.158) treated tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting that ATF4 specifically drives asparaginase-induced <italic>Asns</italic> expression. In our experiments, baseline <italic>Asns</italic> expression was consistent across clones and induction in response to asparaginase was observed across all clones analysed, albeit to slightly different magnitudes, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>) suggesting a general resistance mechanism and supporting the clinical utility of an ASNS inhibitor, if one were to be developed, as third line treatment in this context.</p><p>We hypothesised that the observed effects of ASNase on our taxane-resistant clones was an inherent property of these clones rather than a docetaxel-induced phenomenon, since they exhibit basally high levels of NRF2 signalling. However, due to the low abundance of these clones prior to docetaxel treatment (&lt;1%) accurate estimation of the effect of ASNase alone on these clones in the absence of docetaxel-induced selection is challenging. As an alternative means to test this hypothesis, we attempted to establish monoclonal cell lines of these clones by isolating them from their parental pool by single-cell cloning. Single-cell clones were screened by qPCR of the genomic DNA with a barcode-specific reverse primer and a forward primer that binds with the zsGreen transgene (for primer validation see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using this strategy, we successfully isolated the NRF2-high clones 751 and 1240. We then implanted these clones individually into BALB/c mice and after one week we initiated treatment with ASNase monotherapy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>, monoclonal tumours derived from clone 751 or 1240 both exhibited significant suppression of tumour growth in response to ASNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>), while tumours derived from our standard 3 pools of D2A1-m2 WILD-seq cells containing all clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>) did not. These data strongly indicate that NRF2-high clones have a pre-existing sensitivity to ASNase and that docetaxel treatment merely increases their abundance rather than shaping their phenotype.</p><p>In summary, our data support the notion that WILD-seq can identify causal mechanisms of drug resistance in vivo, that can be leveraged to inform new combination therapies. Since the redox defense signatures we identified are detectable in patients after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), one can envisage an approach whereby patients receiving NAC have the surgical tumour specimen profiled for NRF2 gene signatures and those with high levels receive a post-operative course of L-asparaginase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tumour heterogeneity is thought to underlie drug resistance through the selection of clonal lineages that can preferentially survive therapy. However, identifying the features of such lineages, so that they can be targeted therapeutically, has been challenging due the lack of understanding of their molecular characteristics and the lack of animal models to prospectively test therapeutic interventions and combinations thereof. To overcome these challenges, we developed WILD-seq, a system that leverages expressed barcodes, population bottle necking, syngeneic mouse models and single cell RNA-seq to link clonal lineage to the transcriptome. Among the existing methods for coupling lineage tracing with single cell transcriptomic profiling, the majority use either lentiviral delivery of a genetic barcode similar to that used here or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations for clonal lineage identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biddy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simeonov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>). We chose to avoid CRISPR/Cas9-based lineage labelling as induction of DNA damage could have an impact on the transcriptome and the sensitivity of the cells to therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haapaniemi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>) many of which cause DNA damage as part of their mechanism of action. Our approach is unique in that we purposefully bottleneck our clonal population to achieve a balance between maximising clonal diversity and minimising variation in clonal representation across replicate animals and experiments. It is this feature that allows us to robustly call clonal gene expression signatures and differential clonal abundance before and after therapeutic intervention and it is this in turn that allows us to identify relevant drug resistance mechanisms in vivo.</p><p>Single cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool to study complex biological systems and recent analytical advances have facilitated the integration of diverse datasets to infer effects of perturbations. While these approaches are well suited to integrating data across samples and conditions at the level of cell types which are discriminated by large differences in gene expression, they are currently unable to reliably identify the same subtypes of tumour cells, such as different clonal lineages, across samples as these are discriminated by relatively small differences in gene expression and this data is confounded by gene expression changes induced by the local microenvironment. These issues are further exacerbated when the perturbation under investigation induces further and potentially clonal lineage-specific transcriptomic changes. Barcoding approaches, such as WILD-seq, circumvent these problems by using the barcode to match sub-populations of cells across conditions and treatments without reliance on their transcriptomic profile and thereby enables the deconvolution of changes in abundance of subtypes of tumour cells and changes in the cell state. As such, barcoding with WILD-seq facilitates interpretation of perturbations in single-cell RNA-seq regardless of whether changes in clonal abundance are an expected outcome.</p><p>We find that the abundance of clones in cell culture and in vivo differ greatly, with the most abundant clones in vitro being lowly represented in vivo and vice versa thus providing a cautionary note when analyzing drug response in vitro. Moreover, WILD-seq of 4T1 tumours revealed that the relative immune competence of the host profoundly sculpts the transcriptome of clonal lineages and, as exemplified by JQ1, therapeutic interventions can impact the tumour microenvironment and its interaction with tumour cells, effects that would be missed in vitro and in immunocompromised hosts. We utilised WILD-seq to analyze sensitivity and resistance to taxane chemotherapy in two syngeneic, triple negative, mammary carcinoma models highlighting both known and new pathways of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marine et al., 2020</xref>). Resistance to cancer therapies can arise due to clonal selection or through adaptive reprograming of the epigenome and transcriptome of individual clones. Our data with docetaxel treatment in the 4T1 and D2A1-m2 models indicate that, over the time frames we have examined, clonal selection is the dominant force driving resistance to taxane chemotherapy, with gene expression signatures, such as EMT and NRF2 signaling, being present in clones at baseline that are then selected for during therapy. Critical support for a clonal selection mechanism comes from the observation that monoclonal tumours derived from NRF2-high D2A1-m2 clones are inherently sensitive to L-asparaginase without ever having been exposed to taxanes, indicating that docetaxel merely enriches for these clones that have a pre-existing vulnerability to asparagine deprivation. Conversely, up-regulation of <italic>Asns</italic>, which was detected across clonal lineages after L-asparaginase treatment, is suggestive of an adaptive transcriptional resistance phenotype. Therefore, depending on the mode of action of specific drugs, transcriptional reprogramming may also induce therapeutic resistance and such mechanisms can also be effectively identified with the WILD-seq platform where clonal resolution can confirm a lack of clonal selection. For example, it has been proposed that tumour cells can dynamically switch between epithelial and mesenchymal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shibue and Weinberg, 2017</xref>) and that such cells may transition to a more mesenchymal state to resist the initial therapy and then transition back towards a more epithelial state to proliferate and repopulate the tumour. While the data presented here suggest that the shift towards a more mesenchymal tuour phenotype upon taxane treatment is driven by clonal selection rather than a change in the state of cells, it is entirely plausible that transient changes in EMT status occur within our clonal population that are missed by sampling at endpoint. Future experiments with sampling of multiple time points and/or re-transplantation experiments present an interesting future application of the WILD-seq system that could directly address these questions where barcoding would be critical to differentiate between changes in cell state and changes in abundance.</p><p>Applying WILD-seq to examine docetaxel response across two TNBC models afforded the opportunity to overlap resistance genes for the same drug across models and remove model-specific effects. These analyses uncovered a critical role for redox defense in docetaxel resistance that also appears to be operative in human breast cancer patients after chemotherapy. Having identified a primary cause of resistance, we next sought to explore the possibility of collateral sensitivity. Collateral sensitivity, first described for antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imamovic and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pluchino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roemhild and Andersson, 2021</xref>) is the phenomenon by which resistance to one drug comes at the cost of sensitivity to a second drug. In the context of cancer and taxanes, collateral sensitivity has the distinct advantage over other therapeutic strategies of maintaining the initial first line therapy and only modifying subsequent therapies. We took advantage of previous findings linking constitutive NRF2 signaling, via <italic>Keap1</italic> loss, to a dependency on exogenous non-essential amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeBoeuf et al., 2020</xref>) and thereby sensitivity to L-asparaginase. Application of L-asparaginase after docetaxel treatment led to an initial cessation of tumour growth followed by regrowth 6 days later. WILD-seq of docetaxel-treated tumours before and after L-asparaginase treatment confirmed the specific suppression of NRF2-high clones and also revealed a compensatory, largely clone agnostic, up-regulation of asparagine synthetase (<italic>Asns</italic>), which likely drives relapse in these tumours given the importance of ASNS to L-asparaginase resistance in <italic>ALL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richards and Kilberg, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, we have previously shown that asparagine bioavailability regulates EMT and metastatic progression in breast cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knott et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, asparagine deprivation, which has not been extensively explored in breast cancer, may present multiple benefits to patients and the utility of L-asparaginase, a clinical stage drug, in this setting warrants further investigation.</p><p>This study highlights the challenges of tackling tumour heterogeneity therapeutically. Even though we can effectively suppress the induction of docetaxel resistant clones by administration of L-asparaginase the tumours still adapt to this intervention and regrow, most likely due to transcriptionally shifting their metabolism towards de novo asparagine synthesis. Nevertheless, hope still remains since there are only three avenues by which cells can supply themselves with asparagine (1) uptake of extracellular asparagine which is effectively shut-off by ASNase (2) de novo synthesis through Asns or (3) catabolism of existing proteins. If we could effectively force tumours to depend on synthesis through ASNS, we could then deprive them of that additional dependency if ASNS-directed therapeutics were to be developed.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and W Kimryn Rathmell as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thales Papagiannakopoulos (Reviewer #1); Michael Hemann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers were thoroughly impressed with the quality of the manuscript and the potential impact on cancer studies. The authors should be commended for a beautiful piece of work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Attend to the requests for clarification and expanded discussion from reviewers 1 and 2, particularly with regard to NRF2 signalling and the EMT/MET transitions.</p><p>2) Respond to reviewers requests for additional insights to ATF4 and l-aspariginase sensitivity. Additional analysis of existing data may be warranted, but we are specifically not looking for additional mouse experiments.</p><p>3) Please provide a point by point response to the remainder of the reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In response to BET inhibitors the authors identify both Unfolded protein response (UPR) and mTOR pathways associated with resistance. UPR involves several signaling arms and transcription factors. The authors should discuss which arm of the UPR pathway is primarily associated with resistance? For example, ATF4 has been previously shown to regulate autophagy which has been shown to lead to resistance to BET inhibition. This is particularly important also in relation to the DTX resistance studies given that ATF4, which is part of UPR, is a well-known regulator of ASNS and amino acid deprivation response.</p><p>– The observation that the NRF2 transcriptional signature is upregulated in DTX resistant cells is important. The authors should validate the heterogenous nature of NRF2 activation in tumor pre- and post-taxane DTX treatment either by staining for NRF2 or some of its bona-fide transcriptional targets by immunohistochemistry. They should observe a clonal expansion of the NRF2-high populations upon DTX treatment. Conversely, the authors should observe a selective depletion of these cells in response to L-asparaginase treatment.</p><p>– Given that ATF4 is a well known regulator of ASNS, the authors should determine whether ATF4 protein levels are increased in resistant tumors. The authors might not observe an increase of ATF4 transcriptionally given that it is primarily regulated post-transcriptionally. Both ATF4 and ASNS can be detected by immunohistochemistry.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While I don't know if any of these major experiments are critical for publication (as I think there is substantial, important work presented in the submitted manuscript), I would recommend the following:</p><p>Major experiments:</p><p>1. Perform transplant experiments with taxane-resistant 4T1 tumors to see if the clonal representation reverts to pre-treatment states.</p><p>2. Pretreat D2A1 tumors with L-asparaginase, perform clonal analysis of tumors, and then treat with taxanes to see if pre-treatment eliminates resistant clones (the other possibility is that treatment with taxanes is necessary to create the L-asparaginase sensitive state).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think that the experiment is conducted with sufficient rigor, and is exciting in its current state. I have no major recommendations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80981.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Attend to the requests for clarification and expanded discussion from reviewers 1 and 2, particularly with regard to NRF2 signalling and the EMT/MET transitions.</p><p>2) Respond to reviewers requests for additional insights to ATF4 and l-aspariginase sensitivity.

In the context of L-asparaginase resistance, as suggested by the reviewer, ATF4 activation most likely underlies the upregulation of <italic>Asns</italic> in response to amino acid deprivation. In tumour cells treated with asparaginase we see strong correlation between ATF4 activity (as assessed by expression levels of transcriptional targets of ATF4) and <italic>Asns</italic> expression (See new Figure 7f and Figure 7 —figure supplement 1b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The observation that the NRF2 transcriptional signature is upregulated in DTX resistant cells is important.

As such, we don’t have samples available that would be suitable for immunohistochemistry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given that ATF4 is a well known regulator of ASNS, the authors should determine whether ATF4 protein levels are increased in resistant tumors.

Instead, we have analysed the output of the ATF4 pathway in our scRNA-Seq data. We find that expression of transcriptional targets of ATF4 correlate very well with <italic>Asns</italic> specifically under asparaginase treatment (See new Figure 7f and Figure 7 —figure supplement 1b) suggesting a role for ATF4 in mediating the <italic>Asns</italic> up-regulation in this setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While I don't know if any of these major experiments are critical for publication (as I think there is substantial, important work presented in the submitted manuscript), I would recommend the following:</p><p>Major experiments:</p><p>1.
