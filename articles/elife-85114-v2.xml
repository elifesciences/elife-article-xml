its ability to under a morphogenetic transition from typically budding yeast to filamentous forms of hyphae and pseudohyphae. Filamentous morphogenesis is the most intensively studied <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence traits; however, nearly all of these studies have been based on in vitro induction of filamentation. Using an intravital imaging assay of filamentation during mammalian (mouse) infection, we have screened a library of transcription factor mutants to identify those that modulate both the initiation and maintenance of filamentation in vivo. We coupled this initial screen with genetic interaction analysis and in vivo transcription profiling to characterize the transcription factor network governing filamentation in infected mammalian tissue. Three core positive (Efg1, Brg1, and Rob1) and two core negative regulators (Nrg1 and Tup1) of filament initiation were identified. No previous systematic analysis of genes affecting the elongation step has been reported and we found that large set of transcription factors affect filament elongation in vivo including four (Hms1, Lys14, War1, Dal81) with no effect on in vitro elongation. We also show that the gene targets of initiation and elongation regulators are distinct. Genetic interaction analysis of the core positive and negative regulators revealed that the master regulator Efg1 primarily functions to mediate relief of Nrg1 repression and is dispensable for expression of hypha-associated genes in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our analysis not only provide the first characterization of the transcriptional network governing <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation in vivo but also revealed a fundamentally new mode of function for Efg1, one of the most widely studied <italic>C. albicans</italic> transcription factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Candida albicans</italic></kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>transcriptional network</kwd><kwd>virulence traits</kwd><kwd>intravital imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI133409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krysan</surname><given-names>Damian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An intravital screen identifies the transcription factors that govern gene expression of the human fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> during filamentation in a mammalian host.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular morphology and morphogenesis are central features of fungal biology that contribute to the ability of fungi to cause disease in plants and mammals. In <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, one of the most common human fungal pathogens, the ability to transition between round, budding yeast and filamentous hyphae and pseudohyphae is positively correlated with its ability to cause both mucosal and invasive infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lopes and Lionakis, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sudbery, 2011</xref>). Conversely, establishment of the commensal state of <italic>C. albicans</italic> within the gastrointestinal tract is negatively correlated with filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Witchley et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the yeast form is thought to be required for dissemination within the blood stream while transition to hyphae contributes to tissue damage in both disseminated and mucosal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saville et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meir et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, <italic>C. albicans</italic> morphogenesis has been an intensively studied virulence trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Villa et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To date, the extensive literature devoted to understanding the mechanisms of <italic>C. albicans</italic> morphogenesis has been almost entirely focused on the in vitro induction of the yeast-to-hyphae transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sudbery, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Villa et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these studies, a wide range of genes and regulatory pathways have been found to modulate this transition in response to various inducing conditions in vitro. A significant knowledge gap is that it is not clear how many of these genes and pathways are also involved in <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation in vivo. Our group has developed an in vivo imaging assay that allows us to directly, and quantitatively, characterize <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation during mammalian infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wakade et al., 2022b</xref>). Specifically, a 1:1 mixture of WT and mutant <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains labeled with different colored fluorescent proteins are inoculated into subcutaneous/epithelial stroma of a mouse ear. Using confocal microscopy, the relative yeast/filament ratio and the filament length of the two strains is readily determined for large numbers of cells, providing a statistically powerful assay of in vivo filamentation. Importantly, we can characterize both initiation of the morphological switch (ratio of yeast to filament) and maintenance of filamentous growth (filament length). Furthermore, the tissue that is infected in this approach is anatomically equivalent to the subepithelial stroma below mucosal surfaces where <italic>C. albicans</italic> colonizes humans. During initial disease, <italic>C. albicans</italic> undergoes yeast-to-hyphae transition within this compartment and thus our approach models filamentation in a tissue that is directly relevant to <italic>C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis.</p><p>Our initial investigations using this model have revealed significant differences between the in vitro and in vivo regulation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wakade et al., 2022a</xref>). For example, the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway is required for initiation of filamentation in almost all in vitro conditions; specifically, strains lacking the adenylyl cyclase gene (<italic>CYR1</italic>) or the PKA catalytic subunits (<italic>TPK1/2</italic>) remain in yeast phase under hyphae-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, <italic>cyr1</italic>ââ and <italic>tpk1</italic>ââ <italic>tpk2</italic>ââ mutants form hyphae in vivo to nearly the same extent as WT cells, indicating that this pathway plays a minor role in the regulating the switch between morphotypes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wakade et al., 2022a</xref>). The length of the filaments formed by these mutants is shorter than WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wakade et al., 2022b</xref>). Consequently, the PKA pathway appears to switch from controlling initiation of hyphae formation in vitro to regulating maintenance of hyphal extension in vivo.</p><p>To further characterize the regulation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation in vivo, we screened a collection of 155 transcription factor (TF) deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>) for those with either reduced hyphae/yeast ratios or filament length. We combined these studies with in vivo transcriptional profiling and genetic interaction analysis to provide the first model for the transcriptional network regulating <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation during infection of mammalian tissue. Although there are similarities between the TF networks operative in vitro and in vivo, we have identified TFs that affect filamentation in vivo but not in vitro. In addition, we provide evidence that the master regulator of <italic>C. albicans</italic> morphogenesis, Efg1, mainly functions to inhibit the function of Nrg1, a critical repressor of filamentation during filamentation within tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of TFs required for <italic>C. albicans</italic> filament initiation in vivo</title><p>Previously, we reported the in vivo characterization of four TFs (Efg1, Brg1, Bcr1, and Ume6) with well-studied roles in vitro filamentation using both laboratory strains and clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>). As part of their characterization of a collection of 155 TF deletion mutants, Homann et al. reported that at least 40 mutants had effects, both positive and negative, on morphogenesis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>). Taking advantage of this important genetic resource, we set out to define the set of TFs that regulate <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation in vivo. To do so, we labeled all TF mutants by integrating an iRFP fusion protein at the <italic>ENO1</italic> locus as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>). A 1:1 mixture of the iRFP-labeled TF mutant and SN250 (WT, unless otherwise indicated) containing a GFP fusion protein integrated at the same locus was injected into the pinna of a DBA/2 mouse ear. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, infected ears were imaged by confocal microscopy as detailed in the Methods and in a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wakade et al., 2022b</xref>). This time point gives a ratio of yeast-to-filamentous cells similar to that resulting from incubation of the WT strain for 4 hr in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); the latter conditions are those we used for in vivo to in vitro comparisons reported herein.</p><p>We characterized in vivo filamentation using two readouts that correspond to hyphal initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wakade et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). First, the ratio of yeast to filamentous cells was determined for each mutant; scoring criteria are outlined in Methods. This readout reflects the ability of a strain to initiate the filamentation program. Second, we estimated the filament length of the WT and TF deletion mutant cells. This readout reflects the ability of a strain to maintain filament elongation. We found that all TF mutants, with the exception of the <italic>efg1</italic>ââ mutant, formed some proportion of filamentous cells. Each TF mutant was paired with the WT strain in the infection to better control for day-to-day variation. In addition, this experimental design improved the statistical power of the analyses because we did not need to correct for multiple comparisons. Previous control experiments have not found any evidence of in-trans effects associated with this co-infection approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A volcano plot showing the normalized proportion of filamentous cells for each TF deletion mutant is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Only two mutants (<italic>tup1</italic>ââ and <italic>nrg1</italic>ââ) showed statistically significant increases in the proportion of filaments; Tup1 and Nrg1 are well-characterized repressors of filamentation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sudbery, 2011</xref>). We classified the TF mutants with reduced filamentation into two groups: (1) core regulators of in vivo filamentation (<italic>EFG1</italic>, <italic>BRG1</italic>, <italic>ROB1</italic>), defined as mutants that formed fewer than 30% filamentous cells, and (2) auxiliary regulators, defined as mutants with a statistically significant change in filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intravital imaging assay identifies transcription factor mutants with altered initiation of filament formation in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of % filamentous cells of transcription factor homozygous deletion mutants normalized to co-infecting wild type (WT) cells 24 hr after injection into the subdermal tissue of a mouse ear.

Deletion of <italic>BRG1</italic>, <italic>ROB1</italic>, <italic>TEC1</italic>, and <italic>RIM101</italic> reduced the ratio of filaments/yeast but each of these homozygous deletion mutants formed filaments. Similar results were observed with these five mutants in vitro using RPMI+10% FBS medium at 37Â°C as inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Among the auxiliary regulators, a total of five TF deletion mutants were reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>) to be deficient for filamentation in vitro (<italic>TEC1</italic>, <italic>RIM101</italic>, <italic>CPH2</italic>, <italic>AHR1</italic>, <italic>ISW2</italic>, <italic>NDT80</italic>, <italic>SFL2</italic>) while three mutants showed the opposite phenotype of increased filamentation in vitro but decreased filamentation in vivo (<italic>FGR15</italic>, <italic>ZCF3</italic>, <italic>19.6874</italic>).

The <italic>stp2</italic>ââ mutant showed reduced filamentation as well; however, Stp2 regulates amino acid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MiramÃ³n and Lorenz, 2016</xref>) and we suspected this phenotype may represent a genetic interaction with the <italic>arg4</italic>ââ mutation present in this background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Noble and Johnson, 2005</xref>); consistent with this hypothesis, re-introduction of the <italic>ARG4</italic> gene to the <italic>stp2</italic>ââ mutant restored normal filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Efg1 has been a well-studied master regulator of in vitro filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glazier, 2022</xref>).

These five strains were part of a larger collection of clinical isolates that were extensively characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>. Among these strains, Hirakawa found one that contained a natural <italic>EFG1</italic> loss-of-function mutation (P94015). Since Efg1 is required for full virulence in mouse models and the ability to filament is strongly associated with virulence, we wondered if P94015 might contain a suppressor mutation that would allow it to filament in vivo. Consistent with its inability to filament in vitro and its lack of a functional copy of <italic>EFG1</italic>, the P94015 strain was essentially afilamentous in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We recently reported the expression profile of WT infecting the ear and showed correlated with both the profile of cells from infected kidney tissue and in vitro hyphae induction; correlation between the two in vivo profiles was stronger than with in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>). These data indicate that the transcriptional and, by inference, the physiological state of the cells of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells under these in vitro induction conditions is reasonably similar to the state of the cells in vivo. Consistent with that notion, the percentage of filamentous cells is very similar between 4 hr in vitro induction and 24 hr post infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we feel that comparisons between these two conditions will be, to a first approximation, valid. Furthermore, these transcriptional similarities argue against our imaging model as being a special case that is not comparable to other infection niches or induction conditions.</p><p>We examined the effect of the three core regulators of filament initiation in vivo using NanoString, Consistent with their roles in both in vivo and in vitro filamentation, the <italic>brg1</italic>ââ, <italic>efg1</italic>ââ, and <italic>rob1</italic>ââ mutants altered the expression of the environmentally responsive genes under both in vitro and in vivo conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). From the chord plots, Efg1 is the dominant TF in vitro while Rob1 regulates a larger number of this set of genes in vivo. In contrast, Brg1 regulates a similarly sized set of genes under both conditions. Although there is overlap between the in vitro and in vivo sets of genes regulated by each TF, there are more genes that are regulated only in vitro or in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These data suggest that the direct and/or indirect target set of each TF is dependent on the environment. We also asked how many targets were regulated in common by the three core TFs. Focusing on the in vivo expression data, a significant percentage of genes downregulated in the <italic>efg1</italic>ââ mutant (67%) was also downregulated in one of the other two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Each of the less dominant TFs are regulated by two additional TFs. Efg1-Brg1-Tec1 and Efg1-Brg1-Ahr1 both appear to form feedforward loops.

In vitro, repressors of <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation include Nrg1, Tup1, Ssn6, and Rfg1. Although Homann et al. found that 16 TF deletion mutants were hyper-filamentous on at least one condition in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>), our in vivo screen of the same deletion set found that the <italic>nrg1</italic>ââ and <italic>tup1</italic>ââ mutants were the only two with statistically significant increases in percentage filamentous cells. Similarly, deletion mutants of <italic>NRG1</italic> and <italic>TUP1</italic> were the only two that formed longer filaments than the WT strain. We were interested, therefore, in generating double mutants of three key positive regulators (Brg1, Efg1, and Rob1) and repressors (Tup1 and Nrg1) to gain information about how they worked together to regulate morphogenesis in vivo.</p><p>We first examined the genetic interaction between the Tup1 and Efg1. The <italic>tup1</italic>ââ mutant forms nearly 100% filaments in vitro and in vivo while the <italic>efg1</italic>ââ mutant forms almost no filaments under either condition.

From these data, Efg1 and Nrg1 appears to bind a common set of hypha-associated genes during filament initiation but Efg1 is not required for their expression. Most likely, Rob1 and Brg1 along with additional TFs contribute to the expression of Nrg1-repressed, hypha-associated genes. After relief of Nrg1 repression, Efg1 binds to the promoters and regulates the expression of a second set of genes that are not repressed by Nrg1. Since canonical hyphae-specific genes are in the first class of Efg1 targets, our data are consistent with the surprising result that Efg1 indirectly regulates hyphae-specific genes, possibly by mediating the displacement of Nrg1 from their promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation is one of the most extensively studied virulence traits of this important human fungal pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sudbery, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Villa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>).

The in vivo analysis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation using the direct inoculation of the subepithelial/subdermal tissue of mouse pinna followed by confocal microscopy reported herein has several features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wakade et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wakade et al., 2022a</xref>). First, the method uses direct inoculation of the tissue and thus is not confounded by ability of mutants to colonize, disseminate, and/or invade target organs. Second, the subepithelial tissue is anatomically similar to the stroma below mucosal surfaces and is relevant to infection. Third, hypha-associated gene expression in infected ear tissue correlates well-infected kidney tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wakade et al., 2022a</xref>), the main target of disseminated <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections in mice. Fourth, as we have demonstrated, the model allows the characterization of both filament initiation and elongation.</p><p>Efg1, Brg1, and Rob1 have the strongest phenotypes with respect to both filament initiation and hyphal elongation, although the <italic>efg1</italic>ââ mutant does not form filaments that can be assessed. These three TFs have similar phenotypes in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); additionally, <italic>efg1</italic>ââ and <italic>brg1</italic>ââ mutants have reduced in vitro and in vivo filamentation across multiple clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wakade et al., 2021</xref>). The filamentation phenotypes of these three mutants have also been studied during GI colonization using a FISH-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Witchley et al., 2019</xref>). During GI colonization, the <italic>efg1</italic>ââ, <italic>brg1</italic>ââ, and <italic>rob1</italic>ââ mutants were predominantly in yeast form suggesting they are important for filamentation in both niches. In contrast, the <italic>tec1</italic>ââ mutant formed near WT proportions of filaments during GI colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Witchley et al., 2019</xref>) while the proportion of filaments were reduced in the ear infection model, indicating that Tec1 may play a more important role in filamentation in the submucosae compared to colonization. Finally, Witchley et al. observed that the <italic>ume6</italic>ââ mutant formed filaments to an extent similar to WT in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Witchley et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed no difference in the proportion of filaments formed by the <italic>ume6</italic>ââ mutant relative to WT but that the filaments were much shorter. Witchley et al. did not measure filament length in the GI model but inspection of their micrographs suggests that <italic>ume6</italic>ââ filaments were comparable in length to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Witchley et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, Efg1, Brg1, and Rob1 are important regulators of filamentation in these two niches whereas the roles of other TFs appear to vary from niche to niche.</p><p>In vitro analysis of filamentation/hyphae formation has been performed using a wide range of induction conditions and specific genes are required for filamentation in specific conditions. For example, Homann et al. screened the TF library that we used here using solid agar plates and 15 different media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>). Deletion mutants of <italic>BRG1</italic>, <italic>EFG1</italic>, <italic>ROB1</italic> showed reduced filamentation on the majority of media/conditions while deletion of the repressors <italic>TUP1</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic> showed increased filamentation under all condition. Our in vivo results for filament initiation correlate well with these trends indicating that TFs with important roles in vitro also have important roles in vivo. The mutants with less severe phenotypes in vivo such as <italic>tec1</italic>ââ, <italic>ndt80</italic>ââ, and <italic>cph2</italic>ââ, for example, also had phenotypes in vitro but these were not as consistent across the different conditions. We suggest that these auxiliary regulators respond to a more limited set of stimuli or function together with one or more additional TFs. The synergistic interactions of Efg1 and Brg1 with Tec1 is an example where two core TFs function with an auxiliary TF to, in the case of Efg1-Tec1, interdependently regulate other auxiliary regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Under some in vitro conditions, TFs such as Tec1 and Cph2 have very strong filamentation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lane et al., 2001</xref>) and we suggest that this may occur because those in vitro conditions generate a very specific filamentation signal that is highly dependent on a specific TF(s). In vivo, on the other hand, this signal is but one of many and therefore has a modest effect on filamentation process.</p><p>In the case of repressors of filamentation, a similar pattern arises where Tup1 and Nrg1 repress filamentation under nearly all in vitro conditions; in vivo, <italic>tup1</italic>ââ and <italic>nrg1</italic>ââ mutants were the only two with increased filamentation relative to WT. In vitro, 19 TF mutants have increased filamentation and, consequently, the largest discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo regulators is within the set of repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Homann et al., 2009</xref>). Of these, Nrg1, Tup1, and Ssn6 have been characterized as bona fide transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Braun and Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2005</xref>) while the other TF mutants with increased filamentation are more likely to indirectly cause increased filamentation by altering the physiology of the cell such that its filamentation is a compensatory response. Although our assay may have reduced sensitivity for repressors, it is also possible that the in vivo environment is such a strong inducer of filamentation that mild to moderate repressor phenotypes are masked in this setting.</p><p>Nrg1 and Tup1 are widely described as functioning together to repress filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2005</xref>). Tup1 lacks a DNA-binding domain while Nrg1 does bind specific NRE-binding sites. However, while transcriptional profiling of <italic>tup1</italic>ââ and <italic>nrg1</italic>ââ mutants during filamentation showed significant overlap between the two regulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2005</xref>), distinctions in the differentially expressed genes were apparent as well. Furthermore, constitutive expression of <italic>NRG1</italic> in the TET-off system blocks filamentation under in vitro inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saville et al., 2003</xref>), while expression of <italic>TUP1</italic> from the same promoter does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruben et al., 2020</xref>). These observations indicate that Tup1 and Nrg1 have genetically separable functions. Our data further support and extend this conclusion. The increased filamentation induced by deletion of <italic>TUP1</italic> is dependent upon Efg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), under in vitro and in vivo conditions. In contrast, filamentation of the <italic>nrg1</italic>ââ mutant is not dependent on Efg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The differential Efg1 dependence of Tup1 and Nrg1 is hard to reconcile with a model in which these two repressors function as a complex. Ssn6 and Tup1 are also a well-characterized co-repressor pair that is conserved in eukaryotic cells and have been proposed to function with Nrg1 as complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2005</xref>). However, we observed no phenotype for the <italic>ssn6</italic>ââ mutant in vivo; in vitro, the increased filamentation for <italic>ssn6</italic>ââ is not consistently observed. Taken together, our data and those in the literature suggest that Tup1 and Nrg1 play distinct roles in the repression of filamentation and that the mechanisms mediating relief of their repression are also distinct.</p><p>A model for the interactions of Tup1, Efg1, and Nrg1 that is consistent with our data as well with literature data is as follows. Tup1 lacks a DNA-binding domain and its deletion mutant has effects on gene expression that overlap with Nrg1 based on previously reported microarray studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2005</xref>). We, therefore, propose that Tup1 may bind to Efg1 rather than to Nrg1 and in doing so inhibit Efg1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This would explain the overlapping expression profiles of Tup1 and Nrg1 and the differential genetic interactions between Tup1-Efg1 and Nrg1-Tup1. To date, no CHiP analysis of either Tup1 or Nrg1 has been reported during in vitro filamentation. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively identify shared direct targets of Tup1 and Nrg1. The overlapping expression profiles are explained by our proposed model which is also consistent with genetic interaction data we report herein. Accordingly, future detailed biochemical and binding studies of the Tup1-Nrg1-Efg1 axis are likely to provide interesting new insights into the molecular mechanisms of filamentation regulation.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional regulatory circuit for the expression of hypha-specific genes.</title><p>Red indicates repressor of filamentation; yellow indicates core positive regulator; and light green indicates auxiliary.

Each of the Efg1 bound genes that were restored to WT expression by deletion of <italic>NRG1</italic> in the <italic>efg1</italic>ââ mutant also contained an NRE (to our knowledge, no comprehensive analysis of Nrg1 binding has been reported). These data suggest that Efg1 functions, at some level, to mediate the relief of Nrg1. Since Efg1 and Nrg1 bind some of the same targets, a potential mechanism would be for Efg1 to directly displace Nrg1 from the promoters of hypha-associated genes and, thereby, set the stage for TFs such as Rob1, Brg1, and likely others to bind and directly activate gene expression. Other mechanisms are possible and, regardless of that specific mechanism, our findings indicate that during hypha-initiation Efg1 indirectly regulates the expression of hyphae-specific genes. Overall, these genetic interaction studies indicate that much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanism by which hyphal formation is initiated in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>Based on our genetic screens and genetic interaction studies, we have formulated a genetic circuit for the positive and negative regulation of filament initiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This circuit incorporates previously established concepts and functions derived from in vitro studies as well as the data from the current study. As outlined above, the most distinct aspect of this model is that Efg1 plays an indirect role in regulating the canonical set of hyphae-specific genes by mediating the relief of Nrg1 suppression, leaving the direct activation of these genes to other TFs. Although we have largely limited our in vivo transcriptional studies to the core TFs involved in filament initiation, we suspect that at least some of the auxiliary regulators also contribute to the regulation of hyphae-specific genes as we propose for Tec1.</p><p>In addition to providing new insights into the initiation of filament formation, we have generated the first large-scale data set of TFs that are required for filament elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). A number of TF mutants selectively affect the elongation phase of filamentation in vivo and at least five of these do not affect elongation in vitro. Hms1 and Lys14 are two TFs that regulate hyphal elongation in vivo but have few or no other in vitro phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">PÃ©rez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shapiro et al., 2012</xref>). Perez et al. found that both Hms1 and Lys14 are required for systemic infection, suggesting that reduced elongation may contribute to virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">PÃ©rez et al., 2013</xref>). Our in vivo transcriptional profiling of the <italic>HMS1</italic> and <italic>LYS14</italic> mutants suggest that they regulate a distinct set of genes relative to the core TFs involved in filament initiation. Future studies will be required to understand the relationship between reduced filament elongation in vivo and virulence.</p><p>At least two distinct mechanisms could contribute to the reduced elongation phenotype for a given TF mutant. First, TFs could specifically, and directly, regulate the expression of genes that are uniquely required for hyphal elongation. A prime candidate for this class of TF is Ume6 since it is expressed only during hyphal formation and is required for this process in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2008</xref>). Second, TFs that have general effects on growth under the conditions of hyphae formation would be expected to reduce the rate or limit elongation. We did not do time course analysis in this work and, therefore, it is possible that some of the mutants with reduced apparent filament length would eventually match WT lengths after additional time. From our set of mutants with reduced length, the <italic>sef1</italic>ââ mutant is potential candidate for this class of TF. Sef1 is required for <italic>C. albicans</italic> to respond to the low iron state established by the host during infection. Deletion of <italic>SEF1</italic> leads to reduced growth under low iron conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>) and, therefore, the reduced cellular iron levels in the <italic>sef1</italic>ââ mutant may reduce filament length simply by limiting the growth of the hyphae. Other mechanisms such as septin regulation, Spitzenkorper assembly, activation, and maintenance of polarized growth factors are all undoubtedly active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sudbery, 2011</xref>). Additional studies will be required to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which hyphae elongation-related TFs function during this process.</p><p>Ume6 plays an interesting role in that its phenotype is limited to filament elongation but it appears to share targets with hyphae-initiating TFs, particularly with respect to canonical hyphae-associated genes. As such, it seems to function like a transitional TF that bridges the initiation and elongation phases. It is likely that Rob1, Brg1, and other TFs with effects on both initiation and elongation may also bridge the two phases. Indeed, Nrg1 and Brg1 form a negative feedback loop during in vitro filamentation that is thought to maintain hyphal elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cleary et al., 2012</xref>). Additional work will be required to develop a deeper understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the elongation phase and its key targets, particularly since mutants with selective defects in this process have decreased infectivity and virulence.</p><p>It is important to consider specific limitations of our approach. First, our transcriptional analyses are based on a focused set of genes known to be regulated by different environmental condition based on in vitro experiments. Our previous reported analysis of these gene has shown that the expression of these genes in kidney, ear, and in our in vitro conditions is reasonably well correlated. However, we may be missing key targets for in vivo filamentation since no genome-wide analysis of gene expression has been performed in the ear. This also means the proportion of genes regulated by a given TF is the proportion of our set of genes and we cannot make conclusions about the totality of genes regulated by a given TF.</p><p>Second, we selected a single in vitro filamentation condition to which we compare our in vivo data. There are a wide range of conditions that induce hyphae formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Our selection was based on two primary considerations: (1) RPMI with 10% serum at 37Â°C is somewhat host-like and widely used in the field for this reason; (2) the extent of filament formation by our WT strain at 4 hr induction matches the extent of filamentation we observed after 24 hr in vivo; (3) as mentioned above the expression profiles in this condition were reasonably well correlated. However, it is almost certain that if other in vitro conditions were used as a comparator then a different set of results and conclusions would have resulted.</p><p>Third, some of our genetic interaction analysis was based on complex haploinsufficiency using double heterozygous mutants. We used this approach because the homozygous mutants of the core regulators have very low levels of filamentation; therefore, the dynamic range available to assay a double homozygous mutant would be unlikely to provide a statistically interpretable result. The limitation is that the double heterozygotes may not be sensitive enough to reveal subtle interactions; as such, this approach is quite specific but is likely to miss subtle genetic interactions. In the case of the combination of positive and negative regulators, these concerns were not present and, therefore, we used double homozygous mutants.</p><p>Finally, it is important to consider the generalizability of these data and conclusions to other filament-inducing conditions and, most importantly, other host niches. As discussed above, it is becoming emphatically clear that the regulatory networks governing <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation vary from condition to condition and host niche to host niche. For example, the most widely recognized master transcriptional regulator of filamentation, Efg1, is dispensable for this process when the cells are embedded in agar and incubated at 25Â°C or under hypoxic conditions. From our own work, we have reported that the <italic>brg1</italic>ââ deletion mutant forms robust filaments in oral tissue but has greatly reduced filamentation in the ear model. Our focus on filamentation within the sub-stromal tissue of the ear epithelium is likely to yield results that have both similarities and differences to filamentation at other sites and under other conditions; however, these limitations are true for any study of <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation. We assert that the complexity of this key <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence trait is worthy of additional study and, therein, likely to yield additional insights.</p><p>In summary, our systematic genetic analysis of the transcriptional regulation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation has both confirmed the importance of key regulators identified in vitro and expanded our understanding of the process to include details and concepts that could not have been inferred from in vitro studies alone. The latter emphasizes the utility of studying virulence-associated traits during infection as well as in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see below both reviewers were very favorable about your manuscript. However, they identified several areas where clarifications are needed.</p><p>1) In my opinion no new experimental work is needed.</p><p>2) Please address the reviewers' points below. I believe their comments/criticisms can be addressed with text changes and additional clarifications in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should make it more clear what is the interpretation for the mutants with a slower rate of hyphal elongation in vivo (Figure 2). The mutants do not appear to show a significantly slower rate of elongation in vitro, suggesting that they do not have a major metabolic problem. Although it is an interesting phenotype, it is not clear if this is just a metabolic issue, or if this indicates that the rate of hyphal elongation is regulated in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It would help if the authors could discuss several experimental limitations of this study: (1) proportions of genes controlled by specific TFs may change depending on the Nanostring gene set, (2) in vitro and in vivo targets for TFs can vary depending on conditions and host niches; this is discussed somewhat but it could also alter results and their interpretation, (3) limitations of haploinsufficiency vs. other approaches for determining TF interactions.</p><p>2. The model in Figure 10 is hard to reconcile with previous work showing that many Nrg1 target genes are also Tup1 targets and previous studies showing that Nrg1 DNA-binding protein recruits the Tup1 corepressor in yeast. As a global corepressor, Tup1 may also have targets that are not related to Nrg1. These finding should be considered with respect to the model in Figure 10.</p><p>3. A rationale for studying selected TFs should be provided (lines 361-366).</p><p>4. Alternative mechanisms that control <italic>C. albicans</italic> filament elongation and initiation need to be discussed.</p><p>5.

It would help if the authors could discuss several experimental limitations of this study: (1) proportions of genes controlled by specific TFs may change depending on the Nanostring gene set, (2) in vitro and in vivo targets for TFs can vary depending on conditions and host niches; this is discussed somewhat but it could also alter results and their interpretation, (3) limitations of haploinsufficiency vs. other approaches for determining TF interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree and have added a new section to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The model in Figure 10 is hard to reconcile with previous work showing that many Nrg1 target genes are also Tup1 targets and previous studies showing that Nrg1 DNA-binding protein recruits the Tup1 corepressor in yeast. As a global corepressor, Tup1 may also have targets that are not related to Nrg1. These finding should be considered with respect to the model in Figure 10.</p></disp-quote><p>Microarray experiments have indicated considerable overlap in genes differentially expressed in <italic>tup1</italic>ââ and <italic>nrg1</italic>ââ mutants. However, this does not mean that they are direct targets of those factors. No CHiP analysis has been done of Tup1 and since it lacks a DNA binding domain, this may be technically difficult. Our model in 10 is not inconsistent with deletions of <italic>TUP1</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic> having similar effects on expressionâindeed, it directly implies that. We now discuss this in more detail and propose a potential molecular explanation for our observations that is consistent with both our new genetic interaction data and the literature data. This is at lines 476-487.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A rationale for studying selected TFs should be provided (lines 361-366).</p></disp-quote><p>We selected <italic>HMS1</italic> and <italic>LYS14</italic> because they were known to have infectivity defects in mouse models; they did not have an effect on in vitro filamentation initiation or elongation. We have revised this description to improve clarity on lines 293 to 302.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Alternative mechanisms that control C. albicans filament elongation and initiation need to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response 1 to Reviewer 1 public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Lines 153-154: the observation that certain mutants show increased filamentation in vitro but decreased filamentation in vivo is interesting and additional commentary is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is interesting. However, almost nothing is known about these TFs in vitro. We respectfully submit that this is better left to dedicated experiments in the future because any comments would be highly speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lines 203-204: UME6 has previously been shown to control hyphal elongation in vivo (Banerjee, et al., 2008) so the observations in Figure S1B are not particularly novel or surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. It was not our intention to suggest that this was a novel observation. We have revised the rationale for testing this mutant to as follows<italic>:</italic></p><p>âUme6 is a TF that is required for hyphal elongation in vitro and appears to do so in vivo based on histology (17). Its deletion mutant is not included in the Homann collection (11). We, therefore, constructed the ume6ââ mutant in the SN background to determine if the reduced hyphal elongation phenotype was also observed in our system.â</p><p>This section is now at line 169-172.</p></body></sub-article></article>
