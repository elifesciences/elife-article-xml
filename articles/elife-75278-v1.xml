The errors involve Figures 3B, 3C, and 3D but do not alter the conclusions drawn from the FRET experiments.</p><p>At the time of original publication, the model membranes used as energy acceptors in the FRET experiments were described as dansyl-PE/POPC/DHPC (5:45:50) bicelles. Based on more recent experiments performed for a 2020 <italic>Analytical Chemistry</italic> publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Gao et al., 2020</xref>) and further elaborated in a recent (2021) <italic>Bio-protocol</italic> article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Gao et al., 2021</xref>), we now know that describing the energy acceptor model membranes as dansyl-PE/POPC/DHPC bicelles is incorrect. In the <italic>Analytical Chemistry</italic> paper, we showed that dilution of POPC-DHPC (50:50) ‘bicelle’ lipid mixes to the low micromolar range, as similarly employed and described in the Methods for the FRET experiments involving the C2-domain and mutants, results in nearly immediate transformation into small POPC unilamellar bilayer vesicles containing little or no DHPC. The transition reflects DHPC’s high aqueous solubility. Thus, corrections have been introduced into the text (Methods) and the labels for the Figures 3B and 3C axes. We also have adjusted the Figure 3C X-axis label from &quot;mM&quot; to &quot;µM&quot; as correctly conveyed in the original Methods section.</p><p>The article text and associated panels in Figure 3 have been corrected accordingly.</p><p>The text corrections in the Figure 3 legend (changes are underlined) apply to (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>):</p><p>Figure 3.

(E) Effect of Y96F, Y96A, N64A, and N65D mutations on dissociation constant (K<sub>s</sub><sup>A</sup>) of human cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activity. Proteins were purified as described in (Stahelin et al., 2007). Activity was measured as a function of PC molar concentration for 60 min at 37 °C. The PC mole fraction was held constant at 0.285. cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activities (nmol of arachidonic acid released/min/mg of recombinant cPLA<sub>2</sub>α) were collected on eight separate occasions and are presented as n = 4 for Y96F, n = 4 for Y96A, n = 4 for N64A, n = 4 for N65D, and n = 8 for WT. Error = standard deviation. R<sup>2</sup> values are 0.9021, 09609, 0.9586, 0.9780, and 0.9485 for WT, Y96F, Y96A, N64A, and N65D, respectively. (F) Effect of Y96F, Y96A, N64A, and N65D mutations on allosteric sigmoidal constant (K<sub>half</sub>) of human cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activity. Activity was measured as function of increasing PC mole fractions for 60 min at 37 °C. The PC mole fraction ([PC]/[PC]+[TX-100]) was 0.024 at 50 μM PC, 0.047 at 100 μM PC, 0.069 at 150 μM, 0.091 at 200 μM, 0.13 at 300 μM PC, 0.166 at 400 μM, 0.2 at 500 μM PC, 0.28 at 800 μM PC, 0.37 at 1200 μM PC, and 0.44 at 1600 μM PC. cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activities (nmol of arachidonic acid released/min/mg of recombinant cPLA<sub>2</sub>α) were collected on ten separate occasions and are presented as n = 4 for Y96F, n = 4 for Y96A, n = 4 for N64A, n = 4 for N65D, and n = 4 for WT.
