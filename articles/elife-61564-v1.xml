intracellular serine/threonine kinases that control a variety of cellular signaling functions. Here we report that a member of casein kinase 1 family, casein kinase 1G2, CSNK1G2, binds and inhibits the activation of receptor-interacting kinase 3, RIPK3, thereby attenuating RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. The binding of CSNK1G2 to RIPK3 is triggered by auto-phosphorylation at serine 211/threonine 215 sites in its C-terminal domain. CSNK1G2-knockout mice showed significantly enhanced necroptosis response and premature aging of their testis, a phenotype that was rescued by either double knockout of the <italic>Ripk3</italic> gene or feeding the animal with a RIPK1 kinase inhibitor-containing diet. Moreover, CSNK1G2 is also co-expressed with RIPK3 in human testis, and the necroptosis activation marker phospho-MLKL was observed in the testis of old (&gt;80) but not young men, indicating that the testis-aging program carried out by the RIPK3-mediated and CSNK1G2-attenuated necroptosis is evolutionarily conserved between mice and men.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>necroptosis</kwd><kwd>testis</kwd><kwd>reproductivity</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institutional</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002888</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Commission of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institutional</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Casein kinase 1G2 interacts with and inhibits the activation of receptor-interacting kinase 3, RIP3, in response to TNF and toll-like receptor family members and attenuates its necroptosis signaling activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RIPK3 is an intracellular serine/threonine kinase with a key role in necroptosis, a regulated form of necrotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christofferson and Yuan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vandenabeele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wallach et al., 2016</xref>). During necroptosis, in response of TNF-family of cytokines, toll-like receptors (TLRs), and Z-RNAs, RIPK3 is activated either by a related kinase RIPK1, or adaptor proteins TRIF, or ZBP1/DAI, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Degterev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Activated RIPK3 phosphorylates the mixed lineage kinase-domain-like protein, MLKL, to trigger its oligomerization and translocation from the cytosol to membranes including plasma membrane for their disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Necroptosis is actively suppressed by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3, whose upstream activation pathway is often shared between caspase-8 and RIPK1 kinase. Embryonic lethality in <italic>Caspase-8</italic> knockout mice is rescued by double knockout <italic>Ripk3</italic> or <italic>Mlkl,</italic> and cellular necroptosis induction by TNF-α or TLRs is dramatically enhanced if caspase-8 activity is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dannappel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dillon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Günther et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Newton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oberst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rickard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>). RIPK3 was also reported to be negatively regulated by the phosphatase Ppm1b but the effect seems minor and the in vivo validation has yet to be obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One of the important physiological function of necroptosis is to promote the aging of testis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The necroptosis activation marker, the phosphorylated MLKL has been observed in spermatogonium stem cells and Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of old (&gt;18 months) but not young mouse testis. Knockout <italic>Ripk3</italic>, or <italic>Mlkl</italic>, or feeding mice with a RIPK1 kinase inhibitor-containing diet, blocks necroptosis from occurring in mouse testis, and allows mice to maintain the youthful morphological features and the function of male reproductive system to advanced ages, when age-matched wild-type mice had lost their reproductive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Casein kinases are a large family of intracellular serine/threonine kinases that control a variety of cellular signaling functions that include the circadian clock, Wnt receptor activation, μ opioid receptor modulation, DNA repair, and hypoxia response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elyada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etchegaray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pangou et al., 2016</xref>). We found several of the casein kinase (CSNK) 1 family members, including CSNK1D1, CSNK1E, and CSNK1G2, bind to and inhibit RIPK3 kinase activity. Interestingly, CSNK1G2 expresses at the highest level in mouse testis, whose expression pattern overlaps with that of RIPK3. Knocking out <italic>Csnk1g2</italic> in mouse or multiple cell lines including cell lines derived from spermatocyte and Sertoli cells significantly enhanced necroptosis response and the <italic>Csnk1g2</italic> knockout mice showed premature aging of their testis.

The effect of CSNK1 members on RIPK3 kinase activity was then assessed by co-expressing each member with RIPK3 in human embryo kidney 293 T cells, and the RIPK3 kinase activity was measured by probing the serine 227 auto-phosphorylation of RIPK3, an event critical for RIPK3 to recruit its substrate MLKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Among the casein kinase family members, CSNK1D1, CSNK1G2, and CSNK1E suppressed serine 227 phosphorylation on RIPK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In particular, CSNK1G2, but not its closest family members CSNK1G1 and CSNK1G3, showed the most potent suppression of RIPK3 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Two kinase-dead mutants, CSNK1G2(K75A) and CSNK1G2(D165N), failed to suppress RIPK3 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that the kinase activity of CSNK1G2 is required for its function in suppressing RIPK3. Although CSNK1G2 was not among the casein kinases co-precipitated with RIPK3 in 293 T cells, likely due to lack of expression in this cell line, its ability to strongly inhibit RIPK3 kinase activity and its pattern of tissue expression (see below) prompted us to invest this isoform of casein kinase further. Consistent with its ability to inhibit RIPK3 activity when co-expressed in 293 T cells, knockout <italic>Csnk1g2</italic> in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs, significantly accelerated MEF necroptosis induced by the combination of <underline>T</underline>NF-α (T), a <underline>S</underline>mac mimetic (S), and a pan-caspase inhibitor <underline>Z</underline>-VAD-fmk (Z) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The enhanced necroptosis was mitigated by reintroducing wild-type CSNK1G2 into the <italic>Csnk1g2</italic> knockout MEFs, but a similar level of K75A kinase-dead mutant did not restore the necroptosis inhibition activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition to TSZ, MEFs with their <italic>Csnk1g2</italic> knocked out also showed enhanced cell death when treated with death-inducing cytokine TRAIL plus a Smac mimetic and z-VAD (TRAIL/S/Z), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus a Smac mimetic and z-VAD (LPS/S/Z) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Knockout <italic>Csnk1g2</italic> accelerates necroptosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins.

To this end, we immunoprecipitated CSNK1G2–RIPK3 complex and by mass spectrometry analysis found three clusters of peptides of CSNK1G2 that contained phosphorylated amino acid residues. These residues were: serine 26 and serine 27, serine 211 and threonine 215, and serine 381 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We subsequently introduced phosphorylation-resistant mutations in these residues and assessed their effect on RIPK3 activity. We found that only the S211A/T215A mutant lost the ability to block RIPK3 S227 phosphorylation, whereas the other two mutants containing serine 26/serine 27 and serine 381 to alanine mutations still blocked RIPK3 S227 phosphorylation as efficiently as the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Furthermore, compared to wild-type CSNK1G2 that efficiently bound to RIPK3 and blocked RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction induced by necroptosis inducer TSZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 1–4), S211A/T215A mutant CSNK1G2 lost its ability to bind RIPK3 and did not block RIPK1–RIPK3 interaction in response to TSZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 5 and 6).

It is thus essential that such a danger signal has to be well controlled to prevent accidental death. So far, the most dominant negative regulator identified is active caspase-8, which cleaves and inactivates RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases, thereby terminating necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Günther et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Newton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oberst et al., 2011</xref>). Inhibition or genetic inactivation of caspase-8 activates necroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, Ppm1b phosphatase has been proposed to directly dephosphorylate threonine 231 and serine 232 sites of RIPK3 to attenuate the recruitment of MLKL, although the effect is modest at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, even after MLKL translocated to the plasma membrane, the MLKL-containing membrane fraction lipid rafts can still be removed from the membrane by flotillin-mediated endocytosis or ESCRT-mediated exocytosis before membrane leakage occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). All these regulatory events happen after RIP3 kinase is already activated and thus can only serve as ‘emergency brakes’.</p><p>Our current report identified CSNK1G2 as an upstream negative regulator of pre-activated RIPK3. CSNK1G2 physically interacts with RIPK3 and prevents RIPK3 from responding to upstream activating signals, be that TNF-α, TRAIL, or LPS. CSNK1G2’s function appears analogous to cFlip protein for caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chang et al., 2002</xref>) or Bcl-2 for Bax/Bak, both of which bind and sequester their pro-death protein targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elmore, 2007</xref>). The binding of RIPK3 by CSNK1G2 requires its auto-phosphorylation on the serine 211 and threonine 215 sites, possibly a structural requirement to form the CSNK1G2/RIPK3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This complex formation prevents RIPK3 from being recruited to the necrosome, thus attenuating necroptosis. Since RIPK3 homo-dimerization is a possible requirement for its activation marked by auto-phosphorylation at serine 227, CSNK1G2, by binding to the monomeric RIPK3, effectively suppresses RIPK3 activation. In addition to CSNK1G2, other members of the casein kinase-1 family, including CSNK1D1 and CSNK1E, seem to be able to bind and suppress RIPK3. These members may regulate necroptosis and other functions of RIPK3 in tissues other than testis, a hypothesis certainly merits future studies.</p><p>This CSNK1G2-mediated RIPK3 suppression is particularly important to attenuate necroptosis from occurring in mouse testis, a cell death program that actively promotes male reproductive system aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is thus not surprising that knockout CSNK1G2 resulted in drastically accelerated aging of the testis. CSNK1G2 is also expressed in human testis, and the necroptosis marker phospho-MLKL was present in the old but not young testis of men. Therefore, the CSNK1G2-accelerated and necroptosis-mediated testis aging phenomenon is evolutionarily conserved between mice and men.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293T</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-11268</td><td valign="top">Female</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CCL-2</td><td valign="top">Female</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GC-2spd(ts)</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-2196TM</td><td valign="top">Male</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">15 P-1</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-2618TM</td><td valign="top">Male</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MA-10</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-3050TM</td><td valign="top">Male</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa-HA-3×Flag-RIPK3</td><td>Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa-HA-3×Flag-RIPK3-Myc-CSNK1G2</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa-HA-3×Flag-RIPK3-Myc-CSNK1G2(K75A)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa-HA-3×Flag-RIPK3-Myc-CSNK1G2 (S211A/T215A)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NIH3T3-Flag-mRIPK3</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NIH3T3-Flag-mRIPK3-Myc-mCSNK1G2</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NIH3T3-Flag-mRIPK3-Myc-mCSNK1G2(K75A)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MEF(<italic>Csnk1g2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MEF(<italic>Csnk1g2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>)-Myc-mCSNK1G2</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MEF(<italic>Csnk1g2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>)-Myc-mCSNK1G2(K75A)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MEF(<italic>Csnk1g2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>)-Myc-mCSNK1G2(S211A/T215A)</td><td valign="top">Dr. Xiaodong Wang lab at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-RIPK3 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">ProSci</td><td valign="top">Cat# 2283;

A Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, USA) was used to generate the following HPLC gradient: 0–30% B in 40 min and 30–70% B in 15 min (A = 0.1% formic acid in water, B = 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The eluted peptides were sprayed into a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a nano-ESI ion source. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode with one MS scan followed by four CID (collision-induced dissociation) and four HCD (high-energy collisional dissociation) MS/MS scans for each cycle. Database searches were performed on an in-house Mascot server (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK) against human CSNK1G2 protein sequence. The search parameters are: seven ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.5 Da mass tolerance for product ions; three missed cleavage sites were allowed for trypsin digestion, and the following variable modifications were included: oxidation on methionine, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results are representative of three independent experiments. Statistical tests were used for every type of analysis. The data meet the assumptions of the statistical tests described for each figure. Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM or SD. Differences between experimental groups were assessed for significance using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test using GraphPad prism6 and Microsoft Excel 2017. Fertility rate was assessed for significance using Fisher’s exact test (unpaired, two-tailed) using GraphPad prism6 software. The *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, and ***p &lt; 0.001 levels were considered significant. NS, not significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mr. Alex Wang for critically reading and editing the manuscript.

In this manuscript, the authors have identified casein kinase 1 family members as RIP3 kinase-interacting partners, and demonstrated that the casein kinase CSNK1G2 inhibits necroptosis by binding to and inhibiting RIP3. A mouse knockout of CSNK1G2 display a premature testis aging phenotype, including elevated levels of necroptosis in the testis and reduced fertility, along with reduced lifespan. Importantly, the authors confirmed that these changes in the male reproductive system are due to increased necroptosis, and human testes exhibit increased necroptosis with increasing age. These results led the authors to conclude that CSNK1G2 restricts RIP3-dependent necroptosis in the testis to prevent premature testicular aging.</p><p>Collectively, the study is well done and convincing, and the manuscript discovers a novel kinase that regulates the activity of RIP3 and to play a crucial role in male reproductive aging, and also reveals an interesting link between necroptosis and reproductive aging. However, reviewers noted several issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate the interaction between RIP3 and CSNK1G2 using overexpression assays. To strengthen their conclusions, the interaction between endogenous RIP3 and CSNK1G2 should be confirmed and validated in untransfected cells or tissue.</p><p>2) The role of other CSNK isoforms in RIP3 interactions and necroptosis inhibition is unclear. Mass spectrometry results in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 showed that CSNK1A1, CSNK1D and CSNK1E were pulled down as RIP3-interacting partners. However, CSNK1A did not inhibit RIP3 phosphorylation. Why was that the case? Why was CSNK1G2 not identified in the mass spectrometry experiment? Are any of the other CSNK isoforms expressed in the testis and if so, can they potentially compensate for the loss of CSNK1G2 function in the knockout mice? Since multiple CSNK isoforms could interact with RIP3, do they inhibit RIP3 activation via similar mechanisms in a cell type-specific manner?</p><p>3) The authors show that CSNK deficiency impacts testicular aging and mating performance in older mice. Does CSNK1G2 expression, localization, or activity change with age in wild type mouse or human testes?</p><p>4) Additional detailed fertility data in Figures 4J and 5G would make the author's argument more convincing. Mice at 12-month of age typically show drastically reduced breeding performance, so it is surprising that 12 of out 12 old wild type male mice gave rise to offspring. Was the breeding performance scored over a defined period of time (e.g. within a month)? Another indication for breeding performance is the size of the litter. If the authors have this data from the original breeding experiment, they should be included in the table in Figures 4J and 5G.</p><p>5) In all figures showing testis histology (3B, 4F, 5D), the panels are too small to evaluate the histology. Higher resolution and larger images are necessary to clearly identify the cell types expressing RIP3 and CSNK1G2 and interpret the testis phenotype.</p><p>6) At several places in the manuscript, please revise the text to clarify or substantiate conclusions:</p><p>– In Figure 3B (subsection “Knocking out CSNK1G2 in Testis Cells Significantly Enhanced Their Necroptosis Response”), the authors report expression of CSNK1G2 and RIP3 in spermatogonial stem cells and Sertoli cells, but the (low-resolution) image appears to show expression in multiple spermatogenic cells. Spermatogonial stem cells cannot be identified without specific co-staining; a hematoxylin+IHC serial section image alongside the IF images would be necessary to identify the cell types, and would make the figure easier to interpret. Figure 3C also claims an effect in spermatogonial stem cells and Sertoli cells, but does not provide support for which cell types are being tested. GC2 cells used in Figure 3D-F are derived from spermatocytes (meiotic germ cells), not spermatogonia (pre-meiotic germ cells). These issues could be addressed without affecting the authors' main message by changing &quot;spermatogonium cells&quot; to &quot;spermatogenic cells&quot; throughout the text, to encompass all stages of spermatogenesis.</p><p>– In Figure 4C, the CSNK1G2 KO mice shown in blue have decreased weight compared to WT. Based on the description in the text and images in Figure 4B, the colors might be mistakenly switched between CSNK1G2<sup>-/-</sup> and <sup>+/+</sup>. In Figure 4E, the WT and KO labels appear to be swapped.</p><p>– The authors should provide numbers and p-values for Figure 1G, and numbers (p-values already provided) for Figures 4A, C, E, H, 5A-C, F, 6C, E, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-H.</p><p>– In Figure 1A, with WT CSNK1G2, Flag-RIP3 shows up as one band, while with the mutant forms, Flag-RIP3 shows up as several bands. Are those high-molecular weight bands the phosphorylated forms, or are there other PTMs of RIP3 that are also affected by CSNK1G2?</p><p>– MEFs express endogenous CSNK1G2 (Figure 1C). Reconstitution of CSNK1G2 in the KO MEFs inhibited RIP3 phosphorylation (Figure 1C). The level of CSNK1G2 expression under this condition was similar to endogenous CSNK1G2 expression in wild type MEFs (Figure 1C, compare lanes 5 and 7). Yet, over-expression in KO MEFs had a stronger effect on RIP3 phosphorylation. Do the authors have an explanation for this?</p><p>– Throughout the manuscript, a single time point was chosen to demonstrate the effect of CSNK1G2 on RIP3 activation. The effect was not &quot;all or none&quot;, suggesting that CSNK1G2 might affect the kinetics of necrosome formation and necroptosis. It would be helpful to discuss how CSNK1G2 might affect the kinetics of the response; this could provide key insights into the mechanism of CSNK1G2 on necroptosis regulation.</p><p>– CSNK1G2 binding to RIP3 seemed to decrease upon TSZ stimulation (Figure 1D). Was this due to de-phosphorylation of CSNK1G2?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61564.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate the interaction between RIP3 and CSNK1G2 using overexpression assays.

To this end, we used an anti-CSNK1G2 monoclonal antibody to pull down the endogenous CSNK1G2 from the testis extracts of 3-month old wild type and CSNK1G2 knockout mice and found that the endogenous RIP3 was only co-precipitated with CSNK1G2 from the extracts of wild type testes.

We have thus focused on the function of CSNK1G2, an isoform predominantly expresses in testis. CSNK1D and CSNK1E may also regulate RIP3, a protein is known to be tissue specifically expressed, under different physiological conditions. However, sorting out their regulatory roles is beyond the scope of this paper. The reason for the failure to identify CSNK1G2 in the mass spectrometry experiment in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A is that the experiment was done in HT29 cells, a human colon cancer cell line not expressing CSNK1G2. The observed acceleration of aging in the testis of CSNK1G2 knockout mice does not support the hypothesis that other CSNK isoforms could compensate for the function of CSNK1G2 in this particular tissue. These points are now added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that CSNK deficiency impacts testicular aging and mating performance in older mice.
