fuse proteins to small molecules, solid carriers, or other proteins. Compared to other protein ligases, it offers greater substrate specificity, higher catalytic efficiency, and catalyzes no side reactions. However, its reaction is reversible, resulting in only 50% fusion product from two equally abundant educts. Here, we present a simple method to reliably obtain 100% fusion product in 1:1 conjugation reactions. This method is efficient for protein-protein or protein-peptide fusions at the N- or C-termini. It enables the generation of defined and completely labeled antibody conjugates with one fusion partner on each chain. The reaction requires short incubation times with small amounts of enzyme and is effective even at low substrate concentrations and at low temperatures. With these characteristics, it presents a valuable new tool for bioengineering.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>connectase</kwd><kwd>protein conjugation</kwd><kwd>antibody drug conjugates</kwd><kwd>ligase</kwd><kwd>cyclization</kwd><kwd>sortase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>512378754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Adrian CD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

They enable the generation of antibody conjugates, of segmentally labeled proteins for nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, and the fusion of proteins to the cell surface. Various methods are employed for these applications, often with an excess of one conjugation partner (e.g. 3–10 equivalents). Each of them comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) labeling of lysine residues or maleimide labeling of cysteine residues, are easy to use, but can be unspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stephanopoulos and Francis, 2011</xref>). Click chemistry is specific, but requires the introduction of non-biological chemical groups in the fusion partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolb et al., 2001</xref>). Split domain methods, such as SpyTag-SpyCatcher, are also specific, but introduce long sequences between the fusion partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sutherland et al., 2019</xref>). Split intein methods introduce only a short ‘ligation scar’, but may suffer from solubility problems and varying efficiency for different substrate pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastassov et al., 2024</xref>). Enzymatic methods are simple and, in some cases, specific, but the resulting fusions are reversible and therefore incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 2022</xref>). Nonetheless, they find good use, both in industry and in thousands of academic studies.</p><p>The most popular enzyme, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Sortase A, catalyzes the reversible fusion of substrates <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> in the form of <bold>A</bold>-LPXTG (X=any amino acid) and G<sub>1-5</sub>-<bold>B</bold> to yield <bold>A</bold>-LPXTG<sub>1-5</sub>-<bold>B</bold> (usually with additional linker sequences) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mazmanian et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, it shows good specificity for substrate <bold>A</bold>, but is relatively unspecific towards substrate <bold>B</bold>. Here, the glycine may be replaced by lysine side chains or by other amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heck et al., 2014</xref>). Sortase A has a low affinity for its substrates and therefore requires high substrate concentrations for moderate activity e.g., K<sub>M(LPETG)</sub>=7330 µM, K<sub>M(GGGGG)</sub>=196 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frankel et al., 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobitz et al., 2017</xref>). It also catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of both educts and products (k<sub>cat</sub>, <sub>hydrolysis</sub> = 0.086 /s; k<sub>cat</sub>, <sub>Ligation</sub> = 0.28 /s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frankel et al., 2005</xref>). Some of these characteristics could be improved by the generation of mutant proteins or by the optimization of reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, these properties still constrain its applicability, meaning that Sortase A is primarily used for protein-peptide fusions at high concentrations, and with an excess of peptide.</p><p>Several other enzymes share these basic characteristics with Sortase A. These enzymes belong to the cysteine (Sortase, Butelase, Asparaginyl endopeptidase) or serine proteases (Trypsiligase, Subtiligase), and bind their substrates through a (thio-)ester bond, which can react with H<sub>2</sub>O (hydrolysis, irreversible) or the H<sub>2</sub>N group of fusion partners (aminolysis, reversible) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, however, an enzyme ligase with entirely different characteristics was discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2021</xref>). This enzyme, Connectase, binds its substrate through an amide bond, which is hydrolysis-resistant. It therefore exclusively catalyzes conjugations with the H<sub>2</sub>N groups of fusion partners. In addition, Connectase acts on a longer recognition sequence, leading to higher substrate specificity and higher catalytic efficiency. This enables entirely different applications, such as the specific labeling of proteins with fluorophores within cell extracts, allowing their in-gel detection with significantly higher sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio compared to western blots with tag-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Yet just like other enzyme ligases, Connectase catalyzes a reversible reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2021</xref>). Connectase from <italic>M. mazei</italic>, for example, binds substrates with the sequence <bold>A</bold>-ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, step 1). It then forms a covalent intermediate, <bold>A</bold>-ELASKD-Connectase, with the N-terminal part of this sequence, and cleaves off the C-terminal peptide PGAFDADPLVVEI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2–3). This reaction works both ways, meaning that PGAFDADPLVVEI can react with <bold>A</bold>-ELASKD-Connectase to restore Connectase and its substrate, <bold>A</bold>-ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI. However, when a second substrate <bold>B</bold> in the form of PGAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold> is added to the reaction, it can be used instead of the peptide PGAFDADPLVVEI to form the fusion product <bold>A</bold>-ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, steps 4–5).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Connectase reaction mechanism.</title><p>The structures were predicted with Alphafold 2.

This is because the same amounts of PGAFDADPLVVEI peptide byproduct and PGAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold> educt compete for the <bold>A</bold>-ELASKD-Connectase intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, step 3). Consequently, 100% fusion product can be obtained by removing or inactivating the peptide byproduct, for example by specific enzymatic proteolysis. However, the employed protease would have to act only on the PGAFDADPLVVEI peptide and not on the PGAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold> educt. In the following paper, we present a solution to this problem and describe a simple method to obtain 100% fusion product from equally concentrated educts in short time and with small amounts of enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modification of the Connectase recognition sequence</title><p>To facilitate the removal of peptide byproduct from Connectase reactions (see Introduction), we studied ways to alter the Connectase recognition sequence. For this, we used Ubiquitin (Ub) with a C-terminal Connectase recognition sequence followed by a Streptavidin tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Ub-Strep). As a second reaction substrate, we used peptides derived from the Connectase recognition sequence (XGAFDADPLVVEI, where X represents any of the 20 amino acids). The conjugation of these substrates results in a shorter Ubiquitin product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Ub-Peptide), which lacks the Streptavidin tag. Therefore, the conjugation rate with the different peptides could be determined by monitoring Ub-Peptide formation in SDS-PAGE time course analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutagenic analysis of the Connectase recognition sequence.</title><p>A ubiquitin substrate with a C-terminal Connectase recognition sequence followed by a Streptavidin-tag (Ub-Strep) is fused to peptides consisting of N-terminal Connectase recognition sequence variants (top scheme). These peptides differ in the first amino acid, where proline was replaced by each of the 19 other standard proteinogenic amino acids. An SDS-PAGE time course analysis of each reaction (1 eq. Ub-Strep, 1 eq. Peptide, 0.01 eq. Connectase, 22°C) shows the gradual emergence of the fusion product, Ub-Peptide. Based on densitometric analyses, the reaction rate with the different substrates was estimated (lower panel; an exact determination is not possible due to the reversibility of the reaction [see Methods section]) and normalized to the highest rate (X = P, 100%). The peptide substrates (XGADADPLVVEI) and byproducts (PGAFDADPLVVEI-Strep; top panel) are not visible on the gels.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata1"><label>Figure 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>PDF file containing original gel images, indicating relevant bands.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="elife-102765-fig2-data1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata2"><label>Figure 2—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Original gel images.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-102765-fig2-data2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata3"><label>Figure 2—source data 3.</label><caption><title>Measurements and calculations.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-102765-fig2-data3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102765-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The experiment with the original recognition sequence peptide (X=Proline) resulted in the rapid formation of an equilibrium with ~0.5 equivalents (eq.) Ub-Strep and ~0.5 eq. Ub-Peptide, corresponding to ~50% product yield from equally abundant educts (1 eq. each; see introduction). While proline substitutions with X=D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, R, T, W, or Y drastically reduced ligation rates, substitutions with S, C, and A resulted in moderate or high ligation rates. This was surprising, because the KDPGA sequence is highly conserved in the physiological Connectase target, mtrA (methyltransferase A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2021</xref>). Due to its unique structure and chemistry, proline was previously considered essential for the reaction. The results show that other amino acids, which possess a β-carbon (present in all amino acids except G) but lack a γ-carbon (absent in G, S, C, A), can also be used in this position.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Discrimination between different recognition sequences</title><p>This unexpected finding allowed us to design reactions, in which educts and peptide byproducts differ in their N-terminal amino acid. This discrimination criterion could then be used to specifically inactivate the X<sub>1</sub>GAFDADPLVVEI peptide byproduct (PGAFDADPLVVEI-Strep in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) without affecting the X<sub>2</sub>GAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold> educt (peptide without <bold>B</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Such selective inactivation can be achieved through methods that specifically target X<sub>1</sub> (e.g., A, C, S, P, etc.) while leaving X<sub>2</sub> (≠ X<sub>1</sub>) unmodified. We hypothesized that for example an N-acetyltransferase, which acetylates the N-terminal alanine on the peptide byproduct (X<sub>1</sub>=A), while leaving the N-terminal proline on educts (X<sub>2</sub>=P) unmodified, might be employed to specifically inactivate the undesired byproduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lapteva et al., 2021</xref>). Another possibility is to use chemicals, which form ring structures with the amino and sulfhydryl-groups of N-terminal cysteines (X<sub>1</sub>=C, X<sub>2</sub>=A /P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, it is possible to use aminopeptidases, which act exclusively on the peptide byproduct X<sub>1</sub>. Many of these enzymes have no absolute specificity for just one amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzales and Robert-Baudouy, 1996</xref>). Proline residues, however, are structurally distinct and not modified by many promiscuous enzymes, but instead by a set of proline-specific enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham and O’Connor, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Based on these considerations, we decided to search for a proline aminopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2022</xref>), which removes the N-terminal proline from PGAFDADPLVVEI sequences with suitable efficiency, but is inactive towards all other residues (including X<sub>2</sub>=A). Literature research identified <italic>Bacillus coagulans</italic> proline aminopeptidase (BcPAP) as a candidate. This enzyme had been shown to cleave N-terminal proline from peptides consisting of 2–4 amino acids, while remaining inactive towards other N-terminal amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoshimoto and Tsuru, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitazono et al., 1992</xref>). We could produce it as a soluble monomer (33 kDa) in <italic>E. coli</italic> (&gt;40 mg from 1 L culture) and tested its suitability for shifting the Connectase reaction equilibrium.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A method for complete protein-protein fusions</title><p>We tested the effect of BcPAP in ligation reactions with <bold>A</bold>-ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI (<bold>A</bold>=LysS (Lysine-tRNA ligase), GST (Glutathione-S-Transferase), Ub (Ubiquitin)) and AGAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold> (<bold>B</bold>=MBP (Maltose Binding Protein), Ub, - (just the peptide)) substrates, which cover a range of molecular weights (1–61 kDa). The reactions were performed at room temperature (22 °C) in a neutral buffer (pH 7.0), with moderate salt concentrations (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl), 100 µM of each substrate (A and B), as well as 0.033 eq. Connectase, and 0.066 eq. BcPAP. They were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie G-250, and imaged with a fluorescence scanner (Excitation 685 nm, Emission 725 nm).

The cleavage is efficient as the TEV protease recognition sequence is exposed N-terminally of the unstructured Connectase recognition sequence. Consequently, cleavage and conjugation can be performed in parallel with small amounts of enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Another way to prevent N-terminal acetylation is to add an extra N-terminal proline (i.e. P|AGAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold>), which is removed during the reaction by BcPAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To substantiate these findings, we conducted a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. The signal intensities in these experiments allow no protein quantifications, as smaller molecules are often measured with more intense signals. Nevertheless, we report relative intensities in this paper as a qualitative measure.

Many applications require their conjugation to spacious payload molecules (e.g. horseradish peroxidase) and/or to a defined number of molecules. This number, also known as drug: antibody ratio, is used as a benchmark for several specialized techniques. Of these, formyl-glycine insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) (Catalent), sugar engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wijdeven et al., 2022</xref>; Mersana), cysteine engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sadowsky et al., 2017</xref>; Genentech), the introduction of unnatural amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>; Sutro), and Sortase-mediated conjugations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gebleux et al., 2012</xref>; NBE) all find commercial use. Each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. One problem is that even a relatively high conjugation ratio of 90% on each antibody chain leads to a desired drug: antibody ratio of 4 in only 66% of all HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>2</sub> antibodies, as each antibody chain is modified separately. The completely labeled antibodies are hard to separate from the partially labeled antibodies and side reactions can further complicate the process.</p><p>To test the established method for antibody conjugation, we added the Connectase recognition sequence plus an additional C-terminal Streptavidin tag to the C-termini of αHER2 light and heavy chains. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding for these proteins, and the culture medium was tested for the exported antibodies with the in-gel fluorescence method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs, 2024</xref>). In this western blot alternative, Connectase is used to fuse far-red fluorophores to target proteins, which can subsequently be detected on the SDS-gel with a fluorescence imager (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). From this, we expected a concentration of ~2 µg antibody per ml of culture medium – a value that could be confirmed after protein purification with a Streptavidin column.</p><p>The purified antibodies were labeled with either AGAFDADPLVVEI peptide, AGAFDADPLVVEI-Ubiquitin (1 eq. per antibody subunit; reaction conditions as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), or AGAFDADPLVVEIK(-Biotin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). SDS-PAGE time course analyses show almost complete labeling reactions after an incubation time of two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). The heavy chain is labelled faster than the light chain, possibly because the Connectase recognition sequence is more accessible in this case. The conjugation products remained stable for several days in blood plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The reactions were also analyzed by LC-MS. For this, the antibody carbohydrate side chains were removed enzymatically to reduce sample complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramlich et al., 2021</xref>). The masses determined in the unconjugated antibody sample were consistent with assemblies of completely intact antibody subunits, except for the C-terminal Strep-tag lysine, which was missing in most subunits. Of the assigned masses, HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>2</sub> assemblies constituted 69% of the signal, followed by HC<sub>2</sub> (30%), and HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>1</sub> (0.4%) assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top panel).</p><p>Next, a 1:1 antibody-peptide conjugation reaction was analyzed with the same method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle panel). Here, the HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>1</sub> assembly was detected only in completely conjugated form, as HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>1</sub>-peptide<sub>3</sub> (100%). Similarly, HC<sub>2</sub> was completely conjugated to HC<sub>2</sub>-peptide<sub>2</sub> (100%). HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>2</sub> was found to be conjugated to either two (2%), three (15%), or four (83%) peptides. Taken together, this suggests a total labeling efficiency of 97%, in line with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>Finally, a 1:1 antibody-ubiquitin conjugation was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lower panel). Here, the HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>1</sub> assembly was more abundant and the HC<sub>2</sub> assembly less abundant compared to the unconjugated sample. Again, HC<sub>2</sub> and HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>1</sub> were detected only in completely conjugated form, as HC<sub>2</sub>-Ub<sub>2</sub> (100%) and HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>1</sub>-Ub<sub>3</sub> (100%). HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>2</sub> was found to be conjugated to either one (2%), two (1%), three (2%), or four (95%) ubiquitin molecules, suggesting a total labeling efficiency of 98%.</p><p>These results demonstrate that the method is effective for the rapid generation of near-homogeneous antibody conjugates. The conjugation ratio could potentially be further increased with a small excess of the conjugation partner (here: Ubiquitin or peptide). The desired products can be purified in subsequent steps, for example with Streptavidin columns to remove unconjugated antibodies, or with size exclusion columns, to separate HC<sub>2</sub>LC<sub>2</sub> from other assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Protein cyclization and polymerization</title><p>Protein cyclization is used to enhance protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Purkayastha and Kang, 2019</xref>), while protein polymerization can be useful for engineering biomaterials or affine binders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fierer et al., 2014</xref>). Both results may be achieved with proteins carrying both N- and C-terminal Connectase recognition sequences. Circularization may be favored, when the protein is present at a low concentration and when its N- and C-termini are in close proximity. Polymerization might be favored for rod-shaped proteins with distant N- and C-termini at high concentrations.</p><p>To test these ideas, we used Ubiquitin (AGAFDADPLVVEI-Ub-ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI) as a small globular test substrate at low concentrations (10 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). At the start of the reaction (0–7.5 min), we observed its polymerization to linear chains of two (Ub-L<sub>2</sub>) or three (Ub-L<sub>3</sub>) protomers. These linear assemblies gradually disappeared (7.5–120 min), as their N- and C-termini were fused. The resulting circular assemblies (80% Ub-C<sub>2</sub> and 20% Ub-C<sub>3</sub>, according to SDS-PAGE densitometry) presented the stable end-products of the reaction.</p><p>When the reaction was performed with ten-fold higher substrate concentrations (100 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), longer linear ubiquitin polymers were initially formed, which eventually gave rise to larger circular assemblies (37% Ub-C<sub>2</sub>, 45% Ub-C<sub>3</sub>, 9% Ub-C<sub>4</sub>, 6% Ub-C<sub>5</sub>, and 2% Ub-C<sub>6</sub>). Single ubiquitin molecules were not efficiently circularized in either experiment, suggesting that the N- and C-termini in one ubiquitin molecule are too far apart to be connected, and that additional linker sequences are needed to favor this assembly.</p><p>Taken together, the results show that the presented conjugation method enables efficient protein circularizations and that the yields of specific assemblies can be controlled by modifying the reaction conditions (e.g. substrate concentration) and the substrate design (e.g. linker length). As with other cyclization/polymerization methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van ’t Hof et al., 2015</xref>), these parameters need to be tested for each individual substrate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we have shown that the Connectase recognition sequence can be altered, so that the peptide reaction byproduct can be specifically inactivated by a proline aminopeptidase. This method enables the fast, simple, specific, and complete 1:1 fusion of proteins and/or peptides.</p><p>Instead of just fusing two molecules, as for example in chemical ligations, the method replaces one sequence (e.g. PGAFDADPLVVEI-Strep in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) with the fusion partner. This has several advantages. For example, an affinity tag used for substrate purification can be removed by the conjugation reaction. As the affinity tag remains on unconjugated substrates, it can subsequently be used to remove the peptide byproduct and any unconjugated substrates (e.g. an antibody conjugated to only three molecules instead of four). When the same affinity tag is added to Connectase and BcPAP, this setup enables the complete purification of homogeneous fusion product in a single step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Two exemplary strategies for purifying protein conjugates.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The first strategy uses purified educts and couples the conjugation reaction with affinity tag removal (top scheme). This allows the separation of the untagged product (Ub-Ub conjugate) from tagged enzymes (Connetase-His<sub>6</sub>, BcPAP-His<sub>6</sub>), side products (GAFDADPLVVEI-His<sub>6</sub> peptide), and the first educt (Ub-His<sub>6</sub>) by collecting the unbound fraction (flow through (FT)) in an affinity chromatography step. The second untagged educt (AGADADPLVVEI-Ub) must be entirely converted. This can be achieved with sufficient incubation times in equimolar reactions (<bold>A</bold>) or by using a small excess of reaction partner (<bold>B</bold>). (<bold>C</bold>) The second strategy can be used for expressed proteins in cell extracts and introduces an affinity tag in the reaction product (top scheme). It necessitates the complete conversion of the first affinity tagged educt (Strep-Ub). This is most conveniently achieved by using the second untagged educt (MBP) in excess. Note that proteins with N-terminal alanine residues, such as AGAFDADPLVVEI-MBP, may be partially N-acetylated in some expression systems. In these cases, a higher excess (e.g. more extract with MBP) must be used, as acetylated substrates are not converted by Connectase. Strategies to avoid N-acetylation are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>.

This is not possible with chemical, split intein, or split domain ligation methods. Yet, the addition of a new X<sub>3</sub>GAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>C</bold> fusion partner to an existing <bold>A</bold>-ELASKDX<sub>2</sub>GAFDADPLVVEI-<bold>B</bold> fusion product allows the exchange of molecules <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>. To make this second conjugation complete, a new method for the specific removal of X<sub>2</sub> is needed, just like BcPAP was used to remove X<sub>1</sub>=Pro in this study. This new method could involve another aminopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzales and Robert-Baudouy, 1996</xref>), a specific chemical modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2016</xref>), or an N-acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lapteva et al., 2021</xref>) (see the section ‘Discrimination between different recognition sequences’). The resulting re-conjugation would enable advanced applications, such as the immobilization of a protein on a surface and its release on demand, or the visualization of existing conjugation products by fluorophore (de-) coupling.</p><p>These considerations illustrate the versatility of Connectase as a bioengineering tool. As more applications with this enzyme are developed, synergies will emerge. For example, in this paper, the same Connectase recognition sequence could be used to monitor antibody expression levels in a western blot-like application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>) and for the subsequent antibody conjugation. In future, other Connectase applications, such as protein purification or microplate-based protein quantification, may offer additional functionality for the recognition sequence.</p><p>During the preparation of this study, a somewhat related method was published for the enzyme Sortase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnott et al., 2024</xref>). The authors fused various sequences, such as <bold>A</bold>-LPETGAHHHHH and GVGSKYG for <bold>A</bold>-LPETGVGSKYG generation (C-terminal labeling) or YALPETGG and GVGK-<bold>B</bold> for YALPETGVGK-<bold>B</bold> generation (N-terminal labeling). The peptide byproducts (i.e. GAHHHHHH or GG), were digested with an aminopeptidase. This aminopeptidase showed a preference for GG or GA over GV and therefore displayed a lower activity towards GVGSKYG or GVGK-<bold>B</bold> substrates. The method significantly increased the obtained fusion product yields and therefore presents an important development for Sortase-mediated ligations. Despite these similarities, there are important differences compared to the method presented here. As described in the introduction, Sortase irreversibly hydrolyzes both educts and products, shows low specificity for the C-terminal fusion partner, and has low catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morgan et al., 2022</xref>). As a result, the method is most efficient for C-terminal protein conjugations with small peptides at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnott et al., 2024</xref>). Protein-protein conjugations are relatively inefficient, as they result in high quantities of hydrolysis side products and remain largely incomplete, even after several days of incubation with high enzyme quantities.</p><p>The main disadvantage of Connectase lies in its relatively long recognition sequence. The substrates require a 13 amino acid recognition sequence on the N-terminus and a 19 amino acid sequence on the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). For protein-protein conjugations, we employed additional linker sequences of one (N-terminal R) and five (C-terminal AAAGA) amino acids. This design resulted in efficient conjugations for each substrate tested so far, including 44 constructs derived from 19 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs, 2024</xref>). Therefore, the employed linkers can generally be regarded as sufficient, even in cases of poor steric accessibility of the substrate termini. Taken together, this results in a final conjugation ‘scar’ of 19–25 amino acids between the fusion partners. This is comparable to the SpyTag / KTag system (23 amino acids plus linker sequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fierer et al., 2014</xref>), but longer than the sequences typically employed for Sortase-mediated fusions (7–9 amino acids, usually with additional (GGGGS)<sub>x</sub> linkers between the protein(s) and the ligation site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antos et al., 2017</xref>). Long linker sequences can potentially interfere with protein folding, and they can be susceptible to proteases, or proof immunogenic. Although these problems have not been encountered for Connectase so far, it is an attractive option to engineer Connectase variants with a shorter recognition sequence in the future. For now, the method described here is primarily useful in applications, where this longer ‘scar’ can be tolerated. In these cases, however, the combination of simplicity, substrate specificity, efficiency, and completeness, along with the possibility to use either biologically or chemically produced substrates, and the absence of side reactions, is unmatched by other chemical or enzymatic methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The peptide for the in-gel fluorescence assay was synthesized by Intavis, while all other peptides were synthesized by Genecust. Genes were synthesized by Biocat, and cloned into the pET30b(+) vector (restriction sites: NdeI, XhoI) for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> or the pcDNA3.1 vector (restriction sites: HindIII, XhoI) for expression in HEK293 cells.</p><p>For recombinant expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, BL21 gold cells were transfected with the respective plasmids and grown in lysogeny broth medium with 50 µg/l kanamycin at 22 °C. Protein expression was induced at an optical density of 0.4 at 600 nm with 500 µM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside. Cells expressing soluble proteins were harvested after 16 hr, resuspended in buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 x c0mplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche; cat. # 11697498001; no inhibitor was added to cells expressing BcPAP), 0.02 g/l DNAse, pH 8.0), lysed by French press, and cleared from cell debris by ultracentrifugation (120000 × <italic>g</italic>, 45 min, 4 °C).</p><p>For recombinant expression of αHER2 antibodies, HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in ten 75 cm² flasks with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; cat. # 11966025) supplemented with fetal calf serum. At 70% confluency, they were transfected with plasmids encoding for αHER2 light and heavy chains using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo; cat. # 11668027), according to the manufacturer’s instructions (47 µl Lipofectamine, 55 µg of each plasmid). The cells were grown for ten days without splitting, and the medium was exchanged daily. The medium samples were used for αHER2 detection by in-gel fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>, described below), then pooled, centrifuged (6000 × <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4 °C), and filtered (0.45 µm) before protein purification.</p><p>For protein purification, His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins (all proteins except for antibody subunits <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>) and Strep-tagged Ubiquitin constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were applied to HisTrap HP columns (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 20–250 mM imidazole). Strep-tagged proteins (the antibody subunits and the Ubiquitin constructs) were instead purified with StrepTrap XT columns (1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2.7 mM KCl, 138 mM NaCl, 0–50 mM Biotin, pH 7.4). After this initial purification step, proteins with N-terminal TEV recognition sequences (MBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>)), Ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>), and Ubiquitin for cyclization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were incubated with TEV protease at a 1:100 molar ratio. The reaction was performed overnight in dialysis tubes (dialysis buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl) at 4 °C. The processed proteins were separated from His6-tagged TEV protease, N-terminal fragments (MHHHHHHENLYFQ), and residual unprocessed proteins by another purification step. For this, the reactions were applied a second time to HisTrap HP columns (as above), and the flow-through was collected. All chromatography steps were performed on an Äkta Purifier FPLC (GE Healthcare) using Unicorn v5.1.0 software. Purified proteins were supplemented with 15% glycerol, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Biochemical ssays</title><p>Unless noted otherwise, all conjugation reactions were performed at 22 °C in neutral (pH 7.0) buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate, 50 mM MES, 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM KCl. They were stopped with SDS loading buffer (final concentration: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 25 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8; final protein concentration ~0.1 g/l) and incubated at 90 °C for 10 min. The samples were separated using mPAGE 12% Bis-Tris gels (Merck; 5 µl loading volume per sample) with MOPS running buffer (50 mM MOPS, 50 mM Tris, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA; no pH adjustment). The gels were stained with Coomassie blue (25% ethanol, 25% methanol, 10% acetate, 0.25% Coomassie R-250), and subsequently with Coomassie colloidal solution (20% ethanol, 10% ammonium sulfate, 5.8% phosphoric acid, 5% methanol, 0.12% Coomassie G-250). They were destained with 10% acetic acid and imaged with an Azure Sapphire NIR fluorescence scanner (excitation at 685 nm, emission at 725 nm, 25–50 µm resolution, Intensity 8, highest scanning speed). Densitometric band quantification was performed with Image Studio Lite 5.2. The bands were manually assigned with the ‘draw rectangle’ tool. Each quantified region encompassed the entire band, bordered by a minimum of three pixels of background for accurate measurement.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, 20 experiments were set up, each with a different XGAFDADPLVVEI peptide (X=any of the 20 amino acids). The reactions contained 20 mM Ub-Strep, 20 mM peptide, and 0.2 mM Connectase. Samples were taken before the addition of Connectase (0 min) and after the indicated times (0.1–96 hr). After SDS-PAGE and densitometric analyses, the relative reaction rates in each experiment were estimated. An exact determination was not possible because the reaction is reversible, and the emerging peptide side product (PGAFDADPLVVEI-Strep) competes with the assayed peptide (XGAFDADPLVVEI) for the enzyme binding sites. The estimates were made based on the required time to obtain 10%, 20%, and 30% fusion product yield in each reaction.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>, 8 experiments were set up with different substrate pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D and E</xref>: LysS/MBP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>: GST/MBP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: Ub-Strep/AGAFDADPLVVEI peptide; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>: LysS/MBP before TEV cleavage (see &quot;Purification&quot;); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>: LysS/Ub; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: LysS/Pro-Ub; protein sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Each substrate was used at 100 µM (except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (10 µM)). The reactions were started by addition of 0.033 molar equivalents (eq.) Connectase and 0.066 eq. BcPAP. For the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, 0.01 eq. TEV protease was also added. The reactions were incubated at 22 °C (except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> [10 °C]). Samples were taken before (0 min) and after the addition of Connectase/BcPAP (3.8–960 min). After SDS-PAGE, the substrate band densities relative to the control sample (0 min) were determined. The product band densities were determined relative to the total band density (substrates +products).</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>, Connectase (2 µM) was used without (A) or with BcPAP (7 µM, B). Both solutions were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min with the following compounds: buffer (control reaction), 1 mM ZnCl2, ‘Complete’ protease inhibitor mix (Roche, 1 tablet per 25 ml), AEBSF, ALLN, Antipain, Aprotinin, Bestatin, Chymostatin, E-64, EDTA, Leupeptin, Pepstatin, Phosphoramidon, PMSF. The concentrations of the last compounds are unknown to us, as the supplier (G-biosciences, Protease Inhibitor Set, cat. # 786–207; inhibitors used at ‘2 x’ concentration) refused to provide them on request. After the incubation, the enzyme-inhibitor mixture was added to an equal volume of conjugation substrates (20 µM Ub-Strep, 20 µM AGAFDADPLVVEI peptide). After 2 hr at 22 °C, the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>, the cell culture medium samples taken during αHER2 expression (see above) were analyzed. They were centrifuged (1 min, 10,000 × <italic>g</italic>) and 2.5 µl of each supernatant was mixed with 300 fmol reference protein (MBP with a C-terminal Connectase recognition sequence). The mixture was incubated with 1 nM Connectase and 10 nM fluorescent peptide substrate (RELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEISEEGE-Cy5.5) for 20 min at 22 °C. The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and imaged before and after Coomassie staining. The band densities corresponding to reference protein and αHER light (LC) and heavy chains (HC) were determined. They were used to estimate the expressed αHER2 quantities over time with [αHER2]=reference protein quantities x ([signal HC] + [signal LC] / [signal reference protein]). This estimation can be turned into an exact determination of αHER2 quantities by division with an experimentally determined factor, which describes the relative reactivity and brightness of antibody and reference protein bands. In this case, this factor was close to 1, so that estimated and determined values were nearly identical. The determination and the detailed method are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs, 2024</xref>.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>, 25 µM Strep-tagged αHER2 antibody was mixed with 3.33 µM Connectase, 6.66 µM BcPAP, and either 100 µM AGAFDADPLVVEI-Ubiquitin, 100 µM AGAFDADPLVVEI peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or 100 µM AGAFDADPLVVEIK(-Biotin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). The reactions were incubated at 22 °C, and samples were taken after the indicated times (0–120 min). After SDS-PAGE, the product band quantities (i.e., LC-Ub, HC-Ub, or LC-peptide, HC-peptide) were determined relative to the educt band quantities (LC-Strep, HC-Strep).</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>, αHER2 antibodies were biotinylated as described above and mixed (1 µM) with human plasma (a gift from Dr. Konnerth; supplemented with EDTA to prevent clotting). The mixture was divided into three tubes and incubated at 4 °C, 22 °C, or 37 °C. Samples were taken after 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days and stored at –20 °C. For the analysis, 2 µl of each sample was mixed with 33 µl labeling solution (20 nM Connectase, 2 nM PGAFDADPLVVEISEEGE-Cy5.5 peptide) and incubated for 30 min.

BcPAP for 4 hr at 22 °C and then used for LC-MS analysis.</p><p>The samples stored at 4 °C for up to 6 hr, before they were subjected (1.6 µg protein) to an Acquity BEH C4 column, using an UltiMate3000 UHPLC. They were eluted with a 0–50% H<sub>2</sub>O / acetonitrile gradient in presence of 0.1% formic acid over 7 min. The eluted molecules were analyzed with a MaXis HD UHR q-TOF spectrometer. Mass spectrometer parameters were adapted to the size of the molecule and the chromatography flow rate (by default 0.15 ml/min). Data analysis was performed using Bruker Compass DataAnalysis v6.1 software (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Charge deconvolution of the m/z spectra was performed with the MaxEnt deconvolution algorithm (Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany). Deconvolution artifacts without m/z series were excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Max Planck Innovation has filed a provisional patent on the method described in this paper (EP-Patent Application EP241884741) The author declares no other competing interests</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-102765-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Proteins and peptides used in the study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102765-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All primary data are provided as source data files in the article.

In an initial characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2021</xref>), this sequence was identified as RELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI. It remained unclear, whether it could be further shortened from the N-terminal side. The depicted gel shows the Connectase-mediated conjugation of Ub-Strep to RELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI (peptide 1), ELASKDPGFDADPLVVEI (peptide 2), or LASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI (peptide 3). The product, Ub-peptide, is formed at a similar rate with peptide 1 (relative ligation rate determined by densitometric analysis: 94%) and peptide 2 (100%), but at a reduced rate when using peptide 3 (47%). This suggests that ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI is sufficient for efficient conjugation reactions. The protein substrates employed in this paper have the C-terminal RELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI sequence, with the additional N-terminal arginine serving as a small linker.</p><p><supplementary-material id="app1fig8sdata1"><label>Appendix 1—figure 8—source data 1.</label><caption><title>PDF file containing original gel images, indicating relevant bands.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="elife-102765-app1-fig8-data1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="app1fig8sdata2"><label>Appendix 1—figure 8—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Original gel images.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-102765-app1-fig8-data2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="app1fig8sdata3"><label>Appendix 1—figure 8—source data 3.</label><caption><title>Measurements and Calculations.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-102765-app1-fig8-data3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102765-app1-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102765.3.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife Assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dalal</surname><given-names>Yamini</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Compelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Important</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This revision of <bold>important</bold> work is a versatile addition to the chemical protein modifications and bioconjugation toolbox in synthetic biology.

Connectase specifically can provide some benefits over the more widely used Sortase, depending on the nature of the species that is desired to be conjugated. However, due to a similar lengthy sequence between conjugation partners, the method described in this paper does not provide clear benefits over the existing SpyTag-SpyCatcher conjugation system. Additionally, specific disadvantages of the method described are not thoroughly investigated, such as difficulty in purifying and separating the desired product from the multiple proteins used. Overall, this method provides a novel, reproducible way to enzymatically create protein-protein conjugates.</p><p>The manuscript is well-written and will be of interest to those who are specifically working on chemical protein modifications and bioconjugation.</p></disp-quote><p>I'd like to comment on two points.</p><p>(1) The benefits over the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. Here, the conjugation partners are fused via the 12.3 kDa SpyCatcher protein, which is considerably larger than the Connectase fusion sequence (19 aa). This is mentioned in the introduction (p. 1 ln 24-26). Furthermore, SpyTag-SpyCatcher fusions are truly irreversible, while Connectase/BcPAP fusions may be reversed (p. 8, ln 265-273). For example, target proteins (e.g., AGAFDADPLVVEI-Protein) may be covalently fused to functionalized magnetic beads (e.g., Bead-ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI) in order to perform a pulldown assay. After the assay, the target protein and any bound interactors could be released from the beads by the addition of a Connectase / peptide (AGAFDAPLVVEI) mixture.</p><p>In a related technology, the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system was split into three components, SpyLigase, SpyTag and KTag (Fierer et al., PNAS 2014). The resulting method introduces a sequence between the fusion partners (SpyTag (13aa) + KTag (10aa)), which is similar in length to the Connectase fusion sequence (p. 8, ln 297 - 298). Compared to the original method, however, this approach seems to require longer incubation times, while yielding less fusion product (Fierer et al., Figure 2).</p><p>(2) Purification of the fusion product. The method is actually advantageous in this respect, as described in the discussion (p. 8, ln 258-264). Examples are now provided in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Unlike previous traditional protein fusion protocols, the author claims their proposed new method is fast, simple, specific, reversible, and results in a complete 1:1 fusion.

It is misleading to title a paper with absolutes such as &quot;100% product yield&quot;, when the majority of reactions show &gt;95% product yield, without any purification. Please change the title of the manuscript to something along the lines of &quot;Novel Irreversible Enzymatic Protein Fusions with Near-Complete Product Yield&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The conjugation reaction is thermodynamically favored. It is driven by the hydrolysis of a peptide bond (P|GADFDADPLVVEI), which typically releases 8 - 16 kJ/mol energy. This should result in a &gt;99.99% complete reaction (DG° = -RT ln (Product/Educt)). In line with this, 99% - 100% of the less abundant educts (LysS, Figure 3A; MBP, Figure 3B; Ub-Strep, Figure 3C) are converted in the time courses (Figure 3D-F show different reaction conditions, which slow down conjugate formation). 100% conversion are also shown in Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure S4. Likewise, 99.6% relative fusion product signal intensity in an LCMS analysis (Figure S2) after 4h reaction time (0.13% and 0.25% educts). In this experiment, the proline had been removed from 99.8% of the peptide byproducts (P|GADFDADPLVVEI). It is clear that this reaction is still ongoing and that &gt;99.99% of the prolines will be removed from the peptides in time. These findings suggest that the conjugation reaction gradually slows down the less educt is available, but eventually reaches completion.</p><p>For some experiments, lower product yields (e.g. 97% in Figure 3B) are reported in the paper. These were calculated with Yield = 100% x Product / (Educt1 + Educt 2 + Product). With this formula, 100% conjugation can only be achieved with exactly equimolar educt quantities, because both educt 1 and educt 2 need to be converted entirely. If one educt 1 is available in excess, for example because of protein concentration measurement inaccuracies or pipetting errors, some of it will be left without fusion partner. In case of Figure 3B, 3% more GST seemed to have been in the mixture. These are methodological inaccuracies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please provide at least one example of a purified desired product, and mention the difficulties involved as a disadvantage to this particular method. Separating BcPAP, Connectase, and the desired protein-protein conjugate may prove to be quite difficult, especially when Connectase cleaves off affinity tags.</p></disp-quote><p>Examples are now provided in Figure 6. As described in the discussion (p. 8, ln 258-264), the simple product purification is one of the advantages of the method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For the antibody conjugate, please provide an example of conjugating an edduct that would prove to be more useful in the context of antibodies. For example, as you mention in the introduction, conjugation of fluorophores, immobilization tags such as biotin, and small molecule linker/drugs are useful bioconjugates to antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>Antibody-biotinylation is now shown in Figure S6; Antibody-fluorophore conjugates are part of Figures S5 and S7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please assess the stability of these protein-protein conjugates under various conditions (temperature, pH, time) to ensure that the ligation via Connectase is stable over a broad array of conditions. In particular, a relevant antibody-conjugate stability assay should be done over the period of 1-week in both buffer and plasma to show applicability for potential therapeutics.</p></disp-quote><p>The stability of an antibody-biotin conjugate in blood plasma over 7 days at different temperatures is now shown in Figure S7.</p><p>Generally, Connectase introduces a regular peptide bond (Asp-Ala) with a high chemical and physical stability (e.g. 10 min incubation at 95°C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer; H2O-formic acid / acetonitrile gradients for LC-MS). The sequence may be susceptible to proteases, although this is not the case in HEK293 cells (antibody expression), <italic>E. coli</italic>, or blood plasma (Figure S7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Please conduct functional assays with the antibody-protein/peptide conjugates to show that the antibody retains binding capabilities to the HER-2 antigen and the modification was site-selective, not interfering with the binding paratope or binding ability of the antibody in any way. This can be done through bio-layer interferometry, surface plasmon resonance, ELISA, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We plan the immobilization of the HER2 antibody on microplates and its use in an ELISA. However, this experiment requires significant testing and optimizations. It will be part of a future paper on the use of Connectase for protein immobilization.</p><p>For now, the mass spectrometry data provide clear evidence of a single site-selective conjugation, as the C-terminal ELASKDPGAFDADPLVVEI-Strep sequence is replaced by ELASKDAGAFDADPLVVEI(-Ub). Given that the conjugation sites at the C-termini are far from the antigen binding sites, and have already been used in a number of other approaches (e.g., SpyTag, SnapTag, Sortase), it appears unlikely that these conjugations interfere with antigen binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Please include gels of all proteins used in ligation reactions after purification steps in the SI to show that each species was pure.</p></disp-quote><p>The pure proteins are now shown in Figure S9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Please provide the figures (not just tables) of LC/MS deconvoluted mass spectra graphs for all conjugates, either in the main text or the SI.</p></disp-quote><p>Please specify which spectra you are missing.
