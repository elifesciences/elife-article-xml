recording in freely moving rodents provides a unique window into the temporal dynamics of neural circuits. Recording from unrestrained animals is critical to investigate brain activity during natural behaviors. The use and implantation of high-channel-count silicon probes represent the largest cost and experimental complexity associated with such recordings making a recoverable and reusable system desirable. To address this, we have designed and tested a novel 3D printed head-gear system for freely moving mice and rats. The system consists of a recoverable microdrive printed in stainless steel and a plastic head cap system, allowing researchers to reuse the silicon probes with ease, decreasing the effective cost, and the experimental effort and complexity. The cap designs are modular and provide structural protection and electrical shielding to the implanted hardware and electronics. We provide detailed procedural instructions allowing researchers to adapt and flexibly modify the head-gear system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd><kwd>silicon probe</kwd><kwd>freely moving</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>microdrive</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 NS107616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buzsáki</surname><given-names>György</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 NS104590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buzsáki</surname><given-names>György</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH122391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buzsáki</surname><given-names>György</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R271-2017-1687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Peter C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008392</institution-id><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research, Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-5053-00279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Peter C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A reusable system of 3D printed stainless steel microdrive and plastic head cap allows stable recording of electrophysiological data in mice and rats and easy recovery of silicon probes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Action potentials are the common currency of communication between neurons and they can be detected as voltage fluctuation in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrian and Moruzzi, 1939</xref>). However, recording from representative ensembles of neurons simultaneously requires electrodes with multiple recording sites. Multi-wire twisted electrodes (tetrodes) and silicon probes offer the possibility to record tens to hundreds of neurons simultaneously from multiple cortical and subcortical structures simultaneously in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wise and Najafi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csicsvari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Montgomery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). For cost benefits, microwire arrays are a popular choice for neuroscientists, despite the amount of manual labor involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edell et al., 1992</xref>). Silicon probes, while more expensive, do not require assembly, the tissue-volume displacement is minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kipke et al., 2008</xref>), recording properties are consistent (site impedance and locations) and geometric configurations (number of shanks, distance, and pattern of recording sites) can be customized to suit the architecture of the particular brain structure under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wise and Najafi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scholvin, 2016</xref>). The affordability of high-channel-count electrophysiology amplifier chips (e.g., RHD-2132 and RHD-2164, Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berényi et al., 2014</xref>) and integrated designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) have accelerated the spread of large-scale recordings. Integration of µLEDs into silicon-based electrodes and can offer unique spatiotemporal control of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The most expensive component of the head gear is the recording probe (from $1000 for 32-channel passive recording probes to &gt; $3000 for µLED probes or larger channel count probes). Therefore, reusing silicon probes in freely moving animals is an important current goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to reducing costs, repeated usage of the same probe/headgear would allow for better consistency in recordings across animals, enhances data reproducibility, and would reduce electrode/headgear preparation for surgery. Achieving this goal requires an integrated design of a reusable microdrive and head gear to increase recording stability and protect/shield sensitive drive and electronic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Senzai et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Currently available headgear systems are typically large, reducing the ability to record from multiple brain structures in mice. In contrast to recent progress in recording electrodes, the development of implantation techniques such as the Flexdrive, Shuttledrive, DMCdrive and the Hyperdrive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Voigts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Voigts et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lu et al., 2018</xref>) has lagged behind. Electrodes are either fixed in brain tissue or attached to a microdrive to allow the advancement of the electrode after implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fee and Leonardo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Korshunov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vandecasteele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamamoto and Wilson, 2008</xref>). Microdrives and accompanying head gear protection and shielding inevitably add extra weight (weight = 0.12 g - 1 g, drives designed for mice) and volume (skull surface area = 7.68–252 mm<sup>2</sup>, drives designed for mice) to the implant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The weight, volume and footprint of the microdrive can limit comfortable movement of small rodents and can prevent flexible multiregional recordings in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Headley et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, chronic recordings from freely behaving subjects are essential in many experiments, where the relationship between neuronal activity and movement, perception, learning and memory, decision making, and other forms of cognition are studied to disambiguate overt behavior and hidden variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Steinmetz, 2020</xref>). An ideal microdrive should have high precision movement, mechanical stability, minimal size, low weight, and the ability for flexible customization. Commercially available microdrives are expensive and hard to customize. Disposable 3-D printed customized drives and head gear have reduced costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Headley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2020</xref>). Most importantly, recovery and reimplantation of recording probes are limited with currently available headgears.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of microdrive designs used in mice.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study/Company</th><th>Width (mm)</th><th>Length (mm)</th><th>Height (mm)</th><th>Footprint (mm<sup>2</sup>)</th><th>Weight (g)</th><th>Travel distance (mm)</th><th>Easy recovery</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vandecasteele et al., 2012</xref></td><td>4.3</td><td>6.4</td><td>13</td><td>27.52</td><td>0.6</td><td>8–12</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>Janelia Research Campus</td><td>3.5</td><td>3.8</td><td>9</td><td>13.3</td><td>0.8</td><td>5</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>Janelia Research Campus</td><td>2.5</td><td>3.8</td><td>10</td><td>9.5</td><td>0.5</td><td>5</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>Cambridge Neurotech</td><td>2.5</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>0.54</td><td>5</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>Neuronexus</td><td>12.5</td><td>11.5</td><td>8.5</td><td>143.75</td><td>0.36</td><td>1</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>NeuroNex MINT</td><td>3.2</td><td>7.5</td><td>16</td><td>24</td><td>0.67</td><td>4.8</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2017</xref></td><td>6.26</td><td>5.26</td><td>9</td><td>32.93</td><td>0.4</td><td>2</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref></td><td>18</td><td>14</td><td>20</td><td>252</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Voroslakos et. al.</td><td>3.1</td><td>5</td><td>15.3</td><td>15.5</td><td>0.87</td><td>7</td><td>yes</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Below, we report the design and testing of an integrated 3D printed headgear system (including microdrives and protective head cap) that is adaptable for multiple recording devices for both mice and rats.

Yet, plastic prints have limitations mostly due to the low strength of the materials. Repeated use of plastic threads results in rapid deterioration, which can be prevented by metal-to-metal connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Recently, metal printing has become affordable offering increased strength, with options for printing in aluminum, stainless steel and even titanium with similar printing resolution to plastics. Here, we have taken advantage of this and constructed a 3D printed microdrive from stainless steel (stainless steel 316L, 20 μm resolution), which offers superior strength and form factor compared to plastic prints (Young's modulus of stainless steel: ~180 GPa vs plastic: ~2 GPa). The metal printing allows reuse of the drives with minimal wear, driving the effective cost down.</p><p>The microdrive is composed of three metal parts: an arm, a body, and a base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and has a footprint of 15.5 mm<sup>2</sup> (width: 3.1 mm, length: 5 mm, height: 15.3 mm). The detachable base allows for easy recovery of probes. The arm/shuttle is mounted on a screw to the drive body, allowing it to move linearly along the vertical axis simply by turning the screw (270 µm/ turn). The constructed microdrive has a total travel distance of 6 mm (maximum distance between arm and bottom of the drive body), allowing one to record from multiple brain regions across days and weeks. Due to its small form factor, multiple probes can be implanted in the same animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The drives come with a stereotaxic implantation tool, printed in plastic (clear v4 resin from FormLabs), for user-friendly and reliable implantations and probe recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), consisting of a stereotactic manipulator attachment and a microdrive holder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reusable metal microdrive.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The metal microdrive consists of three main parts: a drive body, a movable arm/shuttle, and a removable base.

The head cap is prepared before surgery and can be reused easily. 2. The cap does not need support screws, reducing the invasiveness of the surgery and accelerating the animal’s recovery. 3. The 3D printed cap-base is secured with a single step, by attaching it to the dorsal surface of the skull with Metabond cement. This ensures alignment precision relative to the brain surface, easier probe recovery, and reusability. 4. The electric shielding and structural support is implemented in the reusable head cap, decreasing extra manual steps for the construction of the protective cap from copper mesh, male header pins and grip cement during surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vandecasteele et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These steps offer a time savings from 40 to 90 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">3</xref>), compared to a manually constructed cap during surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vandecasteele et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Further, the modular cap system substantially increases flexibility during an implantation procedure. Because the sides can easily be disassembled and reassembled, complex surgical procedures can be split into multiple sessions when needed. In the first session the skull is prepared, and the base of the cap is attached to the skull. After recovery, the craniotomy and implantation are performed in a second surgery. This double-step procedure results in a speedy recovery of the animal and reduces the likelihood of human error during extended procedures. Additionally, subsequent troubleshooting can be performed through the course of long chronic experiments with minimal disruption to the animal and the implanted components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Probe recovery</title><p>To recover the probe at the end of a chronic experiment, the drive holder is aligned with the drive using the stereotactic frame.

The cap system allows for considerably faster and more standardized surgeries to be performed and faster post-surgical recovery of the animals. Importantly, recovery of the probe and head cap becomes an easy and routine procedure, allowing the same silicon probes to be used in multiple animals, offering substantial savings.</p><p>Our head caps are minimally invasive and do not require supportive bone screws, shortening surgery time and postoperative recovery. Except for the base, the entire headgear is reusable, making experiments performed on multiple animals less variable. For multiple surgeries (e.g., virus injection for optogenetic or pharmacogenetic experiments), implantation of the base during the first surgery provides fixed coordinates for a subsequent surgery. The head cap system is flexible, due to the large internal volume, and allows for multiple probe implants, optical fiber implants, and other optional components. In contrast, manually constructed cap systems are time-consuming to build, require extensive experience, and its construction may vary from animal to animal and across investigators even in the same laboratory. The main disadvantage of existing headgears is the limited success for probe recovery. Even after successful recovery of the recording probe, a new protective cap must be built from scratch in subsequent surgeries. In contrast, our modular cap system is prepared before surgery, decreasing the time the animal spends under anesthesia, reducing potential complications during and after surgery. Using this strategy, we were able to explant and implant the same silicon probe in &gt;10 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Senzai et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The metal microdrive weighs 0.87 g with a footprint area of 15.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, allowing the implantation of multiple probes in rats and even in mice. Because the entire headgear can be removed from the base with a screwdriver, recovery of the silicon probes is simple and highly successful. The drives are printed in stainless steel, with a stiffness prints approximately 100 times higher than that of plastic (Young’s modulus of stainless steel: ~180 GPa vs. plastic: ~2 GPa). Steel drives provide higher stability, potentially better recording quality, and prevent potential wobbling while turning the screw to adjust the probe’s position in the brain. Commercially available drives are typically built from plastic, are non-recoverable, and more expensive. Hand-made drives introduce variability across drives and experiments. In contrast, 3D steel printing provides high consistency across drives, reducing interexperimental variability.</p><p>Our system allows electrophysiologists to record the neuronal activity from multiple brain regions simultaneously in freely moving rodents. The large internal volume of the head cap and the small footprint of the metal microdrive enable researchers to perform more than one silicon probe implantation in freely moving mice and rats. Despite the highly successful recovery of silicon probes, the probe itself can deteriorate over time, limiting the number of reimplants (decreased signal-to-noise over time, reduced number of high-quality single unit clusters). Appropriate cleaning procedures can extend the lifetime of silicon probes.</p><p>To facilitate wide use of the 3D printed designs, we share all necessary details of parts, fabrication process, and vendor source for easy replication by other laboratories (see Materials and methods). We offer several video tutorials, which describe the construction of the microdrive, the cap systems, the probe implantation, and the probe recovery. The CAD system allows different laboratories to customize both the drive and headgear according to their specific goals and needs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

the base (0.5 × 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup>). Thin walls around the base prevent cement flowing between the base and the body during surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Glue a nut inside the arm (referred to as ‘arm nut’; 00–90 brass nut) before attaching it to the body. The body has an opening in the top part of the back where a nut can fit inside (‘top nut’; 00–90 brass nut). Insert the ‘top nut’ from the back, then insert the arm from the front and introduce a screw (00–90, 1/2’, brass screw) through the ‘top nut’ and the ‘arm nut’. Tighten the screw completely and release it a quarter-turn (or less). Fix the ‘top nut’ and the screw together using solder so the arm can be moved linearly relative to the body by turning this screw. Attach the body-arm complex to the base using a screw in the back (000–120, 1/8’, stainless steel screw). Finally, insert a male header pin into the body and secure it using dental acrylic cement (Unifast Trad). This can be used as a soldering joint during surgery. Finally, attach the backend of the silicon probe to the arm using cyanoacrylate glue and solder the Omnetics connector (Omnetics Connector Corporation) of the probe to the male header pin of the drive holder.

This can help to open the cap using a fine pair of tweezers. The tip of the tweezer is squeezed between the rectangle and the walls. Pushing the tweezer against this rectangle readily opens the walls. The right wall has one tapped hole in the front and one in the lower part of the back (000–120 thread, 1.9 mm length). In addition, it has a hole in the upper part of the back (1 mm in diameter, 1.4 mm length). The left wall has one hole in the front and one in the lower side of the back (1 mm in diameter, 1.4 mm length) and a tapped hole in the upper side of the back (000–120 thread, 1.9 mm length). In addition, there are two rectangular holes in each wall (0.8 × 0.8 mm<sup>2</sup>) in which male header pins are glued with cyanoacrylate glue to serve as soldering points for the Omnetics connector and for the shielding copper mesh. To reduce weight, walls are perforated and covered with light copper mesh by gluing it with dental acrylic (Unifast Trad).

The right and left walls have a front hole (diameter 1.8 mm) in which a screw can be passed (00–80, 1’ 18–8 stainless steel socket head screw) for fixing the walls to the metal insert of the base. In addition, there is a rail on each wall at the bottom part that grabs onto the base piece (1.2 mm height and 1 mm deep).</p><p>During surgery, the walls are kept open with the screw loosely tightened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, top part). After all the connectors are attached to the male header pins, the walls are closed, and the front screw is tightened. The right wall has a hole in the upper side of the back (1.8 mm, 2 mm length) and a tapped hole in the lower side of the back (00-80 thread, 2 mm length). The left wall has a hole in the lower side of the back (diameter 1.8 mm, 2 mm length) and a tapped hole in the upper side of the back (00-80 thread, 2 mm length). The walls are closed in the back using two screws (18-8 stainless steel socket head screw, diameter 0-80, 5/32” length). The left wall also has an insert in the upper part of the back side for a nut (18-8 stainless steel thin hex nut, M2.5 × 0.45 mm thread). This latter nut serves as a locking mechanism for the top cover. There are four rectangular through-holes in each wall (0.8 × 0.8 mm) in which male header pins are glued with epoxy (Araldite Standard Epoxy) and serve as soldering points. The locations of the holes can be modified according to user specifications to adapt different connector placements. To protect the implanted electrodes, the rat cap is covered by either self-adherent wrap (3M Coban) or the plastic top cover. The edge is extruded on the outer surface on top of the walls to provide extra surface for better adhesion. The plastic cover is attached to the walls using the front slide-in slot and the back screw (stainless steel flared-collar knurled-head thumb screw, M2 × 0.40 mm thread size, 4 mm long). To protect the neuronal signal from environmental electromagnetic interference noise, conductive copper coil electrical tape is glued to the walls by cyanoacrylate glue (copper tape: 1&quot; wide, McMaster product number: 76555A724) and connected to the ground.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Assembly_instructions_rat_cap_v8.pdf</italic> file contains instructions with photographs.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref> shows the assembly of the rat cap.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>3D designing and printing parts</title><p>All parts were designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360">https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360</ext-link>).

Lower the probe into 0.9% saline and ground the saline to the recording preamplifier ground. Connect the probe to an Intan preamplifier headstage (RHD 32- or 64-channel recording headstages) and to the main Intan board to perform the impedance test measurement at 1 kHz frequency. This measurement provides a quick and rough estimate about the quality of the recording sites.

Silicon probes (NeuroNexus, Ann-Arbor, MI and Cambridge Neurotech, Cambridge, UK) were implanted in the dorsal hippocampus (rats: antero-posterior (AP) −3.5 mm from Bregma and 2.5 mm from the midline along the medial-lateral axis (ML); mice: antero-posterior (AP) +1.75 mm from Bregma and 0.75 mm from the midline, 10 degree relative to the sagittal axis). The probes were mounted on the recoverable metal microdrive and previous design iterations made in plastic (unpublished work; stl files and instructions are available at our GitHub repository <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Plastic_recoverable">https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Plastic_recoverable</ext-link>), allowing for precise vertical movement after implantation and implanted by attaching the base of the micro-drives to the skull with dental cement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The small footprint of the metal microdrive enables researchers to perform more than one silicon probe implantation in freely moving mice. For this purpose, larger mice (&gt;35 g) were selected.</p><p>After the post-surgical recovery, we moved the probes gradually in 50 µm to 150 µm steps until the tips reached the pyramidal layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The pyramidal layer of the CA1 region was identified by physiological markers: increased unit activity and the presence of ripple oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>). In mice, the probe was implanted 500 µm below the surface of the brain and recordings were performed each day. The probe was moved 70 µm after each recording day. Data was collected daily. The implanted animals were single housed, and they do not carry the headstage while in the vivarium. During recordings, the headstage is attached and a counterbalanced pulley system ensures that the animal is not carrying the extra weight of the headstage and cable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiology data</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were amplified using an Intan recording system: RHD2000 interface board with Intan 32 and 64 channel preamplifiers sampled at 20 kHz (Intan Technologies).

The cap system was first tested in a mouse with wire electrodes (M_01) and in a rat without electrophysiology (R_01). After the evaluation of the cap system, we have implanted silicon probes attached to recoverable, plastic microdrives (Plastic recov refers to this microdrive) or flexible probes cemented in place and tested the cap system with electrophysiology in freely moving mice (M_02 – M_04) and in freely moving rats (R_02 – R_06). We used silicon probes from NeuroNexus (Buzsaki-32 NN) and Cambridge Neurotech (ASSY-156 E1 CN). Finally, we evaluated the recoverable, metal microdrive using a Diagnostic Biochips probe (128–5 DB) in a freely moving mouse (M_05) and a Neuropixels probe in a freely moving rat (R_09). All attempted probe recovery was successful except in R_02A (two shanks broke during the acute recordings). The same ASSY-156 E1 (CN) probe was used in R_03 and R_04, but after successful recovery from R_04 the impedance of the contact sites were too high to reimplant this device. A new ASSY-156 E1 probe was used in R_05.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-65859-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-65859-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All documentations for parts and device fabrication are included in the manuscript and supporting files, including video recordings.

The added value in this work beyond previous designs is: a) a carefully designed solution to facilitate probe recovery, thus reducing experimental costs and favoring reproducibility; b) flexibility to accommodate several microdrives and additional instrumentation; c) open access design and documentation to favor customization and dissemination. The design is quite simple and versatile, and the authors provide detailed instructions. This will be a very useful resource for many readers who are interested in performing multi-site silicon probe recordings of large ensembles of neurons in freely behaving rodents. The method will appeal to a broad range of systems neuroscientists who seek to understand neurophysiological mechanisms underlying cognition and behavior.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Metal microdrive and head cap system for silicon probe recovery in freely moving rodent&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Liset M de la Prida (Reviewer #1); Michael Okun (Reviewer #2), and Ashley L Juavinett (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We have also prepared public reviews of your work, which are designed to transform your unrefereed author manuscript into a publicly accessible refereed preprint (read more about this in the &quot;Posting public reviews&quot; section below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers were enthusiastic about the potential impact of this work. However, some concerns were raised regarding transparency, specific quantitative support of usability measurements, and clearer descriptions regarding the novelty of this resource compared to other previously published resources. Showing long-term recordings is recommended, but it is expected that the authors already have these recordings on hand. That is, reviewers believe that no new data are required, simply an inclusion and analysis of existing data. Authors are also requested to be more specific and transparent about which probes work with this resource. Specific details can be found in the three independent reviews, which were remarkably consistent and are included in their entirety below. Reviewers would like to see authors addressing all of their comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Comments and suggestions (the order is not informative)</p><p>1. The report reads very descriptive. While authors declare having used n = 7 rats and n=5 mice in methods, this is not exploited quantitatively in the paper. The ms will benefit from including some assessment to support ease of use (e.g. behavior in implanted versus not implanted animals), stability of recordings over days, weeks or months; or any other relevant supportive example.</p><p>2. Page 4, line 100 and table 1: What travel distance this refers to? The effective travel distance should be better explained. Once the probe is mounted in the shuttle, the travel distance is limited by the probe length and tip location from the microdrive base. Unexperienced users may misunderstood this important issue.</p><p>3. Table 1: What are inclusion criteria? Are these microdrives designed for tetrodes or for silicon probes; mice only?

Introduction, line 49: authors make a good case for the emergence of novel integrated solutions such as uLED and microfluidic probes which benefit from the use of versatile headgear designs.

Consider Altuna et al., Lab on Chip 2013 https://doi.org/10.1039/C3LC41364K of any other appropriate reference for integrated fluidic multi-site probes, or just avoid the mention to microfluidity.</p><p>7. Introduction, lines 52-54: flexDrive, shuttledrive, etc. all of them are mostly dedicated to carry tetrodes. There are fewer designs for silicon probes, which may support the need for this paper, but authors avoid discussing the potential overlapping and added value between existing solutions and their own design.

This is not particularly easy with silicon probes. Please, add equipment information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides an updated guide on the procedures for performing chronic recordings with silicon probes in mice and rats in the lab of the senior author, who is one of the leaders in the use of this experimental method. The new set of procedures relies on metal and plastic 3D printed parts, and represents a major improvement over the older methodology (i.e. Vandecasteele et al. 2012).</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and the technical instructions (in the Methods section) seem rather detailed. The main concerns I had are as follows.</p><p>1. The present design is an improvement over Chung et al., (the most similar previously published explantable microdrive design, as far as I am aware) in terms of the footprint and travel distance. However, a main disadvantage of the system in its present form is that (apparently) it does not support Neuropixels probes. While such probes might not be suitable for some uses (e.g. to record from large populations in dorsal hippocampus), Neuropixels probes are of considerable interest to many labs.</p><p>2. The total weight of the mouse implant seems quite high (together with the headstage, I estimate it is &gt;= 4gr). Could the authors provide the exact value, and describe whether this has any impact on the way the animal moves? Also, the authors should describe how the animals are housed (e.g. do they carry the headstage even when not being recorded). The authors say that a mouse can be implanted with more than one microdrive. The authors should clarify whether they actually have an experience with such implants, or is this just a suggestion based on their educated estimate?</p><p>3. There is no information in the Results section on the number of implants performed, the duration the animals were implanted, the quality of the recordings obtained, number of successes or failures. The figures merely provide examples of one successful recording in a mouse and in a rat. All these details should be provided, along with details of how many probes were reused and how many times (a brief mention of one case, lines 252-253 and 359-360, is not sufficient).</p><p>4. In Figure 2, spike waveforms are classified as pyramidal, wide or narrow interneurons. I did not find any description of how this classification was performed.</p><p>5. Also in Figure 2, refractory period violations are reported in percent (permille in fact). First, it is not clear how refractory period was defined. Second, such quantification is incorrect in principle: we use refractory period violations to infer the rate of false positives. Yet the relationship between fraction of ISI violations and false positive rate depends on the firing rate of the neuron. For example, 0.1% of ISI violations is quite good for a unit spiking at 10 spikes/s, is so so for a unit spiking at 1 spike/s, and is very bad if the firing rate is 0.1 spike/s (see Hill et al. JNeurosci. 2011 for derivation). Alternatively, the authors can follow an approach described in an old paper by the same lab (Harris et al., JNeuropsysiol. 2000), quantifying the violations in spike autocorrelogram relative to its asymptotic height.</p><p>6. Line 477: the authors write that the probes were mounted on a plastic microdrive. This seems to contradict the key claim of the manuscript (namely that the microdrives were from stainless steel).</p><p>7. I believe that the work of Luo and Bondy et al., (<italic>eLife</italic> 2020) and should be references and compared to.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First, I'd like to applaud the authors for the development of a very clever device and for their clear description of how to use it. With the inclusion of more details around the compatibility of this device with specific probes, more support for specific claims in the manuscript, and more transparency about the success of probe recovery, this manuscript will inevitably serve as an important resource for many researchers.</p><p>I'll leave one thought for consideration here before diving into specifics: the organization of this manuscript was a bit unclear to me. I think it makes sense to have a &quot;Results section&quot; which gives a high level description of the procedure and your design choices, as well as a &quot;methods section&quot; which outlines the protocol, but this needs to be clear. This could be solved by a line at the end of the introduction that says something like &quot;Here we'll describe the results we obtained and a high level summary …. Readers can find detailed instructions in the methods as well as in the attached files…&quot;. I would also defer to the <italic>eLife</italic> editors for how they would like to handle this organization.</p><p>The introduction of the paper is very well written, but towards the end there are several unsubstantiated claims. Specifically, the idea that this design reduces surgery time substantially. Can you be more specific, or back this up with timelines from other designs? On line 203 there is a reference to another paper after this claim, but this could be made more clear in the introduction. Which aspect of this procedure is quicker than other procedures? As I'll come to later in this review, there is also a claim about the recovery being &quot;reliable&quot; – knowing exactly how reliable, given your experience, would be extremely useful.</p><p>Overall, I have two suggestions that would greatly improve this manuscript.</p><p>First, more neural data should be shown. In Figure 2 E-H and Figure 3, some neural data recorded using this device is shown, but this is not nearly enough for users to assess the usability of these probes. The mouse data is particularly sparse, and it is very difficult to make much out of Figure 3D without seeing isolated units. If 7 rats and 5 mice were recorded, more of this data should be shown. Specifically, users may be interested in seeing the stability of units over time, as well as the SNR levels on various days of recording. The methods there was daily recording – showing some of this data would be useful. How long has one of these devices been successfully used to record activity? These types of details are essential to ensuring that your device enables quality data collection.</p><p>Secondly, there should be a table detailing each procedure done with these devices, including the type of animal (mouse/rat), age (if available), sex, success of recording (and for how many days/weeks), and success of the probe recovery (beyond saying it is &quot;highly successful&quot;, line 257). This comprehensive overview of exactly how reliable your device is will be very useful to readers.</p><p>Several aspects of the manuscript could be clarified.</p><p>1. The &quot;footprint&quot; of the device is given multiple times, but a height and width would also be useful.</p><p>2. There is a clear trade-off between the minimal wear and increased reusability of metal drives with the weight of these drives, and that should be acknowledged. Would it be possible to create such a drive with a sturdy but lighter plastic, and if not, why?</p><p>3. Line 105 says the microdrive weighs 0.87 g – is this without any materials to attach it to the skull? Similarly, the overall weight of the entire assembly should be given.</p><p>4. It is unclear what material the stereotaxic attachment is made of.</p><p>5. There doesn't seem to be any mention of how to actually attach the probe to the arm/shuttle. Is it glued? Which probes were used should be clear in the Results section (I see it is eventually mentioned in the methods). Relatedly, it should be clear which types of probes were tested with this microdrive, and which probes you would recommend using with it. Specifically, will this microdrive and assembly work with Neuropixels 1.0 probes? Being clear about which probe was used is especially important for the multi-probe implantation – presumably this will not work with probes with large PCB boards and/or headstages. Also, are multi-probe implantations possible in mice using your microdrives and assembly?</p><p>6. It is unclear how the headstage is affixed in either the rat or mouse assembly.</p><p>7. For probe recovery, it's important to note that distilled water will not be recommended for all probes. For example, neuropixels have very clear restrictions on what you should use with them. I would advise the reader accordingly. Tergazyme may be useful here as well.</p><p>8. How is grounding handled in these devices? There are multiple mentions of a skull screw used to affix the protective assembly, but in most designs, a skull screw is there to serve as a reference and/or grounding. (Sidenote: It is not clear to me why a ground screw is so bad for the animal, as is emphasized multiple times in the manuscript. We are also putting a large open whole in the skull…) Is there a ground wire in these devices? Similarly, is the copper mesh inside electrically connected to the probe, or is it kept isolated?</p><p>9. Line 476 in methods is very unclear and mentions a plastic microdrive: &quot;The probes ere mounted on a plastic recoverable microdrive to allow precise vertical movement after implantation (github.com/YoonGroupUmich/Microdrive) and implanted by attaching the base of the micro-drives to the skull with dental cement.&quot; Is this the same microdrive mentioned in the main manuscript? In general, it is unclear how the &quot;Additional implantation information&quot; relates to the main methods and seems that this information should be integrated into the other methods sections.</p><p>10. There is no mention of where to download the design files.</p><p>11. Data is provided for only 2 animals (one mouse, one rat) and 2 sessions – could more data be made available?</p><p>12. Code is provided for sorting (Kilosort Wrapper and phy plugin).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Metal microdrive and head cap system for silicon probe recovery in freely moving rodent&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined in the individual reviews below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Authors have addressed all comments. The revised version is substantially improved. Videos are superb useful as well as the accompanying information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to thank the authors for carefully and thoroughly addressing the concerns and comments that I have raised. I believe that the revised version (including the addition of the videos illustrating the key procedures) is significantly improved.</p><p>I would like to encourage the authors to incorporate into the final version of the paper all the relevant technical details from the rebuttal. For example, in their response the authors mention using a pulley to counterbalance the headstage (yet this seems not to be mentioned in the manuscript), and similarly with preferentially using large (&gt;35gr) mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript has improved significantly since the initial submission with numerous additional figures, tables, and methodological details that address the initial concerns. The reviewers have added multiple useful insights to the manuscript, including the footprint of the device, more clear justification for the use of stainless steel, the material of the implantation tool. The additional videos explaining how to assemble the headgear are very well done and clear. These details will undoubtedly help readers who wish to implement this headgear system in their own labs. The addition of more quantification of the neural data is also very appreciated. The authors have added additional analysis for Figure 2, showing single units for the mouse recording (though it would be useful to have a similar analysis in Figure 3 for the rat data).</p><p>There are several points that should be addressed within the revised manuscript:</p><p>The new Figure 5 illustrates the use of two different recording devices in mice. Figure 5A demonstrates the units recorded over time on each shank as the probe is lowered each day. However, it is unclear to me how Figure 5B relates to 5A – in 5B it looks as if all four shanks are at the same depth, whereas in 5A they are at different depths. Ultimately, it seems like some sort of integration representation of these two panels where viewers can appreciate the location of single units on each shank over days would be the most useful. On this same figure, the axis labels for 5F and 5I are a bit misleading, because this is not about the noise level of the recording, but about the waveform. I'd suggest changing the figure and the wording in the text to &quot;Waveform relative noise level&quot; so that readers do not confuse this with overall signal to noise in the recording. The axis on 5G could be readjusted so that readers can appreciate the data. In the figure caption, I'd suggest spelling out &quot;ACGs&quot; for readers unaccustomed to that shorthand. Presumably these ACGs are from the unit in the box? If so, I'd clarify in the caption.</p><p>Related to Figure 5, the corresponding text says, &quot;suggesting either that the distance between the electrode sites and neuron bodies decreased or that large size neurons were recorded,&quot; but it is important to note that the probe was being moved into different brain areas over these days of recording. The text should be modified to clarify this – the clear difference from day 5 to the other days is almost definitely explained by the movement to deeper brain structures. This paragraph should also note the clear decrease in the # of units with the reimplanted probe, as well as the clear increase in the noise level in the reimplanted probe.</p><p>The authors have also added behavioral data, shedding light on the ability of animals to move with this headgear, however some clarity around these behavioral findings is needed. On line 219 it reads, &quot;The 3D printed head cap system is comparable in weight to manually built headmounts&quot; which is an abrupt and unclear transition to the paragraph about the impact of the headgear on behavior – reading between the lines, I think the authors are saying, &quot;… however, we wanted to verify still that our headgear would not impede the animal's behavior.&quot; It is also unclear from this paragraph how this behavior was measured. The methods section describes mice and rats running on a track – were they headfixed? It is also unclear how the water reward is relevant here – did animals need to collect a water reward in order for the track to continue moving? Also, the mice with 3D printed headgear ran on a different track than the mice with manually printed headgear – some mention of this in the main text is warranted for transparency in interpreting the behavioral results shown. The wording in the methods is also unclear – is the track circular or a figure eight? Finally, contextualizing the results found here in terms of typical speeds on such a treadmill (e.g., in the discussion, see the point below) would be very useful to readers.</p><p>In this same paragraph, the authors state they found a &quot;small significant difference,&quot; but this wording is misleading. A statistical test result is or is not significant, and the authors should remove the word small. Readers can determine whether or not the absolute value of the p-value is informative. There is a typo in this section also: &quot;We also performed the same test on mice subjects and found a small significant difference between the median running speed of the two *rat* groups (KS-test; p = 0.045) but no significant different between the 95 percentile speeds (KS-test; p = 0.24).&quot; I would also recommend that the authors write out the full name of the KS test, at least on the first mention.</p><p>Line 139 says, &quot;High-quality electrophysiological signals can be collected from freely moving mice for weeks and months (Figure 2E and F)&quot; however it is unclear from this figure whether this data was indeed recorded over weeks and months. If this is a claim the authors cannot substantiate with data, it should be removed. Figure 5 does indeed show &quot;weeks&quot; with the headgear (showing data out to day 16 for the 4-shank probe and 17 for neuropixels), so it seems like an applicable figure to reference here, without the mention of &quot;months.&quot; Similar changes should be made for the reference to the rat recordings and Figure 3 – it's unclear based on the figure caption how long after implant these extracellular traces were obtained.</p><p>Finally, although these are significant additions to the main portion of the text, there is no mention of either the single-unit figure or the behavioral results in the discussion. A contextualization of these data in terms of the headgear's usability as well as a comparison of these findings to other recoverable drives would be useful and warrant discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65859.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Comments and suggestions (the order is not informative)</p><p>1.

Our developmental process was the following: first, we tested the ease of use and longevity of the cap systems in a chronic rat (R_01, n = 90 days) and a chronic mouse (M_01, n = 60 days). After this initial test, we implanted flexible probes with the cap system to test longevity of electrophysiology recordings using our cap system both in a mouse and a rat (M_02, 32-channel flexible probe, n=27 days and R_02, 64-channel flexible probe, n = 76 days). Finally, we tested the cap systems with our recoverable, plastic microdrive system which we have been using for the last two years in our laboratory. We used 32 and 64-channel silicon probes, Neuropixels probes as well as tungsten wire electrodes in mice and rats (for details see Supplementary File 1). After the initial tests, we changed from plastic recoverable to metal recoverable microdrives. In the first submission, we tested our full system (cap with metal, recoverable microdrive) in a mouse and a rat and we are continuously implanting animals using these newly developed methods.

In the revised manuscript, we dedicate a full new figure (Figure 5) to the quantification of single cell features. We want to emphasize though that our head gear development is not primarily about long-term stability but for reusing silicon probes and head gear components with ease, decreasing the effective cost, experimental effort and complexity. The metal drive has the potential to allow for better long-term recordings, but we do not have firm quantitative data to support this, since this was not the goal of our experiments. For long-term recordings of multiple single units different technologies are needed (flexible probe recordings from the Frank group (Chung et al., 2019); Lieber group’s injectable electrode (Schoonover et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2017)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

While such probes might not be suitable for some uses (e.g. to record from large populations in dorsal hippocampus), Neuropixels probes are of considerable interest to many labs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our microdrive and head cap system can also support Neuropixels probes. Since our initial submission, we have implanted a Neuropixels probe in the intermediate hippocampus of a rat using our recoverable, plastic microdrive. At the end of the experiment, the Neuropixels probe was successfully recovered, cleaned, and implanted again in a new rat. In addition, we designed a new arm for our metal microdrive which can support Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and implanted another rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>We have also created a video showing how to attach Neuropixels probe to a metal microdrive (Figure 1-video 2).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Metal microdrive adapter for Neuropixels probe.</title><p>A.

The total weight of the mouse implant seems quite high (together with the headstage, I estimate it is &gt;= 4gr). Could the authors provide the exact value, and describe whether this has any impact on the way the animal moves? Also, the authors should describe how the animals are housed (e.g. do they carry the headstage even when not being recorded). The authors say that a mouse can be implanted with more than one microdrive. The authors should clarify whether they actually have an experience with such implants, or is this just a suggestion based on their educated estimate?</p></disp-quote><p>The total weight of the metal microdrive, including the base, body and arm is 0.87 gram. Additional weight is the metabond and dental acrylic cement. The amount of cement that is used during surgery can vary between researchers and the type of surgery. The overall weight of the assembly also depends on the silicon probe with Omnetics connector(s) that is used for the surgery, e.g.: 32-channel micro-LED probe is 1.11g (NeuroLight Technologies LTD.), 64-channel 4-shank probe is 0.96g (ASSY E-1, Cambridge NeuroTech), 64-channel 5-shank probe is 1.05g (A5x12-16-Buz-Lin-5mm, NeuroNexus Ltd.) and a 128-channel 4-shank probe with integrated Intan chips is 0.94g (P128-5, Diagnostic Biochips). In addition, the overall weight of the entire assembly can change if optic fibers are used in optogenetic studies or if any custom connectors are implanted (e.g., connector and wires for brain stimulation). That is the reason why we reported the overall weight of each system (metal microdrive, mouse cap and rat cap) individually.</p><p>The implanted mice are single housed, and they do not carry the headstage while in the vivarium. During recordings, the headstage is attached and a counterbalanced pulley system ensures that the animal is not carrying the extra weight of the headstage.

There is no information in the Results section on the number of implants performed, the duration the animals were implanted, the quality of the recordings obtained, number of successes or failures. The figures merely provide examples of one successful recording in a mouse and in a rat. All these details should be provided, along with details of how many probes were reused and how many times (a brief mention of one case, lines 252-253 and 359-360, is not sufficient).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Supplementary File 1 explaining all the details of our implants. We would like to refer the Reviewer to response #1 to Reviewer 1.</p><p>Adapting new technology is challenging. To date, we have extensive experience with the rat cap system only (n=3 users in the lab, n = 25 rats implanted). Two lab members have started to adapt our mouse cap and implanted 3 mice since our submission. We included their maze running behavioral data for comparison between the copper mesh and cap system.</p><p>Prior to the development of the metal microdrive, we have conducted an internal lab survey comparing the hand-made microdrive (Vandecasteele et al., 2012) and our recoverable, plastic microdrive. Six lab members who had extensive experience with both types participated (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Our questions were:</p><p>1. On a scale 1-10, how would you compare the plastic, recoverable drive to the Vandecasteele et al., 2012 one in terms of: (a) ease of building a drive, (b) size and (c) ease of recovery.</p><p>Overall, the success rate of recovery is much higher using a recoverable microdrive system, but the size of the plastic, recoverable microdrive is limits certain experiments. This was one of the main motivations to develop the metal, recoverable microdrive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 2, spike waveforms are classified as pyramidal, wide or narrow interneurons. I did not find any description of how this classification was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the single cell putative cell types from the manuscript as this issue is not relevant to the current manuscript. Figure 2 has been simplified and a new figure 5 is dedicated to the single cell quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Also in Figure 2, refractory period violations are reported in percent (permille in fact). First, it is not clear how refractory period was defined. Second, such quantification is incorrect in principle: we use refractory period violations to infer the rate of false positives. Yet the relationship between fraction of ISI violations and false positive rate depends on the firing rate of the neuron. For example, 0.1% of ISI violations is quite good for a unit spiking at 10 spikes/s, is so so for a unit spiking at 1 spike/s, and is very bad if the firing rate is 0.1 spike/s (see Hill et al. JNeurosci. 2011 for derivation). Alternatively,</p><p>the authors can follow an approach described in an old paper by the same lab (Harris et al., JNeuropsysiol. 2000), quantifying the violations in spike autocorrelogram relative to its asymptotic height.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this panel from Figure 2 and dedicated a new figure (Figure 5) to the single cell quantification. Refractory violations can be used as an alarm for poor cluster quality. Absence of refractory violations alone does not guarantee good separation for the reasons the Reviewer mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 477: the authors write that the probes were mounted on a plastic microdrive. This seems to contradict the key claim of the manuscript (namely that the microdrives were from stainless steel).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if this description was not clear in the original manuscript. In the revised version, we have added a table (Supplementary File 1) explaining all details of each animal subject (species, strain, weight, cap type), type of silicon probe and microdrive used. As we explained in Response 3, our main goal was to test each system individually and once all components have been verified, we combined everything into one surgery.</p><p>The plastic and metal microdrives are based on the same principles. The implantation/recovery tools are also identical in design concepts. Based on our own experience, users dol not recognize any changes in terms of ease of use, ease of implantation and ease of recovery when changing from plastic recoverable microdrives to metal ones. The advantage of metal drives is size reduction, their multiple reusability and stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I believe that the work of Luo and Bondy et al., (eLife 2020) and should be references and compared to.</p></disp-quote><p>We reference Luo et al., (2020) in our revised manuscript. One of the main advantages of using a microdrive system is the ability to move the recording probe inside the brain tissue and sample new sets of neurons. This is not the case in Luo and Bondy et al., (<italic>eLife</italic> 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>First, I'd like to applaud the authors for the development of a very clever device and for their clear description of how to use it. With the inclusion of more details around the compatibility of this device with specific probes, more support for specific claims in the manuscript, and more transparency about the success of probe recovery, this manuscript will inevitably serve as an important resource for many researchers.</p><p>I'll leave one thought for consideration here before diving into specifics: the organization of this manuscript was a bit unclear to me. I think it makes sense to have a &quot;Results section&quot; which gives a high level description of the procedure and your design choices, as well as a &quot;methods section&quot; which outlines the protocol, but this needs to be clear. This could be solved by a line at the end of the introduction that says something like &quot;Here we'll describe the results we obtained and a high level summary …. Readers can find detailed instructions in the methods as well as in the attached files…&quot;. I would also defer to the eLife editors for how they would like to handle this organization.</p><p>The introduction of the paper is very well written, but towards the end there are several unsubstantiated claims. Specifically, the idea that this design reduces surgery time substantially. Can you be more specific, or back this up with timelines from other designs? On line 203 there is a reference to another paper after this claim, but this could be made more clear in the introduction. Which aspect of this procedure is quicker than other procedures? As I'll come to later in this review, there is also a claim about the recovery being &quot;reliable&quot; – knowing exactly how reliable, given your experience, would be extremely useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for carefully reading our manuscript and providing useful and constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I have two suggestions that would greatly improve this manuscript.</p><p>First, more neural data should be shown. In Figure 2 E-H and Figure 3, some neural data recorded using this device is shown, but this is not nearly enough for users to assess the usability of these probes. The mouse data is particularly sparse, and it is very difficult to make much out of Figure 3D without seeing isolated units. If 7 rats and 5 mice were recorded, more of this data should be shown. Specifically, users may be interested in seeing the stability of units over time, as well as the SNR levels on various days of recording. The methods there was daily recording – showing some of this data would be useful. How long has one of these devices been successfully used to record activity? These types of details are essential to ensuring that your device enables quality data collection.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these comments, which prompted us to add more quantifications and details. We added 3 new figures, 6 new videos and a Supplementary Table to address the Reviewer’s comment. Figure 5 is dedicated to the quantification of unit parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, there should be a table detailing each procedure done with these devices, including the type of animal (mouse/rat), age (if available), sex, success of recording (and for how many days/weeks), and success of the probe recovery (beyond saying it is &quot;highly successful&quot;, line 257). This comprehensive overview of exactly how reliable your device is will be very useful to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added Supplementary File 1, which list all critical technical details of all experiments included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several aspects of the manuscript could be clarified.</p><p>1. The &quot;footprint&quot; of the device is given multiple times, but a height and width would also be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The outer dimensions of the microdrive are specified in figure 1B. All dimensions of the drive are available in Table 1. We also added the width, height, and length to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There is a clear trade-off between the minimal wear and increased reusability of metal drives with the weight of these drives, and that should be acknowledged. Would it be possible to create such a drive with a sturdy but lighter plastic, and if not, why?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. Stainless steel is about 100 times less flexible than plastic (Young's modulus of stainless steel: ~180 GPa vs plastic: ~2 GPa), yet the density is only 8 times higher (steel: ~8 kg/m3, plastic ~1 kg/m3). This is why the device can be made sturdier at a similar size. Manufacturing a plastic drive with the same strength would make the plastic drive substantially larger. While plastic drives are cheaper, their reusability is more limited. Both materials have their own advantages and weaknesses. However, reusability is an important factor since preparing a new head gear requires many hours of dedicated time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 105 says the microdrive weighs 0.87 g – is this without any materials to attach it to the skull? Similarly, the overall weight of the entire assembly should be given.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct that the total weight of the metal microdrive, including the base, body and arm is 0.87 gram. Additional weight is the metabond and dental acrylic cement. The amount of cement that is used during surgery can vary between researchers and the type of surgery. The overall weight of the assembly also depends on the silicon probe with Omnetics connector(s) that is used for the surgery, e.g.: 32-channel micro-LED probe is 1.11g (NeuroLight Technologies LTD.), 64-channel 4-shank probe is 0.96g (ASSY E-1, Cambridge NeuroTech), 64-channel 5-shank probe is 1.05g (A5x12-16-Buz-Lin-5mm, NeuroNexus Ltd.) and a 128-channel 4-shank probe with integrated Intan chips is 0.94g (P128-5, Diagnostic Biochips). In addition, the overall weight of the entire assembly can change if optic fibers are used in optogenetic studies or if any custom connectors are implanted (e.g., connector and wires for brain stimulation). That is the reason why we reported the overall weight of each system (metal microdrive, mouse cap and rat cap) individually.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is unclear what material the stereotaxic attachment is made of.</p></disp-quote><p>The stereotaxic attachment is made of plastic (clear v4 resin from FormLabs). We have added this information in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There doesn't seem to be any mention of how to actually attach the probe to the arm/shuttle. Is it glued? Which probes were used should be clear in the Results section (I see it is eventually mentioned in the methods). Relatedly, it should be clear which types of probes were tested with this microdrive, and which probes you would recommend using with it. Specifically, will this microdrive and assembly work with Neuropixels 1.0 probes? Being clear about which probe was used is especially important for the multi-probe implantation – presumably this will not work with probes with large PCB boards and/or headstages. Also, are multi-probe implantations possible in mice using your microdrives and assembly?</p></disp-quote><p>We attach the backend of the silicon probes to the arm using cyanoacrylate glue (Loctite, #45208). We have included this step in our Methods section, and we have also added this information to the figure legend of Figure 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We added a new table summarizing which probes were used with our microdrive system. We have also performed the necessary modification of the arm design to support Neuropixels 1.0 probes (Figure 2) and performed a chronic surgery in a rat. Our microdrive can support any type of silicon probes provided that the arm is customized for the right size. We do not fully understand the Reviewer comment about “large PCB boards and/or headstages”. If the PCB boards and/or headstages are small/light enough for a rodent to carry them, our system will work with that device. Using our system with regular silicon probes, the headstages are attached to the animals during the recording session only. A counterbalanced pulley system makes sure that the animal is not carrying the extra weight of the headstage during recordings. In the revised manuscript, we provide quantitative data that compares the running speed of animals with various drives.</p><p>Dual probe implantations are possible with our system, as illustrated in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is unclear how the headstage is affixed in either the rat or mouse assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>The headstage is attached to the Omnetics connector sitting on the PCB of the probe. A male header pin is attached to the probe PCB using cyanoacrylate glue and dental cement. During surgery, this male header pin is soldered to the cap system. There is no further need to support the headstage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. For probe recovery, it's important to note that distilled water will not be recommended for all probes. For example, neuropixels have very clear restrictions on what you should use with them. I would advise the reader accordingly. Tergazyme may be useful here as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is right that some probes might not be suitable for our cleaning procedure. In the revised manuscript, we clearly specified which probe types can be cleaned in the described way. We have also added a separate recommendation for cleaning Neuropixels 1.0 probes based on Luo et al. (2020) work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. How is grounding handled in these devices? There are multiple mentions of a skull screw used to affix the protective assembly, but in most designs, a skull screw is there to serve as a reference and/or grounding. (Sidenote: It is not clear to me why a ground screw is so bad for the animal, as is emphasized multiple times in the manuscript. We are also putting a large open whole in the skull…) Is there a ground wire in these devices? Similarly, is the copper mesh inside electrically connected to the probe, or is it kept isolated?</p></disp-quote><p>We either implant a 100-µm stainless-steel wire or a skull screw with an attached insulated wire (California Fine Wire, CA, USA) above the cerebellum to serve as ground for our recordings. After the silicon probe is implanted, this ground wire is soldered to the copper mesh or copper tape (mouse and rat cap, respectively). The probe’s ground and reference wires are also soldered to the copper mesh or copper tape. For the mesh to function as a Faraday cage, it must be grounded. Traditionally, the reference and ground electrodes were isolated from each other, but since we have been using Intan-based recording devices, we have not observed any difference in the quality of our recordings after shorting the reference and ground wires. The Intan headstages are shipped with shorted reference and ground (there is a zero-ohm jumper at R0 location on the printed circuit board of all headstages).</p><p>In the manuscript we refer to support skull screws as additional screws and not to the ground or reference screws. It has been common practice to use multiple support screws in rats and mice to attach the headgear to the skull. For instance, Vandecasteele et al., (2012) recommends using at least 4 support screws in rats. Recently, we eliminated this step and replaced the support skull screws with a surface bond material (Metabond). In our current protocol, we apply one or two layers of Metabond instead of multiple skull support screws, making the surgical procedure less invasive. We have also found that the animals recover faster. The bond is stable across the animal’s lifetime, and we have not observed any headgear loss with properly implanted animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Line 476 in methods is very unclear and mentions a plastic microdrive: &quot;The probes ere mounted on a plastic recoverable microdrive to allow precise vertical movement after implantation (github.com/YoonGroupUmich/Microdrive) and implanted by attaching the base of the micro-drives to the skull with dental cement.&quot; Is this the same microdrive mentioned in the main manuscript? In general, it is unclear how the &quot;Additional implantation information&quot; relates to the main methods and seems that this information should be integrated into the other methods sections.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our detailed answer to Comment 4 from Reviewer #1.

Figure 5A demonstrates the units recorded over time on each shank as the probe is lowered each day. However, it is unclear to me how Figure 5B relates to 5A – in 5B it looks as if all four shanks are at the same depth, whereas in 5A they are at different depths. Ultimately, it seems like some sort of integration representation of these two panels where viewers can appreciate the location of single units on each shank over days would be the most useful. On this same figure, the axis labels for 5F and 5I are a bit misleading, because this is not about the noise level of the recording, but about the waveform. I'd suggest changing the figure and the wording in the text to &quot;Waveform relative noise level&quot; so that readers do not confuse this with overall signal to noise in the recording. The axis on 5G could be readjusted so that readers can appreciate the data. In the figure caption, I'd suggest spelling out &quot;ACGs&quot; for readers unaccustomed to that shorthand. Presumably these ACGs are from the unit in the box? If so, I'd clarify in the caption.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. Indeed, Figure 5A captures the single unit stability visually with individual shanks plotted above each other and panel B shows the correct horizontal layout and captures the distribution across days for units across all shanks. We have altered the figure legend to better describe this and switched the subpanels in B. We have added “Waveform relative noise level” to the appropriate labels. We also updated the figure caption for J-L. It reads now: “J-L Neuropixels probe recording, where the same putative interneuron was tracked across four days. J Average waveforms (bandpass filtered 300-10000 Hz) of a putative interneuron recorded on 16 channels across 4 days (left). The average waveforms recorded at the site with the largest amplitude waveform is highlighted on the right (waveforms are color-coded by recording day). Autocorrelation histograms (K) and spike amplitudes (L; from Kilosort) for the same single unit, color-coded by recording day.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to Figure 5, the corresponding text says, &quot;suggesting either that the distance between the electrode sites and neuron bodies decreased or that large size neurons were recorded,&quot; but it is important to note that the probe was being moved into different brain areas over these days of recording. The text should be modified to clarify this – the clear difference from day 5 to the other days is almost definitely explained by the movement to deeper brain structures. This paragraph should also note the clear decrease in the # of units with the reimplanted probe, as well as the clear increase in the noise level in the reimplanted probe.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we added this information to the revised manuscript. We would also like to point out that despite a successful probe recovery, the recording quality can deteriorate over time reducing the number of high-quality single unit clusters (e.g., increased impedance of recording sites and decreased signal-to-noise over time).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have also added behavioral data, shedding light on the ability of animals to move with this headgear, however some clarity around these behavioral findings is needed. On line 219 it reads, &quot;The 3D printed head cap system is comparable in weight to manually built headmounts&quot; which is an abrupt and unclear transition to the paragraph about the impact of the headgear on behavior – reading between the lines, I think the authors are saying, &quot;… however, we wanted to verify still that our headgear would not impede the animal's behavior.&quot; It is also unclear from this paragraph how this behavior was measured. The methods section describes mice and rats running on a track – were they headfixed? It is also unclear how the water reward is relevant here – did animals need to collect a water reward in order for the track to continue moving? Also, the mice with 3D printed headgear ran on a different track than the mice with manually printed headgear – some mention of this in the main text is warranted for transparency in interpreting the behavioral results shown. The wording in the methods is also unclear – is the track circular or a figure eight? Finally, contextualizing the results found here in terms of typical speeds on such a treadmill (e.g., in the discussion, see the point below) would be very useful to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct that we wanted to test whether our new headgear system would interfere with the behavior of freely moving mice and rats. We added the suggested sentence to the revised manuscript. All animals were freely moving, not head fixed. Rats and mice were water deprived and had to collect water as reward. The linear mazes had ‘reward areas’ on each end where reward was delivered via an automatic infrared-beam triggered system. Animals only received water reward for trials in which they travelled from one reward site to the other. We clarified the maze design in the manuscript: ”120-cm diameter circular track with a diagonal path allowing the animals to run in a figure-eight pattern”, its similar to a classical figure-eight maze, yet return arms are altered to a continuous circle, so that mice make fewer sharp turns. The animals are water deprived and earn reward when performing the alternation task correctly. The water reward was given at the start of the central path. We added this information to the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this same paragraph, the authors state they found a &quot;small significant difference,&quot; but this wording is misleading. A statistical test result is or is not significant, and the authors should remove the word small. Readers can determine whether or not the absolute value of the p-value is informative. There is a typo in this section also: &quot;We also performed the same test on mice subjects and found a small significant difference between the median running speed of the two *rat* groups (KS-test; p = 0.045) but no significant different between the 95 percentile speeds (KS-test; p = 0.24).&quot; I would also recommend that the authors write out the full name of the KS test, at least on the first mention.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that a statistical test result is either significant or not.

If this is a claim the authors cannot substantiate with data, it should be removed. Figure 5 does indeed show &quot;weeks&quot; with the headgear (showing data out to day 16 for the 4-shank probe and 17 for neuropixels), so it seems like an applicable figure to reference here, without the mention of &quot;months.&quot; Similar changes should be made for the reference to the rat recordings and Figure 3 – it's unclear based on the figure caption how long after implant these extracellular traces were obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the “months” from the revised manuscript and added the requested information (post-op day 18) to the caption of Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, although these are significant additions to the main portion of the text, there is no mention of either the single-unit figure or the behavioral results in the discussion.
