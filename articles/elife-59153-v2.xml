However, links between GDM and T2D are not well understood. We used a well-characterised GDM prospective cohort of 1035 women following up to 8 years postpartum. Lipidomics profiling covering &gt;1000 lipids was performed on fasting plasma samples from participants 6–9 week postpartum (171 incident T2D vs. 179 controls). We discovered 311 lipids positively and 70 lipids negatively associated with T2D risk. The upregulation of glycerolipid metabolism involving triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol biosynthesis suggested activated lipid storage before diabetes onset. In contrast, decreased sphingomyelines, hexosylceramide and lactosylceramide indicated impaired sphingolipid metabolism. Additionally, a lipid signature was identified to effectively predict future diabetes risk. These findings demonstrate an underlying dyslipidemia during the early postpartum in those GDM women who progress to T2D and suggest endogenous lipogenesis may be a driving force for future diabetes onset.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Gestational diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>prospective study</kwd><kwd>pathophysiology</kwd><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>Type 2 Diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRN 143219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD050625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunderson</surname><given-names>Erica P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>NIDDK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK118409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunderson</surname><given-names>Erica P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008897</institution-id><institution>Janssen Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>430086739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunderson</surname><given-names>Erica P</given-names></name><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000064</institution-id><institution>Banting and Best Diabetes Centre, University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>Mi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al Rijjal</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000064</institution-id><institution>Banting and Best Diabetes Centre, University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al Rijjal</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lipid dysmetabolism occurs at postpartum in women who progress from GDM to type 2 diabetes, and specific lipids could predict the progression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) develops during pregnancy, affecting 1–14% of all pregnancies depending on diagnostic criteria and the population characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melchior et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of women with a history of GDM were not known to have overt diabetes before pregnancy and return to non-diabetes post-delivery. However, women with a history of GDM are ~7 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) during the child-bearing years compared to women who had no previous GDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gunderson et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, it is estimated that 35–50% of women with GDM may progress to T2D within 10 years after delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tobias, 2018</xref>). Within 15 to 25 years, the lifetime maternal risk for overt diabetes is estimated to reach &gt;50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">American Diabetes Association, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to uncover the underlying metabolic changes and understand the distinctive pathophysiology in T2D progression/development following GDM.</p><p>In the past decade, omics-based approaches have been used to discover novel metabolic fluctuations in humans, providing insight into pathophysiology of disease and identifying biomarkers of future disease including diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allalou et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, lipidomics has emerged as a more specialized omics platform that enables the measurement of a wide spectrum of lipid species. This approach has greatly expanded our understanding of the complexity of lipid dysregulation in metabolic diseases. Recently, an increasing number of lipidomics studies have aimed to link lipid dysregulation to diabetes pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meikle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rhee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meikle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alshehry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suvitaival et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Razquin et al., 2018</xref>). In the Framingham Heart Study cohort, more than 100 lipid analytes were measured and a group of triacylglycerols (low total carbon number and carbon double bonds) were found to be associated with increased risk of T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rhee et al., 2011</xref>). In the PREDIMED trial, 207 plasma lipids were measured in which lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylcholine-plasmalogens (PC-PLs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and cholesteryl esters (CEs) were found to be inversely associated with T2D risk while triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerol (DAGs) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PEs) were positively associated with T2D risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Razquin et al., 2018</xref>). A total of 277 plasma lipids were analyzed using a lipidomics approach in Finnish males in which five lipids were selected to predict progression to Type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suvitaival et al., 2018</xref>). In this cohort, higher levels of specific TAGs and diacyl- phospholipids and lower levels of alkylacyl-phosphatidylcholines were also observed in those who progressed to T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suvitaival et al., 2018</xref>). In a very recent lipidomics study of a Chinese cohort, 250 lipids were tested and 38 significantly associated with T2D risk, including TAGs, LPCs, PCs, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)–plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamines (PUFA-PEps), and CEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). A lipid panel including six lipids significantly improved T2D prediction compared to that achieved by conventional risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). In all of these studies, the positive association of TAG/DAG and T2D risk was consistently reported. However, a convergence on other specific lipids were not evident. This could be due to the differences in study design, cohort background and methodology including, importantly, limitations in coverage - expressed lipids in each study were not consistent.</p><p>Lipidomics has also been performed in GDM cohorts, including the measurement of 181 lipids in serum samples obtained from GDM women in their early second trimester. Four lipid biomarkers (TG(51:1), TG(48:1), PC(32:1), and PCae(40:4)) were identified for GDM prediction with a moderate accuracy 71% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Another lipidomic study measuring ~300 lipid species in blood samples from 104 women with recent GDM at 12 weeks post-delivery, of whom 21 cases later developed T2D, showed 84% accuracy in T2D prediction based on three lipids [i.e., PE(P-36:2), PS38:4, CE20:4] in combination with six other risk factors (i.e., age, BMI, prenatal fasting glucose, postpartum fasting glucose, total triglycerides, and total cholesterol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lappas et al., 2015</xref>). Our team identified seven lipids from early postpartum blood samples to predict later incident T2D with an AUC of 0.92 in a relatively small subset of women with recent GDM in our large prospective cohort (55 matched pairs of incident cases controls) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khan et al., 2019</xref>). To date however, no consensus has been achieved in terms of lipidomic dysregulation in GDM progression to T2D, likely due to limitation in the coverage of lipidome, cohort size, clinical data including diagnosis and follow-up years. Lipidomic changes within a large prospective cohort of women with GDM followed from the early postpartum period have not been evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of lipidomic changes in relation to progression to T2D could elucidate the pathogenesis of transition from GDM to T2D, and thereby improve our understanding of the clinical targets for therapeutic interventions.</p><p>In the present study, lipidomics of 1008 lipid species from 15 lipid classes and 296 fatty acids was measured in a well-characterised prospective cohort with recent GDM pregnancy and no diabetes, followed from 6 to 9 weeks post-delivery (baseline), retested with OGTTs for 2 years and followed via clinical laboratory testing and diagnoses up to 8 years later. Our aims were to systematically investigate lipidomic dysregulation in the transition from no diabetes to incident T2D following a GDM pregnancy and uncover lipid markers that may facilitate the early prediction of T2D incidence with clinical risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical characterization of the participants at baseline</title><p>The SWIFT cohort enrolled a total of 1035 women diagnosed with GDM.

Among all the TAGs detected (carbon atoms from 36 to 60), those significantly associated with diabetes risk contained between 40–56 carbon atoms and 0–8 double bonds. Within those TAGs containing 40–56 carbon atoms, T2D risk increased in step with the number of carbon atoms (except carbon atom 55). TAGs most significantly associated with T2D risk were clustered in the range of carbon atoms 50–54 and double bond 0–4, particularly with even carbon atoms 52 and 54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

A lipid signature associated with future diabetes risk was uncovered which contributes new knowledge to understanding the aetiology of diabetes in women associated with GDM. Importantly, our data indicate that women with recent GDM who later develop new onset T2D have clear differences in their lipidome compared to controls after delivery.

This is equivalent to an impressive 57.2% of all measured TAGs (293 out of 512) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, among the lipids associated with the most significant T2D risk, 91% of them were TAGs (97 out of 107) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This finding fits our clinical measurements showing elevated TAGs in T2D incident cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and is consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meikle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rhee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meikle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alshehry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suvitaival et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Razquin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lappas et al., 2015</xref>). TAGs, belonging to neutral lipids, are the energy storage in adipocytes and are an efficient energy source for muscle. In plasma, TAGs enable the bidirectional flow of fat from adipose tissue storage and blood glucose from the liver. Therefore, it is not surprising that TAGs outweigh other lipids as the dominant lipid species in terms of reflecting the changes of lipid metabolism in the body. The source of TAGs could be from food intake or endogenous TAG biosynthesis, such as lipogenesis. Our KEGG analysis demonstrated that the glycerolipid metabolism pathway was upregulated, suggesting the accumulation of TAGs could be attributed to the up-regulation of TAG biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It was reported high sugar could stimulate de novo lipogenesis in liver thereby increasing serum TAG level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwarz et al., 2003</xref>). This process could be activated directly through transcriptional factor carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) to promote expression of lipogenic enzymes. Alternatively, lipogenesis could also be regulated by insulin through sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1). The elevated level of plasma hexose and insulin in those incident T2D cases at baseline could be associated with the enhanced endogenous lipogenesis.</p><p>In contrast, classes of glycerophospholipids (PC and LPC classes) are inversely associated with T2D risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Glycerophospholipids (through DAG) and TAGs share the same precursor glycerol-3-phosphate. Therefore, the downward trend in glycerophospholipids could be linked to the up-regulation of TAG biosynthesis. In addition to the phospholipids, an impressive 62% of measured sphingolipids (31 out of 50 tested) were inversely associated with T2D risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Particularly SM(18:1), SM(20:1), SM(24:1), HCER(24:1), and LCER(16:0) were among the lipids with the most significant risk associated with diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). KEGG analysis revealed that sphingolipid metabolism was the most significantly down-regulated (p=2.11E-05), further supporting the inverse association between sphingolipids and diabetes risk. So far, the relationship between sphingolipids and T2D risk has not been unequivocally ascertained. Several cross-sectional clinical studies have shown that CERs (upstream node of the sphingolipids pathway) are elevated in obese subjects with T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meikle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemaitre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haus et al., 2009</xref>). We and others, however, have previously shown a negative association of SMs (downstream node of the whole pathway) with diabetes risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allalou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Razquin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Floegel et al., 2013</xref>). Further biological testing in humans and models of diabetes risk are required to validate the association between sphingolipids and diabetes onset.</p><p>Glycerophospholipids (through DAG) and TAGs share the same precursor glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). The higher G3P induced by higher plasma glucose levels could shift the acyl-CoA to lipogenesis from sphingolipids and phospholipids pathways. Therefore, in those incident T2D cases, the downward trend in glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids could be associated with the up-regulation of TAG biosynthesis. In normal physiological conditions, de novo lipogenesis mainly occurs in the liver and adipose tissue and is a minor contributor to serum TAG homeostasis. However, an up-regulated lipogenesis could break the balance causing lipidemia. In addition, down-regulation of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids biosynthesis impairs the integrity of cell membrane structure, which might contribute to insulin resistance. Although higher glucose level could correlate with higher TAG, TAG is not simply an indirect measure of glucose. Instead, increased TAG along with decreased phospholipids and sphingolipids could be an early sign of up-regulated endogenous de novo lipogenesis, a driving force of T2D.</p><p>Investigating the composition of the fatty acids in the lipids showed long chain SFA myristic acid (C14:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0) were positively associated with T2D risk. Previously, palmitic acids were reported to cause pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and were shown to be associated with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nemecz et al., 2018</xref>). A previous study on a large prospective cohort EPIC-InterAct case suggested that even-chain SFA in phospholipids were positively associated with diabetes risk while odd-chain SFA had a negative association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forouhi et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we detected odd-chain SFA from phospholipids were negatively associated with T2D risk. However, the association between even-chain SFAs and T2D risk was more complicated depending on the lipid classes from which they were derived. Even-chain SFAs from glycerol lipids (TAGs and DAGs) were positively associated with T2D risk while those from sphingolipids had a negative association. No significant association to T2D risk was detected in even-chain SFAs from phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Odd-chain SFAs (C15:0 and C17:0) are mainly exogenously derived from dairy fat intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smedman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolk et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodson et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, even-chain SFAs are from an endogenous source, such as increased lipolysis from adipose tissue or de-novo lipogenesis from excess carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hudgins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">King et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hudgins et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the carbon numbers of fatty acids, we also showed the association between the degree of fatty acid unsaturation (number of double bonds) and diabetes. MUFAs, particularly those from sphingolipids, were negatively associated with T2D risk; however，PUFAs from TAGs were positively associated. These findings suggest that fatty acids from different sources and lipid classes have opposite influences on diabetes risk. This would provide novel insight into the role of lipid metabolism in diabetes onset and further develop guidelines for a healthy diet to prevent diabetes.</p><p>In addition to investigating the pathology of diabetes onset, we also developed an 11-lipid panel to predict future diabetes. Traditional clinical parameters such as FPG and 2hPG can achieve a prediction power AUC of 0.775. However, when we combine our lipid panel with FPG and 2hPG, we can improve the prediction power from 0.775 to 0.842. Among those 11 lipids, 10 belong to TAG and one is PC. These results suggest that specific metabolites of the TAG and PC classes play important roles in the early detection of women who will transition from GDM to T2D. Since diabetes is a metabolic disorder involving dysmetabolism of carbohydrate, lipids and amino acids, it is not surprising that biomarkers of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism can improve the predictive power over carbohydrate metabolism alone. Based on our data, we would envision that adding a specific lipidomic signature to existing clinical parameters for testing, perhaps including other metabolites (ie. biogenic amines and amino acids) will provide a more accurate assessment of future T2D risk. Nonetheless, our study provides an important clinical application for early prediction of diabetes when most GDM women return to normoglycemia after delivery. The early prediction will contribute to early intervention and prevention of diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>SWIFT cohort</title><p>The Study of Women, Infant Feeding, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus After GDM Pregnancy (SWIFT) is a prospective cohort that conducted in-person research exams among 1035 women with GDM diagnosed based on the 3 hr 100 g OGTT via Carpenter and Coustan’s criteria, and no prior history of diabetes or other serious health conditions (age 20–45 years, diverse ethnicities) within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Healthcare System (KPNC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carpenter and Coustan, 1982</xref>).

Of 1035 women with GDM who consented to participate in the three in-person research exams for the SWIFT Study, 1010 participants did not have T2D at baseline (6–9 weeks postpartum) based on 2 hr 75 g oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). All research participants underwent annual research 2 hr 75 g OGTTs and other assessments at baseline throughout 2 years of follow-up, and subsequently for medical diagnoses of diabetes confirmed by laboratory testing from electronic medical records up to 8 years post-baseline. Research methodology included monthly quantitative assessment of lactation intensity and duration, socio-demographics, medical conditions, medication use, reproductive history, depression, subsequent births, lifestyle behaviors, body composition and anthropometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunderson et al., 2011</xref>). Fasting and 2 hr postload plasma samples from 75 g OGTTs (baseline, 1 year, and 2 years post-baseline) were analyzed within several weeks for glucose and insulin levels, and fasting stored samples from the SWIFT Biobank (−80°C) were used to measure a lipid panel, free fatty acids and adipokines, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gunderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gunderson et al., 2012</xref>). Follow-up assessments to determine new onset T2D status were based on research 2 hr 75 g OGTTs and KPNC electronic medical records data based on mediation, ICD codes and laboratory tests for glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gunderson et al., 2015</xref>). T2D diagnosis was based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003</xref>). The study design and all procedures were approved by the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Institutional Review Board (protocol numbers #CN-04EGund-03-H and #1279812–10) and Office of Research Ethics at University of Toronto (protocol number #38188). All participants gave written informed consent before taking part in the research exams.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Lipidomics assay</title><p>Baseline fasting plasma from 350 samples from a subset of the cohort (171 incident T2D vs 179 non-T2D controls) were sent to Metabolon, Inc (Morrisville, NC) and measured by GC-MS and LC-MS. Lipids were extracted from the bio-fluid in the presence of deuterated internal standards using an automated BUME extraction according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Löfgren et al., 2012</xref>. The extracts were dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in ammonium acetate dichloromethane: methanol. The extracts were transferred to vials for infusion-MS analysis, performed on a Shimadzu LC with nano PEEK tubing and the Sciex SelexIon-5500 QTRAP. The samples were analyzed via both positive and negative mode electrospray. The 5500 QTRAP was operated in MRM mode with a total of more than 1,100 MRMs. Individual lipid species were quantified by taking the ratio of the signal intensity of each target compound to that of its assigned internal standard, then multiplying by the concentration of internal standard added to the sample. Lipid class concentrations were calculated from the sum of all molecular species within a class, and fatty acid compositions were determined by calculating the proportion of each class comprised by individual fatty acids. In this study, a total of 1008 lipid species from 15 classes and 296 fatty acids were measured. In particular, in the natural lipid group, 26 cholesterol esters (CE), 26 monoacylglycerol (MAG), 59 diacylglycerol (DAG), 493 triacylglycerol (TAG), and 26 free fatty acids (FFA) were detected. In phospholipid group, 140 phosphatidylcholine (PC), 216 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 28 phosphatidylinositol (PI), 26 lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and 26 lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) were measured. In sphingolipid group, levels of 13 dihydroceramide (DCER), 12 ceramide (CER), 12 hexosylceramide (HCER), 12 lactosylceramide (LCER), and 12 species of sphingomyelin (SM) were tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analyses</title><p>Data processing was performed for further statistical analysis. Lipids with &gt;5% missing values were removed from the data allowing only the most robust lipids for the following statistical analysis. After this filtering step, 1008 species were reduced to 816 for further analysis. Remaining missing values were imputed as 1/2 minimum value for each specific lipid. Sample normalization was performed by normalizing each value within the sample to the total value of the sample to adjust differences among the samples. Log-transformation was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) of each lipid for T2D incidence were calculated by applying logistic regression models adjusting effects from race/ethnicity, age and BMI. FDR was calculated by correcting p-value by Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple comparison. A cut-off of FDR &lt; 0.05 was used for significance. Lipids with FDR of odds ratio &lt;0.001 were subjected for lipid predictor selection. By applying a conditional logistic regression model with stepwise method (including forward and backwards), 11 lipids were selected for prediction models. Classification models were built with logistic regression and cross validation was performed to evaluate the prediction performance. Prediction performance was presented as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Because association of lipids with diabetes risk can differ based on acyl chain length and unsaturation degree, lipids were grouped and further analyzed based on carbon atom and double bond numbers. All the analyses above were performed in open-source, statistical software, R v3.2.4. Pathway analysis was performed using positive- or negative-associated lipids in the web tool MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Gabriele V Ronnett for important contributions to data interpretation and Ying Liu for contributions to study conceptualization.

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lai et al. used plasma lipidomics to identify metabolic signatures that predict whether patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) will progress to Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the years after pregnancy. From over 1,000 patients with GDM, the authors performed lipidomics in 171 patients who developed T2DM at follow up and 179 controls who did not. From plasma acquired soon after pregnancy, they identified numerous lipids correlating positively or negatively with T2DM. These included a large number of positively-associated triglycerides and several negatively-associated phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. From the most informative lipids, the authors derived an 11-lipid signature which, when combined with conventional markers of diabetes in the post-pregnancy state, improved the ability to predict future diabetes. The authors conclude that patients destined to progress from GDM to T2DM have aberrant plasma lipid profiles soon after pregnancy, and that detecting these abnormalities can be used to predict future T2DM.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the choice of cohorts, is unclear how the authors matched 171 women with incident T2D to 179 controls. The number of subjects are unequal. The construction of the dataset should be better described.</p><p>2) There needs to be a more informative way to communicate how long the patients were followed after pregnancy than &quot;up to 8 years.&quot; Perhaps the authors can indicate from the cohort analyzed by lipidomics how many patients were followed for 1, 2, 3 etc years, because this could influence the interpretation of the incidence of T2DM. The authors should also confirm that the total years of follow-up were similar between the cases and controls in this cohort.</p><p>3) There also needs to be more detail about the lipidomic method, beyond that it was performed by a company. For example, are any of these lipids subjected to formal quantitation or are these all relative values? How was normalization performed? If the abundance of each species was normalized to a total lipid content, then the apparent reduction of some phospholipids may be an artifact of the elevated TAGs.</p><p>4) Furthermore, although the authors outlined in the Introduction that there have been a number of different lipidomics studies in diabetes, it is less clear whether there was convergence on a set of lipids among these different studies. Can you summarize? If every study lands on different lipids, that could indicate that 1) the underlying biology is different among cohorts with different inherent risks; 2) technical differences in the mass spectrometry; or 3) study design. Some discussion about these issues would improve the paper.</p><p>5) Figure 5 should include the glucose pathway. From the data, the obvious implication is that higher glucose levels lead to higher G3P levels which shift palmitoyl-CoA (and other fatty acid CoAs) to TAGs and away from sphingolipids. Also if higher glucose levels correlate with higher TAG levels, are TAGs simply an indirect measure of glucose or Is the connection more complicated?</p><p>6) The authors state that &quot;samples were randomly divided into 80% as training set for model building and 20% as hold-out testing set for prediction validation. &quot; This is an accepted approach to assess the performance of a prediction model. However, with a single divide, the conclusion might be unduly affected by random variability. The cross-validation approach can be used to better assess the prediction performance across random splittings.</p><p>7) It is important that the authors provide some context about the value of the increased predictive performance that comes with the lipid signature. In other words, do the data support applying a broad lipidomic method like the Metabolon platform, a focused lipid signature, or some other combination of predictive markers to assess risk, given that the conventional FPG and 2hPG seem to do a good job of prediction already?</p><p>8) Although definitive mechanistic explanations for these associations are beyond the scope of the current paper, some speculation would help the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59153.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the choice of cohorts, is unclear how the authors matched 171 women with incident T2D to 179 controls.

We have now performed the analysis with 171 incident T2D vs. 171 controls and found that the significant lipids are the same as that we obtained in the original analysis (with 171 incident T2D vs. 179 controls). We agree with the reviewer/editor, even though we tried to pair match case and control groups on age, race and BMI, it is not a strict 1 vs. 1 perfect match. We have revised the wording (change “pair match” to “versus”) in the manuscript to be more precise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There needs to be a more informative way to communicate how long the patients were followed after pregnancy than &quot;up to 8 years.&quot; Perhaps the authors can indicate from the cohort analyzed by lipidomics how many patients were followed for 1, 2, 3 etc years, because this could influence the interpretation of the incidence of T2DM. The authors should also confirm that the total years of follow-up were similar between the cases and controls in this cohort.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not communicating some of the details of the SWIFT analysis clearly. For both case and control groups, the total years of follow-up were similar. All research participants underwent 2-h 75-g OGTTs and other assessments at baseline and thereafter annually for 2 years and subsequent medical diagnoses of diabetes was retrieved from electronic medical records for 8 years post-baseline. Specifically, all participants attended three in-person clinics (2h 75g OGTT and other clinical assessments) at baseline, 1-year and 2 years post-baseline. After 2 years post-baseline, for the cases, subjects were followed until they were diagnosed as T2D, specifically from electronic medical records available. For control subjects, all the patients were followed for 8 years. We added this point in the Results (subsection “Clinical characterization of the participants at baseline”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There also needs to be more detail about the lipidomic method, beyond that it was performed by a company. For example, are any of these lipids subjected to formal quantitation or are these all relative values? How was normalization performed? If the abundance of each species was normalized to a total lipid content, then the apparent reduction of some phospholipids may be an artifact of the elevated TAGs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We have now added more details with regard to the lipidomics method in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Lipidomics assay”). The assay uses deuterated internal standards and the concentrations of individual lipid species are provided. The units for the lipids concentration are in μM units. Before we subjected the data into analysis, we performed the sample normalization (normalized each value within the sample to the total value of the sample) to allow general-purpose adjustment for differences among the samples. These will not affect the proportion of each lipid in each sample and the statistical analysis between samples (case vs. control group). We didn’t normalize each lipid to the total lipid content and we have carefully revised the Materials and methods part to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Furthermore, although the authors outlined in the Introduction that there have been a number of different lipidomics studies in diabetes, it is less clear whether there was convergence on a set of lipids among these different studies. Can you summarize? If every study lands on different lipids, that could indicate that 1) the underlying biology is different among cohorts with different inherent risks; 2) technical differences in the mass spectrometry; or 3) study design. Some discussion about these issues would improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and agree that the message could be clarified here. As suggested, we have now summarized the findings from different lipidomics studies in diabetes in the Introduction section (second paragraph). In all of these studies, a positive association of TAG/DAG and T2D risk was consistently observed. However, a convergence on specific lipids were not evident. This could be due to the differences in study design, cohort background and methodology including, importantly, limitations in coverage – expressed lipids in each study were not consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5 should include the glucose pathway. From the data, the obvious implication is that higher glucose levels lead to higher G3P levels which shift palmitoyl-CoA (and other fatty acid CoAs) to TAGs and away from sphingolipids. Also if higher glucose levels correlate with higher TAG levels, are TAGs simply an indirect measure of glucose or Is the connection more complicated?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for these insightful comments. We fully agree with this interpretation and have now revised the figure by adding glucose into the pathway. We have also added pertinent points in the Discussion addressing this view (fifth paragraph). Although glucose levels could correlate with TAG levels, our correlation analysis with coefficient r values revealed that the correlation level was weak. The connection between these two factors is likely more complicated. Increased TAG along with decreased phospholipids and sphingolipids represented a profound lipid dysmetabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors state that &quot;samples were randomly divided into 80% as training set for model building and 20% as hold-out testing set for prediction validation. &quot; This is an accepted approach to assess the performance of a prediction model. However, with a single divide, the conclusion might be unduly affected by random variability. The cross-validation approach can be used to better assess the prediction performance across random splittings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this is an important point. Based on the reviewer’s comment, we have now redone the prediction analysis with cross-validation used to assess the performance. We have revised Figure 6B and related parts in the Results and Materials and methods section (subsections “Selective lipids can predict future diabetes and complement clinical diagnostics” and “Data Analyses”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is important that the authors provide some context about the value of the increased predictive performance that comes with the lipid signature. In other words, do the data support applying a broad lipidomic method like the Metabolon platform, a focused lipid signature, or some other combination of predictive markers to assess risk, given that the conventional FPG and 2hPG seem to do a good job of prediction already?</p></disp-quote><p>These are very insightful comments and important for the translatability of this study with respect to assessing risk of T2D in women with a history of GDM. To provide some context, the lipids show higher AUC than FPG or 2hPG alone. Adding lipids to FPG improved the AUC from 0.703 to 0.795. Adding lipids to 2hPG improved the AUC from 0.704 to 0.809. This clearly show that the lipids significantly increase the predictive performance of the classic measurements. We agree with the reviewer, the combination of FPG and 2hPG can achieve prediction power AUC 0.775, the adding of lipids did increase the performance to AUC0.842 (Figure 6—source data 1). Based on our data, we would envision that adding a specific lipidomic signature to existing clinical parameters for testing, perhaps including other metabolites (i.e. biogenic amines and amino acids) will provide a more accurate assessment of future T2D risk. We have now discussed in the Discussion section (last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Although definitive mechanistic explanations for these associations are beyond the scope of the current paper, some speculation would help the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We have revised the Discussion section as the reviewer suggested. Specifically, we speculated the potential mechanism of increased serum TAG level through lipogenesis activated by high serum sugar level (Discussion, second paragraph). We have also discussed the mechanism of the pathway alteration in glucose, TAG, phospholipids and sphingolipids as the reviewer suggested. In short, we speculated that phospholipids (through DAG) and TAGs shared the same precursor glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the higher G3P induced by higher plasma glucose levels could shift the Fatty acid-CoA to lipogenesis from sphingolipids and phospholipids pathways (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
