proteolytic production of secreted 38-to-43-residue amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) by the PSEN1-containing γ-secretase complex, ostensibly supporting the amyloid hypothesis of pathogenesis. However, proteolysis of APP substrate by γ-secretase is processive, involving initial endoproteolysis to produce long Aβ peptides of 48 or 49 residues followed by carboxypeptidase trimming in mostly tripeptide increments. We recently reported evidence that FAD mutations in APP and PSEN1 cause deficiencies in early steps in processive proteolysis of APP substrate C99 and that this results from stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes. These stalled complexes triggered synaptic degeneration in a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model of FAD independently of Aβ production. Here, we conducted full quantitative analysis of all proteolytic events on APP substrate by γ-secretase with six additional PSEN1 FAD mutations and found that all six are deficient in multiple processing steps. However, only one of these (F386S) was deficient in certain trimming steps but not in endoproteolysis. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in intact cells revealed that all six PSEN1 FAD mutations lead to stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate/intermediate complexes. The F386S mutation, however, does so only in Aβ-rich regions of the cells, not in C99-rich regions, consistent with the deficiencies of this mutant enzyme only in trimming of Aβ intermediates. These findings provide further evidence that FAD mutations lead to stalled and stabilized γ-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes and are consistent with the stalled process rather than the products of γ-secretase proteolysis as the pathogenic trigger.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteolysis</kwd><kwd>secretase</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>fluorescence microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG66986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolfe</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG79569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolfe</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Further evidence in support of a new amyloid-independent hypothesis for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is provided, with an expanded set of Alzheimer-causing mutations in the protease that produces amyloid.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a significant challenge to global public health as aging populations worldwide face its profound impact on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. The urgent need for accessible and effective disease-modifying therapies underscores the critical importance of unraveling the underlying mechanisms of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2022</xref>). For over three decades, the amyloid cascade hypothesis has been central in AD research, positing that aggregation of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ), particularly the 42-residue variant (Aβ42), initiates a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selkoe and Hardy, 2016</xref>). This hypothesis emerged with the discovery of dominant missense mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) that alter Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hardy and Allsop, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Selkoe, 1991</xref>).</p><p>The subsequent discovery of FAD mutations in presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and presenilin-2 (PSEN2), catalytic components of γ-secretase complexes responsible for Aβ production from APP C-terminal fragment C99, further reinforced the amyloid hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selkoe and Hardy, 2016</xref>). These mutations generally increase the ratio of aggregation-prone Aβ42 to more soluble Aβ40. However, the processing of Aβ is complex, involving multiple cleavages of the APP transmembrane domain (TMD) by the membrane-embedded γ-secretase complex, resulting in Aβ peptides through two distinct pathways: C99→Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and C99→Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takami et al., 2009</xref>). Despite these advances, uncertainties persist regarding the assembly states of neurotoxic Aβ species and their roles in AD pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benilova et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, clinical trials targeting Aβ or its aggregates have shown only modest efficacy, prompting a reevaluation of Aβ as the primary driver of the disease process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kepp et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD)-mutant PSEN1 on endoproteolysis of C99 by γ-secretase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of proteolytic cleavage of APP substrate by γ-secretase via two pathways.

The monogenic nature of FAD, driven by APP or presenilin mutations, provides a clearer path to elucidating pathogenic mechanisms. FAD mutations in the APP TMD disrupt γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis: Our comprehensive analysis of effects on each proteolytic step for 14 such mutations demonstrated that the first and/or second carboxypeptidase trimming step was deficient in every case, elevating levels of Aβ peptides of 45 residues and longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devkota et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, we found that six PSEN1 FAD-mutant γ-secretase complexes show reduced processive proteolytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>). These PSEN1 mutations were all deficient in the initial endoproteolytic (ε) cleavage of C99 that generates Aβ48 or Aβ49 and the corresponding APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts, in addition to being deficient in one or more Aβ intermediate trimming steps. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> models of FAD, deficient processive proteolysis by FAD mutations was linked to stalled/stabilized γ-secretase enzyme-substrate (E-S) complexes that triggered age-dependent synaptic degeneration independently of Aβ production.</p><p>In the present study, we have expanded the comprehensive analysis of processive proteolysis of C99 by γ-secretase to include six additional PSEN1 mutations (S169L, S170F, G378E, F386S, A431E, A434T). Each proteolytic step was quantified by MS, and interactions between substrate C99 or intermediate Aβs and γ-secretase were measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The results demonstrated that all six FAD PSEN1 mutations lead to reduction of multiple proteolytic steps while increasing the stability of E-S and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes, findings consistent with our ‘stalled complex’ hypothesis of AD pathogenesis. Three mutations displayed unusual profiles of effects on Aβ production that have novel implications for this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FAD-mutant PSEN1 reduces processive proteolysis of C99 by γ-secretase</title><p>Six DNA constructs, each encoding an FAD-mutant γ-secretase, were generated, with all PSEN1 mutations corresponding to those under study by the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN). The selected mutations were S169L, S170F, G378E, F386S, A431E, A434T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). PSEN1 mutations S169L and S170F are in transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3), near the hinge region with TMD2. Mutations G378E and F386S are situated in TMD7, close to the catalytic aspartate residue D385 in the conserved GxGD motif. Mutations A431E and A434T are found in a highly conserved region that includes the PALP motif, which is essential for enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tomita et al., 2001</xref>). The age of onset for these mutations varies as follows: S169L (29–31 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taddei et al., 1998</xref>), S170F (mean 27 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Snider et al., 2005</xref>), G378E (38–44 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lanoiselée et al., 2017</xref>), F386S (37–58 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raux et al., 2005</xref>), A431E (mean 43 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dumois-Petersen et al., 2020</xref>), and A434T (35 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiao et al., 2014</xref>). Monocistronic pMLINK plasmids encoding human PSEN1, each harboring one of these mutations, were individually prepared via mutagenesis of the wild-type (WT) construct. Each mutant PSEN1 DNA insert was cut out with restriction enzymes from this monocistronic plasmid and inserted into a tricistronic construct encoding the other three components of the γ-secretase complex (nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2) through ligation-independent cloning (LIC). The resulting tetracistronic constructs encode all four components of the protease complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The tetracistronic constructs, each encoding either WT or one of the six FAD-mutant forms of the γ-secretase complex, were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK)293F cells, and the expressed protease complexes were subsequently purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devkota et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>). Concurrently, two versions of the recombinant FLAG epitope-tagged version of C99 substrate (C100-Flag) were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>: one in normal media, and the other in M9 minimal media containing <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and <sup>13</sup>C-glucose as the sole sources of nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Purification provides light and heavy isotope-labeled C100-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Enzyme purity was verified by western blot analysis, which demonstrated the presence of all four components of γ-secretase, with PSEN1 autoproteolyzed into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF), indicative of maturation of the complex to the catalytically active protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, the quality of the substrates was assessed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Each purified mutant protease (30 nM) was incubated with saturating levels of the heavy-isotope-labeled substrate (5 µM) at 37°C for 16 hr. In parallel, the WT enzyme was incubated with light-isotope-labeled C100-Flag substrate. Due to the slow rate for this reaction (WT enzyme k<sub>cat</sub> = 2 hr<sup>–1</sup>), this long incubation period is still within the linear range for the formation of products (i.e. the enzyme remains saturated with substrate throughout the incubation period) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devkota et al., 2021</xref>). The resulting products for all proteolytic events for each of these samples were then analyzed using MS techniques as described below. Due to the hydrophobicity and insolubility of the Aβ products, quantification by direct MS posed significant challenges. Consequently, we focused on analysis of the coproducts (AICDs and small peptides) and indirectly calculation of the concentration of the Aβ products.</p><p>Rates for the initial endoproteolytic step (ε cleavage) were determined by quantifying AICD species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) using MALDI-TOF MS. We utilized synthetic AICD 50–99-Flag and AICD 49–99-Flag peptides to construct standard concentration curves by MALDI-TOF MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This approach enabled accurate measurements of the production of AICD 50–99 (coproduct of Aβ49) and AICD 49–99 (coproduct of Aβ48) for both WT and mutant enzymes. For all standards and experimental samples, equal concentrations of insulin were added as an internal standard. The standard curves were generated based on the intensity ratio of the AICD parent ion to that of the internal standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Using these standard curves, we calculated concentrations of AICD species in our test samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Equal concentrations of both AICD 50–99 and AICD 49–99 were produced when comparing WT protease incubated with light-isotope C100 to WT protease incubated with heavy-isotope C100. This demonstrates that use of heavy C100 does not affect the concentrations of products formed during the ε cleavage step. Quantification of AICD species was possible for four mutant proteases but not for A431E and A434T, as product concentrations from these two mutant enzymes were below the detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with the known essential role of the PALP motif in proteolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tomita et al., 2001</xref>). All FAD-mutant PSEN1-containing enzymes except for F386S exhibited a significant reduction in the production of both AICD 50–99 and AICD 49–99, which also measures formation of coproducts Aβ49 and Aβ48, respectively. Reduced ε cleavage of APP and Notch substrate has been observed with other PSEN1 FAD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentahir et al., 2006</xref>). Uniquely, the PSEN1 F386S mutant protease resulted in a significant increase in production of AICD 49–99 and similar levels of AICD 50–99 compared to those observed with WT protease. Three other mutant enzymes (S169L, G378E, and F386S) likewise biased ε cleavage toward AICD 49–99, thereby favoring the Aβ48 → Aβ42 pathway, consistent with previous reports on PSEN1 FAD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sato et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Equal volumes of WT enzyme incubated with light-isotope C100 and PSEN1 FAD-mutant enzymes incubated separately with heavy-isotope C100 were combined in a 1:1 ratio after quenching the reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The 1:1 mixtures were then used to quantify the coproducts of the trimming steps along the two canonical pathways Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42 →Aβ38 via liquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devkota et al., 2021</xref>), as we previously described for six other FAD-mutant enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>). Mixing of the enzyme reactions after quenching but before analysis allows quantification of each small peptide coproduct formed from WT enzyme and mutant enzyme in the same LC-MS/MS run: Products from WT enzyme incubated with light-isotope C100 have lower mass than products from mutant enzyme incubated with heavy-isotope C100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Standard curves were generated for the tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts of each trimming step, using synthetic ITL, VIV, IAT, VIT, TVI, and VVIA peptides, allowing accurate determination of the concentrations of each coproduct generated from all WT and PSEN1 FAD-mutant enzyme reaction mixtures. Equal concentrations of each tri- and tetrapeptide were produced when comparing WT protease incubated with light-isotope C100 to WT protease incubated with heavy-isotope C100, demonstrating that the use of heavy-isotope C100 does not affect the concentrations of products formed during these cleavage steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Alzheimer-mutant PSEN-1 affects the processive proteolysis of C99 by γ-secretase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the reaction mixtures and their preparation, analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the detection of tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts.

Mutations located within or near the conserved PALP motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tomita et al., 2001</xref>), A431E and A434T, exhibited significantly lower levels of trimming coproducts compared to WT and other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although AICD levels from A431E and A434T PSEN1 mutant proteases were below those of the lowest standards, very low levels of certain small peptide coproducts were detected within the range of their standard curves. In strong contrast, F386S PSEN1 mutant enzyme produced equal levels of ITL (coproduct of Aβ49→Aβ46) and VIV (coproduct of Aβ46→Aβ43) compared to WT. However, levels of IAT (coproduct of Aβ43→Aβ40) were substantially lower for this mutant enzyme, indicating a buildup of Aβ43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Along the Aβ42 pathway, F386S PSEN1 enzyme produced levels of VIT (coproduct of Aβ48→Aβ45) only slightly lower than WT enzyme; however, because F386S generated increased levels of AICD 49–99 (coproduct of C99→Aβ48), this mutant also led to a buildup Aβ48. For mutants S169L, S170F, and G378E, small peptide coproducts were generally lower than those generated from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with their reduced initial ε proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Quantification of all coproducts (AICDs, small peptides) using MS techniques enabled calculation of the percent cleavage for each trimming step in the processive proteolysis of APP by γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). That is, given the level of Aβ precursor produced, how much of this precursor was cleaved in the next step? This analysis revealed that none of the mutant enzymes exhibited deficiencies in the Aβ49→Aβ46 or Aβ46→Aβ43 cleavage steps compared to WT enzyme, although percent cleavage could not be determined for A431E and A434T, as these mutant enzymes produced coproducts AICD 50–99 and ITL below the limits of detection. The S169L and F386S mutations demonstrated significant changes in the Aβ43→Aβ40 step, with S169L showing a marked increase and F386S showing a decrease compared to WT. All mutations were deficient in the Aβ48→Aβ45 cleavage step, except for S170F, which exhibited an increase in this trimming step. It should be pointed out, however, that this increased percent efficiency of S170F—over 200%—is not possible, suggesting either under-detection of AICD 49–99 (production of Aβ48) or over-detection of VIT (degradation of Aβ48) for this mutant enzyme. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. All mutations except for S169L and A434T were also deficient in the Aβ45→Aβ42 trimming step. Furthermore, all mutations were deficient in the Aβ42 →Aβ38 cleavage process, except for S169L and A431E, which showed increases compared to WT enzyme. We should point out, however, that detected products from A431E and A434T were very low and therefore likely making calculations of percent cleavage unreliable. This detailed analysis highlights specific deficiencies and alterations in the cleavage patterns associated with each mutation, providing a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of how these mutations affect the proteolytic processing of APP by γ-secretase. Overall, calculation of percent efficiency for each trimming step, along with analysis of effects on initial ε cleavage, revealed that all PSEN1 FAD-mutant proteases are deficient in multiple cleavage steps in processive proteolysis of APP substrate, consistent with the previous findings for the other six PSEN1 FAD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>By analyzing the extent of degradation and production of each Aβ peptide, we were able to calculate the levels of each Aβ peptide in the final quenched enzyme reaction mixtures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We observed a negative value for the concentration of Aβ48 produced from the S170F enzyme, due to the discrepancy pointed out above in quantifying the coproducts of Aβ48 production and degradation. To validate the calculated concentrations of Aβ peptides obtained by LC-MS/MS, we used Aβ40- and Aβ42-specific ELISAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The ELISA results were consistent with the calculations from the LC-MS/MS data for all mutations except for F386S. This mutation exhibited higher concentrations of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 when measured by ELISA compared to the calculations derived from MS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A vs. B</xref>). Because the PSEN1 F386S mutant enzyme produced high levels of Aβ43 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2023</xref>), we tested for cross-reactivity in the ELISAs with synthetic Aβ43 peptide. We found that the putatively Aβ42- and Aβ40-specific ELISAs both cross-reacted with Aβ43 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which can explain the observed discrepancies with F386S enzyme. According to the ELISA results, all six PSEN1 FAD-mutant enzymes produced lower levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 compared to WT, consistent with our previous findings with six other PSEN1 FAD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>). Mutants S169L, G378E, and F386S showed an increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio by both ELISA and LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, Aβ42/Aβ40 produced from the S170F mutant enzyme was equivalent to that of WT by both methods. Mutants A431E and A434T appear to increase Aβ42/Aβ40 by LC-MS/MS; however, these two FAD-mutant enzymes produce such low levels of peptide coproducts that the calculated ratio is not reliable. By ELISA, only Aβ42 was detectable from A431E and A434T mutant enzymes, precluding calculation of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) vs. ELISA.</title><p>Final Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations upon incubation of purified γ-secretase with C100-Flag and the resulting Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios assessed by (<bold>A</bold>) ELISAs and (<bold>B</bold>) LC-MS/MS calculations. n=4; error bars represent s.d.; unpaired two-tailed t-tests comparing familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD)-mutant to wild-type (WT) enzyme reactions (*p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, ***p≤0.001).

Although the PSEN1 F386S mutant did not show an overall fluorescence lifetime reduction compared to WT, when differentiating C99-rich regions vs. Aβ-rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), fluorescence lifetime was significantly reduced in Aβ-rich regions and not C99-rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E vs. F</xref>).

We should point out that the observed decrease in donor lifetime with the PSEN1 FAD mutants might also be due to lower levels of C99-720 expression or higher levels of PSEN1 CTF (i.e. mature γ-secretase complexes). However, C99-720 intensities are not significantly different between cells transfected with WT and those with FAD PSEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, western blot analysis shows that levels of C99-720 are not significantly low and those of PSEN1 CTF are not high in FAD PSEN1 compared to WT PSEN1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Although PSEN1 CTF levels trend low for PSEN1 F386S, this mutant resulted in decreased FLIM only in Aβ-rich regions. Thus, the reduced Alexa 488 fluorescence lifetime apparently reflects effects of FAD mutation on E-S complex stability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The persistent challenge of developing effective therapeutics for AD continues to spark contentious debates within the biomedical research community on the identity of pathogenic triggers. The ‘amyloid cascade hypothesis,’ long a central focus in AD research, has faced significant scrutiny, particularly due to its failure to consistently correlate brain amyloid plaque burden with cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrup, 2015</xref>). Difficulties in pinpointing disease drivers of AD and in discovering effective therapeutics suggest that entities and processes beyond Aβ might play pivotal roles in initiating neurodegeneration. Focusing on FAD could simplify identification of pathogenic mechanisms, as these rare variants of AD are caused by dominant missense mutations in the substrate and enzyme that produce Aβ. This targeted approach may provide clearer insights into the molecular underpinnings of AD and facilitate the development of more effective treatments.</p><p>In this study, we focused on six FAD PSEN1 mutations that are among those under investigation by the DIAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Storandt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McKay et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schultz et al., 2024</xref>), conducting a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of processive proteolysis of APP substrate C99 by γ-secretase. Our analysis revealed that five of the six mutations resulted in substantial deficiencies in the initial cleavage event (ε cleavage), consistent with our previously reported findings for six other FAD PSEN1 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>). The exception was the F386S mutation, which was deficient in several trimming steps (Aβ43→Aβ40, Aβ48→Aβ45, Aβ45→Aβ42, and Aβ42→Aβ38) but not in ε cleavage. This was surprising, because this mutation is immediately adjacent to one of the two catalytic aspartate residues (D385) and was expected to decrease ε cleavage.</p><p>To further explore the impact of these mutations, we employed FLIM. Stabilization of FAD-mutant E-S complexes while stalled in their proteolytic activities was supported by reduced fluorescence lifetimes of labeled antibody probe combinations targeting the E-S complexes. Based on our FLIM studies, all six FAD PSEN1 mutations tested showed stabilized E-S complexes. Five of these mutations stabilized overall γ-secretase E-S interactions, while the F386S mutant stabilized only γ-secretase/Aβ and not γ-secretase/C99 interactions. Together, FLIM data and comprehensive analysis of all cleavage steps involved in the processive proteolysis of APP substrate by γ-secretase revealed that each of these mutations is deficient in multiple cleavage events due to stalled and stabilized E-S complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) mutations lead to stalled processive proteolysis of APP substrate by γ-secretase.</title><p>PSEN1 FAD-mutant γ-secretase complexes are deficient in specific cleavage steps. Enzyme-substrate/intermediate complexes are stalled at these stages.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102274-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Among the six mutants, the FAD S169L mutant was the second least deficient in ε cleavage, as demonstrated by quantification of AICDs using MALDI-TOF. Similarly, FLIM studies indicated this mutation results in the smallest decrease in overall fluorescence lifetime after F386S, suggesting a small but still significant increase in stabilization of overall E-S complexes. According to recent reports by Guo et al., and Odorčić et al. of cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of γ-secretase bound to C99 and Aβ intermediates, S169 is a key residue involved in processive proteolysis. These two groups suggested that FAD mutants destabilize E-S complexes, specifically mentioning the loss of an H-bonding interaction with S169 mutants as the rationale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Odorčić et al., 2024</xref>). However, static structures such as those captured by cryoEM cannot account for dynamic changes in protein conformation, such as the decreased E-S complex flexibility we observed for FAD mutations by molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The PSEN1 A431E and A434T FAD-mutant enzymes exhibited the most pronounced deficiencies in all cleavage events compared to WT. These mutations are located within or near the highly conserved PALP motif, which plays a critical role in the active site conformation and catalytic activity of γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tomita et al., 2001</xref>). This motif is essential for the recognition of APP substrate by γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). The C-terminal PALP motif and the rest of PSEN1 TMD9 are also integral to the formation of the catalytic pore of the protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, the observed deficiencies in A431E and A434T can be attributed to the disruption of these crucial structural and functional elements. Nevertheless, our FLIM results suggest these FAD-mutant proteases can still interact with C99 and form stable E-S complexes. In this context, it should be noted that no FAD-mutant enzyme is completely deficient in proteolytic activity; substrate interaction with the mutant protease is apparently critical to pathogenesis. Consistent with this idea, true loss of function of γ-secretase—due to dominant mutations in PSEN1 and other components of the protease complex that lead to nonsense-mediated decay (i.e. haploinsufficiency)—cause a hereditary skin disease, not neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While an elevated Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is commonly cited as a hallmark of FAD mutations, our results show that S170F did not lead to an increase in this ratio. This finding is consistent with a previous study, which analyzed Aβ40 and Aβ42 production from 138 FAD PSEN1 mutations using purified γ-secretase and APP substrate, which revealed that many FAD mutations do not elevate Aβ42/Aβ40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Among those mutations that do increase the ratio, the effect is primarily due to a reduction in Aβ40 production, with some mutations resulting in minimal production of both Aβ variants.</p><p>The findings reported herein are consistent with our working hypothesis that FAD mutations lead to stalled γ-secretase E-S complexes that contribute to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These stalled complexes—observed in FAD regardless of the specific deficient cleavage steps of the mutation—can trigger synaptic loss in vivo, even in the absence of Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devkota et al., 2024</xref>). The ‘stalled complex hypothesis’ posits that stabilized E-S complexes, even in the absence of Aβ42 or any other proteolytic product, can initiate pathogenesis. In this context, γ-secretase activators that rescue stalled E-S complexes offer a promising therapeutic strategy by potentially rescuing deficient proteolytic function and thereby reducing levels of stalled E-S complexes, without over-activating cleavage of other substrates (which are limited by prior rate-determining ectodomain shedding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolfe, 2024</xref>). Such activators would be distinct from γ-secretase modulators, which selectively reduce Aβ42 levels by stimulating Aβ42→Aβ38. This approach may complement therapies targeting tau aggregation, lipid metabolism, and other Alzheimer-associated pathways, potentially synergizing with emerging drug candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cummings et al., 2023</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>While detailed and quantitative studies of the impact of FAD mutations on all proteolytic stages of γ-secretase processing of C99 have been carried out here, these experiments utilized purified enzymes and substrates in a detergent-solubilized system. This system differs significantly from the cell membrane environment, which is characterized by complex lipid and protein compositions and dynamic microdomains that can affect protein folding, stability, and function. Therefore, the effects of these mutations on γ-secretase processing of C99 may vary considerably when studied in detergent-solubilized systems compared to their natural membrane environment. However, we previously noted that detergent-solubilized and reconstituted proteoliposome systems give similar ratios of AICD 49–99/AICD 50–99 and Aβ42/Aβ40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devkota et al., 2021</xref>). While using MALDI-TOF instead of western blotting provided more accurate quantification of AICDs, we encountered challenges with lower concentrations of AICDs produced by mutations such as A431E and A434T. The concentrations of AICDs in these mostly deficient mutations fell below the detection limit of our instrument, limiting our ability to assess their levels accurately. In addition, FLIM studies relied on overexpression of PSEN1 and C99-720, which could lead to artifacts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse anti-Flag M2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

HEK293 cells with PSEN1/2 double knockout by CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), a gift of Dr. Lei Liu (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA), were used for transfection and FLIM.

This plasmid contains genetic codes for all four components of γ-secretase: nicastrin (NCT), presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen2), anterior pharynx-defective 1 (Aph1), and presenilin-1 (PSEN1). To overcome this challenge, we developed a step-by-step LIC method in <italic>E. coli</italic>, combined with restriction digestion of both the insert and vector, which allowed for the successful insertion of mutations. Four monocistronic pMLINK vectors were generated following established methods: pMLINK-PSEN1, pMLINK-Aph1 (bearing a C-terminal HA epitope tag), pMLINK-NCT (with C-terminal V5 and 6XHIS epitope tags), and pMLINK-Pen-2 (featuring N-terminal STREP and FLAG epitope tags) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Each vector contains LINK1 and LINK2 sequences flanking the gene of interest. LINK1 includes a PacI restriction site, while LINK2 contains both PacI and SwaI restriction sites. To create a tricistronic plasmid containing genetic codes for NCT, Pen2, and Aph1, we employed a two-step process. First, we used LIC in <italic>E. coli</italic> to combine NCT and Pen2 through restriction digestion, forming a bicistronic plasmid. The pMLINK-Pen-2 and pMLINK-NCT vectors were treated with restriction enzymes PacI and SwaI, respectively. Both fragments were then electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel to separate and purify the Pen2 DNA and to linearize and isolate the NCT vector. The Pen2 fragment and the linearized pMLINK-NCT vector were treated with T4 polymerase for 20 min at ambient temperature in the presence of dCTP or dGTP, respectively. The purified T4 polymerase-treated Pen2 fragment was inserted into the purified linearized pMLINK-NCT by LIC to create a bicistronic pMLINK-NCT-Pen-2 vector. Subsequently, we further modified the bicistronic plasmid by including Aph1 through another round of restriction digestion and LIC in <italic>E. coli</italic>, resulting in a tricistronic plasmid. Finally, to create a mutated tetra-cistronic plasmid, we performed multi-site-directed mutagenesis on the PSEN1 and inserted this monocistronic construct into the tricistronic plasmid through additional rounds of restriction digestion and LIC in <italic>E. coli</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for illustration).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>γ-Secretase expression and purification</title><p>γ-Secretase was produced and purified from Expi293F cells as described in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolduc et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fraering et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Osenkowski et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, Expi293F cells were grown in Expi293 expression medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin until they reached a density of 3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Before transfection, the medium was exchanged for fresh Expi293 expression medium (without penicillin-streptomycin). For the transfection process, 100 µg of the pMLINK tetracistronic vector and 320 µL of ExpiFectamine 293 Reagent were mixed in 12 mL of Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The resulting ExpiFectamine 293/plasmid DNA complexes were then added to the cell culture. After 20 hr, ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Enhancer 1 and Enhancer 2 were added, and the cells were cultured until their viability dropped to 75%.

This is important because APP processing can result in the production of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ), a key pathologic protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ exists in various forms that differ in amino acid sequence and assembly state. The predominant forms of Aβ are Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are 40 and 42 amino acids in length, respectively. Shorter and longer forms derive from processive proteolysis of the Aβ region of APP by the heterotetramer β-secretase, within which presenilin 1 possesses the active site of the enzyme. Each form may become toxic if it assembles into non-natively folded, oligomeric, or fibrillar structures. A deep mechanistic understanding of enzyme-substrate interactions is a first step toward the design and successful use of small-molecule therapeutics for AD.</p><p>The key finding of Arafi et al. is that PSEN1 amino acid sequence is a major determinant of enzyme turnover number and the diversity of products. For the biochemist, this may not be surprising, but in the context of understanding and treating AD, it is immense because it shifts the paradigm from targeting the results of γ-secretase action, viz., Aβ oligomers and fibrils, to targeting initial Aβ production at the molecular level. It is the equivalent of taking cancer treatment from simple removal of tumorous tissue to the prevention of tumor formation and growth. Arafi et al. have provided us with a blueprint for the design of small-molecule inhibitors of γ-secretase. The significance of this achievement cannot be overstated.</p><p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p><p>The comprehensiveness and rigor of the study are notable. Rarely have I reviewed a manuscript reporting results of so many orthogonal experiments, all of which support the authors' hypotheses, and of so many excellent controls. In addition, as found in clinical trial reports, the limitations of the study were discussed explicitly. None of these significantly affected the conclusions of the study.</p><p>Some minor concerns were expressed during the review process. The authors have revised the manuscript, and in doing so, dealt appropriately with the concerns and strengthened the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102274.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The work by Arafi et al. show the effect of Familial Alzheimer's Disease presenilin-1 mutants on endoproteinase and carboxylase activity.

Together with FLIM experiments, this study provides additional evidence to support their 'stalled complex hypotheses'….This is a beautiful biochemical work. The approach is comprehensive.”</p><p>Below we respond to the relatively minor concerns of Reviewer 2, which may be included with the first version of the Reviewed Preprint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>(1) It appears that the purified γ-secretase complex generates the same amount of Aβ40 and Aβ42, which is quite different in cellular and biochemical studies. Is there any explanation for this?</p></disp-quote><p>Roughly equal production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 is a phenomenon seen with purified enzyme assays, and the reason for this has not been identified. However, we suggest that what is meaningful in our studies is the relative difference between the effects of FAD-mutant vs. WT PSEN1 on each proteolytic processing step. All FAD mutations are deficient in multiple cleavage steps in γsecretase processing of APP substrate, and these deficiencies correlate with stabilization of E-S complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It has been reported the Aβ production lines from Aβ49 and Aβ48 can be crossed with various combinations (PMID: 23291095 and PMID: 38843321). How does the production line crossing impact the interpretation of this work?</p></disp-quote><p>In the cited reports, such crossover was observed when using synthetic Aβ intermediates as substrate. In PMID 2391095 (Okochi M et al, Cell Rep, 2013), Aβ43 is primarily converted to Aβ40, but also to some extent to Aβ38. In PMID: 38843321 (Guo X et al, Science, 2024), Aβ48 is ultimately converted to Aβ42, but also to a minor degree to Aβ40. We have likewise reported such product line “crossover” with synthetic Aβ intermediates (PMID: 25239621; Fernandez MA et al, JBC, 2014). However, when using APP C99-based substrate, we did not detect any noncanonical tri- and tetrapeptide co-products of Aβ trimming events in the LC-MS/MS analyses (PMID: 33450230; Devkota S et al, JBC, 2021). In the original report on identification of the small peptide coproducts for C99 processing by γ-secretase using LC-MS/MS (PMID: 19828817; Takami M et al, J Neurosci, 2009), only very low levels of noncanonical peptides were observed. In the present study, we did not search for such noncanonical trimming coproducts, so we cannot rule out some degree of product line crossover.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 5, did the authors look at the protein levels of PS1 mutations and C99-720, as well as secreted Aβ species? Do the different amounts of PS1 full-length and PS1-NTF/CTF influence FILM results?</p></disp-quote><p>FLIM results depend on the degree that C99 and long Aβ intermediates are bound to γ-secretase compared to unbound C99 and Aβ. The 6E10-Alexa 488 lifetime is significantly decreased by FAD mutations compared to WT PSEN1 (Fig. 5). However, the observed decrease in lifetime with the PSEN1 FAD mutants might also be due to lower levels of C99-720 expression or higher levels of PSEN1 CTF (i.e., mature γ-secretase complexes). We checked the C99-720 fluorescence intensities in the FLIM experiments and found that C99-720 intensities are not significantly different between cells transfected with WT and those with FAD PSEN1. Furthermore, Western blot analysis shows that levels of C99-720 are not significantly low and those of PSEN1 CTF are not high in FAD PSEN1 compared to WT PSEN1 expressing cells. Although PSEN1 CTF levels trend low for PSEN1 F386S, this mutant resulted in decreased FLIM only in Aβ-rich regions. Thus, the reduced FLIM apparently reflects effects of FAD mutation on E-S complex stability. Levels of full-length PSEN1 were also determined and found not to correlated with FLIM effects, although full-length PSEN1 represents protein not incorporated into full active γ-secretase complexes and therefore does not interact with C99-720.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is interesting that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 Elisa kits detect Aβ43. Have the authors tested other kits in the market? It might change the interpretation of some published work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested other ELISA kits. Considering our findings, it would be a good idea for other investigators to test whatever ELISAs they use for specificity vis-à-vis Aβ43.</p></body></sub-article></article>
