Despite the widespread use and potential utility of these GEVIs, the biophysical underpinnings of the relationship between VSD movement and fluorophore response remain unclear. We investigated the recently developed GEVI ArcLight, and its close variant Arclight', at both the single-molecule and macroscopic levels to better understand their characteristics and mechanisms of activity. These studies revealed a number of previously unobserved features of ArcLight's behavior, including millisecond-scale fluorescence fluctuations in single molecules as well as a previously unreported delay prior to macroscopic fluorescence onset. Finally, these mechanistic insights allowed us to improve the optical response of ArcLight to fast or repetitive pulses with the development of ArcLightning, a novel GEVI with improved kinetics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10482.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10482.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10482.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells, or neurons, transmit information using changes in the voltage across their cell membranes. In the brain, these neurons work together in complex networks, and so understanding how the brain processes information will require neuroscientists to analyze voltage changes in many neurons at the same time.To achieve this, scientists have developed genetically-encoded voltage indicators (or GEVIs). These commonly feature a fluorescent protein attached to a voltage-sensitive protein; when the voltage-sensitive protein moves in response to changes in electrical activity, the amount of light emitted by the fluorescent protein also changes.</p> <p>Treger, Priest and Bezanilla have now studied the characteristics of a popular GEVI called ArcLight by recording how fluorescence and voltage are related, both in single molecules and in groups of millions of molecules.This revealed that the fluorescence response of ArcLight does not occur instantly when a voltage change occurs. Instead the indicator fluoresces after a short delay. This delay corresponds with how quickly the voltage-sensitive protein responds. The fluorescence of a close relative of ArcLight also rapidly flickers, which deteriorates the signal quality.</p> <p>Using this knowledge Treger, Priest and Bezanilla engineered the voltage-sensitive protein of ArcLight to develop a new variant of the indicator, named ArcLightning. Tests revealed that ArcLightning responds much faster than ArcLight to voltage changes in neurons, although the flicker of the fluorescent protein likely remains.</p> <p>ArcLightning should prove to be a valuable tool for analyzing how neurons work together in living animals, but the flicker of the fluorescent protein suggests that there is further room for improvement. The rational design method used to develop ArcLightning could also be applied to improve other recently developed voltage indicators.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10482.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10482.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>single-molecule fluorescence</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>voltage-clamp fluorimetry</kwd><kwd>genetically encoded voltage indicator</kwd><kwd>ArcLight</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM030376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bezanilla</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM07281</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treger</surname><given-names>Jeremy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31-NS081954</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Priest</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ArcLight, a popular optogenetic reporter of voltage, is studied at both single-molecule and macroscopic levels, which leads to new mechanistic understanding and to the rational design of a faster reporter. </meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurately measuring membrane potential is crucial for understanding the activity of excitable cells. Traditionally, these measurements have been performed using various configurations of electrodes, but these can present numerous challenges such as mechanical disruption of cells and tissues and an inability to measure from many sites simultaneously with high spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salzberg, 1989</xref>). It has been found that the fluorescence of many membrane-bound organic dyes changes as a function of membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tasaki et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loew et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davila et al., 1973</xref>). Accordingly, this fluorescence can serve as an optical reporter of transmembrane voltage and render electrodes unnecessary. While this solves many problems associated with the use of electrodes, these potentiometric dyes stain cell membranes indiscriminately, leading to the labeling of glia and other tissue as well as neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Fortunately, recent advances in optogenetics have provided an alternative to these techniques through the use of genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators (GEVIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). These fluorescent proteins are expressed under the control of a desired genetic promoter and thus can be targeted to a chosen cell type. Once translated, the GEVIs are trafficked to the cell membrane where they sense changes in membrane potential and transduce this into a change in their fluorescence, thereby providing an optical readout of cellular electrical excitability. Many different designs have been employed to engineer GEVIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel and Isacoff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimitrov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kralj et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akemann et al., 2012</xref>). To date, most of these consist of a protein voltage-sensing domain (VSD) from a voltage-sensitive ion channel or phosphatase fused to one or more green fluorescent protein (GFP) derivatives. However, it remains largely unclear how movement of a VSD couples into changing fluorescence in an attached GFP, limiting the extent to which rational design can aid in the development and optimization of these GEVIs.</p><p>To help address this knowledge gap, we have conducted an extensive biophysical investigation of a voltage-sensitive phosphatase-based GEVI, ArcLight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). We chose this molecule because it is one of the most promising GEVIs developed thus far with demonstrated utility in intact brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). ArcLight is comprised of the VSD from the <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> voltage-sensor containing phosphatase (Ci-VSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2005</xref>) fused to a variant of GFP. This voltage-sensing domain is highly similar to the VSD of voltage-gated ion channels; all contain a bundle of four transmembrane helices, with the fourth segment (S4) containing positively charged amino acids that behave as the primary sensors of voltage changes. The fluorescence of Arclight changes by more than 30% in response to a 100 mV change in membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>), an extremely large voltage-sensitive change compared to most other fluorescent proteins with S4-voltage sensors.</p><p>In this work, we first demonstrate that ArcLight fluorescence responds to motion of the attached voltage sensor and then investigate the characteristics of the fluorescence of ArcLight', a close homolog of ArcLight, at the single-molecule level. Although single GEVI molecules appeared to function normally, these traces unexpectedly displayed a significant degree of noise at millisecond timescales. Further investigations into this noise revealed that ArcLight' fluorophores possess intrinsic noise due to internal dynamics of the GFP moiety even in the absence of the voltage sensor, and that this noise appears to be a general feature of many GFP constructs including eGFP. Reducing or eliminating this fluctuation noise of the fluorophore could be a novel path towards improving this class of GEVIs. Finally, we investigated the behavior of ArcLight fluorescence at the macroscopic level and used this investigation to develop a novel voltage indicator with improved characteristics. ArcLight demonstrates distinct advantages over many other genetically-encoded voltage indicators, including large signal size relative to background, relatively low spectral bandwidth requirements compared to many FRET-based sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mishina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsutsui et al., 2013</xref>), high quantum yield compared to archaerhodopsin based sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flytzanis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kralj et al., 2012</xref>), and a demonstrated success in multiple biological preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leyton-Mange et al., 2014</xref>). However, ArcLight’s ability to respond to rapid changes in membrane potential is limited by its slow kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). To date, improvements in the kinetics of ArcLight have relied on switching residues from the <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> voltage-sensing domain (Ci-VSD) to residues from analogous voltage-sensitive phosphatases found in other species, especially <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Our mechanistic investigations into the link between ArcLight voltage sensor movement and fluorescence revealed an avenue of improvement for ArcLight as a voltage indicator. Using the cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp technique, we found that ArcLight fluorescence likely monitors a protein transition subsequent to gating charge movement, but that accelerating gating kinetics using a previously-reported mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacroix and Bezanilla, 2012</xref>) can nonetheless significantly speed up the fluorescence response. We termed this fast ArcLight derivative 'ArcLightning'. As expected from the accelerated kinetics of its Ci-VSD, ArcLightning expression in mammalian cells resulted in rapid and large voltage-sensitive fluorescence changes. This work shows that mutations discovered during biophysical studies of voltage sensor behavior can be used to rationally design improved GEVIs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ArcLight fluorescence changes are caused by voltage sensor movements</title><p>Our first goal was to validate that ArcLight fluorescence changes are driven by voltage sensor conformational changes, rather than by a different mechanism. While a direct response to membrane potential is unlikely as the fluorophore does not reside in the membrane electric field, it is conceivable that, for instance, the fluorophore is responding to localized pH changes near the membrane due to voltage-driven proton fluxes across the membrane. Using the cut-open oocyte voltage-clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefani and Bezanilla, 1998</xref>) we were able to simultaneously measure the gating current of ArcLight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and its fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) from the same oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cha and Bezanilla, 1998</xref>). We then utilized the well-described mutations of the R217 residue of the Ci-VSP voltage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimitrov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Villalba-Galea et al., 2013</xref>) to shift the voltage-dependence of the voltage sensor and observe the effects on the fluorescence. In ArcLight, this residue is mutated to a glutamine (R217Q), which places the midpoint of voltage sensor response at approximately -20 mV. Returning this residue to arginine (R217R) shifts the midpoint of gating charge movement to positive potentials while replacing the glutamine with glutamate (R217E) shifts the response to even more negative potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Crucially, the fluorescence response mirrored these changes, indicating that ArcLight fluorescence signals are caused by voltage sensor movement rather than by direct influence of membrane potential or by voltage-driven ion concentration changes.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10482.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ArcLight fluorescence responds to voltage sensor movements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)  Family of gating currents from an oocyte injected with ArcLight R217Q.

To do this, we visualized voltage-dependent fluorescence from single GEVI molecules using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). This technique presented an electrophysiological challenge, as TIRFM can only be performed on an oocyte once the vitelline membrane has been removed. The bare plasma membrane of the oocyte seals to the glass coverslip producing high access resistance to the bath electrodes and, consequently, a poor voltage clamp. Using an electrochromic voltage-sensitive small molecule dye (di-8-ANEPPS), we measured the speed of the voltage clamp on the underside of a peeled oocyte placed directly on a glass coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, the clamp was very slow due to the high access resistance. To remedy this situation, we coated glass coverslips with a polymer cushion. This cushion created a larger, conductive aqueous space between the oocyte and the glass that was thin enough to allow successful TIRFM. This was found to dramatically improve voltage clamp speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This advance allowed us to successfully voltage clamp the molecules observable in TIRFM.</p><p>Having overcome this challenge, we turned our attention to observing single molecules of ArcLight' (see Methods section for details). Briefly, ArcLight' is a previously published variant of ArcLight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>) with two mutations in the GFP domain that seemed to improve its performance as a single-molecule fluorophore. Oocytes expressing low concentrations of ArcLight' had their vitelline membranes removed mechanically and were placed on polymer-coated coverslips and imaged with TIRFM. At the site of cRNA injection ArcLight' density appeared high and single molecules could typically not be resolved. However, imaging from fields further from the site of injection showed distinct, punctate sources of light consistent with small clusters and single molecules of ArcLight’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, many of these points showed clear changes in fluorescence in response to applied voltage changes, suggesting that they came from functional GEVI molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To confirm that these single-molecules were behaving normally, traces from many different fluorescent spots were summed together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); these summed traces recapitulated the macroscopic response of ArcLight' to changes in membrane potential indicating that their function was uncompromised.</p><p>Although the single-molecules appeared to be operating normally, they consistently displayed an interesting phenomenon: a large degree of noise that did not appear to be shot noise. Whereas shot noise has no correlation from data point to data point, the single-molecule traces fluctuated between relatively distinct fluorescence levels, sometimes remaining at a single level for many milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). To our knowledge, there have been no prior reports of GEVIs displaying fluctuations on these millisecond timescales. Accordingly, we initially hypothesized that these fluctuations were reflective of voltage sensor conformational state changes. To test this, we bacterially expressed isolated ArcLight' GFP domains without attached voltage sensors and observed them as single molecules. To our surprise, these isolated GFP domains displayed roughly similar fluctuations to those observed in the full ArcLight molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that these fluctuations originate in the fluorophore itself. To confirm that this fluctuation noise was distinct from shot noise, we computed the autocorrelation functions for fluorescence traces from both an isolated ArcLight' GFP domain and from a region of background fluorescence from the same image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). As expected, the background fluorescence displayed no significant autocorrelation, suggesting that the noise in this trace is primarily due to shot noise or other white noise processes. By contrast, the ArcLight' fluorescence showed significant correlation over tens of milliseconds. Finally, we performed a similar experiment on wild-type eGFP and also observed significant fluctuation noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This result, consistent with the GFP photophysics literature, strongly suggests that this is not a pathology unique to the ArcLight' fluorophore, but rather is one that likely affects many current GEVIs (see Discussion). This observation may lead to a novel avenue for improvement of GEVI signals based on the attenuation or elimination of this noise.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10482.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Voltage-sensitive fluorescence can be recorded from single ArcLight' molecules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An image of the surface of an oocyte expressing ArcLight' in single-molecule concentrations.

As discussed previously, altering the set point of the voltage-dependence of the Ci-VSP voltage-sensing domain by mutating the R217 residue to either a Q or an E correspondingly alters the set point of the ArcLight fluorescence change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Indeed, the change in ArcLight fluorescence at steady state was not statistically significantly different from the degree of change in Ci-VSD conformation as measured by gating charge movement. We also tested whether ArcLight fluorescence kinetics are the same as the kinetics of the gating charge movement (see Methods for details). In both 'on' responses where the membrane was held at a negative potential and then pulsed to depolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and 'off' responses where the membrane was held at a positive potential and then pulsed to hyperpolarized potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we observed that ArcLight fluorescence kinetics are considerably slower than those of voltage sensor movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). The fastest component of fluorescence during the 'on' response was approximately twice as slow as the gating current kinetics, and the 'off' fluorescence kinetics are more than ten times slower than voltage sensor gating. Indeed, neither component of fluorescence response appears to correlate well with any component of gating charge movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overlaying simultaneously acquired gating charge and fluorescence traces, along with an estimated measure of membrane potential, makes the slowed response of ArcLight fluorescence especially apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations raised the question of how gating charge movement is kinetically linked to ArcLight fluorescence. Interestingly, there is a distinct delay between the induction of a voltage change and the initiation of the resulting fluorescence change from ArcLight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). This delay shows a marked voltage-dependence and is present in both on and off fluorescence transitions. Both the delays and fluorescence kinetics show pronounced voltage dependencies, with τ-V curves which are slowest at intermediate potentials and which speed up towards limiting values at extreme potentials. This pattern is reminiscent of gating current τ-V curves, and suggests that voltage sensor movement is partially responsible for determining ArcLight fluorescence kinetics. In fact, the delays of the fluorescence response align quite well with the gating current kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition to wild-type ArcLight, we also investigated the kinetics of fluorescence response in relation to gating current kinetics for the R217R and R217E constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

By mutating the residue I126 in the S1 segment of the voltage-sensing domain of Ci-VSP to a phenylalanine, gating current activation kinetics were previously shown to be accelerated roughly forty-fold while deactivation currents were accelerated roughly eighty-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacroix and Bezanilla, 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that making the same mutation in ArcLight might speed up fluorescence responses in addition to gating currents. As the I126F mutation also shifted the Ci-VSP Q-V to more hyperpolarized potentials, the Q at position 217 in ArcLight was mutated back to R to keep the voltage-dependence at roughly physiological levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since Ci-VSP R217R gating currents are about four-fold slower than R217Q gating currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Villalba-Galea et al., 2013</xref>), we would expect that ArcLight I126F Q217R would display gating current kinetics about 10 times faster in response to depolarizing pulses and 20 times faster in response to hyperpolarizing pulses than wild-type ArcLight. In practice, we observe a roughly six to twelve-fold increase in speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C </xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, if ArcLight fluorescence kinetics track directly with the kinetics of its voltage sensing domain, the fluorescence changes of ArcLight I126F should be about 8 times faster than wild-type ArcLight during both depolarizations and hyperpolarizations. However, while I126F did accelerate the kinetics of ArcLight fluorescence, it did so in an interesting manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Specifically, while wild-type ArcLight fluorescence kinetics show a pronounced dependence on voltage, I126F kinetics are quite flat over most of the physiological voltage range. Furthermore, as the wild-type kinetics speed up towards extreme membrane potentials, they typically seem to approach the near-constant value of I126F. Interestingly, the lags before fluorescence movement seem to show a very similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). An additional feature is the remarkable acceleration of I126F fluorescence kinetics upon hyperpolarization compared to those from ArcLight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These observations provide some insight into the biophysical basis of ArcLight fluorescence sensing (see Discussion). Due to its improved kinetic response versus wild-type ArcLight, we have termed the I126F Q217R mutant 'ArcLightning'.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10482.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Accelerated gating kinetics speed up fluorescence, up to a point.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The voltage-dependence of fluorescence change of ArcLight I126F Q217R occurs over a physiological voltage range, as taken from an on protocol identical to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

The increased speed of return from a depolarizing pulse is particularly noticeable in the case of repetitive stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

First, we show that the ArcLight' GFP domain possesses considerable intrinsic fluctuation noise on the millisecond timescale, and that this noise is also present in wild-type eGFP. Second, we demonstrate that for ArcLight, the transitions of the voltage-sensing domain align with the transitions of the fluorescence signal, although the fluorescence changes are significantly slower than the voltage sensor changes. Finally, we used a point mutation discovered during biophysical investigations of Ci-VSP to design ArcLightning, a novel version of ArcLight with accelerated movements of the voltage-sensing domain and improved fluorescence response times.</p><p>Our single-molecule analysis of ArcLight' revealed a previously unrecognized behavior of the GEVI: an inherent noise, or fluctuation in the fluorescence signal. This noise appears to not be Poisson-distributed, and thus is not likely simply attributable to shot noise from a single fluorophore. Furthermore, we observed similar fluctuations in single molecules of eGFP. There have been prior reports of fluorescence fluctuations in various GFP derivatives which generally fall into two categories: millisecond and microsecond-scale fluctuations detected with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hess et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haupts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosisio et al., 2008</xref>), and much slower blinking detected in imaging studies of gel-immobilized fluorophores that displayed on- and off- dwell times that are typically hundreds of milliseconds and seconds, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peterman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Parajo et al., 2000</xref>); the latter of these modes of fluctuation appears to be quite different from what we observe. We have also, however, found one prior report of fluctuation in an immobilized GFP mutant on comparable timescales to what we observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moerner et al., 1999</xref>), further emphasizing that this noise may be a general feature of GFP derivatives. Crucially, however, this noise has to our knowledge never been verified or acknowledged in a GEVI. This is important as this noise adversely impacts the use of GEVIs in two ways. First, while the fluctuations themselves are not visible in macroscopic recordings due to the large number of fluorophore signals being averaged together, they very likely sum together in some manner to raise the noise level of macroscopic recordings. Second, molecules in the dark state do not contribute useful 'signal' photons to help overcome 'noise' photons delivered by autofluorescence and other sources. Both of these effects likely serve to decrease the signal-to-noise ratio observed for a given set of excitation parameters as compared to a non-fluctuating GEVI, thus limiting the size of phenomena that can be resolved. Accordingly, the reduction or elimination of this noise would likely be a significant benefit to GEVIs, thus providing a new direction for future GEVI optimization. In addition, prior work has shown that pulsed excitation light can significantly increase the amount of signal derived from fluorophores that visit dark states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mejía-Alvarez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donnert et al., 2007</xref>). By showing that the ArcLight' fluorophore makes frequent fluctuations, this work motivates investigations into whether an appropriately-modulated excitation can improve the signal from this and other GEVIs.</p><p>Despite its popularity as a GEVI, the mechanism by which ArcLight transduces the motion of the VSD into a change in the fluorescence of the attached eGFP remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2014</xref>). However, the data presented here provides some insight into this process. The gating current kinetics of ArcLight look qualitatively similar to those from Ci-VSP R217Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) with roughly equal kinetics and V<sub>1/2</sub> (11 ms versus 8 ms, -7 mV versus -16 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Villalba-Galea et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the attachment of the fluorescent protein is producing at most a small change in load on the voltage sensor movement, as compared to the natural load of the linker and the phosphatase in Ci-VSP R217Q. However, in ArcLight the fluorescence changes are substantially slower than the simultaneously measured gating currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and contain a measurable lag prior to onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This initially suggested a three-state minimal model of fluorescence with two state transitions: the first carrying gating charge movement and the second corresponding to fluorescence change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lag would be accounted for by the time required for a significant population to reach the second state, while a smaller rate constant on the second transition than the first transition would cause the fluorescence response to be slower than gating charge movement.</p><p>To test this three-state model, we accelerated the gating charge movement of ArcLight with the I126F mutation. If the three-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) was accurate, we would expect the lag preceding fluorescence change to decrease roughly in proportion to the quickening in gating current kinetics while maintaining a similar τ-V dependence. Instead, we observed that both the lag and the fluorescence kinetics become only weakly dependent on voltage. Furthermore, the value they take is approximately the same value that wild-type ArcLight reaches at extreme potentials when its voltage sensor is moving maximally fast. In particular, the lag preceding fluorescence does not speed up by nearly the same factor that the gating current speeds up. These observations are more consistent with a four-state minimal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Here, as in the previous model, the first transition carries the gating charge and possesses voltage-dependent kinetics. The second transition accounts for the lag and possesses kinetics which do not strongly depend on voltage. Finally, the third transition is responsible for the change in fluorescence and also has nearly voltage-independent kinetics. Thus, in wild-type ArcLight, the first transition contributes significantly to the overall observed time constants, causing the observed lags and fluorescence kinetics to behave as if they were voltage-dependent. In ArcLightning, however, the first transition is so fast that it does not contribute significantly and the next two transitions essentially become rate-limiting. This results in the observed values, which do not depend strongly on voltage.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10482.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A minimal four-state model of ArcLight kinetics.</title><p>The first transition carries the gating charge movement while the third transition carries the fluorescence change and the second transition carries no observable changes.

There are two pieces of evidence in favor of this intrinsic delay. First, ArcLight still shows fluorescence responses at extreme hyperpolarized potentials where the VSD is unlikely to enter the relaxed state. Second, speeding up VSD movement does not make the fluorescence response arbitrarily fast. Rather, there seem to be voltage-independent intrinsic delays in fluorescence response which become rate-limiting once VSD movement is fast enough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, at least some component of the ArcLight response is likely due to VSD activation coupled with intrinsic fluorophore delay.</p><p>While ArcLight fluorescence does not seem to be a direct readout of VSD relaxation, the relaxed state may nonetheless play a role in the very slow response of fluorescence to hyperpolarizing pulses following a prolonged depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This is suggested by two observations: first, ArcLight’s fluorescence follows the leftward Q-V shift in gating current that is a hallmark of the relaxed state in Ci-VSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, ArcLight’s deceleration of off kinetics increases as the duration of the depolarizing pulse increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), as occurs in the relaxation process of voltage-gated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lacroix et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, exit of the VSD from the relaxed state may be linked to the extremely slow fluorescence kinetics. Finally, VSD relaxation explains the comparatively flat kinetics observed in ArcLight gating currents during positive holding potentials. Since these holding potentials dramatically left-shift the V<sub>1/2</sub> of the ArcLight Q-V to values well outside experimentally-accessible values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), the corresponding observed τ-V curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) represents only a single tail of the true τ-V, and thus appears to be relatively constant.</p><p>ArcLightning is unique when compared to many previously developed fluorescent probes. Its speed is not as rapid as ElectricPk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnett et al., 2012</xref>), but it has a much larger voltage-sensitive fluorescence response. As opposed to ArcLightning, both ArcLight and the more recent voltage indicator ASAP1 have significant slow components in their off response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, further study of the interactions between VSD movement and fluorescence response, including the contribution of the relaxed state, of voltage-sensitive phosphatase derived GEVIs should prove useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Villalba-Galea et al., 2009</xref>). Improved understanding of this mechanism may lead to additional probes that accomplish what ArcLightning accomplishes: rapid kinetic responses in response to hyperpolarization that prevent the drifting baselines observed in response to repetitive pulses in similar probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piao et al., 2015</xref>) and a roughly linear voltage-sensitivity across the physiological voltage range that could allow for the visualization of both subthreshold and action potential activity. FRET-based voltage indicators, including VSFP, Mermaid, and Butterfly indicators have recently achieved many or all of these characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knöpfel et al., 2015</xref>). Many of these probes have slightly larger fluorescence changes than ArcLightning and comparable kinetics, and the recently developed chimeric VSFP Butterflies appear particularly promising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mishina et al., 2014</xref>). However, ArcLightning and other monochromatic GEVIs have the distinct advantage of freeing other spectral channels for use in measuring other parameters, such as cell morphology or changes in calcium concentration. Additionally, as ArcLighting requires the recording of only one fluorophore’s emission, it is more compatible with simpler optical setups. In addition to the ability demonstrated here to accelerate the voltage-sensitive response of ArcLight, the previously reported I126F mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacroix and Bezanilla 2012</xref>) may also be applicable to other GEVIs such as ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>) and the Butterfly indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Akemann et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, the single-molecule and macroscopic fluorimetric techniques presented here will improve our future capabilities to mechanistically understand VSP-derived GEVIs and to engineer new and improved generations of these probes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>ArcLight for <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> expression was created in the lab by fusing Venus to Ci-VSP in the SP64T plasmid vector at the appropriate location and mutating to the super ecliptic pHluorin A227D to generate ArcLight or ArcLight' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). ArcLight' was identical to ArcLight but with two point mutations (L64F and T65S) which return the fluorophore to the wild-type GFP scaffold rather than the eGFP scaffold; thus, ArcLight' contains the ecliptic pHluroin A227D fluorophore rather than the super ecliptic pHluorin A227D fluorophore.

Weighted time constants (τ<sub>w</sub>) of gating current were taken using double exponential fits to the decay phase of the gating current. Kinetics of fluorescence traces were first taken from double exponential fits to the trace; when fit with two exponentials, fluorescence traces obtained from off pulses in oocytes only had one meaningful time constant, and thus were refit with one exponential. For clarity of comparison, all kinetics were reported as τ<sub>1</sub>, which denotes the faster and larger amplitude component of the fluorescence traces. Q-V curves were calculated by normalizing the integral of the gating current following a sloped baseline subtraction to remove leak current. When holding at +40 mV the Q-V and F-V curves did not approach saturation in the hyperpolarized direction. Therefore, we first normalized the Q-V by the total gating charge moved in the same oocyte during a depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of -120 mV as these traces saturate on both ends and total gating charge is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>). The normalization factor found in the Q-V was used to normalize the F-V when holding at +40 mV.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to Dr. Tomoya Kubota

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard Aldrich, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The other two reviewers, Brian Salzberg and Kenton Swartz, also agreed to share their identities.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>This is an excellent manuscript that studies the properties of the genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) ArcLight, together with those of ArcLightning, a novel GEVI introduced by the authors in this paper. The authors use the ArcLight GEVI to track voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) at the single molecule level, a not inconsiderable achievement. They also characterize, very carefully, the kinetics of ArcLight's fluorescence changes, and identify a previously unrecognized (or, at least, unreported) delay. As a result of their studies, they develop ArcLightning, a GEVI with superior kinetics, and they posit a four-state minimal model for fluorescence changes of GEVIs. This manuscript provides both a novel, and potentially extremely useful new GEVI, as well as important insights into the behavior of genetically expresses voltage-indicators. It also shows, as the authors note, that mutations found during biophysical studies of voltage sensor behavior can inform the rational design of new and improved GEVIs. Also included is an exciting, however preliminary, description of single-molecule fluorescence signals form single voltage sensors.</p> <p>We are enthusiastic about the work on the properties and modification of ArcLight, and believe that necessary revisions should be easily accomplished. However, we feel that the single-molecule work, while potentially quite exciting, is much too preliminary for inclusion, and should be removed. We would be quite enthusiastic about receiving an additional paper describing a thorough and rigorous characterization of the single voltage sensor signals.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) Remove the single-molecule studies from the paper.</p> <p>2) The authors demonstrate a close correlation between Q and F changes for the wt S4 construct, as well as the R217Q and R217E constructs, which is great to see, but then don't carefully analyze (or at least present) the multiexponential kinetics of either measure and look to see which match and which don't. It would be nice to show integrated Q traces, analyze those, and compare them with what is seen for F. With the two other mutants, it would be interesting to see how these change. The lag in F is also interesting, and it would be nice to show measure V traces as well as integrated Q traces so the reader can see how both V and Q change relative to F.</p> <p>3) Please provide a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of ArcLightning with other versions of optical voltage sensors (e.g. Mermaid, ElectricPk, VSFP).</p> </body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10482.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body> <p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) Remove the single-molecule studies from the paper.</italic></p> <p>Thank you for this comment, and we agree that it is too early to draw conclusions about voltage sensor function based on the data presented. Accordingly, in consultation with the editors, we have substantially revised the presentation of the single-molecule work. We have eliminated entirely the discussion of using ArcLight to learn about voltage sensor function. However, we strongly feel that the fluctuation noise discovered here has substantial implications for future GEVI use and development. In particular, the macroscopic summation of the noise, as well as the corresponding decrease in effective quantum yield compared to a non-fluctuating fluorophore, very likely serve to decrease the signal-to-noise ratio of many GEVI-derived signals, thus decreasing the resolving power of these tools for small signals. In addition to this, correctly-modulated pulsing may be of benefit for increasing signal from many GFP-based GEVIs, as previous work has demonstrated that this can improve signal form many fluorophores that visit dark states. Thus the discovery of this noise may serve to motivate new avenues of GEVI optimization that are distinct from and complementary to current directions. We hope you agree with us that this describes an important phenomenon that likely afflicts many current GEVIs and that it should remain a part of this manuscript in its revised form.</p> <p><italic>2) The authors demonstrate a close correlation between Q and F changes for the wt S4 construct, as well as the R217Q and R217E constructs, which is great to see, but then don't carefully analyze (or at least present) the multiexponential kinetics of either measure and look to see which match and which don't.

The lag in F is also interesting, and it would be nice to show measure V traces as well as integrated Q traces so the reader can see how both V and Q change relative to F.</italic></p> <p>Thank you for these insightful suggestions. We have added two new figures to the section titled “ArcLight Fluorescence Changes are Slower than Gating Currents and Possess a Lag” that address these points. First, we compare the two time constants of both integrated gating charge and fluorescence and show that there are no obvious kinetic correlations between the two. We then show a pair of representative examples of overlaid V, Q, and F traces to more clearly show how they change in time relative to each other. Finally, we do a kinetics analysis of gating currents, fluorescence lags, and fluorescence kinetics for the R217R and R217E constructs and show that they have the same general behavior as the wild-type construct.</p> <p><italic>3) Please provide a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of ArcLightning with other versions of optical voltage sensors (e.g. Mermaid, ElectricPk, VSFP).</italic></p> <p>The toolbox available to researchers interested in measuring changes in membrane potential grows larger each year and we are happy to compare our tool to those currently available. Additional information has been added in the last paragraph of the Discussion. Briefly, ElectricPk is faster but much smaller, and Mermaid and VSFP (and other closely related FRET based probes) are comparable in their abilities but take up a larger fraction of the visible light spectrum, making optical measurement of additional parameters challenging.</p> </body></sub-article></article>
