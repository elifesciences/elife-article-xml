Central to the function of this motor protein complex is dynein intermediate chain (IC), which binds the three dimeric dynein light chains at multivalent sites, and dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup> and nuclear distribution protein (NudE) at overlapping sites of its intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. The disorder in IC has hindered cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography studies of its structure and interactions. Here we use a suite of biophysical methods to reveal how multivalent binding of the three light chains regulates IC interactions with p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE. Using IC from <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic>, a tractable species to interrogate IC interactions, we identify a significant reduction in binding affinity of IC to p150<sup>Glued</sup> and a loss of binding to NudE for constructs containing the entire N-terminal domain as well as for full-length constructs when compared to the tight binding observed with short IC constructs. We attribute this difference to autoinhibition caused by long-range intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal single α-helix of IC, the common site for p150<sup>Glued</sup>, and NudE binding, and residues closer to the end of the N-terminal domain. Reconstitution of IC subcomplexes demonstrates that autoinhibition is differentially regulated by light chains binding, underscoring their importance both in assembly and organization of IC, and in selection between multiple binding partners at the same site.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Motor proteins are the freight trains of the cell, transporting large molecular cargo from one location to another using an array of ‘roads’ known as microtubules. These hollow tubes are oriented, with one extremity (the plus-end) growing faster than the other (the minus-end). While over 40 different motor proteins travel towards the plus-end of microtubules, just one is responsible for moving cargo in the opposite direction. This protein, called dynein, performs a wide range of functions which must be carefully regulated, often through changes in the shape and interactions of various dynein segments.</p><p>The intermediate chain is one of the essential subunits that form dynein, and it acts as a binding site for a range of molecular actors. In particular, it connects the three other dynein subunits (known as the light chains) to the dynein heavy chain containing the motor domain. It also binds to two non-dynein proteins: NudE, which helps to organise microtubules, and the p150<sup>Glued</sup> region of dynactin, a protein required for dynein activity. Despite their distinct roles, p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE attach to the same region of the intermediate chain, a highly flexible ‘unstructured’ segment which is difficult to study. How the binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE is regulated has therefore remained unsolved.</p><p>In response, Jara et al. decided to investigate how the three dynein light chains may help to control interactions between the intermediate chain and non-dynein proteins. They used more stable versions of dynein, NudE and dynactin (from a fungus that grows at high temperatures) to produce the various subcomplexes formed by the intermediate chain, the three dynein light chains, and parts of p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE. A suite of biophysical techniques was applied to study these structures, as they are challenging to capture using traditional approaches. This revealed that the unstructured region of the intermediate chain can fold back on itself, bringing together its two extremities; such folding blocks the p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE binding site. This obstruction is cleared when the light chains bind to the intermediate chain, demonstrating how these three subunits can regulate dynein activity.</p><p>In humans, mutations in dynein are associated with a range of serious neurological and muscular diseases. The work by Jara et al. brings new insight into the way this protein works; more importantly, it describes how to combine several biophysical techniques to study non-structured proteins, offering a blueprint that is likely to be relevant for a wide range of scientists.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>p150 Glued</kwd><kwd>multivalency</kwd><kwd>protein disorder</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>protein interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1617019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbar</surname><given-names>Elisar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2003557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loening</surname><given-names>Nikolaus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005880</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biological Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD018518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbar</surname><given-names>Elisar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Autoinhibition by long-range intramolecular interactions in the partially disordered dynein intermediate chain is relieved by multivalent interactions of dynein light chains, demonstrating for the first time the dual roles of light chains in dynein assembly and regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynein and kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins that are responsible for the transport of cellular cargos such as membranes, RNAs, proteins, and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raaijmakers and Medema, 2014</xref>). Whereas kinesins typically move toward the plus-end of microtubules, dynein moves toward the minus-end. Mutations in the dynein transport machinery have been linked to neurological and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Perry syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy-lower extremity predominant, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, lissencephaly, and other malformations of cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harada et al., 1998</xref>).

One vital subunit is dynein intermediate chain (IC), which plays key roles in modulating dynein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Makokha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nyarko and Barbar, 2011</xref>). Like all other dynein subunits, there are two copies of IC in the dynein motor protein complex. These two IC subunits connect the three dynein light chains (Tctex, LC8, and LC7) to the heavy chain (HC) and serve as the primary binding site of multiple non-dynein proteins essential for dynein regulation, such as the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin and nuclear distribution protein (NudE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain architecture for dynein intermediate chain (IC), dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup>, and nuclear distribution protein (NudE).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architecture diagrams for IC from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Dros.

The lack of a folded stable structure provides highly accessible regions for post-translational modifications and ideal locations for short linear binding motifs, and thus IDRs are often promiscuous and uniquely regulated in their binding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunker et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, IDRs in IC interact with their partners multivalently, which compared to monovalent interactions involve linked associations of ligands binding to multiple sites and often confer increased binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forsythe and Barbar, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The primarily disordered N-terminal domain of IC (N-IC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Makokha et al., 2002</xref>) contains a single α-helix (SAH) and a short helix (H2), each of which is followed by disordered linker regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jie et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the C-terminal domain (C-IC) consists of seven WD40 repeats that fold into a β-propeller and binds helical bundles 4 and 5 of HC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Free N-IC is monomeric but, upon binding the homodimeric dynein light chain subunits (Tctex, LC8, and LC7), it dimerizes to form a subcomplex that is best described as a polybivalent scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nyarko and Barbar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mok et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Susalka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the formation of this subcomplex, the first binding event pays the entropic cost for subsequent bivalent binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nyarko and Barbar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2009</xref>), and the enhancement of subsequent binding events is modulated by the length of the disordered linkers separating the binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reardon et al., 2020</xref>). Such a mechanism has been well described for the IC/Tctex/LC8 complex, for which a three-residue linker separates the Tctex and LC8 binding sites. In this complex, binding of one light chain to IC results in a 50-fold enhancement in the affinity for binding the other light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2009</xref>). Each homodimeric light chain has a corresponding binding site on IC that is initially disordered but forms β-strands (for Tctex and LC8) or an α-helix (for LC7) when bound and incorporated into the fold of their respective ligand. The assembly of monomeric N-IC and the homodimeric light chains is such that, when bound, folding occurs only at the protein-protein interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2009</xref>) while the remaining linker regions stay completely disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nyarko and Barbar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan et al., 2021</xref>).

Dynactin is a multisubunit complex that binds dynein with its largest subunit, p150<sup>Glued</sup>, and this interaction is required for the recruitment of cargo, dynein processivity, and correct spindle formation in cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gill et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kardon and Vale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schroer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>). NudE, on the other hand, regulates dynein recruitment to kinetochores and membranes, centrosome migration, mitotic spindle orientation, and binds LIS1 (Lissencephaly-1 homolog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kardon and Vale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wainman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKenney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang and Zheng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zyłkiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>).

However, the molecular processes underlying which regulator is bound at any given time are still unclear. Previously, we showed using homologs from multiple species (rat, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yeast) that the coiled-coil domains of p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE each bind IC at the same site (the SAH region) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nyarko et al., 2012</xref>) whereas for homologs from a filamentous fungus (<italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> [Ct]) the binding of IC and p150<sup>Glued</sup> also involves binding of the H2 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loening et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Dynein is seemingly a perfect candidate for structural characterization by cryo-EM, as the motor domains are large and symmetric. Extensive cryo-EM structure analyses show that dynactin reorients the motor domains of dynein parallel to the microtubules prior to binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, various adaptors can recruit a second dynein to dynactin for faster movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaaban and Carter, 2022</xref>). However, a recurring theme in these studies is that the flexibility of N-IC limits details of its structure and binding interactions. As a result, residue-specific studies on recombinant IC have so far been limited to short fragments and to conditions far removed from native biological systems. Using the combined data from EM structures and studies on short constructs, we present a simplified model that specifically emphasizes the interactions of IC to aid in visualizing the assembled N-IC subcomplex bound to either p150<sup>Glued</sup> or NudE, providing context for the work we focus on here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The interactions of short fragments of N-IC with dynein light chains and non-dynein proteins from multiple different species (rat, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yeast) demonstrate that NudE and p150<sup>Glued</sup> compete for the same binding site; however, a mechanism for IC partner selection and the importance of bivalency in IC subcomplex assembly have remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nyarko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wainman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siglin et al., 2013</xref>).

Utilizing the entire N-terminal domain of IC allows, for the first time, characterization of IC interactions in the context of its assembly with the light chains, as has been shown vital for other disorder-regulated systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugge et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berlow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark et al., 2018</xref>).

From our studies of both IC<sub>1-260</sub> as well as full-length IC, (1) we describe the first recombinant expression and reconstitution of the polybivalent scaffold formed from IC bound by all three light chains (Tctex, LC8, and LC7), as well as by coiled-coil domains of p150<sup>Glued</sup> or NudE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), (2) we identify long-range tertiary contacts between residues in the LC7 binding site and residues in the N-terminal region (SAH) that inhibit binding to non-dynein proteins, (3) we show how assembly with the light chains relieves this autoinhibition and regulates binding of IC to p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE, (4) we demonstrate for the first time the essential role of light chains in both assembly and regulation of the full-length IC, and (5) we showcase how a suite of biophysical techniques are essential to effectively study intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ct p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> are dimeric, while Ct IC<sub>1-260</sub> is monomeric</title><p>Studies of interactions of IC constructs with light chains show that two monomeric IC chains are brought together by the dimeric light chains to create a ‘ladder-like’ polybivalent scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nyarko and Barbar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan et al., 2021</xref>). Here we use a construct of IC that includes all the binding sites for the light chains and non-dynein proteins, the full-length light chains, and coiled-coil domains of non-dynein proteins and employ multiple techniques to determine their association states. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC), which gives information about a protein’s mass and shape in solution, was used to determine each protein’s heterogeneity and size. A larger sedimentation coefficient (S) indicates a protein with a larger mass and/or a protein with a smaller, shape-dependent, frictional ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al., 2008</xref>). SV-AUC showed that IC<sub>1-260</sub>, the three light chains, and non-dynein proteins p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> all have similar sedimentation coefficients (in the 2–3 S range, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, as sedimentation coefficients also depend on shape, the smaller values observed for p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> are consistent with their predicted coiled-coil structures (which result in elongated, less-compact, rod-like shapes), causing slower sedimentation than if they were globular.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> (Ct) p150<sub>CC1B</sub>, NudE<sub>CC</sub>, and dynein light chains are dimeric, whereas Ct IC<sub>1-260</sub> is monomeric.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation profiles for LC8 (red), LC7 (yellow), and Tctex (orange) (top), and, IC<sub>1-260</sub> (gray), p150<sub>CC1B</sub> (blue), and NudE<sub>CC</sub> (green) (bottom).

In particular, IC<sub>100-260</sub> appears to be the least stable of the three, with complete loss of helical structure around 40°C.

Therefore, the newfound peak dispersion at higher temperature is not due to an increase in secondary structure. Rather, the appearance of peaks at elevated temperatures is most likely due to an increased rate of molecular tumbling causing peaks from more structured parts of the protein that were too broad to observe at lower temperatures to narrow and become visible. The conclusion that these peaks belong to residues in ordered regions is supported by their chemical shift dispersion and their absence in the CLEANEX spectrum at 40°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Even with the use of deuterated samples and TROSY-based experiments, the peaks at 40°C corresponding to more structured regions were, for the most part, not assignable as their rapid relaxation (potentially due to exchange broadening) resulted in extremely low signal intensities in backbone assignment experiments.

Also, important to note is that the shift in sedimentation coefficient for p150<sub>CC1B</sub> when added to the IC/light chains complex is significantly more pronounced than that with IC<sub>1-260</sub> alone, suggesting that binding to IC<sub>1-260</sub> is significantly enhanced in the presence of the light chains.</p><p>NMR spectroscopy indicates that most of the peaks in the disordered regions observed at 10°C for free IC<sub>1-260</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) remain visible in the spectrum of the dynein subcomplex (IC<sub>1-260</sub>/Tctex/LC8/LC7), indicating that there is still significant disorder in the fully bound complex (153 kDa). In contrast, comparison of the spectra of free IC<sub>1-260</sub> and dynein subcomplex at 40°C shows a drastic disappearance of peaks, indicating that the residues corresponding to these peaks have much longer correlation times in the bound state either due to their involvement in binding or due to the overall increase in weight of the entire subcomplex. Peaks from linker regions not involved in binding light chains that are observed at 10°C but not at 40°C likely disappear due to rapid exchange with the solvent at the higher temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Effect of light chains on autoinhibition is retained in full-length Ct IC</title><p>To determine if the autoinhibition seen in IC<sub>1-260</sub> is present in the full-length construct and thus biologically relevant, IC<sub>FL</sub> (residues 1–642) was produced using a baculovirus expression system. The estimated mass of 75.4 kDa for IC<sub>FL</sub> from SEC-MALS matches closely to the expected monomeric mass of 79 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>). Furthermore, SV-AUC shows a single, homogenous peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 4.0 S, as would be expected for monomeric IC<sub>FL</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> top). This is the first evidence that full-length IC is a monomer in solution and requires the light chains for its dimerization. Adding either p150<sub>CC1B</sub> or NudE<sub>CC</sub> to IC<sub>FL</sub> results in a negligible shift of the IC<sub>FL</sub> peak and, in both cases, show a peak corresponding to unbound p150<sub>CC1B</sub> or NudE<sub>CC</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This lack of binding between IC<sub>FL</sub> and p150<sub>CC1B</sub>/NudE<sub>CC</sub> shows that autoinhibition occurs in IC<sub>FL</sub> in a similar manner to what we have observed in IC<sub>1-260</sub>.

These data suggest that the addition of LC7 is sufficient to allow binding of p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> to IC<sub>FL</sub>, whereas the binding of Tctex and LC8 only promotes p150<sub>CC1B</sub> binding to IC<sub>FL</sub> and not NudE<sub>CC</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>N-IC from a variety of species contains a stretch of about 300 amino acids that are primarily disordered, except for a few short α-helices. Within the first 40 residues is a fully ordered helix (the SAH region), followed by a short disordered linker and another region (H2) that form a fully ordered helix in some species but are only a nascent helix in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loening et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siglin et al., 2013</xref>). Prior work suggests that a more disordered H2 is correlated with tighter IC/p150<sup>Glued</sup> binding and has shown that, for Ct IC, the H2 region is disordered and binds directly to p150<sup>Glued</sup> (although mostly in a nonspecific manner) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loening et al., 2020</xref>). In this work, we use a construct of IC that encompasses almost its entire N-terminal domain to probe the interactions of Ct IC with both p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> in context of its multivalent assembly with the three dimeric dynein light chains. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time, using full-length IC, that the mechanisms at place in IC<sub>1-260</sub> remain in the context of the entire IC protein. The results are illustrated by a model that explains the different aspects of IC autoinhibition and how the assembly of the multivalent IC subcomplex relieves this autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model of <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> IC<sub>1-260</sub> binding interactions and subcomplex assemblies.</title><p>Free IC<sub>1-260</sub> is compact and in autoinhibited state (Boxed in black), with the single α-helix (SAH), H2, and H3 regions depicted as helices and with colors indicating the LC8 (red), Tctex (orange), and LC7 (yellow) binding sites. When LC7 is added (left arrow) LC7 outcompetes autoinhibition to bind IC<sub>1-260</sub>, exposing the SAH domain for p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE binding. When p150<sub>CC1B</sub> or NudE<sub>CC</sub> is added (down arrows) to free IC<sub>1-260</sub>, autoinhibition prevents NudE<sub>CC</sub> from binding and reduces the binding affinity of p150<sub>CC1B</sub>. However, as p150<sub>CC1B</sub> is able to bind to the H2 region of IC<sub>1-260</sub>, binding is not completely prevented. Addition of Tctex and/or LC8 (right arrow) leads to a number of possible binary and ternary intermediates. LC8’s role of driving IC dimerization is depicted and, in all intermediates, we predict that IC autoinhibition remains based on very limited changes in nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Continuing to the right, the addition of LC7 leads to formation of the dynein subcomplex and the release of SAH autoinhibition. The free SAH is now able to resume transient interactions with H2 prior to binding with either p150<sub>CC1B</sub> or NudE<sub>CC</sub>. Finally, addition of p150<sub>CC1B</sub> or NudE<sub>CC</sub> leads to the formation of the p150 and NudE subcomplexes (bottom right).

Similar to IC from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, free Ct IC<sub>1-260</sub> is monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>) and contains significant disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). IC<sub>1-260</sub> resists unfolding at temperatures of up to 50°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a feature that we attribute to long-range tertiary contacts between the N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). SV-AUC and SEC-MALS experiments confirm the presence of a binding interaction between IC<sub>1-88</sub> and IC<sub>100-260</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and NMR titrations with N- and C-terminal IC constructs identify an intramolecular interaction between residues in the SAH and the LC7 binding site of IC<sub>1-260</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These long-range tertiary interactions impact IC binding interactions, as seen by the dramatic reduction in binding of p150<sub>CC1B</sub> or NudE<sub>CC</sub> with IC<sub>1-260</sub> compared to IC<sub>1-88</sub> and IC<sub>1-150</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different modes of binding of IC to p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE</title><p>The coiled-coil domains of p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE (p150<sub>CC1B</sub> residues 478–680, and NudE<sub>CC</sub> residues 1–190) show similar dimeric structure and stability by AUC and CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, despite their many similarities, p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> have different modes of binding to Ct IC. First, IC interactions with p150<sub>CC1B</sub> involve binding to both the SAH and H2 regions of IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loening et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, NudE<sub>CC</sub> binds IC via the SAH region and not the H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), agreeing with results previously reported for constructs from <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nyarko et al., 2012</xref>). Second, the p150<sub>CC1B</sub>/IC<sub>1-88</sub> complex has a larger sedimentation coefficient when compared to the NudE<sub>CC</sub>/IC<sub>1-88</sub> complex (3.8 S vs 2.7 S, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) even though the complexes have similar expected masses and the same binding stoichiometry. This suggests that the p150<sub>CC1B</sub>/IC<sub>1-88</sub> complex has a more compact structure. Third, although binding is much weaker with IC<sub>1-260</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) compared to the smaller IC constructs for both p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub>, binding to NudE<sub>CC</sub> is significantly weaker and is only detected at the higher concentrations and enhanced sensitivity afforded by NMR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Finally, similar to the short IC constructs, the light chain/IC assembled complex shows a different sedimentation coefficient when bound to p150<sub>CC1B</sub> (~7 S) or NudE<sub>CC</sub> (~5 S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The larger sedimentation coefficient for the p150<sub>CC1B</sub> subcomplex is unexplained by the small mass difference and thus indicates a more compact and stable conformation for the subcomplex when p150<sub>CC1B</sub> is bound. SV-AUC experiments with IC<sub>FL</sub> further confirm that p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> have different binding modes as, once again, complexes with assembled IC<sub>FL</sub>/light chain subcomplexes show a larger sedimentation coefficient when bound to p150<sub>CC1B</sub> (~8 S) than when bound to NudE<sub>CC</sub> (~7.5 S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We propose that binding of NudE<sub>CC</sub> induces a more elongated and open conformation of the IC subcomplex while p150<sub>CC1B</sub> binding results in a more compact conformation as depicted in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p><p>The advantages of a compact or elongated IC subcomplex remain to be elucidated. It is possible that these different conformations aid in dynein functions that are linked to binding either dynactin (cargo recruitment, processivity, and spindle formation) or NudE (dynein recruitment to kinetochores and membranes, centrosome migration, spindle orientation, and LIS1 interactions). Additionally, variations in IC subcomplex conformation may impact other regulatory mechanisms, such as phosphorylation at residues located in the serine-rich linker following H2 in mammalian IC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vaughan et al., 2001</xref>). Regulatory impacts and the significance of different mechanisms may also rely heavily on linker lengths that vary between isoforms and such variability in linker length may have unequal contributions to IC autoinhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Autoinhibition in IC selects for binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup> over NudE</title><p>Interactions of IC<sub>1-260</sub> with its binding partners observed by ITC and AUC show weak endothermic binding to p150<sub>CC1B</sub> but no binding to NudE<sub>CC</sub>. Our data suggest a process, which we refer to as autoinhibition, in which IC<sub>1-260</sub> adopts a compact structure that covers the SAH region necessary for binding to NudE<sub>CC</sub> and for strong binding to p150<sub>CC1B</sub>, but still leaves the H2 region partly accessible so that weak binding to p150<sub>CC1B</sub> can still occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The SAH region is made inaccessible by tertiary interactions within IC, as seen in an NMR titration of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled IC<sub>1-88</sub> with IC<sub>100-260</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). We assign these tertiary interactions to those within the LC7 binding site at the C-terminus via NMR titrations of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled IC<sub>216-260</sub> with IC<sub>1-88</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), but note that the binding affinity does appear stronger in the longer construct (IC<sub>100-260</sub>). This increase in affinity could be due to additional interactions between H2 and H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>), and indicates that the full context of the disordered chain, including the binding sites for Tctex, LC8, and LC7, is needed for strong, intramolecular interactions. These interactions likely have an autoinhibitory effect, which would explain the reduced binding affinity for p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> for IC<sub>1-260</sub> in comparison to the shorter constructs. A need for ‘opening’ IC from an autoinhibitory state prior to binding also explains the entropically driven first binding step observed by ITC, especially for p150<sub>CC1B</sub>/IC binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Since the inhibitory effect is more pronounced for IC<sub>1-260</sub> binding with NudE<sub>CC</sub>, than for IC<sub>1-260</sub> binding with p150<sub>CC1B</sub>, we propose autoinhibition as a mechanism for selection of p150<sub>CC1B</sub> over NudE<sub>CC</sub>. Autoinhibition as a selection mechanism is underscored by our results with full-length IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Although binding to both p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> is inhibited with IC<sub>FL</sub> alone, the addition of Tctex and LC8 rescues binding to p150<sub>CC1B</sub>, likely by helping make the nearby H2 region more accessible. In contrast, binding to both p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> is rescued via LC7 binding to IC<sub>FL</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). With light chains present and autoinhibition relieved, competition between NudE<sub>CC</sub> and p150<sub>CC1B</sub> may result from the ability of p150 to invade an IC/NudE complex by first binding the exposed H2 region before competing for the SAH binding site as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nyarko et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our work establishes the SAH region as a critical structural element of the IC that, as a single helix, packs against other helices stabilizing a compact structure and, in the process, inhibits binding of partners to either the SAH region or to the partner helix it packs against. The SAH/LC7 site intramolecular contacts, for example, inhibit IC from interacting with p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub>. Based on its inherent ability to interact with other helices, the SAH could form long-range interactions with other helices in the dynein motor or dynein adaptors and inhibit other interactions. This is a highly likely possibility since autoinhibition is a common regulatory mechanism for dynein as is observed in interactions with the motor domain and dynein activators dynactin and Bicaudal-D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torisawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tripathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Terawaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kobayashi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Autoinhibition in IC regulation emphasizes interplay of disorder and multivalency</title><p>Recombinant expression and biophysical characterization of multiple dynein and non-dynein subunits and their reconstitution into three assembled IC subcomplexes and characterization of these complexes offer a testable model for the interplay of disorder and multivalency in regulation of dynein function and selection of binding partners.</p><p>The N-terminal domain and full-length IC constructs from Ct demonstrate subcomplex assembly via light chain binding as the primary modulating mechanism for p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE binding. This is an effect that can only be detected with larger constructs of IC, such as Ct IC<sub>1-260</sub>, that contain long disordered linkers separating short helices and binding sites. As summarized by the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, we propose that these properties combine to create a multifaceted system of regulation for IC. The disordered linkers allow for the needed flexibility to bring together the SAH region and the C-terminus (200+ amino acids away) and to extend it into an open conformation when LC7 is bound (either on its own, or with the other two light chains), which suggests a unique role for LC7 in regulating IC interactions. The model highlights that the C-terminal end of IC<sub>1-260</sub>, which contains a portion of the LC7 binding site, interacts with the SAH and results in a closed conformation. The closed conformation is autoinhibitory, preventing binding of the SAH region by p150<sub>CC1B</sub> or NudE<sub>CC</sub>. However, because p150<sub>CC1B</sub> also binds to H2, p150<sub>CC1B</sub> binding to IC<sub>1-260</sub> is not completely abolished. Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) suggest that residues that overlap with part of the LC7 binding site make the strongest contacts with the SAH, leaving flanking residues to initiate binding to LC7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). From the limited changes in NMR spectra upon Tctex and LC8 binding, we conclude that the overall closed conformation of IC is likely retained by binding of LC8 and/or Tctex since they bind in the center of a long linker, whereas LC7 binding is required to release the SAH region, thereby allowing assembled IC to fully bind to p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub>. In future work it will be important to demonstrate that autoinhibition and its subsequent reversal by multivalent dynein light chain binding is a conserved process of IC among species and determine how this autoinhibition affects dynein function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers do mention that some additional attention should be placed on clarifying the biological significance of the system with a better introduction (including graphics). Further, in the Discussion section more emphasis on the biological relevance of the findings should be given; for example what is the biological role of autoinhibition. As you can see some of the reviewers ask for additional experiments to clarify aspects of the paper. Please consider these carefully in a revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors propose that the two-step binding isotherm observed for p150 is due to binding to both the SAH and H2 regions of IC(1-88), while NudE shows a single binding event by ITC due to interaction with the SAH region only. The NMR experiments of IC(1-88) do not provide sufficient support for this hypothesis (Figure 6B, bottom panel; see point 8 below as well). Additional experimental data would be needed to fully support this conclusion.</p><p>2) ITC, NMR, and AUC data are presented for the binding of NudE to IC(1-260). Some more clarification is needed in terms of the interpretation of these data, also in the context of the observations on IC(FL). The experimental observations do not seem to be explainable simply by a weak complex or a concentration-dependent effect as suggested by the authors.</p><p>3) The difference in sedimentation coefficient of the dynein subcomplex + NudE and of the dynein subcomplex + p150 is surprisingly large suggesting significantly different shapes of the two bound complexes. Some discussion of this issue is present in the manuscript, but no clear explanation is provided. It would seem necessary to confirm these observations by other complementary techniques. With respect to the SV-AUC data, it would be helpful to use frictional coefficients f/F0 to disentangle Mw and conformation from sedimentation coefficients.</p><p>4) The authors suggest that the binding of LC7 releases the auto-inhibitory interaction of IC, however, NMR does not directly support this conclusion (Figure 7B). Some discussion of why this long-range interaction inhibits the binding of NudE, but not LC7 itself, should be included.</p><p>5) As indicated in the summary above more care should be placed on introducing the system. For example, it was felt that Figure 1B, did not help much (e.g. the light chains were hard to acknowledge as they appear to be rather small compared to the IC chain and were at first overlooked at just the binding sites; where is the heavy chain of dynein, why is there no coiled coil of p150, etc?). In a related manner, the functional role of autoinhibition should be more clearly emphasized in the discussion, e.g., what is the relevance of the differential binding of the two ligands and their differential effects on the autoinhibited state. Which biological outcomes are to be expected?</p><p>6) One of the conclusions is that the internal contacts occur between the C-terminal of the IC and SAH/H2, which is seen from the intensity changes in the HSQC spectra upon addition of the 160-240 construct to the 1-88 construct. However, adding the linker part from 100-160 produces a much more pronounced effect (Figure 5C, bottom), suggesting that residues in this region, which includes the Tctex and LC8 binding motifs play additional roles. Is the binding of the light chains to IC of higher affinity to the 100-160 protein than to the 1-260? In that case, this could suggest that also inhibitory access to these two sites occurs in the autoinhibited state. The additional effect of the 100-160 residues should be addressed.</p><p>7) Can H3 be excluded as a player in the internal interactions, just because you see binding to the LC7 site when studied in isolation? Once the LC7 regions is bound, H3 may also participate, as also clearly indicated from the data shown in Figure 4A. Using an H3 peptide would be relevant.</p><p>8) Fig6B and associated text: there is a clear although weak loss in intensity/peak volume in the H2 region for the interaction with NudE. Why assume that there is no interaction? The affinity for NudE is lower, so the concentration of the complex will also be lower at similar conditions compared to that of p150, and this would give rise to the smaller effects in the spectra. In the lower panel, there is a clear indication of binding to H2 as well, and SAH and H2 binding may very well be cooperative as they are sequentially close. What are the relative concentrations of NudE and p150 in the cell? Would they be competitive despite the difference in affinities? Can a mechanism for p150 ability to relieve autoinhibition be proposed – from Fig6B, could it be able to bind first to the H2 region even though SAH is involved in the autoinhibitory interaction?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Multivalency, autoinhibition, and protein disorder in the regulation of interactions of dynein intermediate chain with dynactin and the nuclear distribution protein&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This adds to the explanation of the larger binding affinity in the longer construct. The weak engagement of H2 with NudE may allow p150 to invade a NudE:IC complex, possibly in the trimeric complex (see also work by Berlow et al.

Additional experimental data would be needed to fully support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we currently do not have sufficient support for the hypothesis that p150<sub>CC1B</sub> exhibits two-step binding with IC due to discrete binding events of the SAH and H2, and thus have edited the manuscript to exclude this language. Instead, we emphasize the conclusion that p150<sub>CC1B</sub> binds to both the SAH and H2 regions of IC and that the SAH is needed for tight binding while NudE<sub>CC</sub> binds strongly only to the SAH. We have provided additional experimental data to support this conclusion in Figure 6 S2 showing ITC with an H2 specific construct of IC (IC<sub>37-88</sub>) that binds weakly with p150<sub>CC1B</sub> but does not bind NudE<sub>CC</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) ITC, NMR, and AUC data are presented for the binding of NudE to IC(1-260). Some more clarification is needed in terms of the interpretation of these data, also in the context of the observations on IC(FL). The experimental observations do not seem to be explainable simply by a weak complex or a concentration-dependent effect as suggested by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>By AUC and ITC, NudE<sub>CC</sub> exhibits binding to IC<sub>1-88</sub> (Figure 6A, C). By ITC the dissociation constant of this interaction is moderate at 0.3 µM and by AUC, we see a less dramatic shift in sedimentation constant than expected, suggesting that either the interaction is dynamic or that binding induces a more extended structure for the complex. It is important to note that the sedimentation coefficient of a complex is not only influenced by size but also by shape and by binding on/off rates. NMR further clarifies that, unlike p150<sub>CC1B</sub>, NudE<sub>CC</sub> does not interact with the H2 region of IC (Figure 6B). This important distinction plays a larger role in the interaction of NudE<sub>CC</sub> with IC<sub>1-260</sub> or IC<sub>FL</sub> as we see that with the larger constructs binding is inhibited due to the tertiary, autoinhibitory contacts within IC.</p><p>By ITC, binding is not detected for NudE<sub>CC</sub> and IC<sub>1-260</sub> at the concentration used. By AUC, a peak for a complex with a larger sedimentation coefficient is not seen for NudE<sub>CC</sub> and IC<sub>1-260</sub>, however the absence of a peak corresponding to free IC indicates that some degree of highly dynamic binding takes place. We believe this is due to a minor population of “open”, uninhibited IC<sub>1-260</sub> that exists in solution. NMR captures these minor states of IC that we propose to be concentration independent (evidence of tertiary contacts present for apo IC<sub>1-260</sub> in Figure 4). While the teritary contacts are not concentration dependent, the population of these minor states are simply higher at higher concentration giving rise to what we see as some binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The difference in sedimentation coefficient of the dynein subcomplex + NudE and of the dynein subcomplex + p150 is surprisingly large suggesting significantly different shapes of the two bound complexes. Some discussion of this issue is present in the manuscript, but no clear explanation is provided. It would seem necessary to confirm these observations by other complementary techniques. With respect to the SV-AUC data, it would be helpful to use frictional coefficients f/F0 to disentangle Mw and conformation from sedimentation coefficients.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also surprised by the large difference in sedimentation coefficient between the dynein subcomplex with NudE<sub>CC</sub> compared to the subcomplex with p150<sub>CC1B</sub>. We propose a difference in the level of elongation/compaction between the two subcomplexes as an explanation. As suggested by the reviewer, we have added calculated f/F0 values for all three variations of subcomplex (based on assumed complex molecular weights) and have added them into the results and Discussion sections. We have also better explained and incorporated earlier results from our research group (Morgan et al. 2021) that employ NMR PRE experiments and shows that N-IC exists as an equilibrium mixture of extended and compact states and that binding of NudE shifts the equilibrium toward more open states (which results in a larger f/F0 value and smaller sedimentation coefficient). We have also included SEC-MALS data (Figure 6 S1) of IC<sub>1-88</sub> bound to p150<sub>CC1B</sub> that eliminates the possibility that more than a p150 dimer binds to IC, reaffirming that it is very unlikely that the surprisingly large AUC sedimentation coefficient of the dynein subcomplex with p150<sub>CC1B</sub> is due to a larger mass/binding stoichiometry than expected.</p><p>Multiple sources of complementary data to support a shape difference between subcomplexes are already included in the manuscript. For example, by SEC the dynein subcomplex with p150<sub>CC1B</sub> elutes earlier – also indicating a difference in shape/migration compared to the dynein subcomplex with NudE<sub>CC</sub>. AUC results are also consistent throughout the manuscript, regardless of length of the IC construct used (Figure 6 &amp; 9). We have attempted negative stain on the subcomplexes to further deconvolute the differences in shape/confirmation but have thus far been unsuccessful as the complexes dissociate at the concentrations needed for EM grids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors suggest that the binding of LC7 releases the auto-inhibitory interaction of IC, however, NMR does not directly support this conclusion (Figure 7B). Some discussion of why this long-range interaction inhibits the binding of NudE, but not LC7 itself, should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Edits have been made to the discussion to better explain why LC7 binding is not inhibited in the same manner as NudE<sub>CC</sub>. Briefly, LC7 is a globular protein and its binding site for IC is more complex than the binding site for IC on NudE. The LC7 binding site on IC is longer than the corresponding SAH region it covers in our autoinhibition model (Figure 10 – updates have been made to show the LC7 site as more exposed). In Figure 7B, IC<sub>1-260</sub> binds to both LC7 and NudE<sub>CC</sub> due to high protein concentrations and the unmatched sensitivity of NMR to binding interactions that likely captures the “open” minor states of IC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As indicated in the summary above more care should be placed on introducing the system.

Which biological outcomes are to be expected?</p></disp-quote><p>Edits have been made to Figure 1 with special care to panel B. For example, the light chains and IC have been drawn more to scale, each protein subunit of interest is now clearly labeled, the helices of IC are included, and the coiled-coil of p150 has been changed to match the coiled-coil representation used for NudE. Subunits of dynein that are of less interest for this work are purposefully shown more crudely, and this is now better acknowledged in the figure’s caption.</p><p>A more thorough introduction of dynein is now included in the introduction, including a highlight on diseases caused by dynein mutations and edits have been made to introduce the IC subcomplex more clearly. A clearer connection between disorder and regulation is also now included.</p><p>The discussion has been edited for length, eliminating repetition of what is included in Results sections and, most importantly, now ends with a much stronger overview of dynein autoinhibition and the biological relevance of the findings of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One of the conclusions is that the internal contacts occur between the C-terminal of the IC and SAH/H2, which is seen from the intensity changes in the HSQC spectra upon addition of the 160-240 construct to the 1-88 construct. However, adding the linker part from 100-160 produces a much more pronounced effect (Figure 5C, bottom), suggesting that residues in this region, which includes the Tctex and LC8 binding motifs play additional roles. Is the binding of the light chains to IC of higher affinity to the 100-160 protein than to the 1-260? In that case, this could suggest that also inhibitory access to these two sites occurs in the autoinhibited state. The additional effect of the 100-160 residues should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the question of whether the LC8 and Tctex binding sites are also inhibited, however we want to note that if this is the case, the effect is not pronounced enough to be seen by AUC experiments conducted with IC<sub>1-260</sub> or IC<sub>FL</sub>. Because it does not appear that LC8 and Tctex are inhibited in any of the AUC experiments we do not find it necessary to study the binding affinities further with ITC. Furthermore, residues 100-150 do not appear to impact p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and NudE<sub>CC</sub> binding (Figure 6C, middle panels) and so the additional effects of 100-160 although noteworthy, are not investigated further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Can H3 be excluded as a player in the internal interactions, just because you see binding to the LC7 site when studied in isolation? Once the LC7 regions is bound, H3 may also participate, as also clearly indicated from the data shown in Figure 4A. Using an H3 peptide would be relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that H3 cannot be completely excluded as a player in the internal interactions of IC, however, because the IC<sub>160-240</sub> construct which contains H3 showed minimal evidence of binding (Figure 5) we would not expect an H3 peptide to show different results. Figure 4A shows that there are no assignable peaks for the H3 region, but this does not automatically mean that H3 is involved in the internal interactions. It is common for helical regions to also have lower NMR peak intensities compared to disordered regions, which is another potential explanation for why H3 peaks are either missing or unassignable. Further, we did not focus further on H3 because it is specific to CT-IC and not observed in ICs from other species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Fig6B and associated text: there is a clear although weak loss in intensity/peak volume in the H2 region for the interaction with NudE. Why assume that there is no interaction? The affinity for NudE is lower, so the concentration of the complex will also be lower at similar conditions compared to that of p150, and this would give rise to the smaller effects in the spectra.

As now is more clearly stated in the text, the disappearance of IC<sub>1-88</sub> peaks for both the SAH and H2 regions with NudE<sub>CC</sub> can be explained by an interaction between the SAH and H2 regions identified by previously performed NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> IC. This inherent SAH/H2 interaction may cause some level of conformational exchange broadening when both the SAH and H2 regions are present, although it is clear from our data that H2 is not the driver of NudE/IC binding.</p><p>We do propose, as illustrated in Figure 10, that the weak binding between p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and H2 allows for p150 <sub>CC1B</sub> to bind IC despite the autoinhibition of the SAH region. As this binding is weak (~21 µM) we propose that IC autoinhibition is not completely relieved.</p><p>We were unable to find documentation comparing the relative concentrations of NudE and p150 in the cell and are therefore unable to comment on their competitiveness related to their affinities. This subject is further complicated by the fact that p150<sub>CC1B</sub> is a subunit of dynactin, a protein complex that binds to dynein independently of the interaction between p150<sub>CC1B</sub> and IC via other coiled-coil “activator” proteins.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have received the revised version of the manuscript by Jara et al.

You see evidence of binding at concentrations above the Kd (such as with the NMR), and for the ITC experiments, the concentrations possible are below the Kd. It is difficult to redo the ITC at NMR concentrations because these are protein-protein interactions with the protein in the syringe requiring to be about 10 times more concentrated than the protein in the cell, while for the NMR experiments, both proteins are mixed at similar concentrations and then the mixture is concentrated.</p><p>I hope this is explanation is now sufficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have thoroughly revised the manuscript and included further evidence to support their conclusion, and the relevance of the data for the biology of the protein complex is now addressed to some extent in the discussion.</p><p>A few comments remain:</p><p>Figure 1 has improved but can be further improved by adding N – and C to the IC ends, indicate the HC (heavy chain), LIC (dynein light intermediate chain), N-IC (N-terminal domain of IC), C-IC, SAH (single α helix), H2 (short helix), all of which are mentioned in the text.
