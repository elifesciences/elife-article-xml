cycles such that each ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to a step and enabling the motor to take many steps without dissociating. The neck linker, a structural element that connects the two heads, has been shown to be essential for head–head coordination; however, which kinetic step(s) in the chemomechanical cycle is ‘gated’ by the neck linker remains unresolved. Here, we employed pre-steady-state kinetics and single-molecule assays to investigate how the neck-linker conformation affects kinesin’s motility cycle. We show that the backward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the front kinesin head confers higher affinity for microtubule, but does not change ATP binding and dissociation rates. In contrast, the forward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the rear kinesin head decreases the ATP dissociation rate but has little effect on microtubule dissociation. In combination, these conformation-specific effects of the neck linker favor ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of the rear head prior to microtubule detachment of the front head, thereby providing a kinetic explanation for the coordinated walking mechanism of dimeric kinesin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>kinetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H03661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomishige</surname><given-names>Michio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20H05542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomishige</surname><given-names>Michio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP22H04850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomishige</surname><given-names>Michio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kinetic measurements of kinesin-1's front and rear heads reveal how different neck linker orientation regulate their activity, enabling the motor protein to move in a coordinated manner along microtubules.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin-1 (hereafter called kinesin) is a dimeric motor protein that transports intracellular cargo by moving along microtubules. The unidirectional motion of kinesin toward the plus-end of the microtubule is driven by an N-terminal globular domain (termed ‘head’) that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis and binds to the microtubule. The head is followed by a 14 amino acid segment called the ‘neck linker’ and then a long coiled-coil stalk that dimerizes the two identical polypeptide chains. Dimeric kinesin takes an 8-nm center-of-mass step by moving the rear head past the forward head along a microtubule protofilament once per ATP hydrolysis cycle; by alternating the movement of its two heads, kinesin can move processively for a micron or more without dissociating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asenjo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaseda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asbury et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yildiz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isojima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolff et al., 2023</xref>). The cycle of binding and dissociation of the head to/from the microtubule is tightly correlated with the ATPase cycle; release of ADP, creating a nucleotide-free state, stabilizes the microtubule binding of the head, while phosphate release after ATP hydrolysis induces detachment of the head from the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilbert and Johnson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma and Taylor, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cross, 2004</xref>). Therefore, to alternately move the two heads, the ATP hydrolysis cycles in the rear and/or front heads should be differentially regulated (gated), such that the rear head hydrolyzes ATP and detaches from the microtubule, prior to the front head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hackney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma and Taylor, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilbert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auerbach and Johnson, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cochran, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To gate the ATPase cycles during processive movement, there must be a structural mechanism that enables the two heads to communicate with one another. When both heads are bound to the adjacent tubulin-binding sites (two-head-bound state), the front and rear heads are separated by 8 nm and cannot directly interact with each other. However, their neck linkers are highly extended and adopt two distinct configurations: the neck linker in the front head is stretched backward, and the neck linker in the rear head is pointing forward, favoring the docked state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Skiniotis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tomishige et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Artificially extending the neck linkers by inserting polypeptide spacers reduces the coupling ratio between the forward step and ATP turnover, indicating that the strain transmitted through the neck linkers has an essential role in head–head coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hackney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isojima et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disulfide-crosslinking to constraint the neck linker in either the forward- or backward-pointing configuration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-dimensional structure of kinesin dimer on the microtubule in the two-head-bound intermediate state (modeled based on PDB# 4HNA and 4LNU).

One type of model proposes neck linker-based regulation of microtubule affinity. A ‘rear-head gating’ version of this model proposes that forward strain posed through the neck linker accelerates the detachment of the rear head. Evidence supporting this model is based on experiments showing that the two-headed kinesin hydrolyzes ATP and detaches from microtubule much faster than a one-headed kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hancock and Howard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crevel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schief et al., 2004</xref>) and that the detachment rate of the head from microtubule is faster under a forward than a rearward pulling force from an optical trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uemura et al., 2002</xref>). However, other experimental results showed that the detachment rate from the microtubule by the rear head of a dimer or of the monomer under assisting load was not significantly accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another class of gating models proposes that nucleotide state transition in the ATPase cycle is sensitive to neck-linker tension between the two heads. A ‘front-head gating’ model has been proposed that tension in the two-head-bound state decreases ATP binding in the front head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klumpp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guydosh and Block, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogan et al., 2015</xref>). Pre-steady-state kinetic measurements showed that binding of mant-ATP (a fluorescent analog that shows a signal change upon kinesin binding) to a microtubule-docked kinesin dimer showed single exponential kinetics with a signal amplitude nearly half than that expected if both heads can bind ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klumpp et al., 2004</xref>). However, interpreting these results is complex, since the amplitude and duration of the mant-ATP signal is a composite from the front and rear heads, which complicates the assignment of specific rate constants of nucleotide binding and unbinding or isomerization events to the two microtubule-bound heads.</p><p>In this study, we measured the ATP-binding and microtubule-detachment kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) of the front and rear heads separately using pre-steady-state and single-molecule measurements. To isolate and measure the kinetics of the front and rear head states separately, we utilized two methods: (1) disulfide-crosslinking to immobilize the neck linker in monomeric kinesin in the forward- or backward-pointing configurations (mimicking the rear and front head states, respectively), and (2) a heterodimeric kinesin in which one polypeptide chain was locked in neck linker docked rear head conformation. Our results provide quantitative evidence that both kinesin heads participate in a coordinated gating mechanism: the backward constraint of the neck linker in the front head reduces its detachment rate from microtubules without changing ATP on/off rates, while the forward constraint on the neck linker in the rear head dramatically reduces ATP dissociation rate but has minimal effect on microtubule affinity. These results are consistent with the open and closed conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket in the front and rear heads of microtubule-bound kinesin dimers observed in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoit et al., 2021</xref>) and provide a mechanism for the coordinated hand-over-hand movement of kinesin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Controlling the neck-linker orientation of monomer kinesin through crosslinking</title><p>We first sought to examine the kinetics of nucleotide binding and microtubule dissociation of monomeric kinesin in which the neck linker was oriented either in the forward (mimicking the rear head) or the rearward (mimicking the front head) direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C</xref>). To control the orientation of the neck linker in monomer kinesin, we employed disulfide-crosslinks between two cysteines, one on the head and the other on the neck linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomishige and Vale, 2000</xref>). To immobilize the neck linker in this forward-pointing, docked conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>), K222 (located at the plus-end oriented tip of the head) and E334 (the distal end of the docked neck linker) residues were substituted with cysteines in a Cys-light monomeric kinesin (K339 Cys-light), whose solvent-exposed cysteines were replaced by either Ser or Ala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left).

The crosslinking efficiencies were estimated, by running SDS–PAGE under non-reducing conditions, to be 97% and 87% for the rear and front head crosslinks, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We first evaluated the effect of disulfide-crosslinking on the microtubule-activated ATP turnover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The reduced ATPase activity primarily results from a decreased microtubule association rate (data to be presented elsewhere) with little change in ATP binding or microtubule dissociation rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For the rear head crosslink, the reduced ATPase activity might also be due to the presence of crosslinked species even under the reducing condition (~30%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Using a wild-type kinesin dimer, we demonstrated that Alexa-ATP acts as a substrate to drive kinesin motility along microtubules, although velocities were about 10-fold lower than those driven by unmodified ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). First, we observed single-molecule FRET of ATTO488-labeled ‘wild-type’ monomer on microtubule in the presence of 500 nM Alexa-ATP. We observed FRET efficiency increases upon Alexa-ATP binding to microtubule-bound monomer, and then the donor and acceptor simultaneously disappeared (representing that the head dissociated from microtubule after ATP hydrolysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left), or the donor fluorescence recovered after the disappearance of the acceptor fluorescence (representing that ATP dissociated while the head remains bound to the microtubule; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right). We found that the ATP bound to the wild-type head could be either hydrolyzed, followed by head dissociation from the microtubule, or reversibly dissociated with nearly equal probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

In contrast, the single-molecule FRET observation of Cy3-labeled E236A monomer in the presence of 200 nM Alexa-ATP showed that the majority of the Cy3-labeled mutant remained bound to the microtubule during the observation period, and Alexa-ATP molecules repeatedly bound and reversibly dissociated to/from the mutant head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Since monomeric kinesin repeatedly hydrolyzes ATP per encounter to the microtubule through electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang and Hackney, 1997</xref>), we included 150 mM KCl to prevent reassociation of the detached head. However, the rear head crosslink kinesin did not show any initial burst in turbidity after oxidative treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) because this constraint on the neck linker dramatically reduces the microtubule-activated ADP release rate (data to be presented elsewhere), creating a weak microtubule binding state.

To test this, we crosslinked the neck linker in the backward orientation between C47 on the head and C335 on the neck linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right), which produces an extra seven amino acids compared to C47/C328 between the base and the crosslinked residues on the neck linker, allowing the initial few residues of the neck linker (including I325 residue involved in filling the hydrophobic pocket exposed on the ATP-bound head; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vale and Milligan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sindelar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2014</xref>) to dock onto the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We examined an alternate crosslinking scheme between C4 on the N-terminal stretch and C330 on the neck linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomishige and Vale, 2000</xref>), which couples the neck linker with the N-terminal flexible segment called ‘cover strand (CS)’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left). The interaction between the neck linker and CS has been shown to be important to produce a forward bias in the diffusional motion of the detached head against hindering load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>).

However, it differs from that of the front head in that the backward-pointing configuration is maintained by the crosslinking, not by the backward strain originating from the stretched neck linkers between two microtubule-bound heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyeon and Onuchic, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hariharan and Hancock, 2009</xref>). We sought to further investigate how the neck-linker tension contributes to the front-head gating by examining the nucleotide-binding and microtubule-detachment kinetics of the front head in the context of a dimeric kinesin. To this end, we employed a heterodimer in which one polypeptide is wild-type (WT) and the other contains the E236A mutation (E236A–WT heterodimer). As described above, the E236A mutant acts as a long-lived rear head, which is kinetically trapped in the neck-linker docked, pre-ATP hydrolysis state. Thus, in the E236A–WT heterodimer in the presence of ATP, one would expect the E236A head to be in the rear and the WT head to occupy the front.</p><p>To test this assumption, we used the smFRET sensor, which has been used to distinguish the configurations of two heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mori et al., 2007</xref>). We first introduced one cysteine into the residue 215 (located at the plus-end oriented tip of the head) of the E236A chain and another into the residue 43 (located at the minus-end oriented base of the head) of the WT chain and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, left). The FRET efficiency of dual-labeled molecules bound to the microtubule in the presence of ATP showed a single peak at about 90%. When we introduced 43Cys into the E236A chain and 215Cys into the WT chain, however, the distribution of the FRET efficiency showed a single peak at about 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, right). These results are consistent with the E236A–WT heterodimer stably taking a two-head-bound state, in which the WT head is in the front and the E236A head is in the rear position.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ATP-binding kinetics of the front and rear heads of the heterodimer</title><p>First, we measured the steady-state microtubule-activated ATPase activity of the E236A–WT heterodimer.

Unlike the unbound trailing head of wild-type dimer that showed continuous mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isojima et al., 2016</xref>), the unbound WT head of E236A–WT heterodimer exhibited a low-fluctuation state in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and s.d. traces). This low-fluctuation unbound state was distinguishable from the typical microtubule-bound state, having a shorter dwell time of ~5 ms compared to the bound state and positioning backward, closer to the E236A head, relative to the bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In this state, both neck linkers are docked onto the head, and as a result, the mobility of the unbound head is limited due to the restricted degree of freedom in the neck linkers. Finally, the neck linker of the unbound head undocks, transitioning into the highly mobile state 3 (ADP-bound/semi-open state), which allows the unbound head to bind to the tubulin-binding site and release ADP.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5s2sdata1"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Excel file containing dwell time histogram data of unbound state for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-106228-fig5-figsupp2-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5s2sdata2"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 2—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Excel file containing 2D histogram data of unbound state for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-106228-fig5-figsupp2-data2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106228-fig5-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Distributions of the dwell time in the bound and unbound states of the leading WT head of E236A–WT heterodimer.</title><p>Histograms of the dwell time in the bound (<italic>τ</italic> <sub>bound</sub>) and unbound (<italic>τ</italic> <sub>unbound</sub>) states of the gold-labeled WT head of the E236A–WT heterodimer at various ATP concentrations.

These findings differ from a prevailing view that the ATP-binding step is gated in the front head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klumpp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guydosh and Block, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogan et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found that the ATP-induced detachment rates from microtubule (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) were similarly reduced for both the front head crosslink (7.0 s<sup>–1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the front WT head of the E236A/WT heterodimer (6.3 s<sup>–1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that a step subsequent to ATP binding is gated in the front head. These results are consistent with an inability of the front head to fully close its nucleotide pocket to promote ATP hydrolysis and Pi release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2023</xref>), as will be discussed later.</p><p>We also provide evidence for a rear-head gating mechanism that involves a tighter affinity for ATP (due to a decrease in reversible ATP dissociation rate <italic>k</italic><sub>−1</sub>) without a change in microtubule affinity in the ATP-bound state. The <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ATP for the front head crosslink and the monomer without constraint are similar (~20 µM) and substantially higher than our estimated 4 nM <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ATP for the rear E236A head of the E236A–WT heterodimer. We note, however, that this <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ATP may somewhat underestimate the actual value in wild-type kinesin for two reasons: first, the E236A mutation likely stabilizes the neck linker docked, closed state more than in the rear head of the wild-type dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 1999</xref>), and second, the Alexa-ATP used to measure the ATP off-rate of E236A head showed ~10-fold smaller velocity compared to unmodified ATP, partly due to a slower ATP off-rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). While these caveats may diminish the observed 5000-fold difference in the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ATP in native kinesin, these results nevertheless point to the large difference in ATP affinity between the front and rear heads. The difference in the ATP-affinity between the front and rear heads can explain previous experimental results supporting the front-head gating mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uemura and Ishiwata, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klumpp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guydosh and Block, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogan et al., 2015</xref>), although our direct kinetic measurements show that this difference is manifest through in a stronger affinity for ATP in the rear head rather than a weaker affinity in the front head. While the neck-linker position of the rear head increases the affinity of bound ATP, it does not significantly accelerate <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, which includes the ATP hydrolysis and Pi release steps in the nucleotide catalysis cycle.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kinetic gating aids head–head coordination but does not prevent progression through the ATPase cycle</title><p>Our results show that the front-head gate slows down but does not block its ATPase cycle. The ATP-induced microtubule-detachment rate <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> of the front head is 6–7 s<sup>–1</sup> (7.0 s<sup>–1</sup> for the front head monomer crosslink and 6.3 s<sup>–1</sup> for the front head of E236A–WT heterodimer), which is similar to its overall ATPase rate (4.6 s<sup>–1</sup>). These rate constants are sufficiently low to keep the catalytic cycles of two heads largely out of phase, since the detachment rate of the rear head of wild-type dimer (inverse of the dwell time from two-head- to one-head-bound state during processive movement) is ~100 s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isojima et al., 2016</xref>). The observed detachment of the front head of the E236A–WT heterodimer is likely caused by ATP hydrolysis of the front head, because (1) the ATP turnover rate of this heterodimer was similar to the <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> value, and (2) the dwell time of the bound state of the front head on microtubule was dependent on the ATP concentration. These results suggest that the kinesin’s head can slowly hydrolyze ATP and detach from the microtubule without the aid of neck-linker docking. This idea can explain how the kinesin dimer takes repetitive back steps under large hindering loads. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Cross, 2005</xref> showed that kinesin takes 8 nm backward steps at supra-stall forces (&gt;7 pN) exerted using an optical trap and that the stepping rate was dependent on the ATP concentration (~0.3 and ~1 step/s at 1 mM and 10 µM ATP conditions, respectively), which are comparable to the dwell times that we found for the microtubule-bound state of the front head of E236A–WT heterodimer (0.16 and 1.1 s at 1 mM and 10 µM ATP, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that the back steps or slips are likely caused by the neck-linker docking-independent slow ATP catalysis of the front head, followed by its dissociation from the microtubule in an ADP-bound state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A kinetic and structural model for kinesin gating</title><p>The difference in the ATP-binding affinity between the front (low affinity) and rear (high affinity) heads suggests a structural difference in their nucleotide binding pockets. Indeed, the high ATP affinity state of the neck linker docked rear head is consistent with a ‘closed’ nucleotide pocket observed in crystal and cryo-EM structures of kinesin-1 bound to tubulin and complexed with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog in kinesin’s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, a recent high-resolution cryo-EM image of the microtubule-bound KIF14 dimer showed that while they could observe nucleotide in the active site of the front head, the structure of the pocket was more ‘open’ and similar to that of a nucleotide-free head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoit et al., 2021</xref>). Since the switch I and II loops that are involved in the hydrolysis reaction are positioned away from the γ-phosphate in the opened nucleotide pocket, the open state is incompatible with ATP hydrolysis, while the closed state is competent in ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kull and Endow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, these structural features are consistent with our kinetics results.</p><p>These findings suggest that the isomerization from the open to closed conformational state, rather than the transitions between nucleotide states, is gated by the neck-linker constraint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This aligns with our structural modeling of the kinesin dimer in the two-head-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makino et al., 2024</xref>), which showed that conformational transitions are suppressed for both the front head (from open to closed state) and the rear head (from closed to open state), as these changes would cause an intolerable increase in tension on the disordered neck-linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We demonstrated, using the loose C47/C335 backward crosslink of the neck linker, that neck-linker docking is responsible for opening the gate (i.e., the open-to-closed transition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). The C47/C335 crosslink forms a short 7-amino acid flexible loop, which is insufficient for the formation of two β-sheets (residues 326–334) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, it allows the conformational transition of the initial segment of the neck linker (residues 323–325); K323 and T324 residues form an α-helix extending the C-terminus of α6, while the I325 residue plays a particularly important role in docking onto the hydrophobic pocket exposed on the closed head. Given that the hydrophobic pocket is positioned forward from the neck linker’s base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the docking of the I325 side chain is suppressed in the front head, as it would cause an intolerable increase in tension (entropy decrease) on the disordered neck linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makino et al., 2024</xref>), thus maintaining the open state. The neck-linker extension had a smaller effect on front-head gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), likely because a stable interaction between the I325 side chain and the hydrophobic pocket is necessary to maintain the closed state until ATP hydrolysis completes. In contrast, the neck-linker extension had a larger effect on the rear head’s ATP affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This is probably because the rear head can occasionally transition back to an open state (followed by reversible ATP release) without tension on the neck linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, forward strain plays a crucial role in aiding I325 residue docking and stabilizing the closed state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model to explain how the tension exerted by the stretched neck linker in dimeric kinesin coordinates the microtubule detachment of the two heads.</title><p>This model is based on the proposal that the transition between ATP-bound open and closed conformations of the head is regulated by the neck-linker strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the two-head-bound state, the front head remains in the open state because the backward strain prevents it from transitioning to the closed state. In this state, ATP can weakly bind to the nucleotide pocket but often dissociates. Conversely, the rear head is stabilized in the closed state because the transition to the open state is suppressed by the forward strain. ATP is tightly bound to the closed nucleotide pocket, causing the rear head to hydrolyze ATP and detach from the microtubule before the front head does. In the one-head-bound state, the microtubule-bound head can transition between the open and closed states. However, once the tethered head binds preferentially to the forward tubulin-binding site, the strain built up between the two microtubule-bound heads stabilizes the rear head in the closed conformation and the front head in the open conformation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106228-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Structural difference between the open and closed conformational states of the kinesin head.</title><p>The structural model of dimeric kinesin is based on PDB# 4HNA (rear head in closed conformation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>) and 4LNU (front head in open conformation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2014</xref>).

In the rear head, ATP binding is followed rapidly by an isomerization step that closes the nucleotide pocket, decreasing the rate of nucleotide dissociation and facilitating ATP hydrolysis. This conformational change is facilitated by the docking of the neck linker in its forward orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2023</xref>). In the front head, in contrast, the backward conformation of the neck linker favors an open nucleotide pocket, which helps to prevent the microtubule-bound front head from proceeding with ATP hydrolysis before the rear head detaches. Once the rear head detaches, the front head ‘gate’ is relieved, allowing the neck linker to dock and its nucleotide pocket to close. This asynchrony in the timing of ATP hydrolysis minimizes the likelihood of both heads simultaneously entering an ADP state and dissociating from the microtubule. Recent cryo-EM studies and modeling of the kinesin dimer under various nucleotide states support the proposal that the open-to-closed conformational transition is gated by the neck-linker strain; however, direct evidence for this conformational transition in the context of a processively moving kinesin dimer would help to further substantiate this model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA cloning and protein purification</title><p>We used a 339 amino acid ‘cysteine-light’ mutant or a 349 amino acid wild-type human kinesin-1 monomer as a template for mutagenesis.

We used ATTO 488 (WT monomer) and Cy3 (others) as a donor fluorophore. ATTO 488 was excited with 488 nm diode laser (Cyan-75-TA-FE; Spectra-Physics Inc) and Cy3 was excited with 515 nm diode laser (EXLSR-515-50-CDTF-E, Spectra-Physics Inc). Fluorescent signals were collected through objective lens and a specific filter for cutting of the excitation light and projected on a cooled EMCCD camera. For smFRET observations, fluorescent signal was separated using dichroic mirror and donor and acceptor fluorescence were simultaneously observed. Position of microtubule was identified based on the fluorescence from the labeled kinesin. When more than five fluorescent spots of donor fluorophore lied on a straight line, we assumed that these spots were on the microtubule. FRET data were collected at 10- and 200-ms exposure times for wild-type monomer and for E236A monomer and E236A–WT heterodimer, respectively, at 22°C. We identified ATP binding to the kinesin head when the FRET efficiency exceeded a threshold of 0.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gold labeling of kinesin</title><p>Purified kinesin was biotinylated, and biotinylated kinesin was bound to microtubules in the presence of AMP-PNP as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isojima et al., 2016</xref>).

The ‘bound’ and ‘unbound’ states of gold-labeled kinesin heads were determined as follows: two-dimensional standard deviation (s.d.) of the trajectory for each time frame <italic>t</italic> was calculated as [<italic>t</italic> − 20, <italic>t</italic> + 20] and the median <italic>μ</italic> and s.d. <italic>σ</italic> of the s.d. of the trajectory was determined by fitting the histogram of the s.d. with a Gaussian function.

The accurate frame of the transition was determined by fitting the on- and off-axis trajectory near the transition with two state step function. In the case of G0 construct, if two unbound states were closer than 50 ms and on-axis average of the bound state between these unbound states was separated from the other bound states, these unbound and bound states were determined as unbound states 1–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Previous studies in the field showed that kinesin walks by alternating stepping of its heads, referred to as hand-over-hand. In this stepping mechanism, the front head of a kinesin dimer must remain bound until the rear head dissociates from the microtubule, moves forward, and rebinds to the tubulin on the plus-end side of the front head. There is a large body of work done to address this question. These studies all point to the central role of the 14 amino acid extension, a neck-linker, which connects the two heads to a common stalk, in coordination of kinesin motility. In a two-head-bound state, the motor domains (heads) are oriented parallel to the microtubule, but the neck linkers are orienting toward each other, thereby, breaking the symmetry in a homodimeric motor. In addition, the neck linkers are quite short, almost stretching to their near contour length to accommodate the microtubule binding of both heads. Previous studies pointed out that either the opposing orientation or the intramolecular tension of the neck linkers coordinate the stepping cycle.</p><p>However, we still do not know which step(s) in the chemo-mechanical cycle is controlled by the neck-linker to keep the two heads out of phase. The front head gating model postulates that ATP binding to the front head is gated until the rear head detaches from the microtubule. The rear head gating model proposes that the neck linker accelerates the detachment of the rear head from the microtubule. In this study, the authors use pre-steady state kinetics and smFRET to address this question. They measured ATP binding and microtubule detachment kinetics of kinesin's catalytic domain with neck linker constraints (1) imposed by disulfide crosslinking of the neck linker in monomeric kinesin in backward (rear head-like) and forward (front head-like) orientations, and (2) using the E236A-WT heterodimer to create a two-head microtubule-bound state with the mutant and WT heads occupying the rear and front positions respectively. They found that neck-linker conformation of the rear head reduces the ATP dissociation rate but has little effect on microtubule affinity. In comparison, the neck-linker conformation of the front head does not change ATP binding to the front head, but it reduces ATP-induced detachment of the front head, suggesting that a step after ATP binding (i.e. ATP hydrolysis or Pi release) is gated in the front head.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>I believe that this work will make an important contribution to the large body of literature focused on the mechanism of kinesin, which serves as an excellent model system to understand the kinetics and mechanics of a molecular motor. The mechanism proposed by the authors modifies the front-head gating model and is in agreement with recent structural work done on a kinesin dimer bound to a microtubule. Overall, the work is well performed, and the conclusions are well supported by the experimental data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106228.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors investigate the molecular mechanism behind kinesin-1's coordinated movement along microtubules, with a focus on how ATP binding, hydrolysis, and microtubule attachment/detachment are regulated in the leading and trailing heads.

Its movement relies on the ability of its two catalytic motor domains (heads) to couple microtubule interactions with directional conformational changes and ATP turnover in a coordinated, alternating manner. The kinetics of these processes in each head are tightly regulated (gated) to ensure that at least one motor domain remains bound to the microtubule at all times, preventing detachment.</p><p>Niitani et al. investigated the gating mechanism by focusing on the role of the neck linker, a flexible region extending from the motor domain's C-terminus that undergoes conformational changes during stepping. They examined how the neck linker differentially regulates the microtubule affinity and ATP turnover of the front and rear heads. To do this, they designed cross-linkable monomeric motor domains mimicking the conformations of the front and rear heads and employed a combination of pre-steady-state and single-molecule analyses to measure ATP-binding and microtubule-detachment kinetics. Additionally, they studied a kinesin heterodimer with a locked rear head conformation to distinguish the kinetic properties of the front and rear heads within an active dimer.</p><p>ATP binding rates were measured using stopped-flow experiments with mant-ATP and nucleotide-free kinesin-microtubule complexes. The results showed that crosslinking the neck linker in the forward-pointing conformation (mimicking the rear head) reduced the ATP dissociation rate, while crosslinking it in the rear-pointing conformation (mimicking the front head) had no significant effect on ATP binding kinetics. ATP dissociation from the rear head was further examined using a kinesin mutant (E236A) that stabilizes the ATP-bound state by significantly slowing ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>To assess how neck-linker orientation affects microtubule attachment, the authors monitored turbidity changes after rapidly mixing nucleotide-free, crosslinked kinesin-microtubule complexes with ATP in a stopped-flow apparatus. Their findings demonstrated that the forward-oriented neck linker in the rear head promotes microtubule detachment, whereas the backward-oriented neck linker in the front head reduces detachment rates.</p><p>These results indicate that neck-linker conformation governs gating of microtubule affinity and nucleotide binding. Moreover, they show that even partial docking of the neck linker onto the head is sufficient to partially open the gating mechanism. To further investigate the role of neck linker tension, the authors created kinesin dimers with neck linker insertions of varying lengths. Microtubule detachment kinetics and ATPase activity assays revealed that ATP turnover in the rear head is significantly affected by the degree of forward tension applied to its neck linker.</p><p>Overall, Niitani et al. build upon previous kinesin gating models by introducing a neck-linker tension-based ATP binding affinity mechanism. Their findings provide a mechanistic basis for recent cryo-EM observations for kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 (KIF14) and distinguish the specific roles of neck linker tension in the front and rear heads in regulating ATP binding, hydrolysis, and microtubule detachment. This study is biochemically rigorous and makes an important contribution, though direct structural validation (e.g., cryo-EM snapshots of crosslinked or mutant kinesins bound to microtubules) would further strengthen their conclusions and clarify the asymmetry in ATP affinity between the front and rear heads.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106228.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Niitani</surname><given-names>Yamato</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Tokyo</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tokyo</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Matsuzaki</surname><given-names>Kohei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aoyama Gakuin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sagamihara</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jonsson</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ashburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tomishige</surname><given-names>Michio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aoyama Gakuin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sagamihara</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for the detailed evaluations and thoughtful comments, which have improved the clarity and readability of this manuscript.

(1) They used a cys-lite kinesins mutant and introduced new surface-exposed cysteines. These mutants have lower kcat values than WT. (2) They used fluorescently labeled ATP molecules, which are hydrolyzed 10 times slower than unlabeled nucleotides. (3) They still observe crosslinking under reducing conditions and partial (but almost complete) crosslinking under oxidized conditions. (4) They assumed that cysteine crosslinked orientation mimics the orientation of the neck-linker in the front and rear conditions. The authors clearly pointed to these issues in the Results section. While these assumptions are also supported by several control experiments, the authors need to acknowledge some of these limitations in the Discussion as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now reiterated some of the key caveats in the Discussion, and newly described in the Results section those points not mentioned in the original manuscript that do not affect the conclusion. We also added a summary of the limitations and caveats into the first paragraph of the Discussion section (lines 425-431).</p><p>(1) We added a sentence in the Results section to describe that the ATP-binding kinetics of the Cys-light mutant remained consistent with previous studies as follows: “First, we demonstrated that <italic>k+1</italic> and <italic>k-1</italic> of the wild-type head without Cys-modification were unchanged after oxidization (Table 1) and were comparable to those previously reported (Cross, 2004)” (lines 163-166). The reduced kcat values of cysteine pair-added mutants before crosslinking were primarily due to reduced microtubule association rate (data not included in this manuscript). We have added a sentence in the Results section describing the kcat results as follows: “The reduced ATPase activity primarily results from a decreased microtubule association rate (data to be presented elsewhere) with little change in ATP binding or microtubule dissociation rates (Table 1).” (lines 144-146).</p><p>(2) Fluorescently-labeled ATP was used to determine the ATP off-rates of the E236A mutant monomer and E236A rear head of the E236A/WT heterodimer. Two caveats in these measurements could lead to underestimating the ATP off-rate: (1) The off rate of Alexa-ATP from the head may be reduced compared to unmodified ATP, as Alexa-ATP driven motility showed a 10-fold reduce velocity. (2) The ATP off-rate of the E236A mutant may differ from that of the rear head in the wild-type dimer, since the E236A mutant likely stabilizes the neck linker-docked state more strongly than in the rear head of the wild-type dimer. These points are crucial for evaluating the results of ATP off-rate and the affinity for ATP, so we have added sentences in the Discussion section as follows: “We note, however, that this <italic>Kd</italic> of ATP may somewhat underestimate the true value in wild-type kinesin for two reasons: first, the E236A mutation likely stabilizes the neck linker-docked, closed state more than in the rear head of the wild-type dimer (Rice et al., 1999), and second, the Alexa-ATP used to measure the ATP off-rate of E236A head showed ~10-fold smaller velocity compared to unmodified ATP, partly due to a slower ATP off-rate (Figure 2-figure supplement 3).” (lines 449-454).</p><p>(3) Under reducing condition, the rear head crosslink contained 30% crosslinked species, while under oxidized condition, the front head crosslink contained 11% un-crosslinked species (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). These heterogeneities likely affect the rate constants of <italic>K-1</italic> for rear head crosslink and <italic>K2</italic> for front head crosslink, as crosslinked and un-crosslinked species showed significantly different rate constants. However, we did not use the rear head crosslink result to determine <italic>K-1</italic>, since ATP hydrolysis likely occurred before reversible ATP dissociation. Instead, we used E236A monomer to estimate the <italic>K-1</italic> of the rear head. In addition, the result for <italic>K2</italic> of the front head crosslink was further validated using the E236A/WT heterodimer, which will be described in the next section.</p><p>(4) This is an important point, and therefore, we conducted experiments using the E236A/WT heterodimer (including new experimental results of ATP binding kinetics of the front head) and obtained consistent results. To address this point, we have revised the following sentences in the Discussion: “In the front head, backward orientation of the neck linker has little effect on ATP binding and dissociation rates, both when measured for a monomer crosslink (Figure 2A, B) and for the front head of a E236A-WT heterodimer (Figure 4B, C, F).” (lines 432-433); “However, we found that the ATP-induced detachment rates from microtubule (<italic>K2</italic>) were similarly reduced for both the front head crosslink (7.0 s<sup>-1</sup>; Figure 3A) and the front WT head of the E236A/WT heterodimer (6.3 s<sup>-1</sup>; Figures 6D), suggesting that a step subsequent to ATP binding is gated in the front head.” (lines 437-441).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 238, the authors wrote that &quot;forward constraint on the neck linker in the rear head does not significantly accelerate the detachment from the microtubule.&quot; Can the authors comment on why the read-head-like construct has a low affinity for microtubules even in the absence of ATP (Line 220)? I believe that the low affinity of the head in this conformation is more striking (and potentially more important) than the changes they observe in detachment rates. The authors should also consider that they might not be able to reliably measure the changes in the dissociation rate in single molecule assays of this construct (especially if the release rate of the rear head in the oxidized condition increases a lot higher than that of WT). The kymographs show infrequent and brief events, which raises doubts about how reliably they can measure the release rates under those imaging conditions. Higher motor concentrations and faster imaging rates may address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>The low microtubule affinity of the rear-head-like crosslink stems from an extremely slow ADP release rate upon microtubule binding, not from a fast microtubule-detachment rate. Using stopped-flow measurements of microtubule-binding kinetics (microtubule-stimulated mant-ADP release and microtubule association rates), we found that the rear-head-crosslink resulted in a 2,000-fold decrease in the microtubule-stimulated ADP-release rate. This finding also explains the reduced ATPase of the rear-head-crosslink (Figure 1E). Since this low microtubule-affinity state occurs in the ADP-bound state rather than the ATP-bound state, we hypothesized that the neck-linker docked ADP-bound state cannot effectively bind to microtubules, requiring neck-linker undocking for microtubule binding (Mattson-Hoss et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 111, 7000-7005 (2014)). While we acknowledge that understanding slow microtubule binding in the neck linker docked state is important for elucidating the mechanism and regulation of microtubule-binding of the head, this paper focuses specifically on the mechanism and regulation of “microtubule-detachment”. We plan to present these microtubule-binding kinetics data in a separate manuscript currently in preparation.</p><p>To explain the low microtubule affinity of the rear-head-crosslink, we added this explanation to the text; “because this constraint on the neck linker dramatically reduces the microtubule-activated ADP release rate (data to be presented elsewhere), creating a weak microtubule binding state” (lines 226-228).</p><p>Although the rear head crosslinking construct under oxidative condition showed fewer fluorescent spots per kymographs (images) due to its low microtubule binding rate, we collected more than one hundred spots by recording additional microscope movies (N=140; Figure 3-figure supplement 2B), ensuring sufficient data for statistical analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: How do the rates shown in Figure 2A-B compare to the previous kinetics studies in the field? The authors compare the dissociation rate of WT measured in rapid mixing experiments to that of E236A in smFRET assays. It is not clear whether these comparisons can be made reliably using different assays. Can the authors perform rapid mixing of E236A or try to determine the rate for the WT from smFRET trajectories?</p></disp-quote><p>The results of ATP on/off rates are comparable to the previous stopped flow measurements of ATP binding to monomeric kinesin-1 on microtubule, which are 2-5 µM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and ~150 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (summarized in the review by Cross (2004)). We added a sentence as follows: “First, we demonstrated that <italic>K+1</italic> and <italic>K-1</italic> of the wild-type head without Cys-modification were unchanged after oxidization (Table 1) and were comparable to those previously reported (Cross, 2004).” (lines 163-166).</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the rapid mixing and smFRET data cannot be directly compared due to the differences in temporal resolution and fluorescent probe used. In Figure 2E (2F in the revised version), we measured ATP dissociation rate for both WT and E236A using smFRET. Due to the lower temporal resolution, we could not accurately determine ATP binding rate using smFRET. Therefore, to compare the ATP binding rate between WT and E236A heads, we now have added stopped-flow measurements of mant-ATP binding to the E236A monomer, as shown in Fig. 2C and Figure 2-supplement 2, and described in the text (lines 182-185).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 396: One of the most significant conclusions of this work is that the backward orientation of the neck linker has little effect on ATP binding to the front head. This is only supported by the results shown in Fig. 2A-B. Can the authors perform/analyze smFRET assays on the E236A/WT heterodimer to directly show whether the ATP binding rate to the WT head is affected or not affected by the orientation of the neck linker of the WT head?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our finding about ATP binding to the front head is potentially significant in the kinesin field, as it has been widely believed that ATP-binding is suppressed in the front head. In our original manuscript, this conclusion was supported only by the measurement of ATP on-rate of the front-head-crosslink, which may differ from the front head of a dimer in which the backward orientation of the neck linker is maintained by the backward strain. Although the reviewer suggested performing smFRET experiments using E236A/WT heterodimer, smFRET have relatively low temporal resolution (50-100 fps) and cannot accurately measure the frequency of ATP binding, so we used this technique only to determine ATP off rates. In this revised manuscript, we now have added stopped-flow experiments to separately measure the ATP binding to the front and rear heads of the E236A/WT heterodimer. By labeling the rear E236A head with a fluorophore to quench the mant-ATP signal bound to the rear head, we successfully measured mant-ATP binding rate to the front head. We found that the ATP-binding rate to the front head was comparable to that of an unconstrained monomer head, providing direct evidence for our conclusion. The revised version includes Fig. 4 A-C (with Figure 4-supplement 2; Figs. 4 and 5 are swapped in order) showing the kinetics of ATP binding to the front and rear heads of the E236A/WT heterodimer, with corresponding text in the result section (lines 315-324).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MINOR CONCERNS</p><p>Lines 31 and 32: I recommend replacing &quot;ATP affinity&quot; with &quot;ATP binding rate&quot; or &quot;the dissociation of ATP&quot; to be more specific.

In contrast, the rear E236A head showed virtually no ATP hydrolysis activity, since in high-speed dark field microscopy, we observed forward step caused by rear E236A head detachment from microtubule only rarely, approximately once every few seconds (Figure 5-figure supplement 1).

This finding suggests that ATP binding to the microtubule-bound E236A head is sometimes necessary for the detached WT head to rebind to the forward-tubulin binding site, indicating that the microtubule-bound E236A head occasionally releases ATP during the one-head-bound state (without the forward neck linker strain). To describe the ATP-dependence of the unbound dwell time, we added a sentence in the main text as follows: “In contrast, the dwell time of the unbound state of the gold-labeled WT head showed weak ATP dependence (Figure 5-figure supplement 2), indicating that the rear E236A head occasionally releases ATP when the front head detaches from the microtubule and the neck linker of E236A head becomes unconstrainted.

(2021) differs from the backstep motion reported by Carter and Cross (and many other laboratories). Slip motion occurs after kinesin detaches from the microtubule and continues until the bead returns to the trap center. In contrast, backstep motion occurs during processive movement when the trap force either exceeds or approaches the stall force. The kinetics of these motions also differ significantly: slip steps occur with a dwell time of 71 µs and are independent of ATP concentration, while backsteps take ~0.3 s (at 1 mM ATP) and depend on ATP concentration. These differences indicate that slip motion is phenomenologically distinct from backsteps occurring under supra-stall or near-stall force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 474: Replace &quot;suppresses&quot; with &quot;suppressed&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4E: I would plot these results with increasing ATP concentration on the x-axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We formatted Figure 4E to match Figure 4b from Isojima et al.
