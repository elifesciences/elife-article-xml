The hypothalamus plays a role in such behaviors, but prevailing textbook views depict it as an effector of upstream emotion centers, such as the amygdala, rather than as an emotion center itself. We used optogenetic manipulations to probe the function of a specific hypothalamic cell type that mediates innate defensive responses. These neurons are sufficient to drive multiple defensive actions, and required for defensive behaviors in diverse contexts. The behavioral consequences of activating these neurons, moreover, exhibit properties characteristic of emotion states in general, including scalability, (negative) valence, generalization and persistence. Importantly, these neurons can also condition learned defensive behavior, further refuting long-standing claims that the hypothalamus is unable to support emotional learning and therefore is not an emotion center. These data indicate that the hypothalamus plays an integral role to instantiate emotion states, and is not simply a passive effector of upstream emotion centers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06633.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06633.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06633.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals have evolved a large number of ‘defensive behaviors’ to deal with the threat of predators. Examples include reptiles camouflaging themselves to avoid discovery, fish and birds swarming to confuse predators, insects releasing toxic chemicals, and humans readying themselves to fight or flee.</p><p>In mammals, defensive behaviors are thought to be mediated by a region of the brain called the amygdala. This structure, which is known as the brain's ‘emotion center’, receives and processes information from the senses about impending threats. It then sends instructions on how to deal with these threats to other regions of the brain including the hypothalamus, which pass them on to the brain regions that control the behavioral, endocrine and involuntary responses of the mammal.</p><p>For many years it has been thought that the role of the hypothalamus is to serve simply as a relay for emotion states encoded in the amygdala, rather than as an emotion center itself. However, Kunwar et al. have now challenged this assumption with the aid of a technique called optogenetics, in which light is used to activate specific populations of genetically labeled neurons. When light was used to directly activate neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus in awake mice, the animals instantly froze and/or fled, just as they would when faced with a predator. Given that the optical stimulation had completely bypassed the amygdala, this suggested that the hypothalamus must be capable of generating this defensive response without any input from the amygdala.</p><p>The freezing and fleeing responses resembled the responses to a predator in a number of key ways. Mice chose to avoid areas of their cage in which they had received the stimulation, suggesting that—like a predator—these areas induced an unpleasant emotional state, perhaps akin to anxiety or fear. Freezing and fleeing persisted for several seconds after the stimulation had stopped, just as freezing and fleeing responses to predators do not immediately cease after the threat has gone. And finally, destroying the neurons targeted by the stimulation made mice less likely to avoid one of their main predators, the rat. It also made the animals less anxious.</p><p>Overall the results suggest that the hypothalamus may be more than simply a relay for the amygdala, and that ‘amygdala-centric’ views of emotion processing may need to be re-visited.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06633.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06633.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>emotion</kwd><kwd>defense</kwd><kwd>ventromedial hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>persistance</kwd><kwd>scalability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH085082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kunwar</surname><given-names>Prabhat S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006961</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Caltech Divisional Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kunwar</surname><given-names>Prabhat S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelikowsky</surname><given-names>Moriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH070053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Simon Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Simon Foundation Collaboration on the Global Brain</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meister</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stimulation of specific neurons within the hypothalamus triggers a fear-like emotion state and behavioral response in mice, challenging the textbook view that the hypothalamus serves simply as a relay for emotion states encoded in the amygdala.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Across the animal kingdom, appropriate defensive behavior is key to survival. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the brain has evolved multiple circuits to control such behaviors. For example, studies in rodents have led to the conclusion that there are multiple, anatomically distinct pathways controlling learned (conditioned) and innate defensive responses (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">LeDoux, 2012</xref>] but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cezario et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Martinez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>]). In these pathways, sensory inputs converge on the amygdala, whose output is relayed by the hypothalamus to downstream structures that control the defensive response. However, different subdivisions of the amygdala and hypothalamus are thought to control learned vs innate responses, in a parallel manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fanselow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">LeDoux, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gallagher and Chiba, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fanselow and LeDoux, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Canteras, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Swanson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">LeDoux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Saper and Lowell, 2014</xref>]).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06633.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons and their optogenetic activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating brain circuits involved in defensive behaviors.

A large body of evidence has established the amygdala, principally the lateral (LA), basolateral (BLA) and central (CEA) subdivisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as a brain region that plays a central role in the implementation of emotion states, based on its involvement in conditioned fear (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fanselow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">LeDoux, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2000</xref>]); for convenience we will henceforth use the shorthand term ‘emotion center’ to refer to such regions. In contrast, the hypothalamus is viewed primarily as a relay between the output of the amygdala, and downstream structures that generate observable behavioral, autonomic and endocrine components of a conditioned defensive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">LeDoux, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">LeDoux and Damasio, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because the identification of emotion centers has been rooted in their ability to mediate emotional learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">LeDoux, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Panksepp, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">2011b</xref>), it has been challenging to ascertain whether innate defensive behaviors also reflect underlying emotion states, and therefore to investigate whether structures that mediate these behaviors, such as the medial hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Canteras, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Swanson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sternson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Saper and Lowell, 2014</xref>]) serve as emotion centers. Indeed, classical studies reporting that electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus is unable to condition learned defensive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Masserman, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wada and Matsuda, 1970</xref>) have been used as evidence that the hypothalamus is not itself an emotion center, a view reflected in contemporary textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">LeDoux and Damasio, 2013</xref>). Instead, it has been assumed, by analogy to circuits mediating conditioned defensive responses, that emotion centers for innate defensive behaviors would be located in the medial amygdala (MEA), and that downstream hypothalamic targets would similarly serve as passive relays for amygdala output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">LeDoux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">LeDoux and Damasio, 2013</xref>). Experimental testing of this assumption, however, has been hindered by the lack of more general criteria to identify and study emotion states in systems mediating unlearned defensive responses.</p><p>We have recently proposed that emotion states have several key properties that generalize across emotions and species. These properties include scalability (the magnitude and/or nature of the behavioral response varies with the level of arousal or intensity of the associated internal state), valence (positive or negative), generalization (a given state can be induced by multiple stimuli, and can control multiple behavioral responses) and persistence: they endure long after a threat is no longer present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Russell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Posner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>). Furthermore we argue, in line with Darwin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Darwin, 1872</xref>), Cannon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cannon, 1927</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Panksepp, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">2011b</xref>), that these emotion states play a causative role in controlling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>).

Assuming similar levels of ChR2 expression in each hemisphere, bilateral photostimulation should activate approximately twice as many SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons as unilateral photostimulation (on either side) in the same animal. Indeed, episodes of freezing followed by activity bursts were only observed using bilateral stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The threshold light intensity required to evoke an activity burst was ∼fivefold higher than that required for freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Our previous studies of optogenetically evoked social behavior in VMHvl Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons indicated that more active neurons are recruited with increasing light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with that conclusion, Fos was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons in animals that exhibited activity bursts (light intensity 5.25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), compared to those exhibiting only freezing (0.65 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). Activity bursts following freezing could also be elicited using a higher frequency of photostimulation at a fixed light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that increasing the average spiking rate among these neurons can also shift the behavioral output from freezing towards the activity burst.</p><p>The observation that activity bursts are typically observed after several seconds of freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>) raised the question of whether freezing behavior per se was a prerequisite for an activity burst. Therefore, we investigated whether certain stimulation conditions could elicit an activity burst without observable prior freezing. To do so, we used a more penetrant and highly expressing viral serotype, AAV5, for delivery of ChR2 to SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aschauer et al., 2013</xref>). Systematic manipulation of stimulation parameters yielded a high-intensity, high-frequency condition (10.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 100 Hz) that evoked a short-latency activity burst following stimulation offset, without prior freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>, arrow). During the ramp-up to such a condition, the latency to the onset of the activity burst during freezing gradually decreased.

This directed locomotion was qualitatively and quantitatively distinct from the undirected, high velocity (∼30 cm/s) activity burst behavior described earlier. Moreover, some animals exhibiting such post-stimulation increases in locomotor activity also attempted transiently to jump out of the cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This latter observation suggests that post-stimulation induced jumping may require a higher level of residual defensive arousal than does increased locomotion.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06633-media6-v2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06633.017</object-id><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>ChR2-induced freezing and post-stimulation elevated locomotion and jumping.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06633.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06633.017</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>We also investigated whether persistent effects of photostimulation could be observed in the real-time place avoidance assay. Notably, we observed that after ChR2 mice withdrew from the photostimulated side into the non-stimulated chamber, in contrast to control eYFP expressing animals, they avoided the center of the latter side, showing a dramatic increase in thigmotaxis (preferential occupation of the perimeter of an open space) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>). Thigmotaxis is considered a key measure of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Simon et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, in both the home cage and in a different context, optogenetic stimulation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons leads to persistent defensive or anxiety-like behaviors.</p><p>We also investigated whether transient activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons caused a persistent inhibitory influence on appetitive behavior, by testing whether it increased the latency to re-initiate mating, following its interruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). We observed significantly longer latencies for ChR2 mice to re-initiate mating after SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons were activated, compared to interleaved internal controls in which yellow rather than blue light was delivered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–M</xref>). Thus, activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons causes persistent defensive responses in a variety of behavioral assays, suggesting that it engenders an associated internal defensive state. Consistent with this idea, optogenetic stimulation of these neurons produced nearly a twofold elevation in serum corticosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SF1<sup>+</sup> neuron activation can condition learned avoidance behavior</title><p>There has been conflicting evidence as to whether hypothalamic stimulation can support conditioning, considered by some to be a <italic>sine qua non</italic> property of an emotion state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Masserman, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cohen et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Roberts, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wada and Matsuda, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Panksepp, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">2011b</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons could serve as a US for the formation of associative fear memories. To do this, we used a modified two-chamber, real-time conditioned place aversion assay (RTPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which we refer to simply as conditioned place aversion (CPA). We introduced several modifications for the CPA assay. First, we distinguished the two chambers by lacing them with different odors, and providing distinct mesh flooring and different colored plastic wall inserts. Second, for training we used bilateral stimulation with high light intensity (5.25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), which evoked freezing and/or activity bursts, rather than the low-level stimulation employed for the RTPA assay, which produced withdrawal, but no associative memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The experimental design is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Before conditioning, we performed a 5 min pre-training test to determine each animal's initial chamber preference. Photostimulation during training was then carried out on each animal's initially preferred side (IPS), to determine whether training would overcome this initial preference. Training was performed over a 20-min period, using the manual closed-loop procedure described for the RTPA assays (see above). It consisted of a series of photostimulation trials lasting 10 s, or until the animal withdrew from the stimulation chamber, whichever occurred first. Trials were repeated at 10-s intervals. If the animal withdrew from the training chamber during a photostimulation trial, the next trial was administered after the animal spontaneously re-entered the stimulation chamber. Over the 20-min training period, animals that initially exhibited freezing or activity bursts in the photostimulation chamber during the first few training trials eventually responded to photostimulation during later trials by rapid withdrawal from the IPS/training chamber.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06633.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons produces conditioned place avoidance learning and memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protocol for conditioned place avoidance assay.

For convenience, we refer to this post-stimulation test period operationally as a ‘short term memory’ (STM) test. Following this STM test, animals were returned to their home cage for 24 hr and then tested for their chamber preference once again; we refer to this latter test as the ‘long term memory’ (LTM) test.</p><p>As expected, ChR2-expressing mice exhibited a dramatic avoidance of the photostimulation chamber during the training period, as compared to eYFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Importantly, robust avoidance of the stimulated (initially preferred) chamber persisted during the 10-min STM test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). This reversal of preference was reflected in a large negative value of the preference score, calculated as the percentage of time spent in the initially preferred chamber minus the percentage of time spent in the initially non-preferred chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) during the STM test (or other phase of the experiment). It was also reflected in a significantly more negative (in comparison to eYFP controls) difference score, calculated as the percent of time spent in the IPS during the STM test minus the percentage of time spent in the IPS before training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). (For both metrics, a negative value is indicative of avoidance of the initially preferred chamber).

Importantly, a comparison between pre-training and LTM preference scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, LTM) revealed that the long-term reduction in preference for the IPS was robust (95% confidence interval: −72.30 to −18.14; Effect size: 1.2173; Power: 0.927). In contrast, eYFP control mice showed no significant change in preference score between the pre-training phase and the LTM test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The retention of this conditioned response was confirmed by the significantly more negative LTM difference score, in comparison to eYFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Based on a comparison of the difference scores between the STM and LTM tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), ChR2 mice showed ∼38% retention of their aversion memory.

Males with ablated SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons were fear conditioned using five tone-conditional stimulus (CS) presentations co-terminating with a footshock-US. These mice showed a significant reduction in the magnitude of their activity bursts during the footshock, for some (but not all) of the training trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). In addition, they exhibited a significant retardation in their ability to acquire conditional freezing to the tone-CS during training, as measured during the 30-s tone CS presentation prior to delivery of the footshock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>).

More recently, pharmacogenetic inhibition of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons mice was reported to cause a decrease in rat-evoked ‘defensive behavior’, a metric combining stretch postures and freezing or immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Silva et al., 2013</xref>). Here we used targeted genetic ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) to address the necessity of these neurons for defensive behaviors. These loss-of-function experiments confirm a role for these neurons in predator avoidance, but also provide evidence of a broader role in defensive behaviors and associated emotion states.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Silva et al. (2013)</xref> reported that chemogenetic inhibition of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons using DREADDs selectively impaired defensive responses to a predator (rat). The broader role of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons revealed by our loss-of-function experiments may reflect the fact that genetically targeted ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) causes a more profound elimination of SF1<sup>+</sup> neuronal function than does chemogenetic inhibition, whose extent and efficacy in vivo is difficult to assess. A caveat however, is that our genetically targeted ablation may have caused damage to neighboring populations of neurons, in a non cell-autonomous manner, and that such ‘collateral damage’, if it occurred, could contribute to some of the phenotypes reported here. However, our demonstration that the number of Esr1<sup>+</sup> cells in the adjacent VMHvl and neighboring ARH is quantitatively unaffected following ablation suggests that this possibility is less likely. Furthermore, the observed reduction in predator defense behavior caused by ablation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is similar to the effect of chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons reported earlier (although the behavioral metrics were different) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Silva et al., 2013</xref>).

Our data argue that the function of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons is not restricted to predator defense per se, but rather that this population controls features of an internal defensive emotion state, which generalize across different contexts and different types of threats. Our results also argue against the more trivial interpretation that VMHdm/c serves exclusively as a permissive, sensory relay for predator-derived cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Papes et al., 2010</xref>)—in essence, an ‘internal nose’—a possibility that could not be excluded from earlier loss-of-function studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Silva et al., 2013</xref>).

This negative result could reflect redundancy in the circuits that mediate the shadow response. Alternatively, SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons may play no role in this paradigm, suggesting that they either mediate defensive responses to terrestrial but not to aerial threats, or that the visual response uses a specialized pathway, similar to the shadow-induced jump response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen et al., 2006</xref>).

These changes can be observed either as a quantitative increase in the amplitude or frequency of a given behavior (e.g., increased locomotor velocity), or as a qualitative shift in behavior (e.g., from freezing to flight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Blanchard et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the nature of the defensive behaviors evoked in this study depended on the intensity of the optogenetic stimulation: avoidance was evoked by low intensity stimulation, while freezing and the interruption of ongoing appetitive behavior required a higher intensity, and activity bursts yet more intense stimulation. By comparing unilateral vs bilateral stimulation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the same animal, we demonstrated directly that activation of a larger number of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons was required to evoke an activity burst than to evoke freezing. Similarly, in the two-chamber assay, a higher level of photostimulation was required for associative memory formation, than simply to cause avoidance.</p><p>Similar threshold-dependent changes in behavior have been observed during optogenetic stimulation of medial amygdala and hypothalamic cell types that mediate social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that it may be a general property of some behavior control circuits. Whether this scalable control is achieved through an increase in ensemble size and activity within a homogenous population of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons, or reflects different subpopulations with different thresholds for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), will be an interesting topic for future study. Whatever the answer, the observation that a common circuit node can control multiple defensive behaviors, according to its level of activity, argues against alternative views invoking parallel processing models, in which anatomically distinct pathways control different types of behavioral responses depending on cues or contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fanselow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that photostimulation conditions that initially evoked freezing were often followed, after a delay of several seconds, by activity bursts during the stimulation period. This observation suggests that the brain may be able to integrate the cumulative effects of SF1<sup>+</sup> neuron activation over time, in a manner that changes the type of defensive behavioral output as different thresholds are reached. Such an integrative function is consistent with our observation that activation of these cells produces persistent behavioral effects, as persistent activity is a hallmark of neural integrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goldman et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the transition from freezing to activity burst in our experiments might reflect a time-dependent inactivation or habituation of freezing neurons during photostimulation, which in turn releases from inhibition a second population that controls the activity burst in an antagonistic manner. Whatever the explanation, the ability of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons to integrate signals that change in their quality or intensity over time could allow an animal to express an appropriate behavioral response (freezing, escape) as a predator threat escalates, as encapsulated by ‘Predatory Imminence’ theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Blanchard et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">McNaughton and Corr, 2004</xref>).

However this criterion is more difficult to apply to circuits that mediate unlearned (innate) defensive behavior. Indeed, the failure of hypothalamic electrical stimulation to condition learned defensive responses has been used to argue that the hypothalamus is not itself an emotion center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Masserman, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wada and Matsuda, 1970</xref>), despite some evidence to the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cohen et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Roberts, 1958</xref>). Independent of learning, manipulations of VMHdm and other hypothalamic nuclei in rodents have been interpreted as evidence that these structures control innate ‘fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>), a conclusion consistent with the observation that electrical stimulation of this region in humans evoked anxiety and panic attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wilent et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">2011</xref>). However the attribution to animals of ‘fear’, a subjective human experience, has recently been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">LeDoux, 2014</xref>), on the grounds that it can only be assessed by verbal report in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adolphs, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have recently proposed objective criteria for identifying emotion states in animal models, based on general properties or features common to different emotions within a species, and to similar emotions across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>), and which are independent of anthropocentric attributions of human emotions such as ‘fear’.

The ability to mediate emotional learning is but one facet of these general properties, and not necessarily an essential one.

In addition, we find that optogenetic activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons in VMHdm/c can indeed serve as an unconditional stimulus (US) for associative learning, in a conditioned place avoidance assay. These data, together with earlier studies of conditioning in VMH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Colpaert and Wiepkema, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Santos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Santos and Brandão, 2011</xref>) and associated hypothalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pavesi et al., 2011</xref>), provide definitive evidence against the view that the hypothalamus is not an emotion center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Masserman, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wada and Matsuda, 1970</xref>).

These observations argue that the prevailing, ‘amygdalo-centric’ view of emotion systems should be expanded to include specific hypothalamic structures such as VMHdm, and its associated circuitry (see below). While the VMHdm/c receives input from the anteriodorsal and posterioventral regions of the medial amygdala (MEAad and MeApv) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Dong and Swanson, 2004</xref>) and the basomedial amygdala (BMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Petrovich et al., 2001</xref>), recent data suggest that MeA functions primarily to encode sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergan et al., 2014</xref>). If so, then the transformation of such sensory input into an internal emotion state may, arguably, be carried out primarily at the level of VMHdm, or other interconnected hypothalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Risold et al., 1994</xref>), rather than in the amygdala itself. It should be noted the VMHdm also receives strong projections from the lateral parabrachial (PB) area, which transmits noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bester et al., 1997</xref>); these projections may also provide sensory input to VMHdm important in the encoding of emotion states.</p><p>That said, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the effects of optogenetically stimulating SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons are mediated by ascending (feedback) projections that activate the amygdala; in that case VMHdm/c would be ‘upstream’, rather than ‘downstream’, of the amygdala. However, high-resolution anatomical mapping of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons indicates that recurrent projections to amygdala nuclei are relatively weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org">http//:connectivity.brain-map.org</ext-link>, VMH, Nr5a1-Cre experiments 114290225 and 182337561, sections 64–82). This issue could be addressed, in principle, by combining bilateral activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons with bilateral lesions of the amygdala. However such an experiment is challenging in mice because of the relatively small size of their brain, and the highly invasive nature of such an experiment. Thus, while descending input from the MEA is likely to contribute to VMHdm/c activation during defensive responses in an unmanipulated animal, our data show that one can experimentally bypass such amygdala input and evoke a persistent emotion state by direct activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Are emotion states implemented within VMHdm/c itself, or by downstream structures?</title><p>VMHdm SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons lie within a densely interconnected network of hypothalamic and midbrain nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Canteras, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>). Therefore the ability of SF1<sup>+</sup> neuronal activation to implement a persistent emotion state could be mediated by other nodes in this circuitry, rather than within VMHdm itself. VMHdm/c SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons send projections to the BNST, AHN, lateral hypothalamus (LHA), PMd, MeA and dorsal peri-aqueductal gray (dPAG), as well as to other structures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video9 video10">Video 9, 10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Canteras et al., 1994</xref>).

All procedures described here adhere to the NIH guidelines for animal research.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Viral vectors and stereotaxic surgery</title><p>AAV-EF1a-DIO-eYFP, AAV-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP, and AAV-EF1a-DIO-taCasp3-TEVp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) were purchased from the University of North Carolina vector core facility. AAV-EF1a-DIO-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anthony et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) was constructed in house (Dr Todd Anthony) and packaged by the University of Pennsylvania vector core facility. Mice were stereotaxically injected with viruses as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, viruses were pressure injected (Mico4Controller, World Precision Instruments; Nanojector II, Drummond Scientific) unilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O–U</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–M</xref>) or bilaterally into the VMHdm/c using a pulled glass needle aimed at the VMHdm/c (ML ± 0.5, AP-4.65, DV-5.5) following a high resolution atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aravanis et al., 2007</xref>). A total volume of 600 nl/site was injected at the rate of 100 μl/min. The needle was left in place for an additional 10 min to control for potential virus drag across the needle tract. A custom made bilateral ferrule fiber (200 μm in core diameter, Doric Lenses) or a unilateral cannula (24 gauge, Plastics One) was then placed 0.5 mm above the injection site. Fibers were cemented in place (Metabond). Following surgery, mice were allowed to recover on a heat pad and thereafter closely monitored for an additional 5 days during which they received medicated water (Septra and Motrin). Mice were single-housed for 4 weeks before commencing experiments to ensure surgical recovery and optimized Cre-mediated recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optogenetic activation in the home cage</title><p>Animals were anaesthetized briefly using isoflurane to connect the fiberoptic cable to the unilateral cannula or bilateral ferrule. Mice were allowed to recover for 30 min in their home cage. They were then brought into an adjacent behavioral testing room for digital video capture of homecage behavior. The fiberoptic cable was then connected to a laser (473 nm for ChR2 stimulation and 593 nm for control stimulation, Shanghai laser) using a bilateral commutator (DoricLenses). A signal generator (World Precision Instruments) was used to control duration, frequency and pulse width of the light. A 20 Hz, 20 ms pulse width was used in all experiments except where mentioned otherwise. Laser intensity was calculated for a distance of 0.5 mm below the fiber tip.</p><p>Testing for freezing and activity burst behavior in the homecage was comprised of a period of baseline behavior recorded in the homecage followed by a series of optogenetic stimulations. Each stimulation was 10 s in duration, except in the case of stimulation-induced activity bursting, where the laser was turned off immediately upon the production of an activity burst, regardless of whether this period comprised less than 10 s. Each animal was given six stimulation ‘trials’ per optogenetic condition, with at least an average inter-stimulation-interval of 90 s. Behavior during stimulations was averaged for data analysis. Freezing behavior was assessed by a complete lack of mobility except that required for respiration for 2 s or more using a custom designed behavioral scoring program in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). An activity burst was defined as a sharp, random movement with high locomotion (&gt;20 cm/s of velocity, sustained for at least 1 s). Jumps were determined by assessing whether a mouse moved upwards with all four-legs off the ground. The total number of jumps occurring within the 20 s pre-, during, and post-light stimulation were calculated per mouse. Animals were rested for a week for subsequent tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetic induction of Fos</title><p>Fos induction in response to optogenetic stimulation was assessed in ChR2 SF1-Cre mice receiving blue light stimulation (473 nm, 20 Hz 20 ms, 10 s on and 10 s off for 20 min) in their home cage. Following optogenetically-induced freezing and/or activity bursts, mice were kept in isolation and perfused 90 min later. Brains were extracted and harvested for subsequent sectioning and antibody staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Social behavior testing</title><p>Interruption of aggression and mating behavior was tested using the resident intruder assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Group housed, wildtype BALB/c males and females (Charles River) aged 12 weeks were used as intruders for aggression and mating testing, respectively. Females were selected for their receptivity beforehand to achieve robust baseline mating behavior. Resident males had at least 1 week of mating experience prior to surgery to increase their level of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Resident males that failed to exhibit aggression or mating behavior were excluded from analyses.</p><p>To test for the ability to interrupt ongoing social behavior, mice were administered either blue (473 nm) or control yellow (593 nm) light (20 Hz, 20 ms) once a behavior was underway. Light was delivered until the behavioral episode was terminated. The test was continued until at least seven blue activation and yellow control trials were recorded. The order of ChR2 and control activations were counter-balanced across animals. The order of aggression and mating tests were counter-balanced across animals. Behavior in the resident intruder assay was recorded with a video camera mounted in front of the homecage and manually scored by an observer blind to experimental conditions. Scoring was performed using a custom designed behavioral scoring program in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Feeding behavior</title><p>Following mating and aggression testing, mice were tested for interruption of feeding behavior as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Mice were food-deprived for 24-hr, placed into a novel cage, and presented with a food pellet. Feeding behavior was interrupted using a stimulation protocol identical to that used for mating and aggression interruption (see above). Behavior was recorded using a video camera and subsequently scored by an observer blind to experimental conditions using a behavioral annotation software tool written in MatLab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Real-time place avoidance</title><p>Real-time place avoidance (RTPA) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Stamatakis and Stuber, 2012</xref>). The apparatus (100 × 50 × 25 cm; black pexiglass wall; white pexiglass floor) was comprised of two identical sides that were connected by an opening (12.5 cm) in the center. Animals were placed pseudo-randomly in one side of the chamber (starting side was counterbalanced across mice) and blue light (20 Hz, 20 ms, 0.01 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was delivered as soon as the mouse entered the alternate side of the apparatus by at least 50% of its body. Stimulation continued until the animal returned to the non-stimulated control side. The assay lasted a total of 20 min. Behavior during the session was recorded using a camera mounted above the apparatus and analyzed recording using Mediacruise recording software (Canopus). Total time spent in each chamber, chamber entries, and latency to depart the chamber following stimulation using Ethovision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Conditioned place avoidance</title><p>A custom-designed RTCPA apparatus was built for use in our conditioned place avoidance (CPA) assay. The apparatus measured 100 × 50 × 25 cm in dimensions. The two sides of the apparatus were made contextually distinct. One chamber side was covered with black plastic and fine mesh flooring while the other side was left white and had coarse mesh flooring. The different sides were also distinguished by odor (2.5% of Acetophenone or ethyl acetate). CPA testing was carried out over 2 days. Day 1 involved a 5-min pre-training session to habituate animals to the apparatus and to determine each mouse's place preference. Animals that showed more than 90% of preference during pre-training were excluded from the analysis. Each animal was pseudo-randomly placed in one side (counterbalanced across mice). This was followed by a 20-min ‘conditioning’ session in which blue light stimulation (20 Hz 20 ms, 10 s on and 10 s off, 5.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was administered in the preferred side until the mouse returned to the non-preferred side. Following conditioning, animals were allowed to move freely for another 10 min without light stimulation to determine their post-stimulation preference. After 24 hr, mice were returned to the apparatus to test for long-term aversion memories. Mice were placed in the stimulated side in order to access the aversion memory associated with the context. As in the RTPA task, time spent in each side during the CPA assay was assessed using Ethovision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Predator avoidance testing</title><p>Mice with ablated SF1+ neurons in VMHdm/c were used to test for intact predator avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanchard et al., 2005</xref>). Predator rats weighting 300–500 gm were used to induce avoidance. A custom made testing apparatus measuring (36 × 18 × 40 cm) was designed to be attached to a mouse's homecage. The test rat was confined to a mesh enclosure (16 × 11 × 15 cm) and put on one side of the home cage. D-amphetamine (5.0 mg/kg, Sigma) was injected (i.p.) 20 min prior testing to trigger uniform movements in the rat stimulus. Rats were lowered into the mesh enclosure and mouse behavior was assessed across a 3-min time period. In order to assess how much time a mouse spent close or far from the rat predator, the home cage was divided into three equal ‘zones’, with Zone1 being closest to the rat and Zone 3 farthest. Time spent and frequency of entries into each zone was calculated using EthovisionXT software (Noldus).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Auditory cued fear conditioning</title><p>SF1-ablated and control mice were placed in a conditioning chamber (Med Associates) and fear conditioned as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>). After 2 min of habituation (baseline period, ‘BL’), five training trials were delivered with an inter-trial interval of 1 min. Each trial consisted of a 85 dBA, 2k Hz tone for 30 s that co-terminated with a 2-s, 0.6 mA foot shock. Freezing and activity burst (measured by motion index) responses to the tone and shock, respectively, were analyzed using Video Freeze software (Med Associates).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Anxiety tests</title><p>Open field, novel object, light–dark box and elevated plus maze tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anthony et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cai et al., 2014</xref>) were utilized to assess levels of anxiety in SF1-ablated mice. Mice were tested in the above-mentioned sequence of tests with at least a 4-hr rest period in between tests. The novel object test, which lasted 5 min, was done after the open field test. A stainless steel cup was placed at the center of the box. The center area for the novel object comprised 25% of total area. Time spent in the center as opposed to the borders of the apparatus was assessed. In the light–dark box, animals were initially placed on the light side of box and behavior was assessed across 10 min. In the elevated plus maze, animals were initially placed at the center of the maze and behavior was assessed across 10 min. Ethovision software was used to analyze time spent, entries, and velocities for each anxiety test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Looming visual stimuli test</title><p>SF1-ablated mice were tested for behavior in a looming visual stimulus test, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). Wild type littermate sibling mice were used as controls. Animals were placed in an open-top pexiglass box (48 × 48 × 30 cm). A triangular shaped nest (20 × 12 cm) was placed in one corner. Recording using Nerovision software was done under illumination provided by Infrared LEDs (Marubeni). After 10 min of habituation, a looming stimulus was provided from above when an animal was in the center. The stimulus of 0.5-s duration was repeated 10 times with an inter-stimulus interval of 0.5 s. Mice were given a post-stimulation period of 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Behavioral recording and analysis</title><p>Behaviors were recorded using Nerovision software control or Mediacruise recording software (Canopus).

Mice were perfused using 4% PFA. Brains were cryoprotected (15% sucrose) and frozen at −80°C until sectioning. Brains were sectioned on a cryostat (Leica, Biosystems) at either 30 μm thick (for direct mounting onto slides) or 60 μm thick (for free-floating sections collected in a staining disc). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-SF1 antibody (1:500, TransGenic), rabbit anti-SF1 antibody (1:500, Upstate), goat anti-c-Fos (Santa Cruz, 1: 500), rabbit anti-Esr1a (1: 500, Santa Cruz), mouse anti PR (1:500, Thermoscientific), rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, Invitrogen). The following secondary antibodies were used—donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa 546 (1:500, Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 (1:500, Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 546 (1:500, Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 633 (1:500, Invitrogen). NeuroTrace fluorescent Nissl stains (1:200, Invitrogen) or DAPI (1:200, Invitrogen) was used to counterstain sections and label cell bodies. At least three representative coronal sections spaced equally along the AP axis were used for quantifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistics</title><p>Prism 5 (GraphPad) software was used for statistical analysis of behavioral and histological data. Data are presented as mean ± sem. The cutoff set for significance for all experiments was alpha &lt;0.05. Data were tested for uniform distribution using three different normality tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test and Shapiro–Wilk normality test). If data passed these normality tests, parametric tests were used. Otherwise, non-parametric tests were used. Unpaired t tests and Mann–Whitney tests were used for comparison between subjects, and paired t tests and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests for within-subjects comparisons. For data involving two or more independent variables, two-way ANOVAs were used and Bonferroni posthoc tests, correcting for multiple comparisons, were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Electrophysiological slice recordings and optogenetics in vitro</title><p>Brain slices were prepared from 3-month-old mice approximately 4 weeks after virus injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cai et al., 2014</xref>).

Data was collected from neurons in the SF1-Cre mouse line with the expression of ChR2 using AAV2.EF1α.FLEX.ChR2-eYFP, as identical to that used in the behavioral experiments. Photostimulation parameters for a given optrode were calibrated prior to implantation so that the transmitted light would irradiate the brain tissue at 1.0–1.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, measured under constant illumination. Hardware and software provisions for eliminating photoelectric artifact were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>). All spikes recorded at a single microwire electrode crossing a threshold two standard-deviations over baseline (spike wavelength around 1 ms and interspike interval greater than 2 ms) were sorted into clusters using PC analysis and were considered to represent individual units. Units were recorded under the same photostimulation parameters as those used in the behavioral experiments that is, at 20 Hz with 20 ms pulse-width. Neural activity was recorded over a baseline period of 40 s, followed by a photostimulation period of 40 s.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Monica McCardle, Heeju Kim, Jung-Sook Kim and Xiaolin Da for technical assistance; Celine Chiu and Gina Mancuso for administrative support; and Robert Robertson, Brian Duistermars and Allan Wong for assistance with Matlab programming.

The projection to the dPAG, in particular is worth expanding upon</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an important issue. To address the issue of the outputs of SF1 neurons, we have now expanded the text and cited earlier neuroanatomic studies that have mapped projections from VMHdm (in the subsection headed “Are emotion states implemented within VMHdm/c itself, or by downstream structures?”). This new discussion highlights the potential role of the dPAG in encoding or mediating emotion states. In this context, we have included a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to illustrate the major projections of SF1<sup>+</sup> VMH neurons to different brain structures, based on publicly available data in the Allen Brain Mouse Connectivity Atlas database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/">http://connectivity.brain-map.org</ext-link>), which consists of serial two-photon tomographic reconstructions of Nr5a1-Cre (SF1-Cre) mouse brains injected with a Cre-dependent AAV expressing GFP. We have used the Allen Brain Atlas Brain Explorer 2 program to computationally reconstruct and render in 3D the projections of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons to their major targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video9 video10">Videos 9 and 10</xref>). This computational analysis, and the raw data on which they are based, are presented with appropriate citations and source attribution, in accordance with the Allen Brain Institute policy and guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alleninstitute.org/terms-of-use/">http://www.alleninstitute.org/terms-of-use/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alleninstitute.org/citation-policy/">http://www.alleninstitute.org/citation-policy/</ext-link>). All relevant URLs, including direct links to the original source data, are cited in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The inputs to VMHdm/c neurons, which have been established by earlier traditional neuroanatomical studies, are now also described in the Discussion section subtitled “The relationship between VMHdm/c and the amygdala in encoding emotion states,”.</p><p><italic>2) There is some concern that SF1 neuron ablation may have unintended consequences on neighboring neurons. This possibility should be acknowledged and rectified if possible by including or referring to other inhibitory approaches that have been applied to the same neuron population</italic>.</p><p>We have now acknowledged and discussed this caveat in the manuscript (in the subsection headed “SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons control defensive behaviors in multiple contexts”). However this concern is mitigated by the fact that quantitative analysis of Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the adjacent region of VMH (VMHvl), as well as in the neighboring arcuate nucleus (ARH), revealed no significant reduction in the number of those cells in mice in which SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons were genetically ablated, compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, E–F</xref>). Furthermore, we point out that the effect of this ablation to reduce predator avoidance is similar to the phenotype that was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Silva et al. (2013)</xref>, using hM4DREADD as an independent method to silence SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons. Therefore, we feel confident that the loss-of-function phenotypes we report are indeed due to the loss of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons, and not to “collateral damage” to other neighboring cell populations.</p><p><italic>3) The authors have promoted their contribution to the intellectual framework of how the SF1 neurons contribute to predator responses without giving appropriate credit to earlier work. A number of specific oversights have been</italic> mentioned <italic>by one of the reviewers in their minor comments (not shown) that should be acknowledged in a revised version.</italic></p><p>We apologize for these oversights. We have now rectified this issue with text revisions and additional literature citations, which reference earlier studies that provide evidence of an involvement of hypothalamic structures in predator avoidance behaviors and in learned fear. These revisions are incorporated into the Discussion section. We specifically raise the possibility that a target(s) downstream of VMHdm/c, including the dPAG, may act as an emotion center, and cite earlier work germane to this topic as mentioned by the reviewer (in the subsection headed “Are emotion states implemented within VMHdm/c itself, or by downstream structures?).</p><p>In this context, we wish to clarify how our findings advance the field beyond earlier studies. Many of the older studies we were asked to cite used pharmacological methods for activation or inhibition that lacked cellular specificity and spatial resolution or, in cases where electrical stimulation or lesioning was used, could not exclude a role for fibers of passage. Moreover, activation and inhibition manipulations were reported in different studies from different laboratories, using different species and different behavioral assays, making direct comparisons difficult. We have performed both optogenetic activation, and targeted ablation, of a genetically defined subset of VMHdm/c neurons, in mice, using an extensive battery of behavioral assays. Our data argue that the function of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons is not restricted to predator defense per se, but rather that this population controls defensive behaviors in different contexts containing different types of threats (for example, in anxiety assays). These issues are now discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>Our studies also provide stronger evidence that the hypothalamus encodes emotion states. Previous studies in rodents reached this conclusion by inferring and attributing a state of “fear,” a specific human emotion, to animal models, a practice which has recently been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">LeDoux, 2014</xref>), or on verbal report, which can only be assessed in humans. In contrast, our study is the first (to our knowledge) to provide evidence of an emotion state in an animal model using a set of objective and general features, common to different emotions within a species and to similar emotions across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>), which are independent of anthropocentric homologies and verbal report.</p><p>We also provide strong and direct evidence that the hypothalamus can serve as an unconditioned stimulus for emotional learning, clarifying earlier conflicting studies. This issue is particularly important, because it underlies prevailing textbook views of emotion, such as that presented in Principles of Neuroscience (5<sup>th</sup> Edition, 2013, now cited), which continue to depict the amygdala as the central orchestrator of emotion states, and the hypothalamus as a mere relay or motor output of the amygdala. We now discuss this in detail in the Discussion subsections entitled “SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons, emotion and emotional learning,” and “The relationship between VMHdm/c and the amygdala in encoding emotion states”.</p><p>References mentioned by the reviewer that we have now incorporated into the manuscript are as follows: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Martinez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Silveira and Graeff, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wilent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pavesi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bittencourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amano et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gomes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sukikara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kincheski et al., 2012</xref>; Blanchard and Blanchard, 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bester et al., 1997</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
