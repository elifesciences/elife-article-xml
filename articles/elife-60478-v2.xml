Paneth cells rely heavily on the glycolytic metabolic program, which is in part controlled by the kinase complex Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1). Yet, little is known about mTOR importance in Paneth cell integrity under steady-state and inflammatory conditions. Our results demonstrate that IFN-γ, a crucial mediator of the intestinal inflammation, acts directly on murine Paneth cells to alter their mitochondrial integrity and membrane potential, resulting in an TORC1-dependent cell death mechanism distinct from canonical cell death pathways including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. These results were established with the purified cytokine and a physiologically relevant common Th1-inducing human parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Given the crucial role for IFN-γ, which is a cytokine frequently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease and compromised Paneth cell functions, the identified mechanisms underlying mTORC1-dependent Paneth cell death downstream of IFN-γ may provide promising novel approaches for treating intestinal inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IFN-gamma</kwd><kwd>Paneth cells</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>Toxoplasma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI136538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yarovinsky</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI121090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yarovinsky</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA218133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grivennikov</surname><given-names>Sergei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA227629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grivennikov</surname><given-names>Sergei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A major Th1 cytokine IFN-γ mediates mitochondrial damage that leads to mTORC1 inhibition and Paneth cells death.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Paneth cells, the main antimicrobial peptide producers in the small intestine, constitutively secrete a broad spectrum of bactericidal proteins including defensins, cryptdin-related sequence peptides, and Lysozyme 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bevins and Salzman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clevers and Bevins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolph et al., 2013</xref>).

To examine whether the direct effects of IFN-γ on Paneth cells are responsible for Paneth cell loss during acute gastrointestinal infection, mice with an intestinal pan-epithelial cell- or Paneth cell-restricted deficiency in IFN-γRII were generated by crossing Vil1-Cre or Defa4IRES-Cre (Paneth cell-specific, PC-Cre) mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burger et al., 2018</xref>), with Infgr2 <italic><sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tcyganov et al., 2021</xref>) and orally infected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>.

These observations prompted us to examine if IFN-γ leads to Paneth cell death via mTORC1 inactivation. We first analyzed the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein, a well-characterized marker of mTORC1 activity in mice infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> and treated with anti-IFN-γ therapy throughout infection. We observed a rapid loss of ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation in Paneth cells as early as day 3 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and this loss preceded the loss of Paneth cells detected by immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or quantitative analysis of Paneth cell-specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and data not shown).

Surprisingly and despite an early realization that IFN-γ is also among the central mediators of the immunopathological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panitch et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belnoue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reinhardt et al., 2015</xref>), especially at the mucosal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Obermeier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heimesaat et al., 2006</xref>), relatively little is known regarding the pathological mechanisms mediated by this cytokine.</p><p>We and others have previously reported that IFN-γ is responsible for severe intestinal inflammation characterized by the rapid loss of Paneth cells, a highly specialized type of secretory epithelial cell located in the small intestine that produce large quantities of antimicrobial peptides including α-defensins and lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farin et al., 2014</xref>). Paneth cell-derived antimicrobial peptides regulate the composition of the microbiota and are critical for host defense against enteric pathogens (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clevers and Bevins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaishnava et al., 2008</xref>). While we and others were able to demonstrate that IFN-γ is required for the loss of Paneth cells, whether the direct or indirect effects of this cytokine on Paneth cells causes their disappearance remained unknown. Furthermore, the precise knowledge of the mechanism leading to IFN-γ-mediated Paneth cell death is unknown. This is a significant gap as both experimental and clinical data strongly suggest a link between high IFN-γ levels, impaired Paneth cell function, and inflammatory intestinal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fais et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsuoka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krausgruber et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, a crucial role for IFN-γ in driving Paneth cell-dependent intestinal inflammation has been established in the mouse models with compromised homeostasis functions controlled by Paneth cell-restricted autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grizotte-Lake and Vaishnava, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuzawa-Ishimoto et al., 2017</xref>). Direct gene targeting in Paneth cells revealed that compromised cell-intrinsic autophagic machinery enhanced the susceptibility of Paneth cells to proinflammatory cytokines and caused an exaggerated or even lethal intestinal pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burger et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, in order to understand the mechanism linking IFN-γ to intestinal inflammation, it is essential to understand how IFN-γ triggers the loss of Paneth cells.</p><p>In this work, our in vivo experimental data established a mTORC1-dependent mechanism of Paneth cell death in direct response to IFN-γ. The current work revealed that IFN-γ alone was sufficient for mitochondrial damage in Paneth cells. Although apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis can be triggered by mitochondrial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Green, 2019</xref>), these mechanisms of cell death were not detected in Paneth cells. Furthermore, the possible roles for pyroptosis and necroptosis in IFN-γ-mediated Paneth cell death were ruled out by definitive mouse models deficient in those cell death pathways. Instead, we uncovered that a loss of mTORC1 activity downstream of IFN-γ signaling was responsible for Paneth cell death in vivo and in vitro. The results from our work revealed that impaired mitochondrial function caused by IFN-γ is at least in part responsible for mTOR inhibition. This process alone is sufficient to inhibit mTOR in Paneth cells, but cannot exclude other IFN-γ induced pathways that may play a role in mTOR inhibition.</p><p>Mouse genetic models with Paneth cell-specific targeting of mTOR and Raptor formally confirmed that intact mTORC1 holds an essential role in the presence of Paneth cells. Overall, our results here established that the direct effects of IFN-γ on Paneth cells caused impaired mitochondrial respiration in Paneth cells that was responsible for mTORC1 inactivation. Given the crucial role for IFN-γ, which is a cytokine frequently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease and compromised Paneth cell functions, the identified mechanisms of mTORC1-dependent Paneth cell death downstream of IFN-γ may provide promising novel approaches for treating intestinal inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were originally purchased from the Jackson Laboratories and maintained in the pathogen-free animal facility at the University of Rochester of Medicine and Dentistry.

death. The authors use multiple gene deficient mouse strains, in combination with Toxoplasma infection, to systematically define the Paneth-cell autonomous role of IFNγ and mTOR. The investigators also make use of a series of KOs for genes encoding key components of distinct cell death modalities, such as necroptosis and pyroptosis to indicate that none of the known pathways o cell death are involved in this novel finding. The genetic models are complemented with pharmacological approaches, such as inhibitors of cell death pathways or mTOR signaling and the use of intestinal organoids to further probe the mechanism leading to Paneth cell death. Taken together the data clearly demonstrate a role for IFNγ in promoting the death of intestinal Paneth cells via a mTOR dependent pathway.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;IFN-γ mediates Paneth cell death via suppression of mTOR&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Nicola L Harris as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gillian Coakley (Reviewer #2); Carla V Rothlin (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Paneth cells produce antimicrobials and growth factors that protect and promote the small intestinal stem cell niche. The authors previously demonstrated that IFN-g produced during <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection mediates loss of Paneth cells, a key event that affects intestinal barrier function in this and other disease models. In this study, the authors take advantage of a previously characterized aDefensin4-IRES-Cre mouse to make Paneth cell-specific KOs to investigate cell-intrinsic mechanisms. They demonstrate that IFN-g acts directly on Paneth cells during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection and induces an atypical cell death. IFN-g was found to mediate this effect through mitochondrial damage that leads to mTOR inhibition. They also demonstrate that loss of mTOR activity in Paneth cells is dependent on the microbiota. Thus, by using <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection as a model to study immunopathology, the authors identify a new Paneth cell-intrinsic role for mTOR in preventing a type of cytokine-induced cell death.</p><p>The above results provide important insight into the toxic effect of IFN-g. The genetic techniques clearly establish mTOR within Paneth cells as an important target for this cytokine that has been implicated in many inflammatory settings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) Regarding the reporting of a novel method of cell death, named &quot;interferonoptosis&quot;,</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the study falls short from identifying the type of cell death modality involved and that this is a major weakness. While the knowledge that neither apoptosis, necroptosis or pyroptosis appear to account for this type of death is relevant, the results included in this manuscript are not sufficient to coin a new type of cell death (tentatively named as interferonoptosis by the authors). The mechanism involved in inducing the Paneth cell death should be explored in more detail (see notes on further experimental work as outlined below). Alternatively, the authors may choose to perform a subset of these experiments in addition to substantiality 'toning down' their language' regarding the cell death pathway involved and providing a clear discussion of what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from the existing dataset.</p><p>– A further confirmation of the ability of IFNγ to directly signal to paneth cells and activated mTORC1 signaling should be provided by adding IFNγ to organoids from the reporter mice using the same assay as described in SFIg4.</p><p>– To substantiate their findings that IFN-mediated Paneth cell death is caspase-3 independent, it would be important to address the published findings by Eriguchi et al., (2017) – 10.1172/jci.insight.121886, which reports that &quot;IFN-γ induces Paneth cell death through a caspase-3/7-dependent pathway&quot;, again using an enteroid-based system.</p><p>– Do the authors know whether they successfully inhibited RIPK1 following administration of necrostatin in Figure S3E? This is potentially of great interest because RIPK1 lies upstream of both apoptosis and necroptosis, and thus, this experiment provides additional support for their conclusion that the cell death modality represents something other than these two forms, which can interconvert. (If technically challenging in vivo, the authors may consider using the organoids to demonstrate a lack of a role for RIPK1).</p><p>– What leads to the inhibition of mTOR downstream of IFN γ receptor? This should be tested as multiple mechanisms can lead to inhibition of mTOR. For example, is this event downstream of AMPK, amino acid starvation? Does TSC have a role?</p><p>– The assessment of the pathway cannot be limited to measurements p-S6Ser240/244 and should include other markers such as 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. p-S6Ser240/244 staining appears inconsistent across panels. Please see Figure 4A and Figure S6B.</p><p>– Given the role of mTOR, mitochondrial damage and the vacuolization detected by EM, is it possible that Paneth cells undergo a type of autophagy-dependent cell death. This is particularly intriguing given the prior report from the same authors on the induction of autophagy by IFNγ in Paneth cells (Burger et al., CHM 2018). The relationship between these events should be explored. Is this dependent on ULK1, ATG13? Is mitophagy selectively being triggered? Ultrastructural changes are important in defining cell death and figure 5C lacks the inclusion of a non-infected control.</p><p>– How does IFN γ induced cell death compares to the cell death triggered by other cytokines, such as TNF?</p><p>B) Regarding the impact of the microbiota on mTORC and Paneth cells:</p><p>The authors also show that intestinal microbiota contributes to mTOR dysfunction and Paneth cell death. However the data shown in Figure S6D is not called out in the results and this should be corrected. Is the reason microbiota depletion rescues mTOR activity because the bacteria are necessary for IFN-g production during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection? Please clarify this point in the manuscript. It should be noted that degranulation of Paneth cells is not stimulated in germ-free mice. Thus, Paneth cells might be more resilient to mTOR inhibition in germ-free mice. A more quantitative approach for the assessment of mTOR signaling in SPF versus WT mice across time, including earlier time points than 7 days post infection (see Figure S6) and additional markers of mTOR signaling is needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60478.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) Regarding the reporting of a novel method of cell death, named &quot;interferonoptosis&quot;,</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the study falls short from identifying the type of cell death modality involved and that this is a major weakness. While the knowledge that neither apoptosis, necroptosis or pyroptosis appear to account for this type of death is relevant, the results included in this manuscript are not sufficient to coin a new type of cell death (tentatively named as interferonoptosis by the authors). The mechanism involved in inducing the Paneth cell death should be explored in more detail (see notes on further experimental work as outlined below).

This is potentially of great interest because RIPK1 lies upstream of both apoptosis and necroptosis, and thus, this experiment provides additional support for their conclusion that the cell death modality represents something other than these two forms, which can interconvert. (If technically challenging in vivo, the authors may consider using the organoids to demonstrate a lack of a role for RIPK1).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank all the reviewers for this very valuable comment. We are confident that RIPK1 was successfully blocked based on the following experiments:</p><p>1. We have adopted a protocol for in vivo administration of necrostatin from Immunity 35, 908–918, December 23, 2011 (RIP Kinase-Dependent Necrosis Drives Lethal Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome). In agreement with the previous publication (Figure 5), necrostatin administration in vivo completely prevented TNF-induced mortality in mice. We have not included those technical experiments as the purpose of those experiments was to validate the commercial reagents and establish an experimental protocol in the lab.</p><p>While it is theoretically possible that we failed to completely inhibit RIPK1 in Paneth cells, we hope the reviewers would agree that even partial RIPK1 inhibition should prevent some Paneth cell death if this pathway plays a significant role in IFN-γ mediated Paneth cell death. However, we observed no effect of necrostatin on Paneth cell death.</p><p>2. We have attempted to analyze RIPK1 in sort-purified Paneth cells in response to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (on day 6 post infection prior a complete loss of Paneth cells). We have included the data for the reviewers’ benefit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. As evident from two independent experiments, while a potent STAT-1 phosphorylation was observed in sort-purified Paneth cells in response to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, we could not detect a phosphorylated form of RIPK1 in those cells. Please note that while this may look like a trivial experiment, it required multiple mice to purified sufficient numbers of Paneth cells (200,000) from <italic>T. gondii</italic> infected mice on day 6 post infection due to their substantial loss. We fully acknowledge that WB is a crude approach to analyze the kinase activity of RIPK1, and we hope that these additional data satisfies the reviewers’ technical concern as they revealed that Paneth cells responded to IFN-γ (phospho-STAT-1), but did not demonstrate potent or at least easily detectable RIPK1 activation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Western blot analysis of sort-sort-purified Paneth cells isolated from naïve or <italic>T. gondii</italic> infected mice (day 6 post infection).</title><p>Paneth cells were combined from 3 naïve mice (I) and 12-15 <italic>T. gondii</italic> infected mice (T).

Specifically, we state that:</p><p>“The results from our work revealed that impaired mitochondrial function caused by IFN-γ is at least in part responsible for mTOR inhibition.

We have not included those negative data as they would further dilute the main message of the manuscript (IFN-γ mediated mitochondrial dysfunction is responsible for mTOR inactivation and Paneth cell death).</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion regarding TSC as the TSC complex may mediate nutrient signaling upstream of mTOR to regulate Paneth cell functions and survival. We are in the process of generating Paneth cell specific TSC KO mice using Tsc2 flox mice (Jax #027458). These mice were cryopreserved, but we took the recommendation seriously and acquired those mice as we anticipate a significant Paneth cell dysfunction in the absence Tsc2 as TSC1/2 antagonizes the mTOR signaling pathway. We hope nevertheless that the reviewers would agree that this analysis is beyond the scope of this submission and may reveal <italic>‘gain of function’</italic> phenotype in Paneth cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The assessment of the pathway cannot be limited to measurements p-S6Ser240/244 and should include other markers such as 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. p-S6Ser240/244 staining appears inconsistent across panels. Please see Figure 4A and Figure S6B.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not conclude that the mTOR pathway is involved in Paneth cells death based on the measurements of p-S6Ser<sup>240/244</sup>. Instead, the major evidence comes from the genetic data (now Figure 5A) that formally confirmed that the mTOR pathway is essential for Paneth cells. We strongly believe that the genetic data fully support our claims. We would like to stress that p-S6Ser<sup>240/244</sup> is a common readout for mTOR activity and the measurements of p-S6Ser<sup>240/244</sup> were perform to analyze mTOR activity without any statement regarding the downstream events associated with this particular mTOR function in Paneth cells. In addition, we also analyzed phospho-mTOR Ser<sup>2448</sup> (Figure 4e, 4f).</p><p>We respectfully disagree that there is an inconsistency across the panels shown in Figure 4A (now Figure 5A) and Figure S6B (now Figure 7B). Both panels revealed high intensity for p-S6 protein in Paneth cells detected in both conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice. The staining pattern of p-S6 protein in epithelial cells is distinct between GF and CV mice; however, this difference is significant in that the variation is not an experimental inconsistency, but most likely due to a physiological response to microbiota. We hope the reviewers would agree that the analysis of microbiota-dependent mTOR activation in enterocytes (not Paneth cells) is beyond the scope of this submission, even though it is an interesting research direction.</p><p>If the reviewer pointed that there were some variations for UEA staining, we would like to clarify that UEA detects both Paneth cells and mucus-producing Goblet cells. We see no variations for the detection of Paneth cells via UEA staining. As for the mucus detection, it is fully expected that mucus staining varies across the mice as it is very sensitive to the fixation protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given the role of mTOR, mitochondrial damage and the vacuolization detected by EM, is it possible that Paneth cells undergo a type of autophagy-dependent cell death. This is particularly intriguing given the prior report from the same authors on the induction of autophagy by IFNγ in Paneth cells (Burger et al., CHM 2018). The relationship between these events should be explored. Is this dependent on ULK1, ATG13? Is mitophagy selectively being triggered? Ultrastructural changes are important in defining cell death and figure 5C lacks the inclusion of a non-infected control.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously extensively tested this hypothesis (<italic>Burger et al., CHM 2018</italic>) and in our previous publication we have specifically state that:</p><p>“We initially hypothesized that additional induction of IFN-γ during the mucosal response to T. gondii leads to excessive autophagy activation and unintentional Paneth cell elimination. Contrary to our hypothesis, the experimental analysis of T. gondii-infected PC-Atg5 KO and E-Atg5 KO mice revealed that elimination of Atg5 only in Paneth cells or in all enterocytes did not protect Paneth cells from IFN-γ-dependent cell death. Instead, we revealed that the lack of Atg5 resulted in profound intestinal immunopathology characterized by near complete elimination of all epithelial cells, including Paneth cells.”</p><p>We believe the previous results from my lab (<italic>Burger et al., CHM 2018</italic>) and an independent study from Kevin Maloy (Cell Host and Microbe, Volume 23, Issue 2, 14 February 2018) along with the detailed analysis of the above mentioned publications by Mayara Grizotte-Lake and Shipra Vaishnava (CHM, 2018) have already largely addressed the raised question.</p><p>We initially included the electron microscopy experiments (previous Figure 5C) as an additional illustration for the new data shown in Figure 5 (now Figure 6).

As suggested by all reviewers and editors, we chose to tone down the language since only a subset of the experiments were performed. In this work we have addressed the question of how IFN-γ ‘kills’ Paneth cells. We were able to reveal that this is a direct and mTOR-dependent mechanism. It is not trivial to compare it with the TNF-mediated mechanism as while this pathway is much better studied in general, the correct experiments would require development of additional in vivo models to study the effects of TNF on Paneth cells only (Paneth cell specific TNFRI KO mice as well as PC-specific TNFRII KO mice).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Regarding the impact of the microbiota on mTORC and Paneth cells:</p><p>The authors also show that intestinal microbiota contributes to mTOR dysfunction and Paneth cell death.

We only claim that the reduced levels of IFN-γ seen in GF mice (now Figure 7 – supplement 1) are responsible for the survival of Paneth cells in the absence of microbiota (Figure 7).
