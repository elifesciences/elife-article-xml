while simultaneously detecting their interactions. Here, we describe a novel property of rhodamine dyes, proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), in which one fluorophore (the ‘sender’) can reactivate a second fluorophore (the ‘receiver’) from a dark state. PAPA requires proximity between the two fluorophores, yet it operates at a longer average intermolecular distance than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We show that PAPA can be used in live cells both to detect protein–protein interactions and to highlight a subpopulation of labeled protein complexes in which two different labels are in proximity. In proof-of-concept experiments, PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. These results establish a new way in which a photophysical property of fluorophores can be harnessed to study molecular interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A human body is made up of trillions of cells, each containing millions of proteins working to keep our bodies going. Since the invention of the microscope four hundred years ago, scientists have made large strides in visualizing cells and even single protein molecules within cells. To do this, proteins of interest are labeled with fluorescent dyes that absorb – or are ‘excited’ by – light of one color, and then give off light of a different color. The labeled proteins are excited by a powerful laser, and a sensitive camera detects the light emitted by single molecules of dye. This technique is called single-particle tracking (SPT), and it can reveal how proteins move around inside a cell.</p><p>Because most proteins work together in teams or complexes, it would be useful to track the movement of proteins while at the same time observing their interactions. Unfortunately, SPT does not typically allow scientists to watch how proteins interact with each other. Graham et al. accidentally discovered how to do precisely this.</p><p>First, they labeled proteins with two different colored dyes. Then, the dyes were excited using alternating red and green lasers. Repeated excitation destroys the fluorescent dye molecules, and sure enough, red-excited dye molecules went dark over time. Unexpectedly, however, molecules of the dye that had been excited with red light reappeared after exciting the second dye with green light. The fluorescent molecules were not dead, just sleeping. ‘Resuscitating’ one dye with the other required that they be close together, and therefore this process was called proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA for short).</p><p>PAPA was able to detect interactions between proteins labeled with different dyes in live human cells, and combining PAPA with SPT allowed Graham et al. to distinguish protein molecules labeled with two different dyes from those labeled with a single dye. Finally, Graham et al. labeled molecules of the androgen receptor protein with two different dyes to monitor how they responded to testosterone. Combining PAPA and SPT measurements successfully detected the pairing of androgen receptor molecules, as well as increased binding of these paired androgen receptor molecules to DNA.</p><p>This new way of observing how proteins interact will be useful for studying where and how fast these interactions happen in living cells. Understanding how teams of proteins work together under normal conditions will also shed light on how they misbehave in diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-molecule fluorescence</kwd><kwd>single-particle tracking (SPT)</kwd><kwd>protein–protein interactions</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd><kwd>fluorophore photoactivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>Thomas GW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrie</surname><given-names>John Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA) provides a new way to detect protein–protein interactions in single-molecule imaging of live cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most proteins function by interacting with other proteins, yet we lack tools to study these potentially transient interactions at single-molecule resolution in live cells. Single-particle tracking (SPT) is a valuable approach for monitoring the motions of individual protein molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heckert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>), but it does not distinguish compositionally and functionally distinct complexes of the same protein. Two-color SPT can infer interactions between proteins when both partners are so dilute that they can be fully labeled while still resolving single molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sotolongo Bellón et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>). For most proteins, however, detection of single molecules requires sparse labeling, which makes double-labeled complexes exceedingly rare. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), though powerful for monitoring intra-molecular conformational changes, is not in general a practical way to detect protein–protein interactions in live cells due to a similar requirement for sparse double-labeling, challenges with spectral crosstalk, and the large size of genetically encoded tags relative to the working distance of FRET (see Appendix 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quast and Margeat, 2021</xref>). Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) can detect bulk molecular interactions, yet it does not provide spatial trajectories for individual molecules, which are useful for measuring such properties as chromatin residence time and anomalous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McSwiggen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) detects molecular interactions based on the reconstitution of a fluorescent protein or HaloTag from two split halves fused to interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kerppola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Makhija et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). While BiFC can be combined with single-molecule imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nickerson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shao et al., 2021</xref>), a drawback of this approach is that the extremely strong association of split proteins perturbs the binding equilibrium of their interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kerppola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kodama and Hu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nickerson et al., 2014</xref>), making it impossible to accurately measure dynamic interactions.</p><p>An alternative in vitro proximity sensor to smFRET was devised by Bates, Blosser, and Zhuang, who observed that exciting one cyanine dye can reactivate a nearby cyanine dye from a dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates et al., 2005</xref>). Although photoswitching of cyanine dye pairs enabled early implementations of STORM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rust et al., 2006</xref>), its application as a proximity sensor has been limited by the short inter-fluorophore distance required (≤2 nm), the poor cell permeability of cyanine dyes, and the need for high thiol concentrations and an oxygen-scavenging system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geertsema et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, it has not been reported whether a similar process of reactivation can occur for pairs of non-cyanine dyes. However, many fluorophores—notably rhodamine dyes—can enter a dark state and be directly reactivated by short-wavelength (e.g., 405 nm) light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van de Linde et al., 2011</xref>). This phenomenon, which has been employed for direct STORM (dSTORM) imaging in both live and fixed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2021</xref>), is thought to involve conversion of excited triplet-state fluorophores to reduced species whose absorbance is shifted to shorter wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dempsey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gidi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van de Linde et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vaughan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The development of bright, cell-permeable Janelia Fluor (JF) dyes, based on rhodamine and silicon-rhodamine chemical scaffolds, has transformed single-molecule imaging in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that Janelia Fluor X 650 (JFX650; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimm et al., 2021</xref>) and similar fluorophores can be reactivated from a dark state by excitation of a nearby fluorophore such as Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549), a phenomenon which we term proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA). In contrast to cyanine dye reactivation, PAPA of JF dyes occurs under physiological conditions in live cells and requires neither an oxygen-scavenging system nor exogenous thiols. While PAPA requires proximity between the two fluorophores, its effective distance range extends beyond that of FRET, making it a potentially more versatile interaction sensor.</p><p>Most importantly, PAPA provides a new way to detect protein interactions in live cells at single-molecule resolution. We show that PAPA can be used to detect the formation of protein dimers and that it can enrich for double-labeled molecules within defined mixtures, albeit not with perfect selectivity (see ‘Discussion’ and Appendix 2). As a further proof of concept, we combined SPT with PAPA to analyze the increase in chromatin binding induced by self-association of androgen receptor. By enabling the previously elusive detection of protein–protein interactions, PAPA will provide a new dimension of information in live-cell single-molecule imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PAPA of JF dyes</title><p>We fortuitously discovered PAPA while imaging an oligomeric protein labeled with two different JF dyes. U2OS cells expressing Halo-tagged NPM1 (a pentameric nucleolar protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heckert et al., 2022</xref>) were labeled with a low concentration of Janelia Fluor X 650 HaloTag ligand (JFX650-HTL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimm et al., 2021</xref>) to track single molecules, together with a higher concentration of Janelia Fluor 549 HaloTag ligand (JF549-HTL) to visualize nucleoli. When we alternately excited JFX650 with red light (633 nm) and JF549 with green light (561 nm), we noticed that some JFX650 molecules that had gone dark during red illumination suddenly reappeared after a brief, 7 ms pulse of green light (green vertical lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1ai</xref> and green box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>), we also observed reactivation of JFX650 by violet light, both with and without JF549-HTL (violet vertical lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1ai,ii</xref> and violet box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, reactivation of JFX650 by green light required co-labeling with JF549 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1ai and ii</xref>), implying that reactivation results not from direct absorption of green light by dark-state JFX650 but indirectly due to excitation of JF549. Green illumination of cells labeled with JF549-HTL alone did not produce localizations in the JFX650 channel, demonstrating that this effect is not due to JF549 photochromism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1aiii</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA) of JFX650 by JF549.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Green and violet light reactivate JFX650 through distinct JF549-dependent and JF549-independent mechanisms.

To test this, we expressed fusions of Halo and SNAPf separated by either a short flexible linker (Halo-SNAPf) or a tandem P2A-T2A self-cleaving peptide (Halo-PT2A-SNAPf; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>); labeled cells with JF549-HTL and JFX650 SNAP tag ligand (JFX650-STL); and imaged JFX650 with red light interspersed with alternating short pulses of violet and green light. While violet reactivation was similar for both constructs, green reactivation was substantially greater for Halo-SNAPf than for Halo-PT2A-SNAPf, implying that proximity of the two dyes facilitates reactivation by green light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Thus, we term this phenomenon proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA). We will call the dye that undergoes reactivation the ‘receiver’ and the dye whose excitation induces reactivation the ‘sender.’ Also, we will adopt the terms ‘shelving’ for conversion of the receiver into the dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bretschneider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>) and ‘direct reactivation’ (DR) for reactivation by violet light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dempsey et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Conjugating JFX650 to SNAPf instead of Halo led to more efficient shelving in the dark state, as evidenced by a faster decline in fluorescence during red illumination and greater subsequent reactivation by violet light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This accords with the previous observation that JF549 is more photostable when bound to Halo than when bound to SNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Presman et al., 2017</xref>). Ensemble and single-molecule kinetic measurements indicate that about 10% of JFX650-SNAPf molecules enter the dark state under our experimental conditions and can be reactivated by either DR or PAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). DR by violet light precluded subsequent PAPA by green light, and vice versa, implying that both wavelengths reactivate the same dark state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). We tested other fluorophore pairs and found that PAPA occurred when tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), Janelia Fluor X 549 (JFX549), or Janelia Fluor 526 were used as the sender, or when JF646 or JFX646 were used as the receiver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Distance dependence of PAPA</title><p>To investigate how PAPA depends on sender–receiver distance, we generated fusion transgenes in which Halo and SNAPf were separated by zero, one, three, five, or seven repeats of the titin I91 Ig domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scholl et al., 2016</xref>).

After localizing and tracking single molecules, we separated trajectories occurring after a green pulse (PAPA trajectories) from those occurring after a violet pulse (DR trajectories) and applied a recently developed Bayesian state array SPT (saSPT) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heckert et al., 2022</xref>) to infer the underlying distribution of diffusion coefficients for each set of trajectories (its ‘diffusion spectrum’ for short).

As expected, the opposite trend was observed: PAPA trajectories were enriched in bound molecules compared to DR trajectories, both across an ensemble of cells and at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c and d</xref>). As a further control, we analyzed cells expressing JF549-HTL/JFX650-STL double-labeled Halo-SNAPf-3xNLS or Halo-SNAPf-H2B alone. As expected, PAPA and DR trajectories displayed virtually identical diffusion spectra for these individual components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a–f</xref>).</p><p>To test whether PAPA can also distinguish a mixture of diffusing components, we co-expressed fast-diffusing cytosolic Halo-SNAPf with a SNAPf-tagged synthetic protein that forms large, slowly diffusing 60-mers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>).

Compared to DR trajectories (violet curve), PAPA trajectories (green curve) were strongly enriched in the fast-diffusing subpopulation, consistent with selective reactivation of the double-labeled Halo-SNAPf protein by green light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).

The enrichment of the fast-diffusing population was not absolute as a slow-diffusing shoulder peak was still observed among PAPA trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, green curve; see ‘Discussion’).

Enrichment of the 60-mer peak by PAPA is especially pronounced in this case (compare green and violet curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>), which may reflect reactivation of a receiver molecule by any of several neighboring sender molecules within a 60-mer.</p><p>To estimate the fold enrichment of double-labeled molecules by PAPA, the curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were fitted to a linear combination of the distributions for individual components. For Halo-SNAPf-3xNLS + SNAPf-H2B, the best fit was obtained for DR trajectories with a mixture of 53% Halo-SNAPf-3xNLS and 47% SNAPf-H2B, while the best fit for PAPA trajectories was obtained with 91% Halo-SNAPf-3xNLS and 9% SNAPf-H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a</xref>). The estimated ratio of Halo-SNAPf-3xNLS to SNAPf-H2B thus increases from 0.53/0.47 ≈ 1.1 among DR trajectories to 0.91/0.09 ≈ 10 among PAPA trajectories, an approximately ninefold enrichment of double-labeled molecules by PAPA. Similar calculations showed that PAPA enriched Halo-SNAPf-H2B over SNAPf-3xNLS by 3.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4b</xref>), Halo-SNAPf over SNAPf-60mer by 7.6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4c</xref>), and Halo-SNAPf-60mer over SNAPf by 37-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4d</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that PAPA can be used to enrich a subpopulation of molecules in which a receiver fluorophore (e.g., JFX650) is in proximity to a sender fluorophore (e.g., JF549), thereby revealing the distinct properties of this subpopulation at both the ensemble and single-cell level. While this enrichment was substantial—between 3.7- and 37-fold for different defined mixtures—it was not absolute, and thus it is crucial not to misinterpret PAPA trajectories as a pure sample of interacting molecules (see ‘Discussion’ and Appendix 2).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Distinguishing the properties of androgen receptor monomers and dimers in single cells</title><p>As a proof-of-concept biological application, we tested whether PAPA could be used to detect ligand-induced self-association of mammalian androgen receptor (AR) and distinguish the properties of AR monomers and dimers/oligomers.

Strikingly, PAPA trajectories had a higher bound fraction than DR trajectories, both before and after addition of DHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c, d</xref>). This is consistent with an increase in the affinity of AR for specific DNA sequence motifs upon self-association. Moreover, PAPA revealed that a subset of AR molecules self-associated and bound chromatin with elevated affinity even prior to addition of exogenous androgen. Thus, PAPA can be applied to monitor regulation of a biologically important protein–protein interaction in live cells, discern its effect on chromatin binding, and reveal the existence of molecular subpopulations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have described a novel and useful property of rhodamine dyes, PAPA, in which excitation of a ‘sender’ fluorophore (e.g., JF549) reactivates a nearby ‘receiver’ fluorophore (e.g., JFX650) from a dark state. By enabling targeted reactivation of receiver fluorophores near a sender fluorophore, PAPA provides a new way to detect molecular interactions in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): First, Halo-tagged proteins are labeled with the sender fluorophore and SNAPf-tagged proteins with the receiver fluorophore. Second, cells are illuminated with intense red light to shelve receiver fluorophores in the dark state. Third, alternating pulses of green and violet light are applied to reactivate receiver fluorophores by PAPA and DR, respectively, and these reactivated fluorophores are imaged using red illumination. The ratio of green to violet reactivation provides a measure of protein–protein interaction, while analysis of green-reactivated and violet-reactivated single-particle trajectories makes it possible to compare the overall population of receiver-labeled molecules (violet; DR) to a subpopulation enriched for double-labeled complexes (green; PAPA).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Using proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA) to spotlight protein–protein interactions.</title><p>(1) Label a SNAPf-tagged Target protein with a receiver fluorophore (e.g., JFX650) and a Halo-tagged Partner protein with a sender fluorophore (e.g., JF549).

Image receiver molecules with 633 nm light while alternately illuminating with (3) pulses of 561 nm light to induce PAPA of receiver-labeled Target molecules in complex with sender-labeled Partner molecules, and (4) pulses of 405 nm light to induce direct reactivation (DR) of receiver fluorophores, independent of proximity to the sender.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76870-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While the physical mechanism underlying PAPA remains unclear, its more flexible distance dependence than either FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or cyanine dye photoswitching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates et al., 2005</xref>) suggests a distinct process. One speculative hypothesis is that the excited sender reacts with some other molecule in the cell, producing a short-lived chemical species that diffuses a limited distance to react with and reactivate the receiver dark state. However, we cannot exclude an alternative model proposed by Gidi and colleagues for cyanine dye pairs, in which the absorbance spectrum of the receiver dark state has a broad tail toward longer wavelengths, allowing the sender to serve as an ‘antenna’ that facilitates receiver reactivation via some form of energy transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gidi et al., 2020</xref>). Even if such a process had a low quantum yield, the all-or-nothing property of reactivation might make it observable experimentally. PAPA can complement other techniques for monitoring molecular interactions. Although smFRET is useful for measuring distances between fluorophores in vitro, PAPA provides multiple advantages for live-cell imaging: first, PAPA circumvents the trade-off between labeling density and spectral crosstalk inherent in smFRET (see Appendix 1). It is impractical to detect molecular interactions in cells by sparsely labeling both the FRET donor and acceptor, as double-labeled complexes will be vanishingly rare. Attempting to solve this problem by densely labeling either the donor or the acceptor creates the new problem of fluorescence bleed-through from the densely labeled channel, which may be orders of magnitude brighter than signal from the sparsely labeled channel. In PAPA, sender and receiver excitation occur at different times, eliminating fluorescence bleed-through from the sender into the receiver channel. Hence, one interacting partner can be sparsely labeled with the receiver and the other densely labeled with the sender, permitting efficient detection of double-labeled complexes. Second, PAPA has a conveniently longer working distance than FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which might be extended further by elongating the linkers between Halo/SNAPf and the protein of interest. Because photoactivation is an all-or-nothing event, a signal can in principle be detected if even a fraction of linker conformations orients the dyes close enough together for PAPA to occur. Unlike single-molecule BiFC, PAPA does not perturb binding equilibria, making it possible to use PAPA to study transient, reversible interactions.</p><p>Although PAPA significantly enriches for complexes double-labeled with sender and receiver, its selectivity is not perfect (see Appendix 2). A background level of PAPA was still observed when Halo and SNAPf were separated by a self-cleaving peptide tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a and b</xref>), and this cannot be explained either by incomplete cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>) or by direct reactivation of JFX650 by 561 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). Moreover, some ‘contamination’ of PAPA trajectories with single-labeled molecules was evident in experiments with defined two-component mixtures (e.g., slower-diffusing peak in green curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). When interpreting PAPA-SPT experiments, it is thus critical to keep in mind that green-reactivated trajectories, although enriched for sender–receiver complexes, will inevitably be contaminated by some level of nonspecific background (see Appendix 2). PAPA provides enrichment—not purification—of double-labeled complexes.</p><p>Nonspecific background in PAPA-SPT experiments could arise from multiple sources (see Appendix 2): first, even molecules that are not physically associated come into proximity by chance at some rate. Indeed, when JFX650-labeled cells were bathed in high concentrations of free JF549 dye, reactivation by green light occurred in proportion to the JF549 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). Nonspecific background is thus expected to be greater when sender-labeled proteins are expressed at high levels. Second, dark-state fluorophores spontaneously reactivate at a low basal rate even without photostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). Third, although we chose a time interval between green and violet pulses sufficient to bleach or re-shelve most reactivated fluorophores, it is possible that a small fraction of fluorophores reactivated by a violet pulse survived until the subsequent green pulse. Modeling of these different background contributions will be required to quantify more precisely the characteristics of interacting and noninteracting molecular subpopulations.</p><p>Notwithstanding these technical imperfections, PAPA has the potential to open new experimental routes toward understanding the dynamics of protein complexes in live cells. Our results show that PAPA can be used to detect potentially transient protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and to infer the composition of different peaks in single-molecule diffusion spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). A proof-of-concept application to mammalian AR revealed at a single-cell level the relationship between AR self-association and chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Future applications of PAPA could include measuring differences in the chromatin residence time of different transcriptional subcomplexes, detecting transient interactions mediated by low-complexity domains, or assessing the consequences of posttranslational modifications such as SUMOylation. In principle, a ‘pulse-chase’ PAPA experiment could be used to measure dissociation and binding kinetics of molecular complexes in live cells by monitoring how the diffusion spectrum of reactivated molecules changes as a function of time after the reactivation pulse. Although this study involved labeled proteins, PAPA could potentially be used to detect interactions between other biomolecules as well. By revealing the distinct features of specific molecular complexes, PAPA will provide a powerful new tool to probe biochemical mechanisms in live cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/l glucose (Thermo Fisher #10566016), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher #15140122) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

smFRET?</title><p>smFRET provides a powerful way to measure molecular-scale distances in reconstituted mixtures of purified components and in cell-free extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crawford et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hellenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

(2) Detection of inter-molecular interactions between membrane proteins expressed at a very low level and imaged by TIRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quast and Margeat, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sako et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sotolongo Bellón et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Why is live-cell smFRET restricted to these special cases? The most serious challenge is that single-molecule imaging requires a very low concentration of labeled molecules, far below the endogenous concentration of most proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hellenkamp et al., 2018</xref>). Sparse labeling provides a way to detect single molecules of one type of protein, but it is much harder to detect protein complexes by simultaneous sparse labeling of two different proteins. For instance, consider two proteins that are each present at a typical concentration of 100,000 molecules per nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biggin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cattoglio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2005</xref>). Unambiguous single-particle tracking of diffusing molecules requires that no more than about 10 molecules per nucleus (order of magnitude) fluoresce at a time—in this example, 1 out of 10,000 molecules. This presents no obstacle to imaging a single species of protein. However, two-color sparse labeling is not a practical way to detect interactions between two proteins because only one out of (10,000)<sup>2</sup> = 100,000,000 complexes will be double-labeled. While the exact numbers will of course differ from case to case, sparse double-labeling is not in general an efficient or quantitative way to detect intermolecular interactions within cells.</p><p>If instead the sample is sparsely labeled with one fluorophore and densely labeled with the other, spectral crosstalk becomes a serious problem. Because the excitation and emission spectra of fluorophores typically have long tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a and d</xref>), some donor fluorescence ‘bleeds through’ into the acceptor channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a and b</xref>), while the wavelength used to excite the donor also directly excites the acceptor to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1d and e</xref>). When the labeled molecules are sparse (e.g., when immobilized on a coverslip in vitro), this crosstalk can be quantified and corrected for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hellenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). The crosstalk becomes overwhelming, however, when one of the two channels is densely labeled. Bleed-through from a densely labeled donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b and c</xref>) or direct-excited fluorescence from a densely labeled acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1e and f</xref>) will typically overwhelm the much weaker smFRET signal.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spectral crosstalk impedes the use of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) as an interaction sensor in live cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Emission spectra of JF549 (orange) and JFX650 (red).

The sender is excited only briefly, and reactivation is then detected by direct excitation of the receiver, meaning that fluorescence of reactivated receiver molecules is not contaminated by bleed-through fluorescence from the sender. Molecules may be densely labeled with impunity in the sender channel, permitting efficient detection of their interaction with molecules sparsely labeled with the receiver. As a result, PAPA can detect interactions between molecules at concentrations much too high for either two-color SPT or smFRET.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Sources of background in PAPA-SPT</title><p>In an ideal PAPA-SPT experiment, single-particle trajectories observed after a green reactivation pulse would consist entirely of complexes in which sender- and receiver-labeled molecules physically interact. Such an idealized pure population of complexes is unattainable in practice due to contributions from several other types of localizations. We describe these background contributions below and suggest how future experimental and data analysis methods might minimize or correct for them.</p><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-1"><title>‘Leftover’ reactivated fluorophores from previous photoactivation pulses</title><p>After each photoactivation pulse, a sufficiently long period of red illumination will cause reactivated molecules to photobleach or return to the dark state. However, if reactivated molecules survive between reactivation pulses, then those reactivated by a preceding DR reactivation pulse will contaminate subsequent PAPA trajectories and vice versa. This can be avoided by monitoring the average number of localizations per frame in each experiment to confirm that the red illumination period between reactivation pulses is long enough to restore the number of localizations per frame to baseline. While we imaged U2OS cells, which are flat enough that fluorophores photobleach rapidly throughout their depth, background due to leftover fluorophores may become more troublesome when imaging thicker specimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-2"><title>Spontaneous reactivation</title><p>In addition to stimulated reactivation, dark-state fluorophores undergo spontaneous (‘thermal’) reactivation at a low basal rate, giving rise to a steady background number of localizations per frame. While this is useful for dSTORM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2021</xref>), it results in contamination of PAPA trajectories with noninteracting molecules that have reactivated spontaneously.</p><p>Because the number of localizations from spontaneous reactivation will presumably increase in proportion to the total number of dark-state fluorophores, this type of contamination is expected to become more severe the higher the concentration of receiver-labeled molecules. Reducing the fraction of molecules labeled with the receiver and increasing the reactivation pulse duration may help to maximize the ratio of photostimulated to spontaneous reactivation.</p><p>In the future, analysis algorithms could perhaps be modified to ‘subtract’ spontaneous reactivation from the diffusion spectrum by using the observed number of localizations before and after photostimulation pulses to infer the relative contributions of spontaneous and stimulated reactivation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-3"><title>Nonspecific PAPA</title><p>As described in ‘Discussion,’ several of our results reveal a low level of reactivation by PAPA independent of direct physical association between sender and receiver-labeled molecules. This is not surprising, given that even molecules with uncorrelated random spatial distributions will come together by chance some fraction of the time. This problem may be exacerbated by the large effective distance range of PAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Correcting for nonspecific PAPA quantitatively will be challenging, but we suspect it will be possible in at least some cases. Nonspecific reactivation is expected to scale linearly with the concentration of sender. Consistent with this, high concentrations of free JF549 dye induced nonspecific PAPA of JFX650-SNAPf, which increased in proportion to the JF549 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). In principle, it should be possible to measure the rate of nonspecific PAPA as a function of JF549-Halo concentration and then use this standard curve to estimate the rate of nonspecific PAPA corresponding to the concentration of the sender-labeled protein of interest. Alternatively, paired cell lines could be constructed that express the same concentration of Halo-tagged protein with either a SNAPf-tagged interacting protein or noninteracting SNAPf control protein (in the same subcellular compartment) to measure the rate of background reactivation. The Bayesian analysis framework used here could perhaps be extended to infer the probability that a given trajectory arises from specific or nonspecific PAPA, based on the relative rates of these two processes. Correcting for nonspecific PAPA will likely be simplest for proteins with a uniform spatial distribution, while more sophisticated models may be required to account for background PAPA between proteins with substantial spatial heterogeneity.</p><fig id="app2fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Background reactivation by free JF549 dye.</title><p>U2OS cells expressing Halo-SNAPf-3xNLS were labeled with JFX650-STL only and incubated with various concentrations of free JF549 dye.

The occurrence of a peak with similar D for samples with different SNAPf-tagged proteins suggested that this component was nonspecific. Indeed, when we analyzed weak background JFX650 STL staining of U2OS cells not expressing a SNAPf-tagged protein, we observed a peak with a similar diffusion coefficient, along with a smaller, faster-diffusing peak (D = 3–4 µm<sup>2</sup>/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2d</xref>, black curve). Thus, in addition to specifically labeling SNAPf-tagged proteins, JFX650-SNAP tag ligand produces at least two types of background staining in U2OS cells with well-defined diffusion coefficients. (As a more optimistic aside, detection of these background components highlights the ability of our state array SPT algorithm to identify subpopulations that might go unnoticed by models with a predefined number of states.)</p><fig id="app2fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—figure 2.</label><caption><title>SNAP ligand background staining.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Two example diffusion spectra of spontaneously reactivated trajectories in which an additional unidentified peak was observed at ~0.3–0.4 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (orange arrow).

One endogenous protein known to be labeled by SNAP ligand—albeit at &lt;1% the rate of SNAPf—is O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), the human enzyme from which SNAP tag was originally derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mollwitz et al., 2012</xref>). SDS-PAGE of lysates from JF549 STL-stained U2OS cells revealed a background band consistent in size with MGMT (~22 kDa), along with a second, lower-molecular weight band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), although we have not yet determined the identities of these nonspecifically labeled proteins. Nonspecific dye association with membranes is another potential source of background staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Because the SNAPf-tagged proteins we imaged in this article were expressed at fairly high levels, specific labeling was much greater than nonspecific staining, and nonspecific peaks were only rarely observed in diffusion spectra. However, this form of background staining could pose a more serious problem for SNAPf-tagged proteins expressed at a lower level. Development of improved combinations of self-labeling tags, such as recently described orthogonal HaloTag variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kompa et al., 2022</xref>), will be important for the continued technical advancement of both PAPA and SPT in general.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Supplementary note 1</title><p>Comparison of the SDS-PAGE gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c and d</xref> shows that the Halo component of the self-cleaving Halo-PT2A-SNAPf fusion is present at a higher concentration than the SNAPf component. This is expected, given that ribosomes often terminate translation at self-cleaving peptide sequences without restarting translation of the next open reading frame (1). Although we attempted to flow-sort populations of cells expressing similar levels of Halo, the Halo component of Halo-PT2A-SNAPf is expressed at a somewhat higher level than the other constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Thus, the background PAPA rate observed for Halo-PT2A-SNAPf may overestimate the contribution of nonspecific background to the PAPA rate of the other constructs.</p><p>SDS-PAGE analysis of Halo-Ig-SNAPf linker constructs stained with Halo ligand revealed both a full-length protein and a regular ladder of faster-migrating bands, whose molecular weights correspond to Halo fused to different numbers of Ig repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). SNAP ligand, in contrast, predominantly labeled the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>); smaller fragments were only faintly visible with enhanced image contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>, lower panel). Because the FRET donor (JF549) and PAPA receiver (JFX650) were conjugated to SNAPf, which is almost exclusive to full-length polypeptides, we expect that the presence of smaller Halo-tagged fragments will not impact our measurements of FRET and PAPA efficiency, as these Halo-only fragments will be “invisible” in measurements of JF549-STL fluorescence lifetime and JFX650-STL reactivation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Supplementary note 2</title><p>In principle, accurate quantification of FRET or PAPA does not require that the FRET donor or PAPA receiver be completely labeled. However, it is critical to thoroughly label the FRET acceptor or PAPA sender, as under-labeling would produce molecules labeled with donor or receiver only (i.e., with no FRET or PAPA), leading to an underestimate of the FRET or PAPA efficiency. Because Halo labeling is much more efficient than SNAPf labeling, we therefore labeled Halo with the acceptor (JFX650-HTL) in FRET experiments and the sender (JF549-HTL) in PAPA experiments, while labeling SNAPf with the opposite fluorophore.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76870.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" object-id-type="id" object-id="10.1101/2021.12.13.472508" link-type="continued-by" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.12.13.472508"/></front-stub><body><p>This work develops a new method to probe protein–protein interactions using proximity-assisted photo activation, in which a receiver fluorophore (longer wavelength) can be photoactivated by the excitation of a nearby sender fluorophore (shorter wavelength).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: J. Christof M.

In the introduction, the authors comment that smFRET has proven technically challenging in cells due to the requirement for sparse double-labeling, the large size of genetically encoded tags relative to the working distance of FRET, and the brief observation time (tens of milliseconds) for fast-diffusing complexes. Regarding the requirement for sparse double-labeling, the authors propose that in PAPA, one interacting partner can be sparsely labeled with the receiver and the other densely labeled with the sender, permitting efficient detection of double-labeled complexes. While such labeling strategy can circumvent the tradeoff between labeling density and spectral crosstalk inherent in smFRET, it would increase the unspecific photoactivation in PAPA.</p><p>2. PAPA can operate at a longer average intermolecular distance than FRET (Figure 2). While such property may be used to decrease the potential interference from the fusion tag by elongating the linkers between Halo/SNAPf and the protein of interest, it could increase the unspecific photoactivation in PAPA.</p><p>3. Regarding &quot;the brief observation time (tens of milliseconds) for fast-diffusing complexes&quot; for smFRET, I think the authors need more characterization to demonstrate the advantage of PAPA in single-molecule measurements. Exploring the capacity of PAPA in detecting single molecules would make this work much more valuable: &quot;Most proteins function by interacting with other proteins, yet we lack tools to study these potentially transient interactions at single-molecule resolution in live cells.&quot; Characterization of single-molecule detection may be conducted in vitro. In proof-of-concept experiments, PAPA detected the expected correlation between androgen receptor self-association and chromatin binding at the single-cell level. Single-molecule application could be conducted on nuclear pore complexes.</p><p>4. Overall, it is important to perform a direct comparison between PAPA and smFRET in protein-protein interaction measurements, including SMT, sub-population, and interaction dynamics. Actually, as PAPA is based on JF549 and JFX650, this pair of dyes not only be used as &quot;sender&quot; fluorophore and &quot;receiver&quot; fluorophore in PAPA but also be can be used as donor and receptor in smFRET at the same time. Therefore, besides detecting the ratio of green to violet reactivation, FRET signal could be also measured for experiments in Figures 3, 4, and 5, and such comparison is important for reinforcing the advantage of PAPA over smFRET in detecting dynamic protein-protein interactions in live cells, also essential for comparing unspecific activation in PAPA and crosstalk in smFRET.</p><p>5. Regarding the physical mechanism underlying PAPA, the authors propose a hypothesis that the excited sender reacts with some other molecule in the cell, producing a short-lived chemical species that diffuses a limited distance to react with and reactivate the receiver dark state. In Supplementary Figure 9, the authors showed that when JFX650-labeled cells were bathed in high concentrations of free JF549 dye, reactivation by green light occurred in proportion to the JF549 concentration. The activation dependence on the concentration of free senders might support the free radical hypotheses.</p><p>6.

Live-cell smFRET has been restricted to these special cases by the requirement that labeled proteins be at an extremely low (~100 pM) concentration. To our knowledge, no one has ever used smFRET to study inter-molecular interactions between endogenously expressed cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins in live cells, which is one reason that we explored PAPA as an alternative. Providing the requested side-by-side comparison would require an unprecedented experimental breakthrough to overcome the concentration limit of smFRET.</p><p>An essential point of our paper, which we now state more explicitly, is that PAPA provides a way of detecting protein-protein interactions in typical cases where smFRET does not work. In Appendix 1, we now discuss in more detail the limitations of smFRET and provide a new figure to illustrate these limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please address the issue of how one could distinguish PAPA from DR at the level of single-molecule trajectories instead of relying on the statistics of population measurements or PAPA/RA rations. This characterization could be done by using in vitro single-molecule imaging where the probability of PAPA and DR on the same molecule could be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point and Reviewer 3’s comments, we now include a time course experiment with immobilized H2B-Halo-SNAPf molecules labeled with either JFX650 STL alone or both JFX650 STL and JF549 HTL, illustrating JF549-dependent reactivation of single JFX650 fluorophores by 561 nm light and JF549-independent reactivation by 405 nm light (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><p>It is important to note that because single-particle tracking data are inherently stochastic, obtaining meaningful information always requires the analysis of statistical ensembles. This is true for any SPT experiment. It is never possible to assign with 100% certainty which diffusive state a short trajectory arose from, or to determine the dissociation rate constant of a single bound molecule, because each observed data point is a random draw from a statistical distribution.</p><p>Likewise, in the case of PAPA-SPT, “background” sources of reactivation make it impossible to say with 100% certainty whether an individual trajectory represents a complex in which sender and receiver fluorophores directly interact. We now state this caveat more clearly in the Abstract and Introduction, and we estimate the fold enrichment provided by PAPA in experiments with defined 2-component mixtures (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). In Appendix 2, we now discuss in more detail potential sources of background localizations and suggest future directions for addressing the problem of background.</p><p>Though PAPA is not perfect, our results show decisively that it can detect molecular interactions and enrich for protein complexes in which two dyes are in proximity. This discovery opens the door to a fundamentally new biophysical approach for probing molecular interactions in live cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide a comparison either experimentally or textually of how PAPA detects protein-protein interactions in comparison with BiFC and other commonly used protein FRET sensors.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a textual comparison in the Introduction, Discussion, and Appendix 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As the new method, PAPA basically benchmarks smFRET in the detection of molecular interactions in live cells, my comments and questions are mainly related to the advantage of PAPA over smFRET.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in Appendix 1, smFRET can only be used to detect molecular interactions in live cells if the interacting partners are present at extremely low concentrations and if they can be labeled to bring donor and acceptor dyes very close together. In this rare, fortunate case, smFRET may be preferable to PAPA, as it is exquisitely specific and reveals the precise distance between the two fluorophores.

By contrast, the problems with sparse labeling and spectral crosstalk alluded to by the reviewer make smFRET useless in most cases for detecting intermolecular interactions in live cells (see Appendix 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As a simpler experiment, we monitored DR or PAPA on individual H2B-Halo-SNAPf molecules labeled with JFX650 STL with or without JF549 HTL. In Figure 1—figure supplement 3, we provide montages and kymographs in which single immobilized fluorophores enter the dark state and get reactivated, and we report the statistics of reactivation. In addition, we now include sample videos from our other experiments, in which single fluorophores can be seen undergoing shelving and reactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

While we tried not to dwell on the limitations of smFRET in our original manuscript, we now realize that we did not make this point clearly enough. In Appendix 1 and the associated figure, we explain the technical limitations of live-cell smFRET. We summarize these points below.</p><p>Unless interacting molecules are both present at a very low concentration, smFRET presents a catch-22 between efficiency of double-labeling and signal to background. Detecting single molecules (either by widefield imaging or within a confocal detection volume) requires that they be labeled sparsely enough that each diffraction limited spot is occupied by much less than one molecule on average. This isn’t a problem when imaging a single type of protein, because the fraction of molecules labeled can be made as small as necessary. The problem arises in trying to detect interactions between two different proteins. If both proteins are labeled sparsely, then double-labeled complexes will constitute a vanishingly small minority of the total. If the labeled fraction of each protein is <italic>f</italic>, then the fraction of complexes that are double-labeled will be <italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup>.</p><p>It might seem that one could get around this limitation by sparsely labeling one protein with donor or acceptor and densely labeling with the other with the opposite fluorophore. In practice, this approach is stymied by the problem of spectral crosstalk between donor and acceptor. If the donor is densely labeled, then the long tail of its emission spectrum “bleeds through” into the acceptor channel (Appendix 1–Figure 1a-c), overwhelming the much weaker FRET signal. If the acceptor is densely labeled, then direct excitation by the laser used to excite the donor again overwhelms the FRET signal (Appendix 1–Figure 1d-f). These contributions of donor bleed-through and acceptor direct excitation are routinely accounted for in smFRET experiments involving sparse immobilized molecules. However, this is not possible for a sample in which one fluorophore is labeled orders of magnitude more densely than the other.</p><p>There are special cases in which single-molecule FRET has been used in live cells, involving either (1) double-labeled biomolecules that were microinjected or otherwise introduced into cells at a very low concentration to look at <italic>intra-</italic>molecular conformational changes or (2) membrane proteins expressed at such a low level that single pairs of molecules were resolvable by TIRF microscopy without the need for sparse labeling. To our knowledge, however, smFRET has never been used to study the interaction between endogenous cytosolic or nuclear proteins in live cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Regarding the physical mechanism underlying PAPA, the authors propose a hypothesis that the excited sender reacts with some other molecule in the cell, producing a short-lived chemical species that diffuses a limited distance to react with and reactivate the receiver dark state. In Supplementary Figure 9, the authors showed that when JFX650-labeled cells were bathed in high concentrations of free JF549 dye, reactivation by green light occurred in proportion to the JF549 concentration. The activation dependence on the concentration of free senders might support the free radical hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the text slightly to emphasize that this reaction-diffusion hypothesis is highly speculative. We also mention a second hypothesis, brought to our attention since our initial submission, involving off-peak energy transfer between the sender and the receiver dark state.</p><p>The reviewer is totally correct that a reaction-diffusion mechanism would predict a first-order dependence on free sender concentration. Unfortunately, an energy transfer model would make the same prediction. Careful physical chemistry experiments will be required to distinguish between these and possibly other models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lastly, as smBiFC is also an important approach for detecting single-molecule protein-protein interaction in live cells, it is necessary to include a few words in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that smBiFC provides a valuable complementary approach for studying stable protein complexes. We now include a discussion of smBiFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a valuable new method to assess protein-protein interactions in live cells.

The major disadvantage of this approach is that assembly of split proteins is effectively irreversible, perturbing the binding equilibrium between partners that may ordinarily bind and dissociate dynamically.</p><p>In contrast, PAPA is not expected to perturb dynamic binding equilibria. Consequently, one interesting future direction will be developing a “pulse-chase” variant of PAPA to measure binding and dissociation kinetics of molecular complexes in live cells. We now mention this idea in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>One straightforward experiment that would greatly improve this manuscript: Create and label transmembrane protein-Halo vs transmembrane protein Halo-SNAPf and then I would like to see dual-color video of the single molecules moving in both channels after DR and PAPA, respectively.

It is a little strange to see a single molecule fluorescence manuscript without any hint of what the data look like.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted the proposed experiment by expressing Halo-SNAPf-tagged membrane proteins at a very low concentration in U2OS cells. Unfortunately, because SNAPf is labeled ~2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than Halo (Wilhelm et al., 2021), we found it difficult to obtain a workable density of sparse localizations in both channels. (Note that inefficient SNAPf labeling is not a problem when SNAPf-tagged proteins are present at higher concentrations, the circumstance for which PAPA is the most useful.)</p><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 3, we present a slightly different experiment in which we sparsely labeled H2B-Halo-SNAPf with JFX650 SNAP tag ligand to resolve single immobilized molecules, while we either labeled Halo with JF549 or left it unlabeled as a negative control. Consistent with our other results, DR of immobilized receiver molecules occurred both with and without JF549, while reactivation by 561 nm light occurred much more frequently in the presence of JF549. We display the fraction of receiver dyes reactivated by each light pulse (top panels in a-f), kymographs of the overall population of molecules (bottom panels in a-f), and montages of single molecules getting shelved and reactivated (g).</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s critique, we have also included several supplemental videos to show more clearly what our microscopy data look like. Video 1 shows our initial observation of PAPA with NPM1-Halo protein (related to Figure 1). Video 2 shows an increase in PAPA signal upon rapamycin-induced dimerization of JF549-Halo-FRB and JFX650-SNAPf-FKBP (related to Figure 3). Video 3 shows a PAPA-SPT experiment with one of our defined 2-component mixtures (Figure 4j-l), in which the difference between PAPA and DR trajectories can be seen by eye. Also, please note that example single-molecule trajectories can also be found in the middle column of Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
