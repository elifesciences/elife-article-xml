However, the antibacterial property and mechanism of action of non-bactericidal cathelicidins are rarely known. Herein, a novel naturally occurring cathelicidin (<italic>Popu</italic>CATH) from tree frog (<italic>Polypedates puerensis</italic>) did not show any direct anti-bacterial activity in vitro. Intriguingly, intraperitoneal injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH before bacterial inoculation significantly reduced the bacterial load in tree frogs and mice, and reduced the inflammatory response induced by bacterial inoculation in mice. <italic>Popu</italic>CATH pretreatment also increased the survival rates of septic mice induced by a lethal dose of bacterial inoculation or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Intraperitoneal injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly drove the leukocyte influx in both frogs and mice. In mice, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH rapidly drove neutrophil, monocyte/macrophage influx in mouse abdominal cavity and peripheral blood with a negligible impact on T and B lymphocytes, and neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, but not T and B lymphocytes, were required for the preventive efficacy of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH. <italic>Popu</italic>CATH did not directly act as chemoattractant for phagocytes, but <italic>Popu</italic>CATH obviously drove phagocyte migration when it was cultured with macrophages. <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly elicited chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages through activating p38/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κB p65. <italic>Popu</italic>CATH markedly enhanced neutrophil phagocytosis via promoting the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Additionally, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH showed low side effects both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH acts as a host-based immune defense regulator that provides prophylactic efficacy against bacterial infection without direct antimicrobial effects. Our findings reveal a non-bactericidal cathelicidin which possesses unique anti-bacterial action, and highlight the potential of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH to prevent bacterial infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antimicrobial peptide</kwd><kwd>cathelicidin</kwd><kwd>prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>phagocyte influx</kwd><kwd>tree frog</kwd><kwd>amphibian</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Frog</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31870868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hailong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81373380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hailong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81802023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Research &amp; Development Plan in Social Development of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE2020652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012246</institution-id><institution>Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New insight into non-bactericidal cathelicidin against bacterial infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a wide array of gene-encoded small defensive molecules that have been identified from prokaryotic to eukaryotic kingdoms, including bacteria, fungi, plantae, and animalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mygind et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Radek and Gallo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang and Gallo, 2016</xref>). In vertebrates, cathelicidins constitute one of the major antimicrobial peptide families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). Cathelicidins are composed of an N-terminal signal peptide (about 30 amino acids), a highly conserved cathelin domain (99–114 residues) between signal peptide and mature peptide, and a C-terminal mature peptide (12–100 residues) with diverse structures (sequence and length) and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanetti et al., 2000</xref>). Based on the structural characterisation, the mature peptides of cathelicidins can be distinguished into amphipathic <italic>α</italic>-helical structure (e.g. human LL37), beta-sheet structure (e.g. porcine protegrin), and structure enriched in specific amino acids like proline/arginine residues (e.g. bovine Bac5 and Bac7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanetti et al., 2000</xref>). Cathelicidins were initially characterised for their direct antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gennaro et al., 1989</xref>), which act as natural amino acid-based antibiotics with broad spectrum that directly target bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Snoussi et al., 2018</xref>). Due to their rapid and potent bactericidal property without significant toxicity, cathelicidins have been considered as promising peptide antibiotics for therapy of bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oyston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zanetti, 2004</xref>). Several cathelicidin-derived peptide antibiotics have been tested in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gordon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mwangi et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to direct antimicrobial activity, more and more studies demonstrated that cathelicidins possess diverse immunomodulatory activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since the first purification of cathelicidins (Bac5 and Bac7) from bovine neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gennaro et al., 1989</xref>), more than 1500 vertebrate cathelicidins have been identified from aquatic vertebrates to terrestrial vertebrates, including fishes, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=cathelicidin">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=cathelicidin</ext-link>). Amphibians, the evolutionary link of vertebrates from aquatic animals to terrestrial animals, possess an ancient but powerful innate immune system to thrive in a wide range of habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu and Lai, 2015</xref>). Gene-encoded AMPs form a first line of innate immunity in amphibians to defense noxious microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2007</xref>). In the last decades, a total of 8350 (Jun 21, 2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amphibiaweb.org/">https://amphibiaweb.org/</ext-link>) amphibian species have been documented, and more than 1900 AMPs have been identified from amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu and Lai, 2015</xref>). However, cahtelicidins were absent in amphibians until cathelicidin-AL was characterised from <italic>Amolops loloensis</italic> (Anura: Ranidae), which filled the evolutionary gap of cathelicidin in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hao et al., 2012</xref>). So far, about 20 cathelicidins were identified from amphibians, including frog cathelicidins identified from <italic>Amolops loloensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hao et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Paa yunnanensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Rana catesbeiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ling et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Limnonectes fragilis</italic> (Anura: Ranidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Microhyla heymonsivogt</italic> (Anura: Microhylidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chai et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Polypedates puerensis</italic> (Anura: Rhacophorinae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mu et al., 2017</xref>), toad cathelicidins identified from <italic>Duttaphrynus melanostictus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Bufo bufo gargarizans</italic> (Anura: Bufonidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2015b</xref>), salamander cathelicidin identified from <italic>Tylototriton verrucosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mu et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Andrias davidianus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) (Caudata: Salamandridae), and others. Most of these cathelicidins from frogs, toads, and salamanders exhibited direct antimicrobial activities with broad spectrum via dual bactericidal-immunomodulatory activities. For example, cathelicidin-PY and cathelicidin-PP showed bactericidal activity and anti-inflammatory activity by disrupting bacterial membrane and blocking TLR4-mediated inflammatory response, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the anti-infective action and relative mechanism of bactericidal cathelicidins have been extensively studied. However, the role and mechanism of action of non-bactericidal cathelicidins against bacterial infection remain unknown. In this study, a novel naturally occurring glycine-rich cathelicidin, designated as <italic>Popu</italic>CATH, was identified from the tree frog of <italic>P. puerensis. Popu</italic>CATH did not show any direct antimicrobial activities. Interestingly, intraperitoneal injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH effectively prevented bacterial infection in tree frogs and mice, indicating an indirect antimicrobial mechanism of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH. The mechanism of action was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides new insight for better understanding the anti-infective property and relative mechanism of non-bactericidal cathelicidin, and highlights a host-based immune defense regulator for preventing bacterial infection without drug-resistant risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel naturally occurring cathelicidin was identified from the skin of tree frog, <italic>P. puerensis</italic></title><p>To understand the peptidomics of <italic>P. puerensis</italic> skin, the skin secretions were firstly separated by molecular sieving fast pressure liquid chromatography (FPLC) as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>.

The purified peptide exhibited an observed molecular weight of 4295.9 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Then, a total of 16 amino acids at N-terminus were determined as SRGGRGGRGGGGSRGG by automated Edman degradation. The N-terminus is enriched in glycine residues, which is possibly a novel member of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides like those glycine-rich cathelicidins found in frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hao et al., 2012</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Broekman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>According to this implication, we designed primer based on the conserved region of amphibian cathelicidins to clone the gene encoding the objective peptide.

In vitro antimicrobial assay, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH was devoid of any antimicrobial activity, including no significant effects on bacterial growth, metabolic activity and surface morphology, which is different from the bactericidal amphibian cathelicidins in previous studies. Intriguingly, although <italic>Popu</italic>CATH lacks direct anti-bacterial activities in vitro, it effectively provides prophylactic efficacy against bacterial infection in vivo with a broad spectrum, including Gran-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and even clinically isolated methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Intraperitoneal injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH before bacterial inoculation significantly attenuated the bacterial load in tree frogs and mice, reduced inflammatory responses induced by bacterial inoculation in mice, and increased the survival rates of septic mice induced by lethal dose of bacterial inoculation and CLP. Except for the intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH also effectively provides prophylactic efficacy against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results indicates that <italic>Popu</italic>CATH can provide preventive capacity via both intraperitoneal and intravenous injection routes. While intramuscular injection had no significant preventive effects against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is more likely that muscle is not rich in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, which are the key effector cells of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH. At the dose of 10 mg/kg, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH did not exhibit therapeutic efficacy against bacterial infection. In order to evaluate whether it has therapeutic efficacy at high doses, we increased the dose of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH. At doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly reduced the bacterial load when it was given at 4 hr after <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is possibly that bacteria have colonised in mice at 4 hr after bacterial inoculation, which need a higher dose of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH to drive more phagocytes for bacterial clearance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a non-bactericidal cathelicidin that can protect bacterial infection in vivo.</p><p>The extent of microbial infection-mediated host damage largely depends on host’s immune status. If the host can effectively initiate an immune defense, the invading microbes will be cleared, and host damage induced by microbial infection will be prevented or controlled. On the contrary, if the host cannot effectively initiate an immune defense, host will lose a balanced protection and microbial infection-mediated host damage will follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Silva, 2010</xref>). Neutrophils and macrophages are two professional phagocytic cell types, which comprise a myeloid phagocyte system of host. Neutrophils and macrophages usually work together in innate immunity as complementary partners of the myeloid phagocytic system. The local and global distribution patterns of neutrophils and macrophages are key immune parameter of host, which play critical roles in initiating effective immune defense against invading microbes. Our findings revealed that intraperitoneal injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH effectively elicited neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage influx in mice, and depletion of neutrophils or monocytes/macrophages blocked <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-mediated protection, indicating that <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-mediated protection depends on <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-induced neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage influx. Previous investigations have demonstrated that successful clearance of invading microbes largely depends on efficient migration of these cell types into the infectious sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves-Filho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nathan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scott et al., 2007</xref>). These suggest that intraperitoneal injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH enhanced the myeloid phagocytic system of mice, thus providing prophylactic efficacy against bacterial infection.</p><p>Macrophages have been shown to phagocytose and directly kill bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nijnik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scott et al., 2007</xref>). In our study, we found that <italic>Popu</italic>CATH did not promote in vitro phagocytosis of fluorescently labelled bacterial particles by mouse peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting no direct stimulation of the phagocytic activity of macrophages by <italic>Popu</italic>CATH. But <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly exhibited immunomodulatory effects on macrophages to induce phagocyte influx. In addition, neutrophils are principal phagocytes in the innate defense system and kill pathogens through mechanisms like oxidative killing activity and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neumann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niyonsaba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rowe-Magnus et al., 2019</xref>), and an influx of neutrophils to the site of infection is pivotal for the clearance of infectious bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves-Filho et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH was merely demonstrated to promote neutrophil phagocytosis through inducing NET formation, but not significantly elicited oxidative killing activity of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicated that macrophages and neutrophils responded to <italic>Popu</italic>CATH in their own manner.</p><p>The expression profiles of chemokines/cytokines in vitro and in vivo are somewhat different, but we observed that the profiles of the major chemokines/cytokines induced by PopuCATH, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3, are similar. We presumed that PopuCATH-induced chemokines/cytokines in vivo are consumed timely. In addition, macrophage is the unique effector cell type of PopuCATH in vitro. While there are many other cell types in vivo, such as monocytes and neutrophils, and we cannot exclude these cells are responsive to <italic>Popu</italic>CATH and subsequently produce chemokines/cytokines. These may explain the subtle differences of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-mediated chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages and mice. In mouse model, the production of chemokines/cytokines in mouse abdominal cavity peaked at 4 hr post injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH. The dynamic of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 production is consistent with the dynamic of neutrophil, monocyte/macrophage recruitment in the mouse abdominal cavity and peripheral blood. Although the pretreatment with <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly induced the production of chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6), <italic>Popu</italic>CATH ultimately attenuated the inflammatory response by decrease of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels post Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infection. Cathelicidins are able to block Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammatory responses, including those mediated by TLR2 and TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coorens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mookherjee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH did not affect LTA- and LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses in mouse peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH are independent of TLRs, and the attenuation of the inflammation may be secondary to the decrease of bacterial growth.</p><p>Some of the properties of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH are reminiscent of the activities of other cathelicidins like LL-37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), CRAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kurosaka et al., 2005</xref>), and OH-CATH30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2013</xref>), which selectively modulated innate immune responses and have been proposed to mediate protection in animal models. Compared to theses bactericidal cathelicidins with immunomodulatory properties, (i) the usage of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH is unlikely to induce drug-resistance because the peptide is unable to directly elicit stress on microbes. (ii) <italic>Popu</italic>CATH showed low side effects unlike LL-37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bąbolewska and Brzezińska-Błaszczyk, 2015</xref>). (iii) The expression profile of chemokines/cytokines in response to <italic>Popu</italic>CATH were largely different from those of other cathelicidins. (iv) Key effector cells for <italic>Popu</italic>CATH were also largely different from those of LL-37, CRAMP and OH-CATH30. For example, human cathelicidin peptide LL-37 has been shown to directly recruit neutrophils, monocytes, mast cells, and T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niyonsaba et al., 2002</xref>). While <italic>Popu</italic>CATH did not directly recruited leukocytes, it just recruited neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages via inducing chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages. In addition, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH just elicited neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage recruitment, but not T and B lymphocytes. Intraperitoneal injection of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly drove phagocyte influx in both abdominal cavity and peripheral blood, demonstrating that it effectively regulated both local and global innate immune response. As a result, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH pretreatment effectively reduced the bacterial load in both abdominal cavity and peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). (v) Intriguingly, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH is a glycine-rich cathelicidin containing 21 glycine residues. The amino acid component is different from LL-37, CRAMP, and OH-CATH30, which are not special residue-rich cathelicidins. The substitution of glycine residues of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH with alanine residues significantly resulted in a reduced efficacy against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH contains 10 arginine residues and seven serine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The substitution of arginine residues or serine residues with alanine residues also significantly led to a decreased efficacy against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data demonstrated that these enriched amino acid residues, including 21 glycine residues, 10 arginine residues, and 7 serine residues, are key structural requirements for <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-mediated protective efficacy against bacterial infection, and <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-mediated protection were specifically due to its unique structure. The first frog-derived cathelicidin is also rich in glycine residues. But it has different amino acid sequence with <italic>Popu</italic>CATH and exhibits direct antibacterial activity unlike <italic>Popu</italic>CATH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hao et al., 2012</xref>). Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides display a high structural diversity, and the diverse structures are responsible for their diverse functions. Accordingly, it is not difficult to understand that these two frog cathelicidins have different functions against bacteria.</p><p>Recently, many progresses have been achieved in the development of anti-resistance therapy for combatting multidrug resistant bacterial infection. Pre-clinical and clinical data pointed out host-directed therapeutic approaches to enhance ‘pauci-inflammatory’ microbial killing in myeloid phagocytes merited particular attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watson et al., 2020</xref>). Host-based therapeutic strategies can maximise microbial clearance and minimise host’s harmful consequences induced by inflammatory response, which has great promise. <italic>Popu</italic>CATH did not show any direct effects on bacteria, but effectively prevented bacterial infection through eliciting phagocyte influx and slightly promoting neutrophil phagocytosis. <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-mediated protection against bacterial infection can be considered as a classic host-based therapeutic strategy, and the non-bactericidal nature of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH may reduce the selective pressures that drive bacterial resistance. In an era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, discovery and development of naturally occurring non-bactericidal antimicrobial peptides like <italic>Popu</italic>CATH may facilitate us to prevent and overcome multidrug-resistant bacterial infection.</p><p>In summary, a glycine-rich amphibian cathelicidin, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH, was identified from tree frog. <italic>Popu</italic>CATH didn’t show any direct effects on bacteria but provided protection against bacterial infection in vivo. PopuCATH acted as an immune defense regulator against bacterial infection by selective modulation of innate immune response. Our findings provide new insights into the development of non-bactericidal cathelicidins to prevent bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Evangelos Giamarellos-Bourboulis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Xueqing Xu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The study by Yang et al., identified a novel cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide named PopuCATH from the tree frog, Polypedates puerensis. in vitro antimicrobial assay showed that PopuCATH didn't show any direct anti-bacterial activity. in vivo antimicrobial assay showed that intraperitoneal injection of PopuCATH before bacterial inoculation significantly reduced the bacterial load in tree frogs and mice, and reduced the inflammatory response induced by bacterial inoculation in mice. PopuCATH pretreatment also increased the survival rates of septic mice induced by a lethal dose of bacterial inoculation or CLP. The underlying mechanism revealed that intraperitoneal injection of PopuCATH significantly drove the leukocyte influx in both frogs and mice. In mice, PopuCATH rapidly drove neutrophil, monocyte/macrophage influx in mouse abdominal cavity and peripheral blood with a negligible impact on T and B lymphocytes, and neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, but not T and B lymphocytes, were required for the preventive efficacy of PopuCATH. in vitro cell migration assay indicated that PopuCATH did not directly act as chemoattractant for phagocytes, but PopuCATH obviously drove phagocyte migration when it was cultured with macrophages. Further investigation showed that PopuCATH significantly elicited chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages through activating p38/ERK MAPKs and NF-κB p65. Incubation of PopuCATH with neutrophils also markedly enhanced neutrophil phagocytosis via promoting the release of NETs. These findings revealed the anti-bacterial action and relative mechanism of a non-bactericidal cathelicidin against bacterial infection, which are novel and interesting. The main strength of this submission is the description of an entire novel peptide. The main limitation is the lack of sufficient explanation why popuCATH is able to prevent the development of an infection but has no effect at all when injected in parallel or after whole bacteria.</p><p>Suggestions for improvement:</p><p>– The authors need to run time-kill assays where in the interaction of popuCATH with antimicrobial is tested. This will provide some evidence if there is a future for this peptide in therapeutics.</p><p>– The authors cannot discuss on the anti-inflammatory activity of popuCATH since the attenuation of the inflammation may be secondary to the decrease of bacterial growth.</p><p>– It is very difficult to explain the total absence of effect when popuCATH is given after induction of infection or in parallel to bacterial challenge. This diversity generates ambiguity on the real physiological meaning of this peptide.</p><p>– Does popuCHATH has more than one gene per chromosome like defensins?</p><p>– In this study, a total of 16 amino acids at the N-terminus of the purified peptide were determined as SRGGRGGRGGGGSRGG by automated Edman degradation. The authors should have designed an antisense primer according to this partial mature peptide. However, the authors designed an antisense primer (5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTGTCTGCCTCCTCGGCTTCC</named-content>-3') according to the conserved domain of amphibian cathelicidins. Why?</p><p>– In Figures 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3C, 3D, 3E, and Supplementary file 3, the highest concentration of PopuCATH is 200 µg/mL. Why did the authors select 200 µg/mL, other than 300, 400, 500…µg/mL as the highest concentration?</p><p>– In both frogs and mice, PopuCATH (10 mg/kg) treatment at 8 h or 4 h before bacterial inoculation significantly reduced the bacterial load in tree frogs, but PopuCATH treatment at 4 h after bacterial inoculation did not significantly reduce the bacterial load. The results indicated that PopuCATH exhibited prophylactic efficacy, but not therapeutic efficacy, against bacterial infection. I would like to known the possible reasons why PopuCATH has prophylactic efficacy, but not therapeutic efficacy. At least, the authors should discuss the data.</p><p>– In Figure 8, PopuCATH-mediated chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages and mice is somewhat different. What is(are) the possible reason(s)? I suggest the authors discuss this difference.</p><p>– A previous study showed that a frog-derived glycine-rich cathelicidin exhibited direct antimicrobial activity (Hao et al., 2012). In this study, PopuCATH is also a glycine-rich cathelicidin. But PopuCATH did not show any direct antimicrobial activity at concentration up to 200 µg/mL. Why? Please discuss this phenomenon.</p><p>– Line 103-104, the authors described that a novel naturally occurring cathelicidin was identified from the skin of tree frog, P. puerensis. Line 497, the authors described that synthetic peptides were purchased from Synpeptide Co. Ltd. That is to say, some results were obtained by using naturally occurring PopuCATH, and the others were obtained by using synthetic PopuCATH. Please describe which results were obtained by using naturally occurring/synthetic PopuCATH in the responding Materials and methods section.</p><p>– In Figure 8, the mRNA levels of chemokines/cytokines in macrophages induced by PopuCATH were tested by Q-PCR. Please list the primers for Q-PCR assay.</p><p>– To assay the effector cells, the protective efficacy of PopuCATH was evaluated in neutrophil or monocyte/macrophage depletion mice by intraperitoneal injection of anti-Ly6G antibody (clone 1A8, BioXcell) and anti-CSF1R antibody (clone AFS98, BioXCell), respectively. However, I the scavenging efficiency of intraperitoneal injection of anti-Ly6G antibody (clone 1A8, BioXcell) and anti-CSF1R antibody (clone AFS98, BioXCell) should be provided, respectively.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72849.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions for improvement:</p><p>– The authors need to run time-kill assays where in the interaction of popuCATH with antimicrobial is tested.

The dynamic of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 production is consistent with the dynamic of neutrophil, monocyte/macrophage recruitment in the mouse abdominal cavity and peripheral blood. Although the pretreatment with <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly induced the production of chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6), <italic>Popu</italic>CATH ultimately attenuated the inflammatory response by decrease of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels post Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infection. Cathelicidins are able to block Toll like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammatory responses, including those mediated by TLR2 and TLR4 (Coorens et al., 2017; Mookherjee et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2013). In this study, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH didn’t affect LTA- and LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses in mouse peritoneal macrophages (<italic>Figure 8—figure supplement 3</italic>), suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH are independent of TLRs, and the attenuation of the inflammation may be secondary to the decrease of bacterial growth.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is very difficult to explain the total absence of effect when popuCATH is given after induction of infection or in parallel to bacterial challenge.

The authors should have designed an antisense primer according to this partial mature peptide. However, the authors designed an antisense primer (5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTGTCTGCCTCCTCGGCTTCC</named-content>-3') according to the conserved domain of amphibian cathelicidins. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>We have designed series of degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequence at the N-terminus. But we failed to clone the cDNA sequence. It is possibly that the amino acid sequence at the N-terminus of <italic>Popu</italic>CHATH is a glycine-rich peptide fragment, and the degenerate primers based on this fragment have high degeneracy. Therefore, we then designed an antisense primer (5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTGTCTGCCTCCTCGGCTTCC</named-content>-3') according to the conserved domain of amphibian cathelicidins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figures 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3C, 3D, 3E, and Supplementary file 3, the highest concentration of PopuCATH is 200 µg/mL. Why did the authors select 200 µg/mL, other than 300, 400, 500…µg/mL as the highest concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>According to a previous study (PMID: 17384586), we selected 200 µg/mL as the highest concentration for antimicrobial assay in vitro. Accordingly, if a peptide (drug) did not exhibit antimicrobial activity at a concentration up to 200 µg/mL in vitro, we usually think that it lacks direct antimicrobial activity. Based on the highest concentration used in antimicrobial assay in vitro, we also selected 200 µg/mL as the highest concentration for side effects assay in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In both frogs and mice, PopuCATH (10 mg/kg) treatment at 8 h or 4 h before bacterial inoculation significantly reduced the bacterial load in tree frogs, but PopuCATH treatment at 4 h after bacterial inoculation did not significantly reduce the bacterial load. The results indicated that PopuCATH exhibited prophylactic efficacy, but not therapeutic efficacy, against bacterial infection. I would like to known the possible reasons why PopuCATH has prophylactic efficacy, but not therapeutic efficacy. At least, the authors should discuss the data.</p></disp-quote><p>In the last version of our manuscript, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH did not exhibit therapeutic efficacy against bacterial infection at dose of 10 mg/kg. In order to evaluate whether it has therapeutic efficacy at high doses, we increased the dose of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH in the revised manuscript. When the dose of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH was increased to 20 mg/kg, <italic>Popu</italic>CATH significantly reduced the bacterial load when it was given at 4 h after bacterial inoculation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 8, PopuCATH-mediated chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages and mice is somewhat different. What is(are) the possible reason(s)? I suggest the authors discuss this difference.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression profiles of chemokines/cytokines in vitro and in vivo are somewhat different, but we observed that the profiles of the major chemokines/cytokines induced by <italic>Popu</italic>CATH, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3, are similar. It is possibly that <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-induced chemokines/cytokines in vivo are consumed timely. In addition, macrophage is the unique effector cell type of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH in vitro. While there are many other cell types in vivo, such as monocytes and neutrophils, and we cannot exclude these cells are responsive to <italic>Popu</italic>CATH and subsequently produce chemokines/cytokines. These points may explain the subtle differences of <italic>Popu</italic>CATH-mediated chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages and mice. And we have discussed it in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A previous study showed that a frog-derived glycine-rich cathelicidin exhibited direct antimicrobial activity (Hao et al., 2012). In this study, PopuCATH is also a glycine-rich cathelicidin. But PopuCATH did not show any direct antimicrobial activity at concentration up to 200 µg/mL. Why? Please discuss this phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed it in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“The first frog-derived cathelicidin is also rich in glycine residues. But it has different amino acid sequence with <italic>Popu</italic>CATH and exhibits direct anti-bacterial activity unlike <italic>Popu</italic>CATH (Hao et al., 2012). Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides display a high structural diversity, and the diverse structures are responsible for their diverse functions. Accordingly, it is not difficult to understand that these two frog cathelicidins have different functions against bacteria.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 103-104, the authors described that a novel naturally occurring cathelicidin was identified from the skin of tree frog, P. puerensis.
