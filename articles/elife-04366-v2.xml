This study uncovers and investigates the effect of phosphatidic acid on Kv channel gating. Using the method of reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers, in which protein and lipid components are defined and controlled, we characterize two effects of phosphatidic acid. The first is a non-specific electrostatic influence on activation mediated by electric charge density on the extracellular and intracellular membrane surfaces. The second is specific to the presence of a primary phosphate group, acts only through the intracellular membrane leaflet and depends on the presence of a particular arginine residue in the voltage sensor. Intracellular phosphatidic acid accounts for a nearly 50 mV shift in the midpoint of the activation curve in a direction consistent with stabilization of the voltage sensor's closed conformation. These findings support a novel mechanism of voltage sensor regulation by the signaling lipid phosphatidic acid.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04366.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04366.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04366.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The electrical signals that carry information through the nervous system rely on positively charged potassium ions moving in and out of neurons. These ions move through proteins called voltage-gated potassium channels that are embedded in the plasma membrane that surrounds the neurons. The potassium channels contain pores that can be opened and closed to control the movement of the potassium ions.</p><p>The main factor that controls the opening and closing of these channels—a process known as ‘gating’—is the voltage across the membrane. However, the channels can also be controlled by proteins, or by other molecules.</p><p>The plasma membrane is made of several different types of molecules called phospholipids. Some of these phospholipids are known to be involved in gating potassium channels, but the roles of other phospholipids remain unclear.</p><p>To investigate the role of a phospholipid called phosphatidic acid, Hite et al. placed potassium ion channels in artificial plasma membranes. These experiments revealed that phosphatidic acid alters the gating of potassium ion channels in two ways. The first way is generic: the negative charge in phosphatidic acid shifts the membrane voltage. The second way is specific to phosphatidic acid: the end of the molecule with the negative charge interacts with the part of the potassium channel that senses changes in voltage to keep the pore closed. The next challenge is to understand how neurons shift their phosphatidic acid levels to regulate their electrical activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04366.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04366.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated potassium channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM43949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hite</surname><given-names>Richard K</given-names></name><name><surname>Butterwick</surname><given-names>Joel A</given-names></name><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphatidic acid influences the gating of voltage-gated K+ channels through a non-specific surface charge mechanism and through a specific interaction between a voltage sensor arginine and the primary phosphate head group on the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels shape and terminate action potentials. While membrane voltage is the fundamental stimulus for Kv channel gating, other stimuli such as protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Vacher and Trimmer, 2011</xref>), intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gamper et al., 2005</xref>) and accessory proteins also regulate various Kv channels.</p><p>In retrospect, given the lipid complexity of cell membranes, it is not surprising to learn that specific lipid molecules are among the regulators of membrane proteins generally and ion channels specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hilgemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Dart, 2010</xref>). Even the structurally simple bacterial K<sup>+</sup> channel KcsA requires anionic phospholipids in order to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heginbotham et al., 1998</xref>), while the more complex eukaryotic inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels are so dependent on the lipid PIP<sub>2</sub> (see abbreviations section for lipid and detergent definitions) that they might have been called the PIP<sub>2</sub>-regulated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Suh and Hille, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). These are just two examples from a growing list of ion channels whose function depends on the presence of specific lipid molecules. In the latter example, since PIP<sub>2</sub> levels vary as a function of the physiological state of a cell, PIP<sub>2</sub> is known as a ‘signaling lipid’ because it triggers or signals the action of molecules to which it binds, such as inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels.</p><p>The function of certain Kv channels is also strongly influenced by the membrane's lipid composition. For example, the archeal KvAP channel requires phospholipids in order to open; they remain completely inactive in non-phospholipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). Eukaryotic Kv7 channels, also known as M current channels, depend on the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Falkenburger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kruse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rodriguez-Menchaca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Telezhkin et al., 2012</xref>). Stimulation of Gq-coupled G protein coupled receptors activates phospholipase C, which depletes PIP<sub>2</sub> from the membrane's inner leaflet and closes Kv7 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Dickson et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, PIP<sub>2</sub> functions as a signaling lipid in regulating Kv7 channel activity, just as for inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels.</p><p>In this study we report our findings from a systematic analysis of Kv1 channel dependence on membrane lipid composition. Channels were reconstituted into planar bilayer membranes, which allow complete control of lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Miller, 1986</xref>). We identified one lipid, phosphatidic acid (PA), which uniquely affects channel gating. We next studied the mole fraction dependence, membrane sidedness, and chemical characteristics of PA necessary to mediate its effect. We further show that PA similarly alters gating in the distantly related Kv channel KvAP. Experiments with mutant KvAP channels point to a mechanism whereby the primary phosphate group on PA stabilizes voltage sensor arginine residues in the closed conformation. Because PA is a naturally occurring ‘signaling lipid’ in the inner leaflet of cell membranes, we think we have likely uncovered a new and biologically relevant mode of Kv channel regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phospatidic acid regulates Kv channel gating</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> introduces the fundamental observation that this study seeks to understand: phosphatidic acid is an outlier among tested lipids in its ability to influence voltage-dependent gating of a K<sup>+</sup> channel.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04366.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>POPA modifies Kv channel gating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative family of currents recorded from Kv channels in DPhPC bilayers.

These currents were recorded in DPhPC bilayers, which were chosen as the ‘baseline’ lipid in this study because they form exceptionally stable bilayers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the influence of mixing different lipids at a mole fraction of 0.25 into the DPhPC lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Voltage sensors of Kv channels respond to the electric field inside the membrane, which is a function of both the applied voltage across the membrane and the surface potentials at the membrane–water interface. (The electric field is also a function of dipole potentials at the membrane water interface, but these, being essentially identical but oppositely oriented on the two sides of the membrane, cancel.) To interpret <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>, consider that the channel responds to V<sub>mem</sub>, the value of the voltage difference across the membrane where the voltage sensors reside. We the experimenters do not know the value of V<sub>mem</sub>, but set the command voltage, V<sub>i</sub> − V<sub>o</sub>, with our amplifier. The pictures illustrate how changing surface charge on the membrane gives rise to different values of V<sub>mem</sub> under a constant command voltage according to the expression V<sub>mem</sub> = (V<sub>i</sub> − V<sub>o</sub>) + (Φ<sub>i</sub> − Φ<sub>o</sub>), where Φ<sub>i</sub> is the surface potential on the inside and Φ<sub>o</sub> is the surface potential on the outside. Now consider a channel whose half open probability occurs at a particular value, V<sub>mem</sub>ʹ. In the absence of surface charge the experimenter observes the half open probability at a command voltage (V<sub>i</sub> − V<sub>o</sub>)<sub>mid</sub> = V<sub>mem</sub>ʹ. Upon addition of surface charge to the inner or outer leaflets the experimenter observes the half open probability at command voltage (V<sub>i</sub> − V<sub>o</sub>)<sub>mid</sub> = V<sub>mem</sub>ʹ + (Φ<sub>o</sub> − Φ<sub>i</sub>).

The equal magnitude but opposite direction shift produced by extracellular and intracellular POPG (or POPS) is consistent with a pure surface charge voltage offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). The shift produced by extracellular POPA—similar in direction and magnitude to the shifts produced by extracellular POPG and POPS—is also consistent with a surface charge voltage offset. In contrast, the larger shift produced by intracellular POPA implies that an additional ‘PA-specific’ voltage offset is occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Magnitude and origins of the PA-specific voltage offset</title><p>In the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref> both membrane leaflets contained the same lipid composition and therefore surface charge effects on the voltage sensor should have largely canceled. Therefore the V<sub>mid</sub> shift in these experiments must have resulted from a non-surface charge, PA-specific effect. In the experiments behind <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref> the lipid composition of the two leaflets was different and therefore different surface charge densities should have contributed to the V<sub>mid</sub> shift. As noted earlier, POPA in the inner leaflet caused a greater shift than POPA in the outer leaflet or than POPG/POPS in either leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B–D and 5A–E</xref>). This can be understood in terms of a specific offset added to a surface charge offset for the case of POPA in the inner leaflet. In fact the shift produced by inner leaflet POPA (∼+50 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4C and 5A</xref>) was approximately equal to the surface charge shift (∼+20 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>) plus the PA-specific shift (∼+30 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore POPA, like other anionic lipids, imposes a bias on the voltage sensor because it creates a layer of negative charge on the membrane surface. But unlike other lipids POPA also exerts an additional bias from the inner membrane leaflet.</p><p>The surface charge effect is a simple electrostatic consequence of a fixed charge layer on the membrane surface. What is the origin of the PA-specific effect? A strong interaction between guanidinium and phosphate groups has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Woods and Ferre, 2005</xref>). We therefore wondered whether PA in the inner membrane leaflet might stabilize a closed conformation of the voltage sensor through interactions with one or more of the arginine residues on the charge-bearing S4 helix of the voltage sensor. To test this possibility we turned to mutagenesis. Mutations in the paddle chimera Kv channel are not well tolerated so we tested whether the PA-specific effect is present in another distantly related Kv channel that can be more easily mutated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows a PA-specific (both membrane leaflets contain PA so the surface charge effect should be absent) positive V<sub>mid</sub> shift in the activation curve of the archeal channel KvAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In closed conformations the centrally located arginine residues likely approach the membrane's inner leaflet where they could interact with PA to help stabilize that conformation.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04366.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Structure and sequence alignment of Kv voltage sensor domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) View from the membrane plane of the voltage sensor domains of rat Kv1.2–2.1 paddle chimera and KvAP.

In its signaling role, PA is most commonly generated from either phosphatidyl choline via phospholipase D cleavage or from diacylglycerol via diacylglycerol kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Foster, 2013</xref>). Once generated, PA can then be rapidly depleted from the plasma membrane by phosphatidic acid phosphatase or a variety of phospholipases, thus allowing tight cellular control over its abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Foster, 2013</xref>). The precise control of plasma membrane PA concentrations in response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli combined with its influence on Kv channel function situate PA at a potential interface between cellular and global metabolic signaling pathways and membrane excitation.</p><p>Given the importance of PA to cellular signaling we suspect that the unique ability of PA to alter Kv channel gating is of biological significance. PA's effect is exerted by two mechanisms. The surface charge component is expected of any charged lipid disposed asymmetrically over the two membrane leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ramu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). The PA-specific component requires a primary phosphate group on the lipid molecule and acts only from the inner leaflet. The mutational data support a hypothesis that PA in the inner leaflet interacts with specific arginine residues in the voltage sensor. It seems plausible that hydrogen bonding between a primary phosphate group and arginine guanidinium group could hold the voltage sensor closed, requiring stronger depolarization to open (i.e. a V<sub>mid</sub> shift to more positive voltages). We have determined crystal structures of the paddle chimera mutant in the presence of brominated PA. We typically observe electron density for lipid molecules in the crystal structure, but none with a specific signal for bromine. Therefore we do not know whether PA is specifically bound to a groove on the surface of the channel. Given the somewhat surprising observation that PA influences gating similarly in both the eukaryotic Kv channel and KvAP—channels that are only distantly related—we imagine that PA's specific effect might be mediated through the guanidinium–phosphate interaction alone (i.e. without other interactions between the lipid tail and the channel). In other words, we imagine in a closed conformation the arginine could be released from its hydrogen bond pairing with counter charges on the channel and become anchored in the membrane's inner leaflet through hydrogen bonding with a primary phosphate group.</p><p>The magnitude of the voltage shift is definitely large enough to influence the electrical properties of an excitable cell. A shift towards more positive voltages brought about by increasing PA in the inner leaflet will ‘silence’ K<sup>+</sup> channels over an otherwise active voltage range. This silencing will lead to increased membrane excitability. The sensitivity of Kv channels to PA seems a likely link between metabolic pathways coupled to lipid metabolism and membrane excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Kv channel purification and reconstitution</title><p>A mutant of the rat Kv1.2 channel in which the helix-turn-helix segment termed the voltage sensor paddle was replaced by the corresponding segment from Kv2.1, known as the paddle chimera Kv channel, was expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tao and MacKinnon, 2008</xref>), with minor modifications.

The channel complex was extracted from membranes with DDM (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) and purified with a cobalt affinity column followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (GE Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). The size exclusion buffer was composed of 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 6 mM DM (Anatrace), 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml POPC:POPE:POPG 3:1:1 (mass ratio) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL).</p><p>Purified channel complexes were reconstituted into OM (Anatrace)-solubilized 3:1 (wt:wt) POPE:POPG lipid vesicles as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Long et al., 2007</xref>).

Lipids of desired compositions were prepared by dissolving argon-dried lipids in decane to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. Lipid solutions were painted over a 300 μm hole in a polystyrene partition that separated the two chambers to form the planar lipid bilayer. The chamber (<italic>cis</italic>) contained 4 ml of 150 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, while the cup (<italic>trans</italic>) contained 3 ml of 15 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Reconstituted channels were pipetted onto the chamber side of the bilayer after thinning of a planar lipid bilayer had been detected via monitoring of electrical capacitance. Once channels were successfully fused with the bilayer, 135 mM KCl was added to the cup side to equilibrate the K<sup>+</sup> concentrations across the bilayer. Membranes were held at a negative holding voltage, stepped to more depolarized voltages in 10-mV increments and then back to the negative holding voltage to close the channels. Shortly after the return to the negative holding voltage, inward current called ‘tail current’ is measured. The fraction of maximal activation at each depolarization voltage can be determined by graphing the inward tail current, normalized by the maximum value, as a function of the preceding depolarization voltage and fit to a two-state Boltzmann equation:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where I/I<sub>max</sub> is the fraction of maximal current, V is the command depolarization voltage to open the channels, V<sub>mid</sub> is the command voltage at which the channels have reached 50% of their maximal current, <italic>F</italic> is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature and Z is the apparent valence of the voltage dependence.</p><p>All recordings were performed using the voltage-clamp method in whole-cell mode.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor) and two other reviewers, both of whom, Kenton Swartz and Chris Miller, have agreed to reveal their identities.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript describing a thoughtful investigation of the lipid dependence of gating of a mammalian voltage-activated potassium (Kv1) channel. The main channel studied here is the Kv1.2/2.1 paddle chimera, for which an X-ray structure is available, and the authors incorporate the channel into planar lipid membranes, using DPhPC as the standard control lipid. When comparing a wide range of additional lipids incorporated into both leaflets of planar lipid bilayers, the authors find that the phosphatidic acid (PA) DOPA produces the most dramatic effect, shifting the G-V relationship to more positive voltages. Further comparison of lipids with alterations in either the headgroups or acyl chains shows that this effect is due to the presence of an anionic headgroup. In elegant experiments with a phospholipase D, which will produce PA from DPhPC, the authors find different effects when modifying the external and internal leaflets. In the external leaflet, PA shifts the G-V to negative voltages whereas in the internal leaflet PA produces a much larger shift to more positive voltages. The authors then compare a series of anionic lipids (DOPA, POPG and POPS) with zwitterionic POPC in experiments in which vesicles containing those lipids are fused with planar lipid membranes containing DPhPC. All three anionic lipids produce negative shifts in the G-V when applied externally, but when applied internally, POPA produces a larger positive shift when compared to POPG or POPS. From these results the authors conclude that anionic lipids in external and internal leaflets shift the G-V relationships by altering the surface charge of the membrane, and that intracellular PA has an additional effect that is not as robust as the larger anionic lipids tested. In a final series of experiments with KvAP, another Kv channel for which structures are available and that is easier to mutate, express and reconstitute, the authors contend that this additional effect of internal PA can be explained by an interaction of the anionic lipid with the innermost basic residue positions of the S4 helix that stabilizes a closed state.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers really like the work, and think that careful revision of the manuscript could make an excellent paper that would be very appropriate for <italic>eLife.</italic></p><p>Suggestions for revision:</p><p>1) While the paper is generally clear, the writing could be improved.

We appreciate that the authors are breaking new ground, and are trying to not get bogged down, but it would be helpful to the reader to have a bit more information than simply G-V relations and Vmid values. For most of the experiments it would be nice to provide example traces so the reader can appreciate whether the various manipulations have interesting effects on the kinetics of activation, inactivation or deactivation, and it would be helpful to report the slopes of the fits of Boltzmann functions to the data.

For the anionic phospholipids, fusion produced reproducible shifts in the Vmid. For POPC, repeated attempts at fusion yielded no change in the Vmid. The absence of a shift following fusion of POPC vesicles was interpreted as an asymmetric distribution of POPC in a DPhPC membrane having no influence upon Kv channel activation. Without independent verification, however, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the POPC vesicles failed to fuse with the membranes. Such a possibility does not alter our overall interpretation of the results, as the clear difference in responses between PA and the other anionic phospholipids would still remain.</p><p><italic>6) The presentation of information depicted in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>needs work and will likely make readers more confused rather than less.

In contrast, Oliver and colleagues suggest that PUFAs inhibit Kv channels by inducing conformational changes in the selectivity filter (Oliver et al, <italic>Science.</italic> 304, 265-270.). Due to the lack of consensus in the field, we would prefer not to include the discussion of PUFAs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
