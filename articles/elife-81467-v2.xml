that this medial temporal lobe (MTL) structure plays a ubiquitous role in arbitrating AA conflict. We challenge this perspective by using three different AA behavioral tasks in conjunction with optogenetics, to demonstrate that a neighboring region in male rats, perirhinal cortex, is also critically involved but only when conflicting motivational values are associated with objects and not contextual information. The ventral hippocampus, in contrast, was found not to be essential for object-associated AA conflict, suggesting its preferential involvement in context-associated conflict. We propose that stimulus type can impact MTL involvement during AA conflict and that a more nuanced understanding of MTL contributions to impaired AA behavior (e.g., anxiety) is required. These findings serve to expand upon the established functions of the perirhinal cortex while concurrently presenting innovative behavioral paradigms that permit the assessment of different facets of AA conflict behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>approach-avoidance conflict</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>medial temporal lobe</kwd><kwd>punishment</kwd><kwd>behavioral inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>156070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Andy CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>Rutsuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetics was used to reveal a novel role for the perirhinal cortex in regulating approach-avoidance behaviors under object-based motivational conflict.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approach-avoidance (AA) conflict is elicited when an organism experiences competition between incompatible motivations of being attracted to and repelled by the same goal stimulus. Its effective resolution is vital for survival and everyday decision-making, while its dysfunction manifests across a spectrum of psychiatric disorders including anxiety and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aupperle and Paulus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fricke and Vogel, 2020</xref>). Since the septo-hippocampal system was first theorized to mediate a behavioral inhibition system (BIS) that is activated to suppress approach responses under conflict situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref>), converging cross-species empirical evidence has highlighted a critical role for the ventral (rodent) or anterior (primate), but not dorsal/posterior portion of the hippocampus (HPC), in modulating anxiety and AA responding during high motivational conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito and Lee, 2016</xref>). For example, in addition to increasing anxiolytic behavior in rodents, lesion or pharmacological inactivation of the ventral HPC (vHPC) increases approach behaviors to motivationally conflicting learned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bannerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannerman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannerman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yeates et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and patient neuropsychological studies with analogous AA tasks have revealed anterior HPC involvement when participants experience high AA conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Neil et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the focus on the role of the HPC in AA conflict processing, very limited empirical work has explored the potential contributions of the surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortices. This is somewhat surprising given the intricate anatomical and functional relationships between MTL structures. Moreover, a revised formulation of the BIS postulated the involvement of the entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex (PRC) in the detection and resolution of AA conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref>), a suggestion that has not yet, to our knowledge, been fully examined empirically. Theoretical models of MTL function posit that stimulus type can impact MTL structure recruitment during cognition. Specifically, the HPC is implicated in scene and context-based processing, while the PRC is predominantly involved in object-associated processes, both within the domain of memory and even beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeidman and Maguire, 2016</xref>). Since ethological anxiety tasks and paradigms of AA conflict processing have typically employed spatial stimuli (e.g., scene images) or required environmental exploration (e.g., maze navigation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannerman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Neil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>), it raises the question of whether the HPC plays a ubiquitous role in AA conflict processing across all stimulus domains or whether other MTL structures may also play a critical role depending on the stimuli involved.</p><p>Here, we designed two rodent AA tasks using objects as target stimuli to test the hypothesis that differential MTL recruitment occurs during AA conflict processing in a stimulus-type specific manner in rodents. In both tasks, rats were trained to associate object pairs with either appetitive or aversive outcomes and were subsequently presented with these objects in a conflict arrangement (simultaneous presentation of appetitive and aversive objects) while the PRC or vHPC (CA3 subfield) was optogenetically inhibited. However, each task was conducted in a different apparatus, specifically a runway or shuttle box, to elicit a different type of avoidance behavior (passive vs. active). The PRC was also inhibited while animals completed an established ‘contextual’ AA task, known to be dependent on the vHPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yeates et al., 2020</xref>). Across both object-based tasks, we observed that inhibition of rodent PRC, but not the vHPC, induced a significant approach bias in response to objects signaling availability of both reward and punishment. In contrast, there was no impact of PRC inhibition when conflict was elicited by contextual cues. These findings implicate a hitherto unconsidered substrate in the arbitration of AA conflict; they emphasize the need to consider the involvement of the broader MTL in AA conflict processing and have implications for our understanding of the neural substrates underlying disorders in which AA conflict behavior is compromised.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic inhibition of PRC increases approach behavior to motivational conflict represented by objects in a runway paradigm</title><p>Rats were first surgically infused with inhibitory archaerhodopsin T (ArchT) or green fluorescent protein only (GFP) and implanted bilaterally with optic fibers into the PRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

PRC groups acquired the object-outcome associations successfully by test 2, with rats spending the most time in the goal box after exposure to the appetitive object pair (p&lt;0.001), and the least time after aversive object pair exposure (p&lt;0.001), compared to goal box time in neutral trials (valence: F(2,40)=396.99, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.95).

When animals were exposed to a high conflict object pair, optogenetic inhibition of PRC (laser on) significantly increased time spent in the goal box compared with trials completed without inhibition (laser off), and compared to GFP control animals with laser on and off (laser × construct: F(1,20)=40.73, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.67; all post hoc: p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), indicative of an increase in approach behavior under motivational conflict. An analysis of the ‘difference score’ between the two conflict test sessions (i.e., laser on–laser off) also indicated that laser-treated ArchT animals spent more time in the goal box than GFP animals (ArchT: 29.72 (M)±14.23 (SD), GFP: –1.41±8.37, t(20) = 6.38, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, PRC inhibition led to a significant decrease in the number of retreats from the goal box (laser × construct: F(1,20)=24.08, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.55), although there was no effect on the number of goal box entries (laser × construct: F(1,20) = 3.12, p=0.09, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) during the choice period. PRC inhibition also had no impact on the latency to enter (LTE) each of the object, neutral and goal boxes (laser × construct: F(1,20) = 2.24, p=0.15, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.1; laser × construct × box: F(2,40)=0.47, p=0.63, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.02), nor did it have an effect on the exploration of appetitive and aversive objects (laser × construct: F(1,20) = 3.10, p=0.09, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.13; laser × construct × object: F(1,20)=0.15, p=0.70, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that when faced with high motivational conflict, PRC-inhibited rats entered the goal box as readily as control animals but stayed longer and retreated less, indicative of a potentiated approach bias under conflict. This effect was not observed in the neutral object test: PRC inhibition had no effect on the time spent in the goal box after exploring neutral objects (laser × construct: F(1,18)=1.02, p=0.33, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Impact of perirhinal cortex (PRC) inhibition on object approach-avoidance (AA) conflict runway task performance.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Rats (n=10 archaerhodopsin T [ArchT]; n=12 green fluorescent protein [GFP]) underwent a series of tests conducted in extinction: high conflict (APP+AV objects), neutral (NEU+NEU), and low conflict (APP+NEU or AV+NEU).

In contrast, PRC inhibition did not disrupt behavior during a contextual vHPC-dependent AA task. Critically, PRC inhibition did not disrupt AA behavior in response to neutral stimuli or novel re-configurations of objects with the same valence. Furthermore, selective optogenetic inhibition of the PRC continuously throughout the entire test session or prior to the first goal box choice (and therefore post-object exploration) induced the same approach bias in choice behavior, suggesting that the observed impact of PRC inhibition on object-associated AA conflict processing was unlikely to be driven by impairments in mnemonic functioning.</p><p>Our finding that optogenetic inhibition of PRC, but not vCA3, disrupted object-associated motivational conflict behavior contrasts with a plethora of studies detailing a role for the rodent vHPC in the resolution of AA conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito and Lee, 2016</xref>). However, a common characteristic of these prior studies is the employment of spatial/contextual stimuli during testing. For example, when spatial locations in ethological tests of anxiety or contextual cues with learned incentive values in a Y-maze task have been used, animals with broad vHPC damage or subfield-specific inactivation of the vCA3 and DG exhibit increased approach behavior under motivational conflict, whereas vCA1-inhibited animals exhibit greater avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannerman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannerman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yeates et al., 2020</xref>). The present study advances this work by utilizing discrete objects as target stimuli and raises the possibility that the vHPC may not play a ubiquitous role in AA conflict processing. Indeed, an absence of anterior HPC involvement has been previously reported in an instrumental AA decision task in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wallis et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, we recently reported significant involvement of human PRC rather than HPC activity, as measured by fMRI, during the resolution of AA conflict induced by objects with opposing valences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2023</xref>). The current findings not only provide invaluable reverse-translational evidence for the rodent PRC mediating analogous behavior, but uniquely demonstrate the necessity of PRC to the arbitration of object-associated AA conflict. Importantly, our observation that PRC inhibition did not alter behavior toward a contextual representation of motivational conflict (i.e., conflicting ‘context-like’ bar cues that span a Y-maze arm) underlines the specificity of the reported PRC effects to object stimuli, and aligns with theoretical viewpoints that posit a degree of stimulus specificity across MTL structures ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davachi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeidman and Maguire, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that the observed approach bias in the face of object-associated motivational conflict during PRC inhibition reflects both a robust increase in approach behaviour and decrease in avoidance behaviour. The latter is reflected in the fact that PRC inhibition induced an increase in the time spent in the ‘Av-Neu low conflict’ condition of the runway task and led to a prolonged ‘escape latency’ when rodents were first exposed to conflicting object pairs. PRC-inhibited rats also spent a greater amount of time in the conflict cued side in the shuttle box task, further lending support to the idea that there was a decrease in avoidance. On the other hand, we also observed that PRC-inhibited animals spent a disproportionate amount of time by the sucrose dispenser in the runway task, seeking out reward under extinction conditions in the face of motivational conflict, which we interpret as an increase in approach behaviour.</p><p>Although the observed involvement of the PRC in the arbitration of AA conflict may, at first sight, be unexpected given that this area is traditionally associated with mnemonic function, its involvement in motivational processes is reasonable considering its reciprocal connectivity with limbic centers of the brain, including the amygdala and orbitofrontal, prelimbic and infralimbic cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tomás Pereira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agster and Burwell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tomás Pereira et al., 2016</xref>). The non-human primate PRC has been implicated in reward-related behavior in a role that goes beyond the basic processing of stimulus-valence associations and may be crucial for mediating more nuanced relationships between cues, behavior, and reward outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suzuki and Naya, 2014</xref>). Specifically, while PRC damage/inactivation does not eliminate reward-related behavior, it does impact an animal’s ability to track and flexibly adapt to changes in the magnitude and schedules of reinforcement of expected reward associated with visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Richmond, 2000</xref>). Moreover, electrophysiological data point toward a role for PRC in processing configurations of multiple visual stimuli to predict upcoming reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohyama et al., 2012</xref>). Our data complement and extend these findings by suggesting that rodent PRC is not simply necessary for the retrieval of object valence, as evidenced by valence-appropriate discriminative responding for low conflict (i.e., approaching more for appetitive-neutral vs. aversive-neutral), neutral and same valence object pairs during PRC inhibition, and may be engaged as part of the BIS to suppress approach when a violation of expected reward/punishment contingencies (e.g., conflict) is detected. Indeed, the absence of a functional PRC led to animals spending a greater proportion of time by the sucrose dispenser when presented with high conflict stimuli in the runway task, compared with stimuli with low or no motivational conflict, reflecting greater approach in anticipation of impending reward. Similarly, PRC-inhibited animals exhibited increased approach, and decreased avoidance of motivationally conflicting objects in the shuttle box task. Our finding of PRC, but not vHPC involvement in modulating conflict-elicited AA behavior, challenges the perspective proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref> that MTL areas such as the PRC and entorhinal cortex are recruited to provide stimulus information of conflicting goals to the HPC, and that the HPC engages in resolving response conflicts. The present data would suggest that the PRC is an integral component of the BIS when conflicting configurations of learned object stimuli are encountered, independently of HPC recruitment.</p><p>An intriguing question is why PRC inhibition potentiated approach, as opposed to avoidance, of an uncertain outcome. In the present study, the excitatory/principal neuronal population (i.e., CaMKIIα-expressing cells) in PRC was targeted and silenced. These neurons receive powerful excitatory inputs from the basolateral amygdala, lateral amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Curtis and Paré, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith and Paré, 1994</xref>), which can override a strongly inhibitory intrinsic network within PRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kajiwara and Tominaga, 2021</xref>), and increase the likelihood of signal propagation to the entorhinal cortex and HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kajiwara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paz and Pare, 2013</xref>). In contrast, stimulation of local, short-range neocortical inputs to PRC have been shown to evoke inhibitory potentials, suggestive of the recruitment of inhibitory interneurons giving rise to feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Unal et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the absence of glutamatergic projection neurons in the PRC could conceivably disrupt the balance of excitation/inhibition in PRC, and lead to a loss of output to a downstream target that is critical in suppressing approach in the face of motivational conflict. In the absence of an effect of inhibiting vHPC, a prominent projection target of PRC, on the expression of object-based AA conflict, we propose the nucleus accumbens, or septum as alternative candidate downstream areas that subserve this function. These areas receive direct projections from PRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tomás Pereira et al., 2016</xref>) and are intrinsically organized (due to GABAergic principal neurons) to inhibit areas further downstream that are concerned with the execution of motor programs and motivated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Floresco, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wirtshafter and Wilson, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Finally, given the well-established role of the PRC in recognition memory and the processing of novelty signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Aggleton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winters et al., 2008</xref>), it is important to highlight that the present effects of PRC inhibition cannot be explained by a disruption to this function. PRC-intact rats typically increase exploration of novel compared to familiar stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winters et al., 2008</xref>) and yet here, PRC inhibition did not change choice behavior during a ‘no conflict’ test in which novel, recombined stimulus pairs within the same valence were presented. Similarly, it is also unlikely that the observed PRC-mediated impairments stem from a deficit in the perceptual processing of the two objects that comprised the high and low conflict pairs, as evidenced by the ability of PRC-inhibited animals to discriminate between valences during the low conflict test. Furthermore, although there is a delay between stimulus presentation and outcome presentation in the object-based runway AA task, it is unlikely that impairments in trace conditioning, in which the PRC has been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kholodar-Smith et al., 2008</xref>), can account for the PRC-mediated impairments in conflict processing. When stimulus presentation occurred in the outcome-associated area in the object-based shuttle box task (i.e., no delay between stimulus and outcome presentation), a similar increase in approach behavior toward high conflict object pairs was observed.</p><p>To conclude, we demonstrate that rodent PRC is involved in the resolution of AA conflict, particularly when the goal stimulus is object-based. Thus, stimulus type may fundamentally alter how the brain represents motivational conflict, which may in turn recruit differential MTL structures for the purpose of AA conflict resolution. Our findings also have implications for our understanding of mental disorders in which AA behavior is awry and suggest that a singular focus within the MTL on HPC dysfunction may be inadequate. Further work is needed on delineating the network of structures involved in various aspects of the conflict process, along with examining how a changing stimulus gradient (e.g., object vs. context vs. social) may recruit different brain structures to resolve conflict.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Long-Evans rats, male, 2–6 months old</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#2308852,<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:RGD_2308852">RGD_2308852</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rb Anti-c-Fos rabbit polyclonal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 226 003,<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2231974">AB_2231974</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TSA-IHC (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peroxidase AffiniPure F(ab')<sub>2</sub> Fragment Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), donkey polyclonal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson ImmunoResearch</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 711-036-152,<break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2340590">AB_2340590</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TSA-IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV- CaMKIIa-ArchT-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene/Ed Boyden</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 99039-AAV1,<break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_99039">Addgene_99039</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Inhibitory opsin</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV-CaMKIIa-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene/Bryan Roth</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 50469-AAV8,<break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_50469">Addgene_50469</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control virus</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPSS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IBM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ibm.com/spss">https://www.ibm.com/spss</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 26</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ethovision XT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Noldus Information Technology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.noldus.com/ethovision-xt">https://www.noldus.com/ethovision-xt</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Animal tracking software/ hardware</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Prism</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/">https://www.graphpad.com/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NHS-Rhodamine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 46406</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rhodamine-based dye; TSA-IHC (1:500)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were 53 male Long Evans rats (Charles River Laboratories, QC, Canada) weighing between 320 and 380 g at the start of the experiment.

A collection of ‘junk objects’ (i.e., no prior reinforcement history and no natural significance to the rats) were obtained for behavioral testing for the three behavioral experiments (object-based runway task, object-based shuttle box task, NOR). For NOR task, the pairs of objects were composed of the same material so they could not be readily discriminated by olfactory cues, whereas object exploration preference was used to assign pairings for the object-based AA tasks (see task procedure below). The objects were attached to the apparatus floor with a hook-and-loop fastener. All objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol solution after each trial for all experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Bar cues</title><p>A set of visuotactile cues were used in the Y-maze task, which consisted of wood panel inserts (46.5 cm [L] × 9.6 cm [H]) affixed to the length of each arm with hook-and-loop fasteners.

On day 1, rats were confined to the start box for 30 s, and then permitted to explore the entire apparatus for 3.5 min. On day 2, following a 30 s confinement to the start box, rats could proceed into and were confined within the object box (without any objects) for 1 min, with re-entry to the start box prohibited by a stainless-steel guillotine door. Rats could then proceed to the neutral box, in which they were confined for 1 min, with re-entry to the object boxes prohibited. Following this, they were confined to the goal box for 30 s before being removed from the apparatus. Days 3 and 4 introduced the rats to the six object cues used for the object-based AA task; each rat performed three daily trials, with each trial presenting two object cues, and thus rats were exposed to all six object cues daily. The order that the objects appeared for each rat was counterbalanced between animals and habituation sessions, and the time spent exploring the objects was recorded. Object habituation began with 30 s confinement to the start box, and rats were then permitted 1 min to explore the two object cues during a given session. Rats then entered the neutral box, in which they were confined for 1 min, followed by the goal box, in which they were confined for 30 s. The affective valence of the object cues for subsequent conditioning sessions was determined based on exploration latencies during habituation 3 and 4. The two most-explored object cues were assigned as the aversive cue pair, the two least-explored as the appetitive cue pair, and the remaining two as the neutral cue pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-2"><title>Object cue-outcome conditioning</title><p>The animals were trained to associate the three object pairs with either appetitive (sucrose), aversive (mild foot shock), or neutral (no event) outcomes over nine daily conditioning sessions. Each rat completed three trials per day, one for each affective valence. During a trial, the time spent exploring each object cue was recorded, and the rat could enter the neutral box after 1 min elapsed. After 10 s, rats could enter the goal box where they were confined to for 30 s during which the outcome assigned to the explored object pair was administered (appetitive: 2×0.8 ml of 20% sucrose every 15 s; aversive: 2×0.75 s, 0.26–0.29 mA shock every 15 s; neutral: no outcome). The magnitude of shock was deliberately kept at a level to elicit avoidance behaviour but preserve the animals’ exploratory drive (i.e., minimize freezing). After 30 s elapsed, rats were removed from the apparatus and returned to their home-cage in preparation for the next conditioning trial. If rats did not readily enter the next box within 30 s, they were gently ushered in by the experimenter, and object, neutral, and goal boxes LTE data was also recorded as a potential measure of preference/aversion of expected outcome. The shock level was calibrated for each rat during the first aversive conditioning session and fixed at a level which elicited a mild startle response and defensive treading behavior, but not freezing. The order of presentation of the object cues and the order in which rats completed each trial were changed daily.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-3"><title>Conditioned cue acquisition test</title><p>Acquisition tests performed under extinction conditions were conducted after conditioning days 4 and 8 in order to assess learning of the object cue-outcome associations.

Successful acquisition was indicated by the rats spending more time in the goal box for appetitive trials than aversive and neutral trials, and rats spending more time in the neutral box for aversive trials than appetitive and neutral trials.

The laser was then turned on for animals completing the entire task under PRC inhibition, before the start box guillotine door was removed exposing the animals to the object box, to which they were confined upon entry. One appetitive object cue and one aversive object cue were presented in recombination as the ‘high conflict object pair’, which animals could freely explore for 1 min. Identical to conditioning sessions, rats were then given 30 s to freely enter the neutral box, after which they were gently ushered in by the experimenter, and confined therein for 10 s. Rats were then permitted to enter the goal box. At this point, rats were given 3 min to freely move between the neutral box and goal box, after which the laser was turned off and the animal was removed from the apparatus and returned to its home-cage in preparation for the next trial. All rats completed two conflict test sessions, one with the laser on and one with the laser off, each with a different set of conflict object cues. The order of the laser treatment, the assigned combination of the conflict object cues, and whether the aversive or appetitive object was presented first in the runway were all counterbalanced.</p><p>The time spent in the neutral and goal boxes, the number of entries into the goal box, and LTE each of the boxes (object, neutral, goal) in the runway were recorded during the tests. As an additional measure of AA behavior, the number of full-body entries into and retreats from the goal box were recorded. A full-body entry occurred when the animal’s hind limbs stepped on to the grid floor of the goal box. To be consistent with our previous work using the same Y-maze task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>), a retreat occurred when the animal exhibited a half-body entry (e.g., only forelimbs) or head-poke into the goal box followed by an immediate exit or backward treading into the neutral box.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-5"><title>Neutral object test</title><p>To ensure that PRC-inhibited could still discriminate stimuli that they were trained on during the conditioning session, a test with the neutral object pair was conducted on the same day as the two AA conflict tests, during which half of the rats (PRC n=19 [n=9 ArchT]; vCA3 n=8 [n=5 ArchT]) completed the test with the laser on, and half with the laser off. . Unlike the high approach-avoidance conflict test, the neutral object test was conducted in a between-subjects design since we deemed that a fully counterbalanced experimental design with 2 conflict trials and 2 neutral trials might lead to unreliable data during the last trial owing to extinction-related confounds. We therefore prioritized maximizing the reliability of the data collected from the 2 conflict trials.

PRC and vCA3 rats were each given two trials per test, an appetitive-neutral object pairing, and an aversive-neutral pairing. Each rat was tested twice, once with the laser on throughout the entire test session, and once with the laser off.

Rats were first trained to associate a novel set of eight objects with either appetitive (four objects; two object pairs) or aversive outcome across four daily conditioning sessions, followed by an acquisition test and a ‘refresher’ conditioning session prior to testing. On the day of testing, rats (PRC n=16 [n=8 ArchT]; vCA3 n=8 [n=5 ArchT]) were given two trials per test, an appetitive-appetitive object pairing, and an aversive-aversive pairing.

For cFos quantification, a 2×2 ANOVA was conducted on the density of cFos labeled cells in both the PRC and vCA3, with between-subjects factors of laser treatment (on vs off) and group.</p><p>Significant main effects and interactions were further investigated with simple contrasts and post hoc tests with a Bonferroni correction where appropriate. Violations to sphericity were addressed with a Huynh-Feldt correction. All manually scored data (e.g., entries, time spent in a given zone) were blindly scored by a second experimenter. None of the data collected were excluded in the final analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Canadian Council of Animal Care and approved by the University and Local Animal Care Committee of the University of Toronto (Protocol no. 20012479).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81467-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated in this study have been deposited in Open Science Framework database under the accession code: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/9h7wr/">https://osf.io/9h7wr/</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dhawan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>ACH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>Male rodent perirhinal cortex, but not ventral hippocampus, inhibition induces approach bias under object-based approach-avoidance conflict</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://osf.io/9h7wr/">OSF</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (#156070 to ACHL and RI).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christian Bravo-Rivera (Reviewer #2); Lukas I Schmitt (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General</p><p>1. Inhibition of the PRC altered conflict processing in the first and second tasks (runway and shuttle box, respectively) but not in the third (Y-maze). How do we know that the failure to detect an effect of PRC inhibition in the third conflict task is due to the fact that it requires context/spatial processing as opposed to reduced efficacy of the repeated PRC inhibition?</p><p>2. How did animals interact with the object pairs in conflict trials? That is, did they preferentially explore one or the other object, and did PRC inhibition alter this exploration in a manner that correlates with its impact on test performance? I.e., did it create a bias towards the exploration of the object that signaled the appetitive outcome? The authors indicate that the exploration data were recorded; their inclusion in the manuscript could help to clarify how inhibition of the PRC has the effects that it does in the conflict test.</p><p>3a. L151. &quot;When animals were exposed to a high conflict pairing, optogenetic inhibition of PRC (laser on) significantly increased time spent in the goal box compared with trials completed without inhibition (laser off) and compared to GFP control animals with laser on and off (laser x construct: F(1, 16) = 29.03, p &lt; 0.001, ηp2 = 0.65; all post hoc: p &lt; 0.001) (Figure 2a), indicative of an increase in approach behaviour under motivational conflict. Furthermore, PRC inhibition led to a significant decrease in the number of retreats from the goal box (laser x construct: F(1,16) = 16.80, p &lt; 0.001, ηp2 = 0.51), although there was no effect on the number of goal box entries (laser x construct: F(1,16) = 1.92, p = 0.19, ηp2 = 0.11) (Figure 2b) during the choice period.&quot; Does the fact that PRC inhibited rats stay longer in the goal box indicate an increase in approach behaviour? These rats enter the goal box just as readily as the controls (entry and latency data) but stay longer when neither outcome occurs; so perhaps they are less sensitive to the absence of sucrose than the controls? The fact that PRC inhibition also increased time in the goal box on trials that included aversive-neutral object pairs (~L169) suggests that it may generally reduce avoidance of an aversive outcome. Is this a fair description of the conflict results? That is, PRC inhibition may have resulted in an appetitive response bias by reducing sensitivity to (or decreasing avoidance of) an aversive outcome…</p><p>3b. L490. &quot;Using a set of original object-based AA paradigms, we found that optogenetic inhibition of the rodent PRC, but not the vCA3, resulted in both a robust increase in approach behaviour and decrease in avoidance behaviour during motivational conflict elicited by the representation of discrete object pairs associated with unmatching affective values.&quot; What is the evidence of an increase in appetitive behaviour and decrease in avoidance behaviour?</p><p>Design</p><p>1. How were the rats allocated to groups for the Neu-Neu test shown in Figure 2c? Why was this testing conducted between-subjects (resulting in ns of just 5 per group) rather than within-subjects, as in the previous high conflict test? Did the 5 rats in each ArchT group (laser on vs laser off) and each GFP group (laser on vs laser off) exhibit the same profile of responding in the previous high conflict test? An obvious concern is that the allocation of rats to groups biased against detection of differences among the ArchT groups.</p><p>2a. Why are there so few rats in the &quot;Low Conflict-GFP&quot; conditions? That is, why weren't rats in the &quot;High Conflict-GFP&quot; condition carried forward to these additional tests? It renders analyses of the Low and NO conflict conditions problematic: as there are 8 rats in the ArchT group and 4 rats in the GFP group, how can these be submitted to any sort of common analysis via ANOVA?</p><p>2b. How many rats were in the ArchT and GFP groups for the novel recombination tests in the runway experiment? The figure again suggests 8 and 4, which again renders the ANOVA problematic.</p><p>2c. The query in relation to unequal ns and application of ANOVA also applies to the results of the shuttle box experiment shown in Figure 3f-i (n for ArchT = 7; n for GFP = 4); and to the combination of PRC and vHPC data that is reported to have been analysed together near line 379. Can this be legitimized in some way?</p><p>3. L640, 652, 664. How were rats tethered to the lasering in the AA conflict test as &quot;the entire apparatus [was] wrapped in red cellophane to minimize reliance on extra-maze cues&quot;?</p><p>Data/stats</p><p>1. L551: &quot;An intriguing question is why PRC inhibition potentiated approach, as opposed to avoidance, of an uncertain outcome.&quot; I understand that there is no effect of the laser on latency to enter any of the runway sections in the high and low conflict tasks. I assume that this is due to the fact that latency data is notoriously variable and the ns are relatively low. As such, I would be interested in an assessment of whether there is an effect of the laser on latency to enter any of the runway sections in an analysis that combines high and low conflict tasks that include an appetitive component…</p><p>2. In task 2, are the escape latency and &quot;time in cued side&quot; data correlated? If so, they are potentially two measures of the same thing, which would warrant some correction in the α rate to control the chance of a Type 1 error. This may have consequences for claims based on these data (e.g., analysis of data presented in Figure 3g).</p><p>3. L765. &quot;The number of entries into and 'retreats' from the outcome box were recorded; an entry was defined when the animal's hind limbs stepped onto the grid floor of the outcome box whereas 'retreats' were defined as partial entry into the outcome box followed by an immediate exit or backward treading into the neutral box.&quot; Why is there an asymmetry in the definition of entries and retreats? That is, the definition of entry is very clearly defined in terms of hind limbs making contact with the grid floor whereas the definition of retreat is more subjectively defined as &quot;partial entry to the outcome box followed by an immediate exit or backward treading into the neutral box.&quot; What is a partial entry: i.e., what criteria were used to define a partial entry? Are 'retreats' capturing something that could be referred to as 'hesitancy'?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors should include histological reports of their implants for all optogenetic experiments.</p><p>2) There is no stated justification for the exclusion of female subjects. The authors should qualify their results indicating that they characterized the male rodent brain; this should be reflected in the title and abstract.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. A major concern is the possibility that the perirhinal cortex is important for the identification of the conflicting stimuli, rather than in processing the conflicting motivation per se. This confound arises because optogenetic suppression occurs during the exposure to the objects. To address this concern, then, the authors should include an additional control for their first experimental paradigm in which they start suppression only after the entrance to the Neutral box or Goal box. If the perirhinal cortex is responsible for mediating motivational conflict, this should be sufficient to produce the originally observed effect. Although some of the experiments partially address this issue, as the authors argue in the discussion, the controls included don't address the possibility that encoding and retrieval specifically for the more complicated conflict stimuli. Given the importance of this concept to the overall message of the paper, this possibility requires additional direct interrogation.</p><p>2. Some of the results are confusing as presented and would benefit from additional analysis. In particular, the lack of difference in the number of entries between laser and non-laser for the first task along with a substantial difference in the number of retreats in Figure 2b is at least superficially confusing. I assume that this is across multiple trials (since otherwise, the number of retreats would be at most 1 less than the number of entries) but this should be clarified in the text and the number of trials should be included in the figure legend. A latency to retreat metric similar to the latency to enter would also be useful to include.</p><p>3. While optogenetic effects are observed for comparisons of the laser and non-laser trials across mice in the ArchT groups for the PRC suppression, it would be useful to assess this difference within mice, for instance by subtracting time-spent in goal box in laser and non-laser conditions. This would allow easier direct comparison between ArchT and GFP groups. Other metrics, such as the escape latency included in Figure 3f, could also be compared in this way. On a related note, the number of animals used appears to vary across experiments (for instance there are smaller number of dots in Figure 2c than other panels) but I do not see this noted in the figure legend or text. This should be clarified.</p><p>4. The difference in the Laser ON and Laser OFF for the example of c-fos staining with ArchT suppression of the entorhinal cortex shown in Figure 7d is not very convincing, which is surprising given the quantification in the previous panel. This should be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81467.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>General</p><p>1.

We believe we have evidence for both: the fact that we observed PRC inhibition-induced increase in the time spent in our ‘Av-Neu low conflict’ condition, in addition to our PRC inhibited rats exhibiting a prolonged ‘escape latency’ when first exposed to conflict object pairs and greater time spent in the conflict cued side in the shuttle box task appear to suggest that the decreased avoidance account may hold true. On the other hand, we also have strong evidence that PRC inhibited animals spend a disproportionate amount of time by the sucrose dispenser, seeking out reward under extinction conditions, which speaks to the presence of a robust increase in approach behaviour. We have inserted additional text in the Discussion to touch on this issue (revised manuscript page 30, para 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Design</p><p>1.

Laser application during the Neu-Neu test, although not ideal, was conducted in a between-subjects design since we deemed that a fully counterbalanced experimental design with 2 conflict trials and 2 neutral trials might lead to unreliable data during the last trial owing to extinction-related confounds. We therefore prioritized maximizing the reliability of the data collected from the 2 conflict trials. The animals were allocated into the Laser on/off groups randomly, after it was confirmed that baseline performance during the conflict trials was comparable across animals (see revised manuscript, page 39, para 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a.

We found that ’laser on’ decreased entry times at both conflict levels, which was driven predominantly by the PRC inhibition group. We also observed that rats exhibited longer latencies to enter all compartments during high conflict trials compared to low conflict trials, which is consistent with the idea that a conflict object pair induced increased ambulatory/hesitant behaviour. These analyses have been included in the revised manuscript (page 11, para 2), and we believe that they strengthen our account that PRC inhibition potentiates reward approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, while they may be measuring aspects of the same underlying construct, the measures are quite different, with the escape latency capturing the first ‘stay’ time in the cued side only, while the ‘time in cued side’ measure captures the time spent across multiple stays in the chamber (see revised manuscript, page 18, para 1).</p><p>Moreover, we would like to clarify that escape latency and &quot;time in cued side&quot; were analysed separately and thus, we do not believe that there is a concern about inflating the α rate or Type 1 errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Our usage of the term ‘retreat’ is consistent with how it was originally defined in our previously published approach-avoidance conflict work using a similar entry/retreat paradigm (e.g., Schumacher et al. 2018) and can indeed be regarded as an index of hesitancy.

When optogenetic inhibition was applied immediately prior to the decision phase of the task (i.e., following object exploration), the behavioural data (e.g., time spent in goal box; escape latency) did not differ from trials in which optogenetic inhibition was applied throughout the entire trial (i.e., data reported in our original manuscript).

A latency to retreat metric similar to the latency to enter would also be useful to include.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this was not clear in our original manuscript but given how we define the terms ‘entry’ and ‘retreat’, it is possible that the latter can occur independent of the former, and therefore, it is possible to have more retreats than entries. An entry occurred when the animal’s hind limbs stepped on to the grid floor of the goal box. To be consistent with our previous work using the same Y-maze task (Schumacher et al., 2018), a retreat occurred when the animal exhibited a half-body entry (e.g., only forelimbs) or head-poke into the goal box followed by an immediate exit or backward treading into the neutral box (see revised manuscript page 38, para 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While optogenetic effects are observed for comparisons of the laser and non-laser trials across mice in the ArchT groups for the PRC suppression, it would be useful to assess this difference within mice, for instance by subtracting time-spent in goal box in laser and non-laser conditions. This would allow easier direct comparison between ArchT and GFP groups. Other metrics, such as the escape latency included in Figure 3f, could also be compared in this way. On a related note, the number of animals used appears to vary across experiments (for instance there are smaller number of dots in Figure 2c than other panels) but I do not see this noted in the figure legend or text. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now included a difference score data analysis and presentation (Mean Data + SD from Laser on – Laser off) for a direct comparison of ArchT vs. GFP group data (see revised manuscript page 5, para 2; page 7, para 2; page 8, para 2; page 13 bottom; page 14, para 3; page 16 bottom; page 20, para 1) , alongside our original data. We decided to leave the complete data set in our manuscript for transparency.</p><p>We have also added more control GFP animals to the experiment and have clarified the Neu-Neu test design and methodology section, explaining the justification for a between-subjects test here (leading to an odd number of animals) (see revised manuscript page 39, para 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The difference in the Laser ON and Laser OFF for the example of c-fos staining with ArchT suppression of the entorhinal cortex shown in Figure 7d is not very convincing, which is surprising given the quantification in the previous panel. This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Higher magnification and resolution photomicrographs have now been included in the manuscript, providing a clearer illustration of the reduction in c-fos labelling following laser application in ArchTPRC tissue.</p></body></sub-article></article>
