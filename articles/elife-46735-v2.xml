We find that within a mature, clonal yeast colony developing in low glucose, cells arrange into metabolically disparate cell groups. Using this system, we model and experimentally identify metabolic constraints sufficient to drive such self-assembly. Beginning in a uniformly gluconeogenic state, cells exhibiting a contrary, high pentose phosphate pathway activity state, spontaneously appear and proliferate, in a spatially constrained manner. Gluconeogenic cells in the colony produce and provide a resource, which we identify as trehalose. Above threshold concentrations of external trehalose, cells switch to the new metabolic state and proliferate. A self-organized system establishes, where cells in this new state are sustained by trehalose consumption, which thereby restrains other cells in the trehalose producing, gluconeogenic state. Our work suggests simple physico-chemical principles that determine how isogenic cells spontaneously self-organize into structured assemblies in complimentary, specialized states.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Under certain conditions, single-celled microbes such as yeast and bacteria form communities of many cells.

The emergence of such phenotypically heterogeneous, spatially constrained sub-populations of cells is considered a requisite first step towards multicellularity. Here, clonal cells proliferate and differentiate into phenotypically distinct cells that stably coexist, and organize spatially with distinct patterns and shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niklas, 2014</xref>). Through such collective behavior, groups of cells can maintain orientation, stay together, and specialize in different tasks through the division of labor, while remaining organized with intricate spatial arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2016</xref>). In both eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes, such organization into structured, isogenic but phenotypically heterogeneous communities, is widely prevalent, and also reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). Such phenotypic heterogeneity within groups of clonal cells enables several microbes to persist in fluctuating environments, thereby providing an adaptive benefit for the cell community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolf et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thattai and van Oudenaarden, 2004</xref>).</p><p>A well studied example of spatially organized, phenotypically heterogeneous groups of cells comes from the <italic>Dictyostelid</italic> social amoeba, which upon starvation transition from individual protists to collective cellular aggregates that go on to form slime-molds, or fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonner, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaiser, 1986</xref>). Indeed, most microbes show some such complex, heterogeneous cell behavior, for example in the extensive spatial organization within clonal bacterial biofilms and swarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolter, 2007</xref>), or in the individuality exhibited in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spudich and Koshland, 1976</xref>). Despite its popular perception as a unicellular microbe, natural isolates of the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, also form phenotypically heterogeneous, multicellular communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cáp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palková and Váchová, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Váchová and Palková, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Veelders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wloch-Salamon et al., 2017</xref>). However, despite striking descriptions on the nature and development of phenotypically heterogeneous states within groups of cells, the rules governing the emergence and maintenance of new phenotypic states within isogenic cell populations remain unclear.</p><p>Current studies emphasize genetic and epigenetic changes that are required to maintain phenotypic heterogeneity within a cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sneppen et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, many studies emphasize stochastic gene expression changes that can drive phenotypic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Süel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balázsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2003</xref>). Further, groups of cells can produce adhesion molecules to bring themselves together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halfmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halme et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Octavio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Váchová and Palková, 2018</xref>), or support possible co-dependencies (such as commensal or mutual dependencies on shared resources) within the populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). Such studies now provide insight into why such heterogeneous cell groups might exist, and what the evolutionary benefits might be. However, an underlying biochemical logic to explain how distinct, specialized cell states can emerge and persist in the first place is largely absent. This is particularly so for isogenic (and therefore putatively identical) groups of cells in seemingly uniform environments. In essence, are there simple chemical or physical constraints, derived from existing biochemical rules and limitations, that explain the emergence and maintenance of heterogeneous phenotypic states of groups of clonal cells in space and over time?</p><p>Contrastingly, a common theme occurs in nearly all described examples of phenotypically heterogeneous, isogenic groups of cells. This is a requirement of some ‘metabolic stress’ or nutrient limitation that is necessary for the emergence of phenotypic heterogeneity and spatial organization, typically in the form of metabolically inter-dependent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cáp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). This idea has been explored experimentally, where approaches that systems-engineer metabolic dependencies between non-isogenic cells can result in interdependent populations that constitute mixed communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Embree et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wintermute and Silver, 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that biochemical constraints derived from metabolism may determine the nature of phenotypic heterogeneity, and the spatial organization of cells in distinct states within the population. Therefore, if we can understand what these biochemical constraints are, and discern how metabolic states can be altered through these constraints, this may address how genetically identical cells can self-organize into distinct states.</p><p>In this study, using clonal yeast cells, we experimentally and theoretically show how metabolic constraints imposed on a population of isogenic cells can determine the production, accumulation, and utilization of a specific, shared resource. The selective utilization of this resource enables the spontaneous emergence and persistence of cells exhibiting a counter-intuitive metabolic state, with spatial organization. These metabolic constraints create inherent threshold effects, enabling some cells to switch to new metabolic states, while restraining other cells to the original state which produces the resource. This thereby drives the overall self-organization of cells into specialized, spatially ordered communities. Finally, this group of spatially organized, metabolically distinct cells confer a collective growth advantage to the community of cells, rationalizing why such spatial self-organization of cells into distinct metabolic states benefits the cell community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells within <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> colonies exhibit ordered metabolic specialization</title><p>Using a well-studied <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isolate as a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reynolds and Fink, 2001</xref>), we established a simple system to study the formation of a clonal colony with irregular morphology. On 2% agar plates containing a complex rich medium with low glucose concentrations, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> forms rugose colonies with distinct architecture, after ~5–6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Such colonies do not form in the typical, high (1–2%) glucose medium used for yeast growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, as previously well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Granek and Magwene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reynolds and Fink, 2001</xref>), glucose limitation (with other nutrients such as amino acids being non-limiting) drives this complex colony architecture formation. Currently, the description of such colonies is limited to this external rugose morphology, and does not describe the phenotypic states of cells and/or any spatial organization in the colony. With only such a description, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the mature colony surface has an internal circle and some radial streaks near the periphery. We carried out a more detailed observation of entire colonies under a microscopic bright-field (using a 4x lens). Here, we unexpectedly noticed what appeared to be distinct internal patterning, and apparent spatial organization of cells within the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As categorized purely based on these observed differences in visual optical density (‘dark’ or ‘light’), regions between the colony center and periphery had optically dense (dark) networks spanning the circumference of the colony, interspersed with optically rare regions. In contrast, the periphery of the mature colony appeared entirely light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based simply on these optical traits alone, we categorized cells present in these regions of the colony as dark cells and light cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At this point, our description is visual and qualitative, and does not imply any other difference in the cells in either region. However, this visual description is both robust and simple, and hence we use this nomenclature for the remainder of this manuscript.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cells within <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> colonies exhibit ordered metabolic specialization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Low glucose is required for rugose colonies to develop.

The expected metabolic requirements of cells growing in glucose limited conditions are as follows: first, all cells would be expected to have constitutively high expression of the high-affinity hexokinase (Hxk1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobo and Maitra, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodríguez et al., 2001</xref>). Further, during glucose-limited growth, all cells are expected to carry out extensive gluconeogenesis, as the default metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haarasilta and Oura, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed this second expectation by measuring the amounts of the gluconeogenic enzymes Pck1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and Fbp1 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase), in short-term (4–5 hr) liquid cultures of log-phase cells growing in either high glucose medium, or in the same glucose-limited medium we used for colony growth. Expectedly, we observed very high amounts of these gluconeogenic enzymes in cells growing in glucose-limited medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), reiterating that even in well-mixed glucose-limited, cells are in a strongly gluconeogenic state. In order to now examine the mature colony and dissecting expected metabolic requirements in these conditions, we first designed visual indicators for these metabolic hallmarks of yeast cell growth in low glucose. We engineered two different fluorescent reporters, one dependent on <italic>HXK1</italic> expression (mCherry under the <italic>HXK1</italic> gene promoter), and the second on <italic>PCK1</italic> expression as an indicator of gluconeogenic activity (mCherry under the <italic>PCK1</italic> gene promoter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Cells carrying these reporters were seeded to develop into colonies, and the expression levels of these reporters were monitored in the mature, rugose colony (5–6 days). Expectedly, the <italic>HXK1</italic>-promoter dependent reporter showed constitutive, high expression in all cells across the entire colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Contrastingly, only the dark cells exhibited high gluconeogenesis reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, the light cells entirely lacked detectable gluconeogenic reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To better quantify this phenomenon, cells were dissected out from dark or light regions respectively (under the light microscope, using a fine needle), and the percentage of fluorescent cells in each region was measured using flow cytometry. Based on flow cytometric readouts,~80% of the isolated dark cells showed strong fluorescence for the gluconeogenic reporter, while ~97% of the light cells were non-fluorescent for gluconeogenic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This spatial distribution of gluconeogenic activity is shown as a quantitative heat-map histogram overlaid on the entire colony, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>. Since this observation was based solely on reporter activity, in order to more directly examine this observation, we estimated native protein amounts of enzymes associated with gluconeogenesis (Pck1, Fbp1, and Icl1- Isocitrate lyase from the glyoxylate shunt) in isolated light cells and dark cells. Only the dark cells showed expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, we measured steady-state amounts of trehalose and glycogen within dark and light cells, using these metabolites as unambiguous biochemical readouts of the end-point biochemical outputs of gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">François et al., 1991</xref>). We observed that the dark cells had substantially higher amounts of both trehalose and glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating greater gluconeogenic activity in these cells. Collectively, these results strikingly reveal that intracellular gluconeogenic activity is spatially restricted to specific regions, resulting in a distinct pattern of metabolically specialized zones within the colony.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cells organize into spatially restricted, contrary metabolic states within the colony</title><p>In the given nutrient conditions of low glucose, gluconeogenesis is an expected, constitutive metabolic process, essential for cells. This can therefore be considered as a necessary, permitted metabolic state in this condition. Paradoxically, in these mature colonies, gluconeogenic activity was spatially restricted to only within the dark cell region, with no discernible gluconeogenic activity in the cells located in the light region. This absence of gluconeogenic activity in these light cells, while concomitant with a constitutively high level of hexokinase activity, therefore poses a biochemical paradox. What might the metabolic state of these light cells be? To quickly address this using a crude but useful readout, we compared the ability of freshly isolated light and dark cells to proliferate in both gluconeogenic (low glucose), and non-gluconeogenic (high glucose) growth conditions. For simplicity, isolated light cells and dark cells were inoculated either into a medium where gluconeogenesis is essential (2% ethanol +glycerol as a sole carbon source), or in high (2%) glucose medium where cells rely on high glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity, and initial cell proliferation was monitored. Here, cells that had been growing in high glucose were used as a control. Expectedly, the dark cells grew robustly and reached significantly higher cell numbers (0D<sub>600</sub>) compared to the light cells in the gluconeogenic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, light cells grew robustly when transferred to the high glucose medium, as compared to the dark cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While this was an overly simple, and not definitive experiment, counter-intuitively, this result suggested that despite being in a low-glucose environment, the light cells were well suited for growth in high glucose, and therefore might be in a metabolic state suited for growth in glucose. We therefore decided to more systematically investigate this phenomenon.</p><p>In the presence of glucose, yeast cells typically show high glycolytic and PPP activities, as part of the Crabtree (analogous to the Warburg) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crabtree, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Deken, 1966</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, if the light cells in the colony were indeed behaving as though present in more glucose-replete conditions, they should exhibit high PPP activity. To test this, we first designed a fluorescent PPP-activity reporter (mCherry under the control of the transketolase 1 (<italic>TKL1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walfridsson et al., 1995</xref>) gene promoter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and monitored reporter activity across the mature colony. Indeed, only the light cells exhibited high PPP-reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This spatial restriction of high PPP activity across the colony is also shown as an overlaid quantitative heat-map histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Next, we directly addressed the possibility of these light cells exhibiting relatively high PPP activity. For unambiguously testing this, we utilized a stable-isotope based metabolic flux experiment to assess the flux towards PPP in light and dark cells. Light and dark cells isolated from colonies were pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose (for ~5 min), metabolites extracted, and the incorporation of this carbon label into the late PPP intermediates ribulose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S-7-P) was measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The relative amounts of these all-carbon labeled PPP intermediates were compared between the two cell types (light or dark). Notably, light cells incorporated significantly higher levels of <sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose into PPP metabolites compared to the dark cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for MS parameters), showing that the light cells are in a high PPP activity state. Finally, we assessed if other biochemical end-point outputs requiring high PPP activity/flux were also high in the light cells. High nucleotide synthesis is a canonical consequence of enhanced PPP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson and Cox, 2013</xref>). The carbon backbone (ribose-5-phosphate) of newly synthesized nucleotides is derived from the PPP, while the nitrogen backbone comes from amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson and Cox, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for MS parameters). We devised another metabolic flux-based experiment to assess de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in light and dark cells, as an end-point collective readout of high PPP activity coupled with amino acid utilization. Light and dark cells, isolated from colonies were pulsed with a <sup>15</sup>N-label (ammonium sulfate +aspartate), and incorporation of this label into nucleotides was measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Light cells had higher flux into nucleotide biosynthesis, compared to the dark cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for MS parameters). Taken together, we surprisingly find that light cells exhibit multiple metabolic hallmarks of cells growing in glucose-replete conditions, including increased PPP activity, and increased nucleotide biosynthesis. Thus, in the spatially organized colony, the light cells and dark cells have contrary metabolic states. This is despite the expectation that the gluconeogenic state, exhibited by the dark cells, is the plausible metabolic state in the given growth conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cells organize into spatially restricted, contrary metabolic states within the colony.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparative immediate growth of isolated light cells and dark cells, transferred to a ‘gluconeogenic medium’ (2% ethanol as carbon source), or a ‘glycolytic medium’ (2% glucose as carbon source), based on increased absorbance (OD<sub>600</sub>) in culture. Wild-type cells growing in liquid medium (2% glucose) in log phase (i.e. in a glycolytic state) were used as controls for growth comparison (n = 3).

the light cells or dark cells, when isolated and reseeded as a new colony, both develop into indistinguishable, complex colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This reiterates that these phenotypic differences between the light and dark cells are fully reversible, and do not require genetic changes. Collectively, these data reveal that cells within the colony organize into spatially separated, metabolically specialized regions. Within these regions, cells exhibit complimentary metabolic states. One of these states, where cells have high PPP activity, is counter-intuitive and cannot obviously be sustained given the external nutrient environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A mathematical model suggests constraints for the emergence and organization of cells in complimentary metabolic states</title><p>What determines the emergence and spatial organization of a group of cells, in these contrary metabolic states? Particularly, what can explain the emergence and proliferation of the light cells, which exhibit this counter-intuitive metabolic state, while the colony maintains a large subset of cells in the dark state? To address this, we built a coarse-grained mathematical model. This model incorporates simple processes derived from our current experimental data, to simulate the formation of a colony of ‘light’ and ‘dark’ cells. The model was intentionally coarse-grained, since its purpose was only to find a minimal, biologically consistent combination of processes that is sufficient to produce the overall spatial structure and composition of cell states observed in the colonies. The intention behind the model was not to decipher all possible molecular details that explain this phenomenon. The model should only sufficiently account for both the emergence of light cells, as well as their spatial organization with dark cells. Such a model could therefore suggest constraints that determine the emergence of light cells, and the organization of the colony with the observed organization, which can then be experimentally tested.</p><p>While building this model, we included a range of processes that must be considered, based on our experimental data thus far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This includes (i) the dark cells switching to a light state, (ii) the production of some resource by dark cells, which may be shared/utilized by the cells, (iii) diffusion parameters for this resource, (iv) consumption of this resource, and (v) rates of cell division are included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we constructed a two-dimensional square grid of ‘locations’ for groups of cells within the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, each location is either empty or occupied by a group of ~100 cells (also see Materials and methods for full details). Note: we intentionally coarse-grain the grid (for computational simplicity, in order to simulate colony sizes comparable to real colonies) by approximating that the locations either consist of all light or all dark cells. This is a major simplification that was necessary. At each time step (12 min of real time), all the processes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> are executed across the spatial grid using the outlined algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In such an implemented algorithm, (i) all cells consume all available nutrients (present in saturating amounts), while free glucose concentrations are negligible, (ii) dark cells grow and divide in the given conditions, (iii) dark cells produce a resource/resources as a consequence of their existing metabolic (gluconeogenic) state, (iv) this resource diffuses around the grid and is freely available, (v) dark cells switch to the light state if sufficient resource is present at their location, and lastly, (vi) the resource when consumed can sustain the light state cells, which can expand if there is an empty location in the neighborhood. If the resource is not present in that location the light cells will switch back to dark cells. All processes occur at specified rates, allowing for stochasticity. Finally, this existence of a shared resource is surmised because, logically the emergence of light cells from dark can happen only if the local nutrient environment enables a switch to the new metabolic state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A mathematical model suggests constraints for the emergence and organization of cells in complimentary metabolic states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Processes, based on experimental data, incorporated into developing a simple mathematical model to simulate colony development.

A range of resource amounts, growth rates and diffusion of the resource were included in control simulations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Strikingly, the simulated spatial organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) recapitulates most obvious features of a real colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These are: at the edge of the initial circular inoculation of the colony is a ring of dark cells, the outermost part of the colony is made up of outcrops of light cells, and from this ring of dark cells emanate clusters of dark cells penetrating into the outcrops of light cells. This is despite the simplicity of the rules in the model, including its flattening into 2D. In the simulation, for the first 40–45 time steps, the colony remains small and predominantly dark, while the resource builds up. Then, dark cells start to switch to light. When this happens within the bulk of the colony, these light cells have restricted division due to spatial constraints. Around 100 to 150 time steps later, light cells emerge at the perimeter of the colony, and then rapidly divide and expand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In order to test if the processes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> are all required for this behavior, we examined three comprehensive control scenarios: (i) dark cells do not produce a resource (and therefore in this case for growth light cells depend only on amino acids or other pre-supplied resources in the medium), (ii) dark cells cannot switch to the light state, or (iii) light cells produce a resource that is needed by dark cells to grow (a straw-man scenario, since initially in the actual colony all cells were in a dark state, as shown earlier).

This includes the overall general architecture, and spatial organization of light and dark cells. Two simple take-home points emerge from this model, for such spatial distribution of cells in these two metabolic states, across the developing colony. First, the model requires that dark (gluconeogenic) cells will produce a resource that is needed by dark cells to switch to the light state. Second, a resource produced by the dark cells is required to sustain the light state. Collectively, in our model, these metabolic constraints are sufficient to determine the overall spatial organization of metabolically distinct, specialized cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Trehalose satisfies criteria to be the metabolic resource determining the emergence of light cells</title><p>Does any gluconeogenic metabolite(s) determine the organization of these cells, consistent with these requirements suggested by experimental and modeled data? Such a metabolite must logically satisfy the following three criteria. First, this resource should be available in the extracellular environment (i.e. released by cells), second, cells must selectively be able to take up this resource, and third, the resource should be metabolized within cells to produce glucose/a glucose-like product capable of fueling a glycolytic and PPP-active state. Further, if this were indeed a ‘controlling resource’ that determined the emergence of light cells, preventing the uptake and utilization of this resource should prevent the emergence and proliferation of only the light cells, but leave the dark cells unaffected. In order to identify such a candidate metabolite, we considered all possible outputs of gluconeogenesis: the storage carbohydrates/sugars glycogen and trehalose, the polysaccharides of the cell wall (chitin, mannans, glycans), and glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jules et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayikci and Nielsen, 2015</xref>). The large molecular size of glycogen, chitins, and complex glycosylated proteins, the lack of known cellular machinery for their uptake, and the difficulty in efficiently breaking them down make them all unlikely candidates to be the resource controlling the emergence of light cells. Contrastingly, trehalose has unique properties making it a plausible candidate. It is a small, non-reducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules. Trehalose has been observed in the extracellular environment in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parrou et al., 2005</xref>), and yeast can uptake trehalose through disaccharide transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jules et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stambuk, 1998</xref>). Further, trehalose can be rapidly and specifically hydrolyzed to two glucose molecules, which can fuel glycolysis and re-entry into the cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi and Tu, 2013</xref>). These diverse data therefore presented trehalose as an excellent putative candidate metabolite that controlled the emergence of cells in the light state. To test this possibility, we first measured extracellular trehalose in colonies. Free trehalose was readily detectable in the extracellular environment of these colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To test if trehalose could be differentially transported into either light or dark cells, we first estimated amounts of a primary trehalose transporter, Mal11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stambuk, 1998</xref>) in these cells. Mal11 protein amounts were substantially higher in the light cells compared to the dark cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To unambiguously, directly estimate trehalose uptake, we isolated light and dark cells from a mature colony, and exogenously added <sup>13</sup>C-trehalose. We then measured intracellular levels of labeled trehalose present in these cells, by extracting and estimating metabolite amounts (by LC/MS/MS) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for MS parameters).

An explicit prediction is made both in our model, and our hypothesis based on these experimental data. This is: preventing uptake and/or utilization of trehalose should prevent cells from switching to the light state. To test this prediction, we generated strains lacking <italic>NTH1</italic> (which cannot break-down trehalose to glucose), and <italic>MAL11</italic> (which will have reduced trehalose uptake), allowed them to develop into mature colonies, and compared the amounts of light cells in each. Compared to wild-type colonies, cells lacking the major trehalose uptake transporter (<italic>Δmal11</italic>) formed colonies with very few light cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Note: while Mal11 shows a high affinity for trehalose, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has multiple sugar transporters with reduced affinity for any disaccharide. Therefore, cells lacking <italic>MAL11</italic> may take up trehalose with lower efficiency. In these cells, the ability to break-down trehalose remains intact. More importantly, in colonies of cells lacking trehalase (<italic>Δnth1</italic>), and which therefore cannot efficiently breakdown internal trehalose, had nearly no detectable light cells, based on brightfield microscope observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This result was more quantitatively estimated in colonies of cells with these respective genetic backgrounds, using the expression of the fluorescent PPP reporter. Again, almost no PPP reporter activity was observed in the <italic>Δnth1</italic> cell colonies, while very few cells with PPP reporter activity were seen in <italic>Δmal11</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As controls, we ensured that there were no defects in the expression of the PPP reporters in cells from these genetic backgrounds. Correspondingly, we also quantified the percentage of dark, highly gluconeogenic cells (as determined using the gluconeogenesis reporter), in colonies from each of these genetic backgrounds. The percentage of gluconeogenic cells was proportionately higher in the <italic>Δmal11</italic> (~73%), and <italic>Δnth1</italic> (~80%) colonies compared to the wild-type colony (~65%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, controlling the uptake and utilization of the resource (trehalose) directly regulates the emergence of cells in the light state.</p><p>Collectively, these data demonstrate that trehalose is the shared gluconeogenic resource that determines the emergence, and persistence, of light cells within the structured colony.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A resource threshold effect controls cooperative switching of cells to the light state</title><p>Our experimental data showing the organization of dark and light cells was obtained from ~5–6 day old, mature colonies. However, in our simulations of the temporal development of the colony, we observed that the dense network of dark (gluconeogenic) cells form first, followed by a very late appearance of light cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This late appearance of light cells in the simulations comes from an inherent threshold effect included within the model. Here, the external build-up of the shared resource made by the dark cells is required. At a sufficient built-up concentration, this resource will trigger the switching of some cells to light cells. Light cells in turn will consume the resource, reducing the available amounts, thereby preventing other cells from switching to this new state. This threshold-effect therefore predicts a delayed, rapid emergence of light cells, and also enables such a pattern of distinct cell groups to form. If this threshold requirement is removed in the simulation (for example when replaced by a rate of switching from dark to light that depends linearly on the amount of resource), the resultant colony remains small, and the organized pattern of cells in two states does not occur. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>. This small colony size is largely due to low resource amounts to support the proliferation of the light cells, since there are insufficient dark cells remaining to produce the resource. This is also clearly seen in control simulations with a range of resource amounts, and linear switching, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–1D</xref>. Contrastingly, in the model that successfully simulates the colony development, the externally available amount of the resource builds-up, reaches the threshold (where cells switch to the light state), and then rapidly decreases, if the light cells also consume the resource (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, upper panel).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A resource threshold effect controls cooperative switching of cells to the light state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulation of colony development, based on the default model (which incorporates a resource threshold buildup, followed by consumption, switching to a light state, and expansion), compared to a model where the threshold amounts of the resource is removed.

We first estimated the relative amounts of extracellular, free trehalose in the colony over time. Notably, trehalose amounts steadily increased over 4 days, and subsequently rapidly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> lower panel). This rapid decrease in trehalose after day four is despite a steady, continuing increase in the total number of cells in the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We next monitored the development of colonies over time, to determine when the light cells emerge. Using just the bright-field image reconstruction of the colonies, during this time course, the intensity of dark cells steadily increased, and organized into the mesh-like network over 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, the light cells appeared only after ~4 days, and rapidly increased in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We more quantitatively estimated this, using strains expressing the gluconeogenic- or the PPP-reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, the increase in total fluorescence intensity due to the gluconeogenic-reporter in the colony (over time) was relatively linear over the first four days (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.99), increasing with the steady increase in the number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Contrastingly, the increase in the PPP reporter activity over the first five days was clearly non-linear and switch like, with very low signal intensity for the first three days, and then a rapid emergence of signal over days four and five (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This indicated a cooperative, switch like emergence of, and increase in these light cells. A useful biophysical measure of cooperativity (more commonly used for protein-ligand binding characteristics) is the Hill coefficient. We adopted the Hill equation, using the amount of PPP reporter fluorescence (instead of ligand-receptor binding), to estimate cooperativity in the system. Over the first five days the increase in PPP-reporter activity showed a Hill coefficient greater than 1, indicating a positively cooperative switch of cells to the light state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This nicely correlates with the build-up, and rapid decrease in external trehalose around day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data also show that the peripheral location of the light cells cannot simply be due to possible greater access to glucose in the medium, since for the first ~4 days, there are no cells in the periphery with high PPP reporter activity. Their emergence is indeed rapid, and switch-like.</p><p>In summary, data from model simulations and experiments show that initially the gluconeogenic cells increase in number, leading to release and build-up of the resource (trehalose) in the local environment. At this time there are no light cells in the colony. Above a threshold concentration of trehalose, some cells rapidly switch to light state with high PPP activity. The further expansion of these light cells correlates with rapid consumption of the extracellular trehalose that sustains this state. These data suggest a threshold effect, where the controlling resource, trehalose, needs to build up above a certain amount, in order for cells to switch to the contrary, high PPP activity state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cells in distinct metabolic states provide a collective growth advantage to the colony</title><p>Finally, we wondered if such an emergence of light cells with high PPP activity might benefit the community of cells as a whole. To address this, we compared the long term colony expansion of wild-type cells, with colonies comprised of cells lacking the neutral trehalase (<italic>Δnth1</italic>). Cells in the <italic>Δnth1</italic> colonies cannot utilize trehalose to produce glucose, and as shown earlier, will remain in a gluconeogenic state. Therefore, in these <italic>Δnth1</italic> cell colonies light cells will be absent. However, these cells are still capable of normal gluconeogenesis (and trehalose production). Strikingly, we observed that as the respective colonies expanded over time (~21 days), the wild-type colonies spread over a significantly greater area on the plate, while the <italic>Δnth1</italic> colonies were unable to expand as efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This shows that the emergence and proliferation of light cells are important for the expansion of the colony.

(<bold>B</bold>) Cells in low glucose perform gluconeogenesis, as required in low glucose medium. As gluconeogenic reserves build up, trehalose builds up in the extracellular environment. At a threshold concentration of trehalose, some cells switch to a high glycolytic, PPP state. This state depends upon the utilization of trehalose to fuel it. This utilization of trehalose by the light cells results in decreased external trehalose to below a threshold. This in turn restrains the other, remaining cells in a gluconeogenic state, where they continue to produce trehalose. This gives rise to the final, self-organized community, with specialization of function and division of labor.

In low glucose conditions, cells begin in a uniform gluconeogenic state, which is the expected metabolic state in this nutrient condition. The gluconeogenic cells produce a resource (trehalose), that is now externally available. This resource builds up to above a threshold amount. At this threshold, some cells take up and consume trehalose, breaking it down to glucose. These cells spontaneously switch to the complimentary metabolic state, with high PPP and glycolytic activity (i.e. the light state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These light cells can remain in this metabolic state only so as long as the resource (trehalose) is externally available. However, as trehalose is consumed by these cells, the available amount of external trehalose itself drops below the threshold. The surrounding dark cells therefore remain trapped in a gluconeogenic state, continuing to produce trehalose. Thereby, a predictable fraction of cells, constrained spatially, will remain in each metabolic state, resulting in specialized cell groups and division of metabolic labor. Thus, biochemically heterogeneous cell states can spontaneously emerge and spatially self-organize. An implicit concept emerging from this study is that of threshold amounts of a controlling or sentinel metabolite that regulates a switch to a new metabolic state. By definition, such a metabolite must be produced by cells present in a certain (original) metabolic state. But when this metabolite is utilized, it must have the ability to switch cells to an entirely distinct metabolic state. Further, the emergence and expansion of cells in the new state will be rapid and switch-like, resembling a bistable system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pomerening, 2008</xref>). This idea of metabolites controlling cell states is an emerging area of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Tu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krishna and Laxman, 2018</xref>), but has not been studied in the context of groups of cells organizing into distinct groups or metabolic states (and therefore different phenotypic properties).</p><p>We speculate what the advantages of such spatially organized, phenotypically distinct states within a group of clonal cells might be, in this example. Here, we observe that the organized community with cells in distinct states has clear advantages, in being able to spatially expand better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). For sessile microbes such as yeast, this ability to forage for better nutrients is important for their survival. This might also convey other advantages, and uncovering those are obvious areas of future studies. Since the inherent properties of the cells in the distinct states are different, this raises the deeper possibility that these advantages come from physical and chemical properties of the cells, which arise from their distinct metabolic states. Regardless, our study substantially advances descriptions of yeast ‘multicellularity’ from simple dimorphism, aggregated cells, or three-dimensional colony forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cáp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palková and Váchová, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Váchová and Palková, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Veelders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wloch-Salamon et al., 2017</xref>), to self-organized, phenotypically heterogeneous cell states exhibiting division of labor and metabolic interdependence. Strikingly, the nature of spatial patterning allied with division of labor that we observe in yeast is reminiscent of true multicellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niklas, 2014</xref>). Also, the cell states in these yeast colonies can be considered commensal, since trehalose is a necessary output of gluconeogenesis, and therefore a default, biochemically non-limiting output in dark cells. Since trehalose controls the emergence and maintenance of light cells in the complimentary metabolic state, it thus can be considered a resource benefiting the light state. Thus simple, metabolism-derived constraints are sufficient to determine how contrary biochemical states can spontaneously emerge and be supported, in conjunction with spatial structure. Such organization of cells into specialized, labor-divided communities expands on the role of reaction-diffusion systems (particularly activator-depleted substrate schemes) in controlling cellular patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo and Miura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2016</xref>), with a metabolic resource threshold being central to the emergence and stabilization of a new phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Tu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krishna and Laxman, 2018</xref>). A deeper dissection of what such constraints can permit will therefore advance our general understanding of how specialized cell states can emerge and be stabilized.</p><p>Metabolic cross-feeding is best understood currently in multi-species microbial communities, where this has been inferred largely using inter-species genomic comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tyson et al., 2004</xref>). Further, metabolic sharing has typically been demonstrated using synthetically engineered systems where mutual dependencies are created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wintermute and Silver, 2010</xref>). The spatial organizations of any such populations remain challenging to model. Biochemically identifying metabolites that are conclusively exchanged between cooperating cells remains difficult, and the significance of such putative metabolite exchange challenging to interpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Souza et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, such studies have emphasized non-isogenic systems, where genetic changes stabilize different phenotypes, and auxotrophies define the nutrient sharing or cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). Contrastingly, here we directly identify a produced metabolic resource, and demonstrate how its availability and differential utilization can control the emergence of cells in opposing metabolic states, in a clonal population. We also explain how the spontaneous spatial organization into phenotypically distinct cell groups occurs. Thus, our study also goes beyond stochastic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balázsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2003</xref>) to explain how phenotypic heterogeneity and specialization can emerge in clonal populations. By considering these metabolism-derived rules, and thereby manipulating available metabolic resources, we suggest how it can be viable to program the formation, structure or phenotypic composition of isogenic cell populations. Collectively, such simple physico-chemical constraints can advance our understanding of how isogenic cells can self-organize into specialized, labor-divided groups, as a first step towards multicellularity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth media</title><p>The prototrophic sigma 1278b strain (referred to as wild-type or WT) was used in all experiments.

Therefore, the dynamic processes involved can be broadly divided into those pertaining to the cells of the colony and those pertaining to the shared resource. The cells and resource occupy a 2-D square grid, which represents the surface of an agar plate. If one takes each grid length to correspond to 50 µm in real space, then, given the average size of a yeast cell at 5 µm, a single grid location can be imagined to contain upto 100 cells, which we term ‘cell blocks’. We coarse-grain the model such that each location is either empty, occupied by light cell block, or a dark cell block. That is, we ignore the possibility that cell blocks might be mixed. This is simply for computational ease. A more detailed model consisting of smaller grid lengths such that each location could hold at most a single cell would exhibit the same behavior as the coarse-grained one, but would require much larger grid sizes and longer computational times in order to simulate realistic sized colonies. With the coarse-graining, our simulations use a 250 × 250 grid. Each grid location also contains saturating amounts of amino acids, as well as a certain level of the shared metabolic resource.

Time and length units are chosen such that each time step is one unit of time, and each grid length is one unit length. With these choice of units, the growth parameters for light and dark cells, respectively, are g<sub>l</sub> = 0.04, g<sub>d</sub> = 0.01. These were chosen so as to reflect the relative rates of diffusion and division. Light cells were observed to grow faster than the dark cells, so their respective growth parameters are set accordingly.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The switching threshold parameter (S = 3.0) was chosen to account for a delay in the switching of dark cells to another metabolic pathway via nutrient sensing as well as to give a reproducible facsimile of the experimental colonies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The shared resource production value was chosen to be 7% (R = 0.07) of the minimum required to divide. In each time step, every block of dark cells adds this amount to the resource grid. This was chosen as a default value, which gave a reproducible facsimile of the experimental colonies. Other values were tried and their effect is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All cells consumed a small level of metabolites (the shared resource or amino acids) in each time step. This value was chosen to be 5% of the minimum required for division (C = 0.05). This gave division times that approximately matched the division times observed experimentally.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The switching probability (p=0.5) was chosen to add an element of stochasticity. So even if the threshold resource conditions are met, dark cells have a 50% chance to switch to light cells in that time step.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The choice of the diffusion constant (D = 0.24) is limited by the numerical stability of the FTCS scheme, which allows only a maximum value of D = 0.25. In real time and length units, this corresponds to a diffusion constant D<sub>eff</sub> of 8.7 × 10<sup>−13</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s. D<sub>eff</sub> is an order of magnitude smaller than the diffusion constant for sugars like glucose and sucrose in water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roache, 1972</xref>). Since the agar used for the experiments is mostly water, the diffusion constants in water can be considered as a good reference point.</p></list-item></list><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.025</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Parameters of the model for the wild-type case.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Parameter</th><th valign="top">Notation</th><th valign="top">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Growth rate (dark cell block)</td><td valign="top">g<sub>d</sub></td><td valign="top">0.01/T</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Growth rate (light cell block)</td><td valign="top">g<sub>l</sub></td><td valign="top">0.04/T</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Switching threshold</td><td valign="top">S</td><td valign="top">3.0 units</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resource produced by each dark cell block</td><td valign="top">R</td><td valign="top">0.07 units/T</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resource or amino acids consumed per cell block (light or dark)</td><td valign="top">C</td><td valign="top">0.05 units/T</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Minimum resource or amino acid reserve needed for division (light or dark)</td><td valign="top">--</td><td valign="top">1.0 unit</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chance to switch to light cell if threshold reached</td><td valign="top">P</td><td valign="top">0.5/T</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Diffusion constant of the resource</td><td valign="top">D</td><td valign="top">0.24 L<sup>2</sup>/T</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Variants of the wild-type model in different figures</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (bottom row) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref> showcase some of the final colonies generated by the simulations when the rules described above are varied.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Ackermann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The two reviewers agree that this is a very interesting manuscript that sheds new light on physiological heterogeneity and possibly even spatially organized metabolic states within an isogenic population of yeast cells. However, both reviewers also raise important questions and are not yet fully convinced by the data presented. We would therefore ask you to consider the following major essential issues:</p><p>1) Please provide more arguments, controls and discussion regarding the hypothesized metabolic states, and especially addressing to what extent these might be the consequence of spatial gradients.</p><p>2) Can you explain in more detail what you hypothesize to be the physiological/evolutionary reason for the different states?</p><p>3) Please expand the statistical analyses.</p><p>Please also consider the questions and comments made by the individual reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The results show that within a yeast colony, cells in specific region of the colony show higher activity in the gluconeogenesis pathway (as estimated using Pck1 levels as a biomarker), whereas others do not. Further experiments show that the so-called &quot;light&quot; cells show hallmarks of cells that are actively growing on glucose, whereas dark cells seem to be more starved. A metabolic model is used to try and explain how these two different states could be the result of some cells producing glucose through gluconeogenesis, while others benefit from this resource as some of the glucose (in the form of trehalose) diffused away from the cells with high gluconeogenesis. Deletion of the trehalose transporter Mal11 or the trehalase (Nth1) abolished (or at least reduced) the differences between the two distinct groups of cells.</p><p>1) The authors claim that all cells would be expected to have high gluconeogenesis activity, but it is unclear to me whether that is really true. Since (low) glucose is used as a carbon source, it seems possible (or even likely) that some cells may be able to take up sufficient amounts of glucose from the medium, while others (e.g. in more dense and internal regions of the colony) are not. It is of course difficult to avoid such differences in nutrient availability in a colony. However, in principle, it should be possible to obtain less confounded results in a medium that does not contain any glucose (e.g. ethanol + glycerol), which would force all cells to enter gluconeogenesis, unless some cells indeed receive some form of glucose (trehalose) produced by other cells.</p><p>2) The test where cells are transferred to medium where gluconeogenesis is really essential (ethanol+glycerol) seems flawed, as in this medium, not only gluconeogenesis but also respiration is required. Furthermore, although I do believe the conclusions coming from this experiment, the control glucose grown cells were pre-grown in liquid instead of on a plate, making them not a true control, since the cells coming from plate will also have to adapt to a liquid medium. You are also missing error bars on graph 2A (i)? Moreover in subsection “Cells organize into spatially restricted, contrary metabolic states within the colony” and Figure 2A, the authors claim a difference in lag, but since only the first 9 hours of growth were measured, I find it difficult to conclude from this graph if it is truly only a lag difference or if the cells perhaps also show differences in growth rate for a much longer time (especially in the gluconeogenic medium).</p><p>3) If trehalose uptake is really required for light cells, then why does deletion of MAL11 and NTH1 not abolish the existence of light cells and the specific colony morphology (as seen in Figure 5D)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Varahan and colleagues describes what I think is an intriguing discovery: genetically identical cells in colonies of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> differentiate into two distinct phenotypic states. The two phenotypes specialise on different metabolic processes and are coupled by the transfer of a metabolite from one cell type to the other. I think the work is both interesting and novel. It is interesting because it shows a clear case of a 'distributed metabolism' in a clonal population: metabolic processes are distributed to different cell types in a clonal population, and the population as a whole exhibits metabolic activity that is based on the coupling between the different sub-processes. The distribution of different metabolic processes to individual cell types could have important consequences. It could alleviate biochemical incompatibilities and allow individual cells to perform metabolic processes faster or more efficiently through specialization. While such metabolic differentiation is thus potentially important, we currently do not understand well how common it is in clonal population.</p><p>While a small number of recent studies have focused on this concept (including e.g. Wolfsberg et al. Metab. Engineering 2018 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30179665 and Rosenthal et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2018 https://elifesciences.org/articles/33099), I think this study here describes one of the clearest and most compelling cases. This is also what makes this study novel: the authors use a combination of approaches (including transcriptional reporters, measurements of proteins and metabolite abundances and metabolic flux analysis) to characterize the metabolic states of the two cell types and understand how they are coupled. And they use mathematical modeling to probe the plausibility of their metabolic analysis and to derive predictions that they then address experimentally.</p><p>I therefore think this manuscript has the potential to make an important contribution to the field: it addressed a concept that is potentially important but largely unexplored and used a strong combination of experimental and computational approaches that provide substantial insights into how metabolic processes can be distributed across two interacting cell types.</p><p>I have two main comments. The first comment is scientific: it did not become clear to me why, on a fundamental level, cells differentiate into two distinct metabolic states, instead of all cells attaining a common intermediate metabolic state. I think this question emerges most clearly in the Discussion, where the authors summarize the main insights. All cells are initially in the same state (gluconeogenesis). They produce trehalose. The trehalose accumulates externally until it reaches a concentration where some cells switch to a different state (glycolytic/high PPP) and start consuming trehalose. Is it understood why there is not a different outcome – that all cells together decrease gluconeogenetic activity over time and all attain the same intermediate metabolic state? I would be very interested in the author's perspective on this issue.</p><p>The second comment is about the text: I found the Introduction difficult to understand and am not convinced about how some of the concepts are discussed. For example, in the second paragraph of the Introduction section, almost every sentence contains a statement that I don't understand or that I think does not correspond to how terms are commonly used in the field. I suggest that the authors revisit the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The two reviewers agree that this is a very interesting manuscript that sheds new light on physiological heterogeneity and possibly even spatially organized metabolic states within an isogenic population of yeast cells.

We then clarify our hypothesis, bringing in our perspective of how possible biochemical constraints might control the emergence of cells with distinct states, before summarizing our findings.</p><p>The changes now included in the revised text are included below for convenience:</p><p>Introduction paragraph one: “Such phenotypic heterogeneity within groups of clonal cells enables several microbes to persist in fluctuating environments, thereby providing an adaptive benefit for the cell community (Wolf et al., 2005; Thattai et al., 2004).”</p><p>Introduction paragraph two: “However, despite striking descriptions on the nature and development of phenotypically heterogeneous states within groups of cells…”</p><p>Introduction paragraph three: “In particular, many studies emphasize stochastic gene expression changes that can drive phenotypic heterogeneity (Suel et al., 2007; Ackermann, 2015; Balázsi et al., 2011; Blake et al., 2003). Further, groups of cells can produce…”</p><p>Introduction paragraph three: “or support possible co-dependencies (such as commensal or mutual dependencies on shared resources) within the populations (Ackermann, 2015). Such studies now provide insight into why such heterogeneous cell groups might exist, and what the evolutionary benefits might be.”</p><p>Introduction paragraph three: “In essence, are there simple chemical or physical constraints, derived from existing biochemical rules and limitations, that explain the emergence and maintenance of heterogeneous phenotypic states of groups of clonal cells in space and over time?”</p><p>Introduction paragraph four: “Therefore, if we can understand what these biochemical constraints are, and discern how metabolic states can be altered through these constraints, this may address how genetically identical cells can self-organize into distinct states.“</p><p>Introduction paragraph five: “The selective utilization of this resource enables the spontaneous emergence and persistence of cells exhibiting a counter-intuitive metabolic state, with spatial organization. These metabolic constraints create inherent threshold effects, enabling some cells to switch to new metabolic states, while restraining other cells to the original state which produces the resource. This thereby drives the overall self-organization of cells into specialized, spatially ordered communities. Finally, this group of spatially organized, metabolically distinct cells confer a collective growth advantage to the community of cells, rationalizing why such spatial self-organization of cells into distinct metabolic states benefits the cell community.”</p><p>Changes/additions in the Results:</p><p>Here, we have added several appropriate controls and clarification of text, as well as the results of two major new experiments. These changes are summarized below:</p><p>Text clarification, regarding the initial description of the colony morphology: “Currently, the description of such colonies is limited to this external rugose morphology, and does not describe the phenotypic states of cells and/or any spatial organization in the colony.”</p><p>Text clarification, on what the expected metabolic state of glucose grown cells are: “The expected metabolic requirements of cells growing in glucose limited conditions are as follows:”</p><p>Adding new experimental data (new control, to show that in the low glucose conditions chosen, the extent of gluconeogenesis is uniformly very high), and related text: “Indeed, we first confirmed this second prediction by measuring the amounts of the gluconeogenic enzymes Pck1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and Fbp1 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase), using short-term liquid cultures of cells in either high glucose medium, or the same glucose limited medium we used for colony growth. Expectedly, we observed very high amounts of these gluconeogenic enzymes in cells growing in glucose-limited medium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), reiterating that even in well-mixed low glucose medium, cells are in a strongly gluconeogenic state. In order to now explore this hypothesis, of examining the colony to dissect expected metabolic requirements in these conditions, we first designed visual indicators for these metabolic hallmarks of yeast cell growth in low glucose.”</p><p>Adding supplemental data, on the distribution of gluconeogenic activity across the entire colony, and not just a section): “This spatial distribution of gluconeogenic activity is shown as a quantitative heat-map histogram overlaid on the entire colony, in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A. Since this observation was based solely on reporter activity, in order to more directly examine this observation […]”</p><p>Text clarification on cell growth data: “Expectedly, the dark cells grew robustly and reached significantly higher cell numbers (0D<sub>600</sub>) compared to the light cells in the gluconeogenic condition (Figure 2A).”</p><p>Text clarification on interpreting the initial characterization of the two metabolic states seen in the dark or light cells: “While this was an overly simple, and not definitive experiment, counter-intuitively, this result suggested that despite being in a low-glucose environment, the light cells were well suited for growth in high glucose, and therefore might be in a metabolic state suited for growth in glucose. We therefore decided to more systematically investigate this phenomenon.”</p><p>Note: we add substantial new data, and better characterize the metabolic states, related to this point. This is also detailed later in the response, and also as a response to a specific reviewer point.</p><p>Subsection “Cells organize into spatially restricted, contrary metabolic states within the colony” which explains new data included, further characterizing the cells in the light region: “This spatial restriction of high PPP activity across the colony is also shown as an overlaid quantitative heat-map histogram in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A. Next, we directly addressed the possibility of these light cells exhibiting relatively high PPP activity. For unambiguously testing this, we utilized a stable-isotope based metabolic flux experiment to assess the flux towards PPP in light and dark cells. Light and dark cells isolated from colonies were pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose (for ~5 minutes), metabolites extracted, and the incorporation of this carbon label into the late PPP intermediates ribulose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S-7-P) was measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The relative amounts of these all-carbon labeled PPP intermediates were compared between the two cell types (light or dark). Notably, light cells incorporated significantly higher levels of <sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose into PPP metabolites compared to the dark cells (Figure 2D, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, and see Table 2 for MS parameters), showing that the light cells are in a high PPP activity state.”</p><p>Text explanations, for a range of controls done with the model simulations, now included in the manuscript: “A range of resource amounts, growth rates and diffusion of the resource were included in simulations (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C).”</p><p>Text clarification: “(a straw-man scenario, since initially in the actual colony all cells were in a dark state, as shown earlier).”</p><p>New text addition, to better describe conclusions: “Two simple take-home points emerge from this model, for such spatial distribution of cells in these two metabolic states, in the developing colony.”</p><p>Text addition, to better describe the experiment: For this we used stable-isotope labeled trehalose, and measured trehalose uptake, breakdown and utilization.”</p><p>Added text to clarify the results: “Indeed, the labeled forms of these metabolites were only above the detection limit in dark cells (Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).”</p><p>Important clarification, on questions regarding the uptake of trehalose: “Note: while Mal11 shows a high affinity for trehalose, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has multiple sugar transporters with reduced affinity for any disaccharide.

Their emergence is indeed rapid, and switch-like.”</p><p>Explanation of our result: “These data suggest a threshold effect, where the controlling resource, trehalose, needs to build up above a certain amount, in order for cells to switch to the contrary, high PPP activity state.</p><p>Cells in distinct metabolic states provide a collective growth advantage to the colony New, important data (and new Figure), showing a clear advantage for the community to have these distinct, metabolically specialized cells: “Finally, we wondered if the emergence of light cells in this high PPP activity state might benefit to the community of cells as a whole. To address this, we compared the long term colony expansion of wild-type cells, with colonies of cells lacking the neutral trehalase (<italic>Δnth1</italic>). Cells in the <italic>Δnth1</italic> colonies cannot utilize trehalose to produce glucose, and as shown earlier, will remain in a gluconeogenic state. Therefore, in these <italic>Δnth1</italic> cell colonies light cells will be absent. Strikingly, we observed that as the respective colonies grew over extended periods of time (~21 days), the wild-type colonies spread over a significantly greater area on the plate, while the <italic>Δnth1</italic> colonies were unable to expand as efficiently (Figure 7A and Figure 7B). This shows that the emergence and proliferation of light cells are important for the expansion of the colony. Since the dark cells are required for the emergence and existence of the light cells, collectively, these data suggest how the community uses cells in distinct metabolic states to maximize growth and spatial expansion, possibly to forage for new nutrients.”</p><p>Additions in the Discussion:</p><p>“A clearer explanation of the concept emerging from our data: “An implicit concept emerging from this study is that of threshold amounts of a controlling or sentinel metabolite that regulates a switch to a new metabolic state. By definition, such a metabolite must be produced by cells present in a certain (original) metabolic state. […] Since the inherent properties of the cells in the distinct states are different, this raises the deeper possibility that these advantages come from physical and chemical properties of the cells, which arise from their distinct metabolic states.”</p><p>In response to the reviewing editor’s comment “especially addressing to what extent these might be the consequence of spatial gradients”:</p><p>Data from both our experimental data and the computational model strongly suggest that the emergence of the light cells is due to the build-up of a threshold level of trehalose, which is produced by the dark (gluconeogenic) cells. The data clearly shows that (a) if trehalose uptake or (b) utilization is blocked/abolished, practically no cells with high PPP activity emerge in the periphery of the colony (i.e. the light region). These data are now much better illustrated or explained. Second, and importantly, the light cells only emerge (quite suddenly) after 4 days of colony development. This overall phenomenon therefore suggests that this availability of a new resource (trehalose) is necessary for the emergence of new (light) cells. The model effectively implies very short-range reaction-diffusion systems (of the activator- depleted substrate type, since trehalose is locally consumed by the cells that switch to the light state). We have now better clarified these points in the revised discussion. That said, it is possible that some spatial gradients of glucose in the solid agar media still exist, which could contribute to the development of light cells. As the colony develops in the low glucose medium, we consistently see the development of light cells only in the periphery of the colony (Figure 2C). Earlier studies have shown that as the colony develops, the glucose in the agar beneath the colony is completely utilized by the dividing cells and the cells at the periphery have the maximum access to the glucose available on the plate (Regenberg et al., 2016). It is possible that this residual glucose present in the agar plate (areas of the plate where the colonies have not grown) combined with the glucose obtained by the hydrolysis of the taken-up trehalose (which is itself critical for the light cells) might explain why light cells preferentially emerge at the periphery of the colony. This is however mostly speculative, but given the extensive, multiple lines of evidence provided for trehalose being the controlling resource (shown at the level of production, uptake, utilization, and abolishing which there are no light cells) we are very confident about the revised Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can you explain in more detail what you hypothesize to be the physiological/evolutionary reason for the different states?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, which prompted us to explore this possibility in greater detail. Instead of only speculating, we now present new data, which directly demonstrate a clear advantage for the colony as a whole to have cells in the light and dark state. This new data is as follows: we find that the presence of the light cells is critical for the spatial expansion of the colony over longer periods of time (measured over ~21 days). This is now included as a new Figure 7A. Notably, colonies of cells that lacks light cells (<italic>nth1</italic> deletion strain, which cannot utilize trehalose, and have no light cells with high PPP activity,are not able to expand spatially as effectively (as a colony) compared to the wild-type. This demonstrates that the light cells are important for the overall foraging behavior exhibited by the colony. We also know that dark cells themselves are critical for the emergence of the light cells, since light cells utilize the trehalose produced by the dark cells to fuel their high PPP activity state. Thus, the presence of cells in two distinct metabolic states allows the colony to spatially expand, potentially forage/move to regions of the medium with more access to glucose, and can be thought of as a bet-hedging strategy wherein the cells with different metabolic states (light and dark cells) enable the colony to efficiently expand and forage for nutrients.</p><p>Appropriate text has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please expand the statistical analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Pertinent statistical analysis has been performed for all applicable data sets in this manuscript.

A metabolic model is used to try and explain how these two different states could be the result of some cells producing glucose through gluconeogenesis, while others benefit from this resource as some of the glucose (in the form of trehalose) diffused away from the cells with high gluconeogenesis. Deletion of the trehalose transporter Mal11 or the trehalase (Nth1) abolished (or at least reduced) the differences between the two distinct groups of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for providing valuable inputs and feedback to help improve the manuscript.

Since (low) glucose is used as a carbon source, it seems possible (or even likely) that some cells may be able to take up sufficient amounts of glucose from the medium, while others (e.g. in more dense and internal regions of the colony) are not. It is of course difficult to avoid such differences in nutrient availability in a colony.</p></disp-quote><p>Even in the early stages of development (under low glucose conditions (0.1%)), a majority of cells exhibit gluconeogenesis (Figure 1). This is based on 2 experimental evidences.</p><p>First, when we spot the gluconeogenesis reporter strain (<italic>PCK1</italic> reporter) onto a plate containing low glucose (0.1%), within a few hours of growth, the colony exhibits uniform, gluconeogenesis.</p><fig id="respfig12"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>12 hr old gluconeogenesis reporter colony (Exposure &lt;5 sec)).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46735-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This suggests that, at the early stages of colony development, a majority of the cells exhibit gluconeogenesis. This is also evident from Figure 6D in the manuscript (you can see uniform fluorescence in the gluconeogenesis reporter colony imaged at a lower exposure (~1 sec)) for the gluconeogenesis reporter. However, as the colony develops, the gluconeogenesis activity becomes heterogeneous wherein the center of the colony exhibits minimal gluconeogenesis activity (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A), the dark cells exhibit maximum gluconeogenesis activity (Figure 1 (manuscript), Figure 6, Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) and the light cells exhibit almost no gluconeogenesis activity (Figures 1C and 6D).</p><p>Second, we also include an additional control, using cells grown in this same low glucose (liquid) medium for a very short time (~6-8 hours, with cells still in log phase), and find that even in a well-mixed system (planktonic cultures), where nutrients are equally distributed for cells unlike a colony, low glucose (0.1%) strongly triggers gluconeogenesis (this we have included as a new supplemental figure, Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). In this experiment, we monitored the amounts of two gluconeogenic enzymes (Pck1 and Fbp1) and compared protein amounts using cells grown in high glucose (2%) or low glucose (0.1%). Low glucose strongly triggered the expression of these enzymes while in high glucose, these enzymes had near-undetectable protein expression.</p><p>Appropriate text has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><p>Finally, using our model, we simulated the development of colonies using 3 different initial concentrations of gluconeogenic cells A) 95% of cells are gluconeogenic B) 50% of cells are gluconeogenic and C) 10% of the cells are gluconeogenic. We see the robust development of a structured colony with distinct metabolic states (resembling an actual wild-type colony) only when initial percentage of gluconeogenic cells are high (95%). Thus, our model suggests that, for the development of colonies exhibiting distinct metabolic states, a majority of the cells have to be gluconeogenic at the start of colony development. When the majority of the cells are gluconeogenic, the critical resource for the emergence of light cells, trehalose, reaches threshold levels and this enables the switching of dark cells to light cells and this in turn results in the development of a structured colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). It is possible that threshold levels of trehalose are not attained when we simulate colony development with lesser percentage of gluconeogenic cells (50% or 10%) and hence we do not see a structured colony that resembles a wild-type colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46735.030</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>A simulation of colony development using the model using different concentrations of gluconeogenic cells A) 95% B) 50% C) 10% during the start of colony development.</title><p>Black regions represent dark cells and grey regions represent light cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46735-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, in principle, it should be possible to obtain less confounded results in a medium that does not contain any glucose (e.g. ethanol + glycerol), which would force all cells to enter gluconeogenesis, unless some cells indeed receive some form of glucose (trehalose) produced by other cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that we could have looked at colony development in a medium containing ethanol+glycerol as the sole carbon source. It just so happens that we made all our initial observations in these conditions of low (as opposed to no) glucose entirely serendipitously. We had started with these conditions of low (as opposed to no) glucose only because this is a well-established condition to study colony development in yeast (Granek and Magwene, 2010; Reynolds and Fink, 2001). We subsequently went on to make all our remaining discoveries, using this low glucose condition. Perhaps if we had started our studies with no glucose, we might have made different sets of observations, but the low glucose condition used is a very reasonable growth medium for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and indeed is a very well established condition (in a range of published studies using yeast to examine gluconeogenesis, the activation of the Snf1 kinase, colony development, etc.). Given that we have backed up our statements with direct metabolite and metabolic flux measurements (which has to our knowledge never been reported from yeast colonies), and more definitively characterize the respective metabolic states, the results are fairly unambiguous. We do now include additional data further comparing the PPP activity (using stable isotope based flux experiments) in the light and dark cells, and this is now included in Figure 2, which establishes these states beyond doubt.</p><p>That said, we are now starting to explore what happens to colonies when grown in no glucose (and with ethanol as a sole carbon source). From very preliminary studies, the overall complexity of these colonies seem to be even greater than that in low glucose, and the growth development of these colonies happen over significantly longer durations of time (compared to the low glucose condition). We are currently in the process of determining the metabolic blueprint of these colonies grown in the ethanol+glycerol medium. The morphology exhibited by these colonies are different in these conditions compared to the morphology exhibited by the colonies under low glucose (0.1%). Please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> for comparison (and compare to Figure 1 in the manuscript).

You are also missing error bars on graph 2A (i)? Moreover in subsection “Cells organize into spatially restricted, contrary metabolic states within the colony” and Figure 2A, the authors claim a difference in lag, but since only the first 9 hours of growth were measured, I find it difficult to conclude from this graph if it is truly only a lag difference or if the cells perhaps also show differences in growth rate for a much longer time (especially in the gluconeogenic medium).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the author that respiration is essential for cells growing in a medium containing ethanol+glycerol as the sole carbon source. However, we do not draw any strong conclusions with this experiment. In fact, we did this only as a preliminary experiment to determine the existence of different metabolic state within the same community (and not to explore the need for respiration). The key take home message from the this experiment was only that dark cells that exhibit a gluconeogenic state are more adapted to growth in a medium containing ethanol+glycerol compared to the light cells which exhibit an alternate metabolic state. That is it. Similarly, the light cells are more adapted to grow in a medium containing glucose compared to the dark cells. This is in fact what prompted us to better characterize the light cells, and led us to perform far more decisive experiments. The reporters for high PPP activity (Figure 2B) were revelatory, suggesting that these cells had an unexpected, high PPP activity state. However, in the earlier version, we did not have direct metabolic evidence for this. Therefore, we now include a new, stable-isotope based metabolic flux experiment, providing <sup>13</sup>C glucose to light and dark cells for ~5min, and directly measuring flux to the late PPP metabolites (ribose-5-phosphate, and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate). We find that light cells have significantly higher flux into PPP (as measured by these newly synthesized metabolites). Further, we also show that light cells, synthesize more nucleotides compared to the dark cells, with new nucleotide synthesis being a canonical end point of high PPP activity. We include this new data, directly measuring PPP flux, in the new figure 2D, as well as Figure 2—figure supplement 1B. The PPP reporter data remains as Figure 2D, while the nucleotide data are now in Figure 2E. These data now unambiguously demonstrate that the light cells have substantially more PPP activity than adjacent dark cells.</p><p>We have made appropriate text revisions, to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, although I do believe the conclusions coming from this experiment, the control glucose grown cells were pre-grown in liquid instead of on plate, making them not a true control, since the cells coming from plate will also have to adapt to a liquid medium.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that cells coming from a plate will take time to adapt to a liquid medium.

The first comment is scientific: it did not become clear to me why, on a fundamental level, cells differentiate into two distinct metabolic states, instead of all cells attaining a common intermediate metabolic state. I think this question emerges most clearly in the Discussion, where the authors summarize the main insights. All cells are initially in the same state (gluconeogenesis). They produce trehalose. The trehalose accumulates externally until it reaches a concentration where some cells switch to a different state (glycolytic/high PPP) and start consuming trehalose. Is it understood why there is not a different outcome – that all cells together decrease gluconeogenetic activity over time and all attain the same intermediate metabolic state?
