A key challenge is understanding the relationship between neural activity and the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal obtained from fMRI, generally modeled by the hemodynamic response function (HRF). The timing of the HRF varies across the brain and individuals, confounding our ability to make inferences about the timing of the underlying neural processes. Here, we show that resting-state fMRI signals contain information about HRF temporal dynamics that can be leveraged to understand and characterize variations in HRF timing across both cortical and subcortical regions. We found that the frequency spectrum of resting-state fMRI signals significantly differs between voxels with fast versus slow HRFs in human visual cortex. These spectral differences extended to subcortex as well, revealing significantly faster hemodynamic timing in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that the temporal properties of the HRF impact the spectral content of resting-state fMRI signals and enable voxel-wise characterization of relative hemodynamic response timing. Furthermore, our results show that caution should be used in studies of resting-state fMRI spectral properties, because differences in fMRI frequency content can arise from purely vascular origins. This finding provides new insight into the temporal properties of fMRI signals across voxels, which is crucial for accurate fMRI analyses, and enhances the ability of fast fMRI to identify and track fast neural dynamics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a tool that can be used to non-invasively measure the activity of the human brain.

When activity in a population of neurons changes, these changes give rise to the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured in most fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ogawa et al., 1990</xref>). Thus far, however, BOLD fMRI has exhibited relatively limited ability to provide the fine-grained temporal information necessary for deepening our understanding of brain dynamics. This is due to the fact that the signals obtained from BOLD fMRI are not direct measures of neural activity, but rather reflect the coupling between neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response, which evolves on a time course of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kwong et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ogawa et al., 1990</xref>). This coupling between neural activity and the BOLD signal can be represented by the hemodynamic response function (HRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguirre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Handwerker et al., 2004</xref>). The properties of the HRF depend on many interconnected factors, including the effects of local vascular architecture and cerebrovascular dynamics, that vary substantially across the brain and between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguirre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Handwerker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Len and Neary, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>). The relative timing and shape of the HRF, therefore, also varies considerably across brain regions and even between neighboring voxels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buckner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miezin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Siero et al., 2015</xref>). Hemodynamic response temporal lag variation is substantially larger than many neural effects of interest, introducing variability on the order of several seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buckner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, to enable inferences about the relative timing of neural activity using signals obtained from BOLD fMRI, it is crucial to understand the variations in HRF timing across the brain.</p><p>Advances in acquisition technology now allow high-resolution whole brain fMRI data to be acquired at fast (&lt;500ms) rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Polimeni and Lewis, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiew et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hennig et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Setsompop et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that fMRI could provide a unique tool to noninvasively track temporal sequences of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Menon et al., 1998</xref>) across the entire brain. Indeed, recent studies have revealed highly structured temporal dynamics using fMRI and suggest that fMRI can enable whole-brain mapping of temporal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Setzer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Raut et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mitra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vizioli et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, hemodynamic signals have been shown to contain more information about fast and high-frequency activity than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Glover, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sasai et al., 2021</xref>). Studies examining individual brain regions have demonstrated that fMRI can achieve impressive temporal precision within regions, on the order of 100ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2013</xref>), meaning that high fidelity temporal information is present within these hemodynamic signals. However, a key remaining challenge is that the hemodynamic differences across the brain confound our ability to infer the timing of the underlying neural activity from BOLD fMRI. Specifically, if a given brain region shows earlier BOLD activity, it could be due to faster neural activity or simply due to a faster hemodynamic response in that region. Fully exploiting the higher temporal resolution provided by fast fMRI techniques will therefore ultimately require accounting for differences in the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response across the whole brain.</p><p>Despite the well-known heterogeneity of hemodynamic timing, most common analysis approaches for BOLD fMRI data assume a standard, canonical HRF shape throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Glover, 1999</xref>). This approach is understandable, since the true HRF is not known, but it nevertheless cannot account for the vascular confound introduced by hemodynamic response variability. Incorrect assumptions about the shape and timing of the HRF can lead to incorrect inferences regarding the underlying neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lindquist et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Handwerker et al., 2012</xref>), and studies that assume a whole brain canonical HRF are unable to decouple the neural and vascular components of the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Handwerker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rangaprakash et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rangaprakash et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshpande et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). Even when using flexible modeling approaches, such as basis sets or finite impulse response models, it is not possible to determine whether a given region’s faster fMRI response reflects fast neural activity, or simply faster local neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Handwerker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The fact that most studies do not account for variations in HRF dynamics is largely due to methodological challenges. Previous work has demonstrated that it is possible to quantify hemodynamic lags across brain regions, and even on a voxel-wise level, to detect the relative order of BOLD responses with high temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miezin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Siero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sicard and Duong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Misaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kastrup et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bright et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). One such method is the use of a stimulus paradigm that drives activity in particular brain regions where the neuronal response properties are relatively well understood and controlled such as primary sensory or motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Handwerker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miezin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). However, this approach cannot be applied to the majority of the brain, where the neuronal response properties are not known ahead of time. Alternatively, using a breath hold or similar hypercapnic challenge can modulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) to all vascularized regions with minimal changes in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>), allowing mapping of vascular latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sicard and Duong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kastrup et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bright et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pinto et al., 2021</xref>). However, breath hold tasks are not suitable for all subject populations, as some patients may have difficulty complying with the breath hold task. Furthermore, breath hold tasks modulate and measure cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which contributes to neurovascular coupling but is a distinct process. While neurovascular coupling reflects the alterations in local hemodynamics that occur in response to changes in neural activity, CVR is specifically a measure of a blood vessel’s capacity to dilate and constrict in response to a vasoactive stimulus, and does not include the extensive metabolic and molecular factors that also drive neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pinto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Esposito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Iadecola, 2017</xref>). In fact, there is evidence that while CVR is affected by healthy aging, some metrics of neurovascular coupling are not, hinting that distinct mechanisms may shape these two patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stefanidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">West et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grinband et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A task-free, neurovascular-based approach for detecting the lags of intrinsic neurovascular coupling would therefore be broadly relevant for analyzing fMRI data. A potential alternative route towards identifying local hemodynamic properties is to examine the properties of resting-state fMRI data. Resting-state fMRI signals reflect neurovascular coupling induced by spontaneous neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ma et al., 2016</xref>) and confer the additional benefit of being task-independent, which makes it a viable scan type for patient populations. Moreover, unlike stimulus- or task-based paradigms for mapping local hemodynamic response timings in specific brain regions, resting-state fMRI can be used to examine the HRF across the whole brain. These advantages have prompted past research into the utility of resting-state fMRI signals to estimate the HRF itself with prior work utilizing deconvolution approaches to explore HRF timing in resting-state data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sreenivasan et al., 2015</xref>). However, these approaches require assumptions about the underlying neural events, which are not known. We therefore investigated whether intrinsic signatures of local neurovascular coupling dynamics are present in the resting-state fMRI signal.</p><p>Our goal was to understand whether information about the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response is present in resting-state fMRI data. We first used simulations of the BOLD response to illustrate how distinct, physiologically relevant HRF shapes should produce marked differences in the frequency content of resting-state signals. Next, we verified this result in fast fMRI data collected at 7 Tesla (T) using visual stimulation to induce a neural response with known timing in primary visual cortex (V1). We quantified the temporal delay of voxels in V1 in response to a controlled, oscillating visual stimulus, and found that voxels with fast and slow hemodynamic responses exhibited distinct resting-state spectral features. We further extended our analyses to the visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) and found that this principle generalized to subcortex. To understand the potential of this information as a tool to predict the temporal properties of individual voxels, we then trained classifiers to use information from the resting-state spectrum to classify voxels as being fast or slow cortical voxels, or even faster LGN voxels. We found that resting-state signals were better predictors of voxel-wise differences in relative hemodynamic timing than latencies measured from a gold standard breath hold task. Our results establish that information about hemodynamic timing can be extracted from the frequency spectrum of resting-state fMRI signals. This demonstrates that resting-state fMRI can provide a way to understand and predict the temporal dynamics of the HRF across the brain, which is critical for interpreting neural activity using BOLD fMRI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The temporal dynamics of the HRF profoundly impact the spectrum of simulated BOLD responses</title><p>Previous modeling work has illustrated that narrower HRFs should result in BOLD responses containing more high frequency power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Glover, 2015</xref>), suggesting that local variations in HRF timing should manifest as local variations in the frequency content of BOLD signals. We therefore hypothesized that the frequency spectrum of BOLD dynamics in the resting-state can be used to infer the relative timing of the task-driven hemodynamic response. We first aimed to illustrate this property by simulating the BOLD frequency response using HRFs with different temporal dynamics. If we assume that the BOLD response is a linear time-invariant system, we can compute the BOLD response as a convolution between a given input (i.e. the stimulus) and the characteristic input response of the system (i.e. the HRF). Then, by varying the frequency of the stimulus we can construct a spectrum of the BOLD frequency response for HRFs with faster or slower dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We performed this simulation using six different HRFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with physiologically representative values for their time-to-peak (TTP), full width at half maximum (FWHM), and amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>). We observed that while HRFs with faster dynamics produced less power in the low frequency bands compared to those with slower dynamics, they also showed a shallower decline in power at higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, this effect was preserved when we normalized the different HRFs to have the same peak amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), demonstrating that this phenomenon is not solely due to the higher amplitude of slower HRFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This effect was also preserved if we accounted for the 1/f-like spectral pattern that neural activity displays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). And finally, although prior work has shown that the TTP and FWHM of the HRF are correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Zwart et al., 2005</xref>), we also tested the effect of holding one parameter constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Varying the FWHM had a more profound impact on the frequency spectrum compared to varying the TTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), as expected due to the higher frequency content of narrower HRF shapes, although short TTPs also had a smaller effect on the spectrum. These simulations demonstrate that there should be profound differences in the relative power at low versus high frequencies for voxels with fast vs. slow HRFs, which we hypothesized can be quantified and related to the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simulations show that the temporal properties of the hemodynamic response function affect the frequency spectrum of the BOLD signal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We generated a simulated BOLD response to determine the response amplitude of each HRF to each neural frequency.

To empirically test the prediction that fast and slow voxels should have distinct frequency content in the resting-state, we first used a task paradigm to identify voxels in V1 with consistently fast or slow hemodynamic responses. To drive continuous oscillations in V1 we presented the subjects with a 12 Hz counterphase flickering radial checkerboard with the luminance contrast of the checkerboard modulated in time as a sine wave of 0.05 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top). We used a combination of an anatomical and functional localizer to identify stimulus-driven voxels in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For those voxels that were significantly driven by the stimulus, we then calculated the phase lag, or relative response latency to the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To quantify this property across voxels, we sought to generate a set of spectral features that could capture these resting-state spectral dynamics. We constructed four spectral features to capture spectral properties: the slope using a linear fit under 0.2 Hz, the exponent of an aperiodic 1 /f fit, the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (0.01–0.1 Hz power; ALFF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zang et al., 2007</xref>), and the fractional ALFF (ratio of 0.01–0.08 Hz to 0–0.25 Hz; fALFF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Each feature of the resting-state spectra revealed significant differences (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p&lt;0.05) between fast and slow voxels across subjects. The slope showed significant differences between the fast and slow voxels within each individual subject (15/15), while the aperiodic exponent, ALFF, and fALFF showed significant differences in 14, 11, and 13 subjects, respectively. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for p-values). Each of these features reflects information about the frequency content at high and low frequencies, suggesting that this was an effective metric for differentiating voxels with fast or slow hemodynamic responses.

Having established that the resting-state spectrum contained signatures of local hemodynamic response timing within V1, we next aimed to test whether this principle extended to the visual thalamus, specifically the LGN. Prior studies have shown that LGN has faster hemodynamic responses than V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>); however, due to its small size and lower signal-to-noise ratio, extracting its spectral features accurately could be more challenging. We generated individual masks of the LGN within each subject using the individual anatomical segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischl, 2012</xref>) and a functional localizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To confirm the presence of stimulus-locked oscillations in the LGN and to assess the relative timing of its response, we first examined the latency of the average response to the visual stimulus in the LGN, as compared to the fast and slow groups in V1. We observed that the LGN peaked before both the fast and slow groups in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with prior work demonstrating faster hemodynamics in thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>). Then, to test whether this faster hemodynamic response was similarly linked to flatter resting-state spectra, we compared the LGN voxels’ resting-state features to the previously identified fast and slow voxels in the cortex. We found that for all subjects there were clear differences in each spectral feature within the LGN compared to both the fast and slow voxels of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>; See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for p-values).

We thus observed even shallower frequency slopes for the fast LGN voxels – again consistent with our simulation results, demonstrating that this pattern held not just within V1 but even extended to the LGN of the thalamus.

Therefore, we tested whether similar information about hemodynamic latencies found using the resting-state spectra could be found in data from the breath hold task. To determine this, we first mapped the vascular latency in response to the breath hold task on a voxel-wise basis across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). We then compared each voxel’s relative vascular latency from the breath hold task across the three groups identified in the visual task – the fast and slow cortical voxels and LGN voxels. We found that some subjects showed the expected temporal sequence of activation, where LGN voxels and fast cortical voxels respond earlier than slow cortical voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but this effect was not present in all subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Even among the subjects that exhibited the expected order of activation, few of them showed individual-level significant differences in breath hold latency between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Specifically, in only 7/15 subjects was the average breath hold latency of fast cortical voxels significantly faster compared to slow cortical voxels. Furthermore, the breath hold latency in LGN voxels was slower than expected in some subjects: it was significantly slower than fast cortical voxels in 5 subjects and significantly slower than slow cortical voxels in 1 subject (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p&lt;0.05). These results demonstrate that although the vascular latencies derived from the breath hold task do show significant differences between fast and slow cortical voxels and LGN voxels across the group, this effect is less robust in individual subjects than the resting-state spectral features. Additionally, not all subjects demonstrated the expected order of latencies between the three groups – with LGN first followed by fast cortical and, lastly, slow cortical voxels. Taken together, these results suggest that the features of the resting-state spectrum capture additional information about local differences in neurovascular coupling delays.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Breath hold vascular latencies yield less robust characterization of task-driven hemodynamic response lags.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plot of one subject’s average BOLD response to the breath hold task in fast (teal) and slow (pink) cortical voxels as well as LGN voxels (yellow).

We next investigated whether our chosen features were sufficient for classification, or whether additional useful information was present in the full resting-state spectrum, by training a second SVM classifier to use each voxel’s resting-state spectrum as the predictor for the classifier. The input to the classifier was the resting-state spectrum limited to up to 0.5 Hz to reduce the number of features fed into the model to avoid overfitting. Once again, we found that the accuracies, both within individual subjects and on the dataset that combined all subjects, were well above chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; per-subject accuracy in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

This result further supported the conclusion that resting-state spectral information performs well at capturing differences in hemodynamic response timings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We conclude that the frequency spectrum of resting-state fMRI signals contains rich information about local hemodynamic timing. Our simulations first illustrated the rationale for this effect: HRFs with faster temporal dynamics produce less power in the low frequency bands and a shallower attenuation of power at high frequencies. This effect is preserved even when we account for the higher amplitude of slower HRFs and the 1 /f decay of the amplitude of spontaneous neural activity. Following this observation, we constructed several quantitative features based on the resting-state spectrum, each capturing a similar property: the relative amplitude of high vs. low frequencies, and when used as predictors for a SVM were able to classify individual voxels as fast or slow. Our findings demonstrate that the temporal properties of the HRF affect the spectral features of resting-state fMRI signals and present a framework for characterizing the temporal properties of the hemodynamic response across voxels, which is crucial for accurate fMRI analyses.</p><p>The work presented here has broad implications for fMRI studies using the frequency content of the BOLD signal to make inferences about intrinsic brain activity. Prior work has identified changes in the spectral content of fMRI signals in certain clinical populations, including major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), mild cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Han et al., 2011</xref>), and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), and interpreted these differences as changes in intrinsic brain activity. However, as seen here, differences in hemodynamic response timings will also alter the frequency content of fMRI signals. Furthermore, prior work has shown that intrinsic timescales of BOLD activity vary across brain regions and can be used to predict individual subject patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fallon et al., 2020</xref>). Our work suggests hemodynamic differences may contribute to these observations. Therefore, changes in the spectral content of fMRI signals can arise not just from differences in intrinsic brain activity but could also be indicators of different hemodynamic response timing.</p><p>A common theme across the spectral features we constructed was that they were sensitive to the relative contributions of low- and high-frequency power. Two features we selected (the slope of the spectrum and the exponent of the aperiodic 1 /f fit) are direct measures of the attenuation in power towards higher frequencies. Similar information is contained in the commonly used metrics ALFF and fALFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zou et al., 2008</xref>): ALFF is a marker of the power in low frequency bands and fALFF is a measure of the ratio of high to low frequency power. While each of these features showed significant differences between fast and slow cortical voxels, only the slope and fALFF exhibited significant differences within each individual subject. These features explicitly capture the relative difference in high-frequency vs. low-frequency power, corresponding to the main prediction of our simulations. Conversely, ALFF had the poorest sensitivity within subjects which could be due to the fact that ALFF is the only feature that does not include information from both low and high frequency ranges and is instead limited to a relatively narrow band of frequencies, 0.01–0.08 Hz. Overall, our results suggest that while some information is contained in the magnitude of the fMRI signal alone, capturing the relative power in high versus low frequencies is the most important metric for predicting hemodynamic timing. Moreover, using the resting-state spectrum itself did not perform significantly better than our chosen features in classifying fast and slow voxels, suggesting that the relative power is indeed the primary contributor when predicting variations in local HRF timings.</p><p>Our results highlight the substantial variability in hemodynamic timing even within a single cortical area, and provide a way to predict this speed, but the specific reasons why individual voxels are fast or slow are not yet clear. A multitude of neurovascular and anatomical factors contribute to the variability in hemodynamic response timing across the brain. For example, the anatomical organization of the vascular network inherently introduces temporal dispersion to the hemodynamic response. As blood travels through the vascular network in response to changes in neuronal activity it not only encounters a range of vessel diameters, but also many branch points which each introduce delays. Prior work has shown that the timing and duration of the hemodynamic response both increase towards the cortical surface while the fastest, narrowest hemodynamic responses occurred in deeper gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Zwart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duvernoy et al., 1981</xref>). This suggests the possibility that the fast responding voxels identified in our study are more concentrated in deeper gray matter, although the spatial resolution of our images was not sufficient to separate voxels by cortical depth in this study. Vascular elasticity and reactivity also change across the vascular network and vary between regions further contributing to the variable timing of the hemodynamic response across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Uludağ and Blinder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drew, 2019</xref>). Arteries are surrounded by smooth muscle cells that rapidly relax and expand their diameter in response to neural activity while veins dilate much more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drew, 2019</xref>). Local differences in the relative concentrations of arteries and veins could therefore also introduce differences in the temporal dynamics of the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Zwart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the slow responding voxels may be more likely to contain veins. These relationships between vascular anatomy and timing further highlight that fMRI studies analyzing spectral power or temporal autocorrelation should take into consideration how local vascular anatomy affects these metrics.</p><p>A unique advantage of fMRI is its ability to image throughout the whole brain, and our results suggest the potential for extracting more information from fMRI studies of subcortex. Due to significant improvements in both the sensitivity and spatial resolution of fMRI, an increasing number of studies are utilizing fMRI to study small, deep brain structures such as the thalamus and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beissner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sclocco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Saranathan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beissner and Baudrexel, 2014</xref>). The ability to image these deeper brain structures in humans opens the door to studying diverse aspects of cognition associated with these deeper brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beissner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sclocco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Saranathan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beissner and Baudrexel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sherman, 2007</xref>). However, these deep brain structures also have unique physiological and anatomical properties that alter their vascular dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duvernoy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Devonshire et al., 2012</xref>). Faster hemodynamic responses are frequently reported in subcortex, but hemodynamic responses in these regions are less well characterized than in the cortex. Our analyses found that variations in HRF timing are reflected in the frequency spectra of thalamic voxels as well, despite their differing signal-to-noise ratio. This result demonstrates the utility of our approach in subcortex and could benefit neuroimaging studies of structures such as the thalamus, a target of increasing interest in fMRI.</p><p>Improvements in the temporal resolution of BOLD fMRI have also sparked interest in detecting neural sequences at sub-second timescales, which are highly relevant for many studies of cognition. Recent studies have leveraged fast fMRI to detect rapid sequences of neural events related to visual sequence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wittkuhn and Schuck, 2021</xref>), auditory dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frühholz et al., 2020</xref>), and changes in arousal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Setzer et al., 2021</xref>). As we continue to identify these rapid neural sequences, it will become even more crucial to consider how the hemodynamic response varies across regions to determine whether a given sequence represents regional differences in neuronal or in hemodynamic timing. Considering spectral signatures can support inference of precise timing of neural activity by providing information about relative hemodynamic latencies between voxels and regions.</p><p>We found that the resting-state signals predicted voxel-wise differences in relative hemodynamic response timing significantly better using a breath hold to estimate vascular delays, the current gold standard. This observation could be explained by multiple factors. One potential factor is subject motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). There was significantly more motion during the breath hold task compared to the visual stimulus (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0.01), which could lead to breath tasks providing less reliable information. Additionally, the models trained using the breath hold latencies were only able to leverage one piece of information: the measure of vascular latency derived from cross-correlation. The information from taking the cross-correlation in the time domain may also be more sensitive to noise, especially at the fast sampling rate of our scans. However, a more important factor may be the biological mechanisms generating each signal. The breath hold task directly modulates cerebrovascular reactivity with minimal accompanying changes in CMRO<sub>2</sub>, allowing for assessment of local cerebral vascular reactivity uncoupled from neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kastrup et al., 1999</xref>). CVR is important to assess in many clinical applications, and the breath hold-based approach remains a gold standard for CVR mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kastrup et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bright et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pinto et al., 2021</xref>). However, while CVR is a significant modulator of the hemodynamic response, it is only one component of neurovascular coupling, and there are many other factors and signaling pathways that also contribute. In particular, local metabolic factors and feedback mechanisms also modulate of blood flow in the brain and are not replicated in the breath hold task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Iadecola, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hosford and Gourine, 2019</xref>). The hemodynamic responses induced by neural activity may, therefore, not be identical in timing to those induced by a purely vascular signal. By contrast, the signals obtained from resting-state fMRI are coupled to underlying neural activity in an analogous manner as during a task condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>). The improved performance of the resting-state-based prediction may therefore reflect that it is intrinsically more similar to a task than the breath hold condition, as the underlying biological origins of resting-state signals share common mechanisms with task-induced neurovascular coupling. Future applications may therefore benefit from continuing to use breath tasks as a gold standard to assess CVR, whereas resting-state analyses may be a better metric of neurovascular coupling.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that our approach has thus far only been validated in the visual system, which is the basis for the majority of our knowledge about the HRF. Given that the HRF has been shown to vary across the brain, the generalizability of our approach to different brain regions has yet to be established. However, studies that have empirically derived the HRF in other brain regions, such as the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>) or somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Zwart et al., 2005</xref>), have produced HRFs with similar shapes and parameters to the double-gamma HRF utilized in our simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Handwerker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Zwart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>) providing evidence that this approach may be generalizable across the brain. Still, future work could investigate this approach in other primary sensory systems such as the auditory system where there are reliable stimulation paradigms. Additionally, this study used data collected at an ultra-high magnetic field strength (7T) which affords a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to more traditional 3T fMRI. However, we also performed the same spectral analysis in an independent dataset acquired at 3T and robustly replicated our result, demonstrating that this pattern is preserved despite a lower SNR and different acquisition parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The work discussed here suggests a wide range of neuroscience applications for our approach to measuring hemodynamic timing. One logical next step would be to use the ability to characterize temporal variation in the HRF to not just predict, but to correct for vascular delays. Previous work demonstrated that correcting for varying hemodynamic latencies across the brain can affect functional connectivity analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rangaprakash et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). Our results could further enhance removal of non-neural latency differences that confound functional connectivity metrics, both static and dynamic, and can increase confidence that the networks we are analyzing are derived from neuronal dynamics. This has become increasingly of interest as more studies use functional connectivity, particularly in resting-state, to study dynamics underlying diseases such as PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rabinak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maron-Katz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), Alzheimer’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Greicius et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agosta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koch et al., 2012</xref>), Parkinson’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Helmich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hacker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agosta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baggio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Putcha et al., 2015</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Filippi et al., 2019</xref>). Since changes in neurovascular function have been observed in many disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de la Torre and Mecocci, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gutteridge et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burrage et al., 2018</xref>), analyzing spectral dynamics may help interpret functional connectivity differences in clinical populations.</p><p>Although we focused on the utility of resting-state spectral information to classify voxels as having relatively fast or slow hemodynamic response timings, we did also examine the correlation with absolute timing measures. We found that most subjects had significant positive correlations between each of the spectral features and the task response latency. Despite this fact, when estimating continuous predictions of absolute hemodynamic response lag, prediction performance was poor. Importantly, previous evidence has shown that the absolute timing of the HRF varies between task and resting-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Glover, 2015</xref>), suggesting that caution is needed in using absolute measures of hemodynamic latencies, as these may not generalize across conditions. Measuring relative differences in HRF timing might therefore be a more effective method to correct for variations in the hemodynamic response across brain regions, since task state can modulate the absolute timing of the hemodynamic response. Furthermore, the relative differences provide the key information necessary to interpret sequences of activity across brain regions, enabling examination of whether purely vascular differences are present across those regions.</p><p>Together, our results demonstrate that the resting-state fMRI signal contains information about local hemodynamic response speeds. This approach can help understand brain-wide variations in HRF dynamics, which is critical as the field moves toward a new era of fMRI studies utilizing fast fMRI to study rapid neuronal dynamics and higher level cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Simulations</title><p>Spectra of simulated BOLD responses were generated by convolving a given HRF with oscillating stimuli, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 Hz, and taking the magnitude of the simulated BOLD response as the power at that frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Subjects were selected for analysis if they had completed at least one run of a visual task as well as one resting-state scan of at least 10 min. Briefly, subjects were scanned on a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head and neck coil. Anatomical runs were acquired with 1 mm isotropic T1-weighted multi-echo MPRAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van der Kouwe et al., 2008</xref>). Functional runs were acquired using TR = 0.378 s, 2.5 mm isotropic voxels, and multiband factor = 8. Similar preprocessing steps were performed for this dataset as described above in <bold>fMRI Preprocessing</bold> including slice-timing correction and motion correction. More information about the specific acquisition parameters and preprocessing can be found in the original open-access publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Williams et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The visual stimulus was a counterphase 12 Hz flickering checkerboard stimulus that lasted 254 s with fixed 16 s ON and 16 s OFF periods beginning with an OFF period. To assist the subjects with fixation, in the center of the checkerboard was a red dot that changed brightness at random interval. Subjects were instructed to press a button whenever they detected a color change. During the resting-state scans subjects performed a behavioral task where they were instructed to close their eyes and press a button on a response box on every breath in. This behavioral task enabled us to behaviorally monitor if the subjects fell asleep. Only subjects that were consistently doing the behavioral task during the entire resting-state run were included in our analysis.</p><p>A GLM was fit in FSL to identify voxels that were driven by the stimulus and voxels with a Z-statistic above 2.5 were selected for further analysis. This functional localizer was then further constrained by its intersection with the anatomical definition of V1.

Then, the fast and slow voxels were registered to the resting-state run and the same procedure outlined above in <bold>Resting-state Spectral Analysis</bold> was used to extract the 4 spectral features of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided informed consent.

across brain areas and will be valuable to researchers who use fMRI and other types of functional imaging that rely on neurovascular coupling. Using simulations and experiments, the authors provide compelling evidence that differences in the HRF can impact spectrum-based metrics such as ALFF and fALFF. A better understanding of the variability of the HRF is critical for the proper interpretation of activation onset times and of differences observed in clinical populations where both neural and vascular alterations can be expected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86453.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Keilholz</surname><given-names>Shella</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03czfpz43</institution-id><institution>Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Keilholz</surname><given-names>Shella</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00te3t702</institution-id><institution>Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.25.525528">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.25.525528v1?rss=1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

If the authors have collected any similar data with different acquisition parameters (such as 3T, lower resolution), a comparison could be helpful for understanding how well the approach translates to other imaging parameters.</p><p>2. For the SVM classification, it is mentioned that voxels are randomly sampled for the 80-20 splits. It would seem possible that certain voxels in an instance of the test set could happen to be in close proximity to voxels in the associated training set, and any smoothness in the reconstructed fMRI data might introduce bias in the performance (despite the fact that the authors have not applied spatial smoothing in post-processing). To examine this possibility, voxels in each test partition could be constrained to be at least a certain distance away from voxels in the associated training split.</p><p>3. The interpretation of the slow v. fast V1 voxel groups could be discussed. Are the fast and slow voxels found in consistent locations across different subjects, and do they map to different anatomic regions within the visual cortex (similar to the example in Figure 1E)? What might cause a voxel to belong to one or the other group – is there a relation to the underlying neural or vascular anatomy of these subjects?</p><p>4. To examine the influence of thermal noise, the authors have taken care to show that removing a fitted noise floor alters the spectral measures of interest by only a small amount (Figure S2). To further test if there is a relationship between the thermal noise content and the HRF phase, perhaps one could see if the fast versus slow V1 voxel groups have any difference in the estimated noise floor (using an appropriate normalization scheme to handle the arbitrary units of fMRI).</p><p>5. The amount of head motion in these subjects during each condition (breath-hold, rest, visual) could be reported.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86453.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should consider and discuss the impact of potential differences in HRF shape beyond the standard model and visual cortex.

Empirically, the double γ model does capture most HRFs typically reported in the human brain, once the duration of neural activity is accounted for and the impulse response is identified. The vast majority of fMRI studies utilize some variation of this shape of HRF in their statistical analyses, as this model captures HRF shapes that have been observed across diverse cortical and subcortical areas. Although there are studies that have investigated alternative models of the HRF (1, 2) their general shape is similar to the HRFs presented here and they have not been as widely used. Additionally, studies that have empirically derived the HRF across the cortex have presented HRFs that generally follow the shape of a double-γ function with time-to-peak (TTP) and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) values in a similar range to our simulated HRFs (3, 4). Prior work has also shown TTP and FWHM of the HRF are correlated (5, 6) informing our decision to model early onset HRFs with a shorter response duration. We acknowledge that the HRFs presented in these simulations by no means capture the full range of shapes the HRF could in principle take across the brain; however, they span a wide range of empirically derived parameters leading us to believe we are capturing a large portion of possible HRF shapes. Still, the reviewer’s point is correct that other shapes can exist, and our decision to correlate TTP with FWHM in our simulated HRFs does not allow us to disentangle the effects that TTP and FWHM have on the power spectra. To remedy this, we generated new sets of HRFs either holding the TTP or FWHM constant while the other parameter varies and created a supplementary figure to report on these additional shapes. The following text has been added to reflect this new analysis:</p><p>“And finally, although prior work has shown that the TTP and FWHM of the HRF are correlated (5, 6), we also tested the effect of holding one parameter constant (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2). Varying the FWHM had a more profound impact on the frequency spectrum compared to varying the TTP (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2), as expected due to the higher frequency content of narrower HRF shapes, although short TTPs also had a smaller effect on the spectrum.”</p><p>We have also added the following text to the discussion to discuss the reviewer’s point that these HRF shapes may vary in other cortical regions:</p><p>“One limitation of our study is that our approach has thus far only been validated in the visual system, which is the basis for the majority of our knowledge about the HRF. Given that the HRF has been shown to vary across the brain, the generalizability of our approach to different brain regions has yet to be established. However, studies that have empirically derived the HRF in other brain regions, such as the motor cortex (5) or somatosensory cortex (6), have produced HRFs with similar shapes and parameters to the double-γ HRF utilized in our simulations (3–6) providing evidence that this approach may be generalizable across the brain. Still, future work could investigate this approach in other primary sensory systems such as the auditory system where there are reliable stimulation paradigms. Additionally, this study used data collected at an ultra-high magnetic field strength (7T) which affords a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to more traditional 3T fMRI. However, we also performed the same spectral analysis in an independent dataset acquired at 3T and robustly replicated our result, demonstrating that this pattern is preserved despite a lower SNR and different acquisition parameters (Supplementary Figure S7).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should clarify the selection of voxels for training and testing, keeping proximity in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the suggestion and agree that voxels in the test set being in close proximity to voxels in the associated training set potentially biases our classifier performance. We conducted new analyses to control for this possibility, requiring that our training and test voxels be in different hemispheres. Encouragingly, despite the smaller training set size in this control analysis, we still successfully decode voxel lags, and furthermore this change actually <italic>improved</italic> the performance of our prediction when generalizing the model across subjects. We have added the following text and supplemental figure to address this:</p><p>“We next considered whether correlated information between neighboring voxels could be contributing this prediction, to test whether we could generalize to distant voxels. To control for instances of voxels in the test set being in close proximity to voxels in the training set, we trained a new set of models using voxels in a single hemisphere (left or right) as the training set, and voxels in the other hemisphere as the testing set. Following this procedure, the number of voxels for training and testing was often closer to a 50-50 split than an 80-20 split; however, validation accuracies both within individual subjects and across subjects nevertheless remained well above chance. Interestingly, the overall performance across subjects was higher, suggesting better generalization across subjects when training on spatially separated voxels (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional context for the interpretation of fast vs slow responders should be given (anatomical/functional location, proximity to vasculature).</p></disp-quote><p>The following discussion paragraph has been added to address this point:</p><p>“Our results highlight the substantial variability in hemodynamic timing even within a single cortical area, and provide a way to predict this speed, but the specific reasons why individual voxels are fast or slow are not yet clear. A multitude of neurovascular and anatomical factors contribute to the variability in hemodynamic response timing across the brain. For example, the anatomical organization of the vascular network inherently introduces temporal dispersion to the hemodynamic response. As blood travels through the vascular network in response to changes in neuronal activity it not only encounters a range of vessel diameters, but also many branch points which each introduce delays. Prior work has shown that the timing and duration of the hemodynamic response both increase towards the cortical surface while the fastest, narrowest hemodynamic responses occurred in deeper gray matter (5–7). This suggests the possibility that the fast responding voxels identified in our study are more concentrated in deeper gray matter, although the spatial resolution of our images was not sufficient to separate voxels by cortical depth in this study. Vascular elasticity and reactivity also change across the vascular network and vary between regions further contributing to the variable timing of the hemodynamic response across the brain (8, 9). Arteries are surrounded by smooth muscle cells that rapidly relax and expand their diameter in response to neural activity while veins dilate much more slowly (9). Local differences in the relative concentrations of arteries and veins could therefore also introduce differences in the temporal dynamics of the BOLD signal (3, 5, 6), suggesting that the slow responding voxels may be more likely to contain veins. These relationships between vascular anatomy and timing further highlight that fMRI studies analyzing spectral power or temporal autocorrelation should take into consideration how local vascular anatomy affects these metrics.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. If the authors have collected any similar data with different acquisition parameters (such as 3T, lower resolution), a comparison could be helpful for understanding how well the approach translates to other imaging parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and agree that demonstrating the validity of the approach under different acquisition parameters would strengthen the generalizability of this work. Certainly, the fact that this work was done at 7T limits the generalizability of these findings given the relatively limited availability of 7T fMRI scanners. We thus investigated our approach using 3T fast-fMRI data previously collected in our lab. We found that we robustly replicated our finding in the 3T dataset, and added the following text and figures reporting this replication:</p><p>“Additionally, this study used data collected at an ultra-high magnetic field strength (7T) which affords a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to more traditional 3T fMRI. However, we also performed the same spectral analysis in an independent dataset acquired at 3T and robustly replicated our result, demonstrating that this pattern is preserved despite a lower SNR and different acquisition parameters (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).”</p><p>“Replication dataset at 3 Tesla</p><p>To generate the replication figure (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1), we analyzed 10 subjects (mean age = 23 years, range = 19-29, 6 female) from a previously published dataset (10). Subjects were selected for analysis if they had completed at least one run of a visual task as well as one resting-state scan of at least 10 minutes. Briefly, subjects were scanned on a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head and neck coil. Anatomical runs were acquired with 1 mm isotropic T1-weighted multi-echo MPRAGE (11). Functional runs were acquired using TR = 0.378 s, 2.5 mm isotropic voxels, and multiband factor = 8. Similar preprocessing steps were performed for this dataset as described above in fMRI Preprocessing including slice-timing correction and motion correction. More information about the specific acquisition parameters and preprocessing can be found in the original open-access publication (10).</p><p>The visual stimulus was a counterphase 12-Hz flickering checkerboard stimulus that lasted 254 seconds with fixed 16 seconds ON and 16 seconds OFF periods beginning with an OFF period. To assist the subjects with fixation, in the center of the checkerboard was a red dot that changed brightness at random interval. Subjects were instructed to press a button whenever they detected a color change. During the resting-state scans subjects performed a behavioral task where they were instructed to close their eyes and press a button on a response box on every breath in. This behavioral task enabled us to behaviorally monitor if the subjects fell asleep. Only subjects that were consistently doing the behavioral task during the entire resting-state run were included in our analysis.</p><p>A GLM was fit in FSL to identify voxels that were driven by the stimulus and voxels with a Z-statistic above 2.5 were selected for further analysis. This functional localizer was then further constrained by its intersection with the anatomical definition of V1. Voxel-wise hemodynamic response lags within this combined mask were calculated and groups of fast and slow voxels were extracted using the methods described above in Voxel-wise Phase Analysis and Groupings. Then, the fast and slow voxels were registered to the resting-state run and the same procedure outlined above in Resting-state Spectral Analysis was used to extract the 4 spectral features of interest.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For the SVM classification, it is mentioned that voxels are randomly sampled for the 80-20 splits. It would seem possible that certain voxels in an instance of the test set could happen to be in close proximity to voxels in the associated training set, and any smoothness in the reconstructed fMRI data might introduce bias in the performance (despite the fact that the authors have not applied spatial smoothing in post-processing). To examine this possibility, voxels in each test partition could be constrained to be at least a certain distance away from voxels in the associated training split.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now addressed in the above section “Essential Revision #2”, we have now performed the control analyses as suggested (Supplementary Figure S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The interpretation of the slow v. fast V1 voxel groups could be discussed. Are the fast and slow voxels found in consistent locations across different subjects, and do they map to different anatomic regions within the visual cortex (similar to the example in Figure 1E)? What might cause a voxel to belong to one or the other group – is there a relation to the underlying neural or vascular anatomy of these subjects?</p></disp-quote><p>This is now addressed in the above section “Essential Revision #3”, we have added a discussion paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To examine the influence of thermal noise, the authors have taken care to show that removing a fitted noise floor alters the spectral measures of interest by only a small amount (Figure S2). To further test if there is a relationship between the thermal noise content and the HRF phase, perhaps one could see if the fast versus slow V1 voxel groups have any difference in the estimated noise floor (using an appropriate normalization scheme to handle the arbitrary units of fMRI).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and we have now performed this analysis. We did not find a significant difference in the thermal noise floor of fast vs. slow voxels across subjects. There might be some relationship between the thermal noise content and the HRF phase, but the nature of this relationship is unclear at this point and could be investigated in future studies. We added this as a supplementary figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
