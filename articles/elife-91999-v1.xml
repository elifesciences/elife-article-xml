In contrast, myeloid cells massively infiltrate tumors and are well adapted to survive these harsh conditions. While they are equipped with cell-killing abilities, they often adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype upon migration to tumors. Therefore, the questions of how to modify their activation programming against cancer, and what signaling cascades should be activated in myeloid cells to elicit their cytotoxicity have remained unclear. Here, we found that activation of IgM-induced signaling in murine myeloid cells results in secretion of lytic granules and massive tumor cell death. These findings open venues for designing novel immunotherapy by equipping monocytes with chimeric receptors that target tumor antigens and consequently, signal through IgM receptor. Nonetheless, we found that myeloid cells do not express the antibody-derived portion used to recognize the tumor antigen due to the induction of an ER stress response. To overcome this limitation, we designed chimeric receptors that are based on the high-affinity FcγRI for IgG. Incubation of macrophages expressing these receptors along with tumor-binding IgG induced massive tumor cell killing and secretion of reactive oxygen species and Granzyme B. Overall, this work highlights the challenges involved in genetically reprogramming the signaling in myeloid cells and provides a framework for endowing myeloid cells with antigen-specific cytotoxicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myeloid cells</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>chimeric antigen receptor</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003390</institution-id><institution>Fritz Thyssen Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmi</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001698</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmi</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmi</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic engineering of murine myeloid cells reveals the challenges in ectopic expression of chemiric receptors and provides a novel framework to endow them with tumor-specific cytotoxic ability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clinical and experimental data have highlighted the important role of the immune cell function and composition in determining tumor progression or eradication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coussens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fridman et al., 2012</xref>). While a high prevalence of tumor-infiltrating T cells is associated with improved prognosis and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thorsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruni et al., 2020</xref>), infiltration of myeloid cells is often associated with poor prognosis and tumor refractory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greten and Grivennikov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanahan and Coussens, 2012</xref>). Based on these findings, vast scientific effort is executed to increase the host’s T cell response to cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fritz and Lenardo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). In most cases however, tumor-reactive T cells generated spontaneously by the host bear low to moderate affinity (10<sup>–4</sup>M- 10<sup>–6</sup>M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann and Slansky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reuben et al., 2020</xref>), which is below the activation threshold needed for therapeutic effect, and attempts to increase TCR affinity using genetical engineering are often limited by induction of cross-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casucci et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these limitations, T cells can be genetically modified to express Chimeric Antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of Single Chain Fragment Variable (scFv) for tumor antigen recognition fused to T cell signaling domains (e.g. CD3ζ, CD28) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rafiq et al., 2020</xref>). Engineered cells are reinfused into the patient, providing the host’s immune system with T cells capable of specifically recognizing tumor antigens in an MHC-independent fashion. Indeed, this strategy benefits from overcoming the complex, multistep, and highly regulated activation process of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">June et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross and Eshhar, 2016</xref>) and has been proven remarkably successful in treating liquid tumors.</p><p>However, the harsh microenvironment characterizing solid tumors manifests a major limitation to T-cell-based treatments. Hypoxic and acidic conditions at tumor sites, along with immunosuppressive capacity of tumor cells limit T cell infiltration, survival, and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joyce and Fearon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanley and Thomas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to T cells, myeloid cells migrate efficiently into the tumor mass and are well adapted to survive and function under this harsh environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greten and Grivennikov, 2019</xref>). However, while myeloid cells are potentially able to produce cytotoxic compounds, they acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype once in the vicinity of the tumor cells and promote tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mantovani and Sica, 2010</xref>). Hence, equipping myeloid cells with means to release cytotoxic compounds following recognition of tumor antigens may provide a new therapeutic strategy. While recognition of tumors can be facilitated through scFv, which signaling chains should be fused are not clear. Early attempts to generate CAR myeloid cells have fused to CD3-ζ chain, which may function in these cells as Fc<bold>γ</bold> chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klichinsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sloas et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, what signaling cascades should be induced in myeloid cells to elicit their cytotoxicity has remained unclear.</p><p>Here, we found that activation of the IgM receptor signaling in myeloid cells induces massive killing of tumor cells. However, we found that in contrast to lymphoid cells, which can ectopically express scFv, myeloid cells identify it as a misfolded protein and rapidly degrade it. Instead, we modified the high-affinity FcγRI, which normally binds IgG, to transmit IgM receptor-driven signals, while recognition of tumor antigens is mediated by IgG-tumor-binding antibodies. Indeed, incubation of mRNA-engineered myeloid cells with tumor cells resulted in massive tumor cell killing only in the presence of IgG-tumor-binding antibodies. Overall, this work suggests a novel mean to endow myeloid cells with antigen-specific killing abilities and harness their capacity to migrate and survive in the harsh conditions at the tumor microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IgM-induced signaling elicits cytotoxic response in macrophages and can be integrated to a CAR design</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that MHC-matched allogeneic tumors, which spontaneously regressed, are coated with IgG and IgM antibodies soon after tumor initiation and are found in proximity to tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmi et al., 2015</xref>). While we characterized the therapeutic role of tumor-binding IgG and their interactions with dendritic cells (DC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmi et al., 2016</xref>), the role of IgM in facilitating DC-mediated immunity has remained unclear. To address that, we initially compared their capacity to induce tumor immunity in a prophylactic tumor immunization assay. To this end, we incubated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) with immune complexes (IC) composed of B16F10 tumor cells coated with allogenic IgG or IgM and injected them subcutaneously (s.c) to syngeneic mice (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After two rounds of immunization, five days apart, mice were challenged with B16F10 cells and tumor size was monitored over time. We found that incubation of MoDC with IgG-IC, but not with IgM-IC, induced T cell immunity and prevented tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We noticed however, that incubation in vitro of MoDC with tumor cells coated with allogenic IgM but not with IgG, resulted in a massive killing of the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To assess the underlying killing mechanisms, we measured the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and granzyme B (GrB) in the supernatants of overnight cultures. Consistent with their killing rates, significantly higher levels of both GrB and NO were detected upon incubation with allogenic IgM-IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that both secretion of reactive oxygen species and lysosome deposition are involved in the killing. To further assess what signaling cascade is induced by IgM-IC, we tested the levels of major inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylated enzymes. Activation with IgG-IC induced classical singling through Fcγ receptors, characterized by high levels of TNFα and IL12, and activation of enzymes in the MAP kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). The phenotype of IgM-IC activated MoDC was more complicated and characterized by low levels of TNFα and high IL-12, suggesting that Akt was only partially phosphorylated. Flow cytometric analysis indicated only neglectable levels of Akt phosphorylation, while ERK and p38 phosphorylation was comparable to that induced by IgG-IC along with higher levels of phospho-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). This somewhat unique signaling cascade most likely indicates a combination of several signaling chains recruited by IgM, including Fcγ and C1q receptors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IgM-induced signaling elicits cytotoxic response in macrophages and can be integrated to a CAR design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of experimental setting.

The scFv, consisting of Variable light (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) chains was attached to a spacer region of Constant Heavy subunits 1–3 (CH<sub>1-3</sub>). These subunits were fused to several potential IgM signaling chains in the transmembrane and intracellular regions and fused to a fluorescence tag to aid detection of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Next, we transfected HEK 293 FT cells with the CAR constructs to test their expressions and cellular localization using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Indeed, all constructs were expressed on cell membrane within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>scFv is not expressed by myeloid cells</title><p>Next, we sought to test the construct’s expressions and functionality in myeloid cells.

Since myeloid cells were reported to express TRM21 E3 ligases that bind C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 fragments of internalized IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mallery et al., 2010</xref>), we next generated a CAR construct with a minimal spacer region by elimination of Constant Heavy domain 1 and 2 (C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2) and tested the expression of these constructs in DC2.4 cell line. However, consistent with our previous results, we were unable to detect any protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–1C</xref>). We then removed the rest of the spacers, generating a construct consisting only of the scFv region and an intracellular signaling domain. As with our previous finding, no expression in myeloid cell lines was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). Similarly, removal of the intracellular portion did not alter the expression patterns of TA99-derived scFv, suggesting that the scFv domains may be the element that prevents its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). To verify that these expression patterns do not stem from the use of mCherry, we have also fused these constructs to GFP. Nonetheless, in both cases, the presence of scFv prevented protein expression in macrophages and DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To test if this phenomenon is restricted to TA99 CAR or reflects a broader phenomenon, we sought to compare TA99 CAR to a well-established αCD19-derived scFv. Towards this end, we generated a plasmid that contains the CD8 signal peptide followed by αCD19-derived scFv and fused to CD8 spacer and transmembrane portion, and an identical one that lacks the scFv part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Interestingly, while we detected low levels of αCD19-derived scFv, they were localized in intracellular compartments and not on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Removal of scFv domain enabled expression of the inserted protein in the Golgi and cell membrane of both macrophages and DC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Both VH and VL domains prevent the expression of scFv in myeloid cells</title><p>We next aimed to test which portion of scFv prevents its membranal expression.

Next, we generated plasmids consisting of minimal subunits, consisting of only the variable light or variable heavy domains of TA99 and αCD19.

To this end, we inserted point mutations that switched cysteine amino acids to glycine, creating a linear protein by preventing disulfide bonds. Interestingly, linearization of αCD19 variable light chain (or heavy chain) had only a marginal effect on its expression patterns and resulted in reduced and compartmentalized expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). In addition, we generated a plasmid that consisted of the first and last 15 amino acids of variable light chain which includes the cysteine amino acids for disulfide bond formation. This fragment was almost inert, and its expression patterns were comparable to that of GFP only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also tested whether specific fragments within the variable light chain sequence prevented its expression. Dividing the light chains of αCD19 scFv into three sequences resulted in a high expression in myeloid cells, albeit tending to induce different expression patterns of cellular compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Taken jointly, our results suggest that the linear form of either the variable light or the heavy chain of antibodies results in a poor and compartmentalized protein expression compared to the full length of ScFv to a lesser extent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>scFv induce ER stress in myeloid cells</title><p>To elucidate the level at which scFv constructs are silenced, we sought to transfect cells of myeloid lineage with mRNA composed of αCD19 scFv fused to a green fluorescent protein tag.

Hence, we generated plasmids containing GFP fluorescence tag followed by T2A skipping peptide, succeeded with TA99 scFv fused to mCherry, all in one reading frame. This design allowed us to test if the GFP and scFv expression are coupled, thus indicating that the regulation is made on the mRNA transcript and prior to protein translation. Alternatively, expression of one fluorescent tag would indicate that the regulation is made at the protein level following translation. While we detected both tags (GFP, mCherry) in HEK293 cells, only GFP was expressed in myeloid cells, but not the mCherry which was fused to scFv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Eliminating the T2A skipping peptide from this construct, generating a plasmid containing GFP tag fused to TA99 scFv succeeded by mCherry, resulted in abrogated and reduced expression levels of both fluorescent tags in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results therefore suggest that scFv expression is regulated on the protein level.</p><p>Consistent with this notion, we found that scFv is expressed in myeloid cell at earlier time points, starting at four hours post-transfection and peaking at about 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In order to determine the mechanism through which scFv is degraded, we next performed proteomics of immunoprecipitated scFv. Hence, macrophages were transfected with GFP only, or GFP fused to αCD19 scFv. After 6 hr, GFP-expressing cells were sorted and lysed, and associated proteins were pulled down using anti-GFP conjugated beads. Eluted proteins were then sent to analyses by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Analysis of protein interactors with scFv in myeloid cells indicated that scFv fraction was statistically enriched with proteins associated with ER stress that could promote scFv degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To further corroborate that possibility, we assessed the co-localization of scFv with key proteins in this pathway. Confocal microscopy corroborated that the majority of αCD19 scFv were localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and co-localized with BIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which are master regulators of ER stress. Lastly, flow cytometric analysis indicated higher levels of phospho-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Next, we tested if TCR fragments, which have been shown to induce ER stress in cells lacking the corresponding chaperons for their folding, will be expressed in myeloid cells. Consistent with this notion, we could not detect expression of alpha chain from TRP1-reactive TCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dougan et al., 2013</xref> following transfection of RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Lastly, we assessed whether scFv fragments are presented on MHC-I and MHC-II. To this end, we transfected Raw 265.7 cells with MHC-I peptide OVA<sub>257-264</sub> followed by MHC-II OVA<sub>323-339</sub> peptide alone or fused to the C-terminal of αCD19 scFv. After 16 hr, we incubated T cells from OT-I and OT-II mice and tested their rates of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To quantify the killing capacity of this construct, we next transfected RAW264.7 macrophages with mRNA which encode these modified receptors, and incubated them with fluorescently labeled HER2<sup>+</sup> expressing 4T1 tumor cells under IncuCyte. Consistent with GrB polarization, transfected macrophages alone were almost completely inert whereas the addition of <italic>trastuzumab</italic> promoted tumor cell killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Importantly, while killing rates of macrophages expressing C5aR chimeric receptor were higher, they were also induced by free and irrelevant antibody (e.g. rituximab; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p>To assess the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the transfected RAW264.7 cells under high-resolution microscopy.

Incubation with plastic-immobilized <italic>trastuzumab</italic> resulted in polarization of the alpha chain toward the plastic and co-localization with the gamma chain. The architecture of C5aR chimeric receptor completely abrogated the membrane organization of the signaling chains, as the two co-localized even under steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then speculated that the fusion of such signaling chain to the alpha chain could mitigate the effects of tonic signaling by attaching IgM receptor signaling chain, instead of the gamma chain, to the transmembrane domain (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Indeed, this architecture can be highly expressed in macrophage membrane and did not recruit or abrogate the gamma chain upon addition of antibodies, while maintaining alpha chain clustering to immobilized <italic>trastuzumab</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–1F</xref>).

Lastly, we tested whether myeloid cells expressing modified FcγRI can affect tumor growth in vivo. To this end, mice were challenged with B16F10 tumor cells and to grow for 8 days until they reached an average size of 20 mm<sup>2</sup>. Next, mRNA transfect BMDC were injected s.c. once a week alone or in combination with i.p. injections of TA99 antibody against the melanoma antigen TRP1. Indeed, significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice treated with modified FcγRI and TA99, but not with sham transfected BMDC or without TA99 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H–1I</xref>).

The inherent plasticity of these cells, however, enables them to change their phenotype upon injection of adjuvant or immune-stimulatory agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quatromoni and Eruslanov, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ricketts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bercovici et al., 2019</xref>). Countless experimental and clinical data have been tested for their capacity to convert tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells phenotype to an anti-tumor, including TLR agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dudek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodell et al., 2018</xref>), immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>), immune checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlauckas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>) and co-stimulatory antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beatty et al., 2011</xref>). While they showed improved T cell infiltration and overall lower tumor burden, they did not meet the expectations. It is noteworthy that most of these attempts are based on the notion that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are the main effector arm against cancer and that the purpose of myeloid cell activation is to support T cell-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ricketts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bercovici et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, myeloid cells are highly equipped with cell-killing mechanisms, including antibody-medicated cellular toxicity (ADCC) and secretion of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mantovani et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that activating the IgM-receptor signaling in myeloid cells using tumor-binding IgG induces oxidative burst, Granzyme release, and massive tumor cell lysis.</p><p>While genetic engineering of immune cells to treat cancer has proven to be successful in lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross and Eshhar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalos et al., 2011</xref>), cells of the myeloid lineage resist gene modification. Noteworthily, these cells are traditionally thought to be programmed to respond to foreign genetic materials. Early attempts to overcome this inherent barrier were achieved by Biglari et al. using adenoviral vectors. They demonstrated that the fusion of scFv against CEA to FcγR can be expressed in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biglari et al., 2006</xref>). Although this construct leads to granzyme release in T cells, its function in monocytes remains obscure. Further attempts to equip macrophages with specific tumor antigen recognition were done by Morrissey et al. They fused scFv derived from αCD19 antibody to different signaling chains that facilitate phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrissey et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, most of these receptors do not appear to be expressed on the cell membrane. Moreover, CAR-merTK, which appears on the cell membrane, was functionally inert and did not induce phagocytosis.</p><p>Recently, Klichinsky et al. have also attempted to genetically modify macrophages using an adenoviral vector expressing αCD19 and αHER2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor fused to CD3ζ − CD28 signaling domains. They suggested that this strategy can be applied to kill HER2-expressing tumor cells through phagocytosis. While the authors demonstrated expression by flow cytometry, they did not attempt to identify the membranous localization in macrophages. It may also be that the use of Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as transduction vectors enable overcoming the inflammatory cascade induced in myeloid cells as a result of liposome-based transfection or lentiviral transduction, thus enabling expression. With that being said, the authors concluded that the improved survival induced in mice was due to M1-like phenotype induced in transduced macrophages by the virus, rather than the CAR construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klichinsky et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Why scFv induces ER stress specifically in myeloid cells remains unclear. Activation of ER stress by misfolded proteins in macrophages plays a dominant role in many human pathologies, yet it also occurs in other cell types. One possible explanation is that these cells lack the machinery needed for successful folding of antibody-like structures. Along these lines, many non-immune cells such as HeLa or HEK293 cells initiate ER-stress response upon transfection of fragments derived from immune-associated receptors such as the alpha chain of the T cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oslowski and Urano, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Overall, while we identify FcγRI as a possible construct that could endow myeloid cells with tumor-specific recognition abilities, the main goal of the present work is to highlight the unique challenges and considerations that are involved in genetically reprogramming the signaling in myeloid cells. We demonstrate that myeloid cells cannot express scFv, most likely since they lack the corresponding chaperons required for its folding. Yet, more work is needed before this could be promoted as an efficient therapy for solid tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Envigo (Jerusalem, Israel). 129S1 mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J OT-I mice were kindly gifted from Prof. Carmit Levy, Tel Aviv University, CD45.1 congenic mice were kindly gifted from Prof. Adi Barezel, Tel Aviv University, and B6.Cg-Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J OT-II mice were generously gifted from Prof. Jakub Abramson, Weizmann Institute, and were housed and maintained in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions animal facility in Tel-Aviv University according to the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal.

is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Farhat-Younis and colleagues demonstrate tumor-specific IgM's capacity to induce tumor cell death in monocyte-derived dendritic cell cultures. They subsequently designed a chimeric receptor based on high-affinity FcgRI. However, the authors found that the transfection process was more efficient when either the variable light or heavy chain was transfected individually rather than the entire scFv. This scFv construct led to an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and scFv degradation. A considerable portion of the manuscript is dedicated to the negative scFv expression results. The authors pivoted to a modified FcgRI capable of transmitting IgM signals. This represents a tremendous amount of work in the development of this chimeric receptor, the critical experiment showing efficacy in vivo was not presented, and instead various in vitro assays are shown. Thus, this manuscript will markedly benefit from showing improved responses to tumors in vivo when macrophages express FcgRI-IgM.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply thank the reviewer for his thoughtful comments and overall favorable review of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In a mouse tumor model, the authors demonstrated that monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) treated with IgG immune complexes (ICs) were more effective at preventing tumor growth compared to those treated with IgM ICs (as shown in Figure 1B). In Figure 1C, their in vitro experiments revealed that IgM resulted in tumor cell death, as well as increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and granzyme B. How do the authors reconcile IgG IC-treated MoDCs performing better in preventing tumors in vivo than IgM IC-treated MoDCs, despite the in vitro results with IgM-ICs. The authors speculate that IgG IC-treated MoDCs might trigger T cell immunity but do not show T cell involvement.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making this point clearer. We have extensively studied this phenomenon and published two papers that detailed the underlying mechanism in two consecutive papers (PMID: 27812544, PMID: 25924063). Briefly, we showed that DC activated with IgM-IC DC undergo cell death concomitantly to their release of lytic granules and lysis of tumor cells. As a result, they do not migrate to the lymph nodes where they should induce reactive T cell clones. In contrast, DC activated with IgG-IC do not elicit in vitro cytotoxicity but rather process the IC to present its derived antigens of MHC-II. We addressed that issue in the revised version and cited the relevant paper to further clarify it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors report distinct functional consequences of MoDCs incubated with tumor-IgG complexes and tumor IgM complexes. Tumor growth was inhibited and T cell immunity induced with the former. The latter, however, elicited robust anti-tumor killing. What happens if MoDCs are incubated with both IgG and IgM complexes? If this combined treatment induces effective killing and T cell memory, would this impact the design of the chimeric receptor to include IgG responsiveness as well?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. As mentioned above, our previous publications strongly suggest that tumor binding IgG and IgM induce different processes in myeloid cells. Yet, since MoDC naturally express the high affinity receptors for IgG FcgRI, we speculate that treating tumor-bearing mice modified monocyte, alone or in combination with tumor-binding IgG, would shed some light into that. Indeed, such treatment elicit a strong T cell immunity in these mice and the data was added to Supplementary Data Figure S4J. With that being said, a complete analysis of this question is very complicated and extent beyond the scope of this work. We would like to emphasize that the purpose of this work is to highlight some of the challenges unique to genetic manipulation in myeloid cells and to suggest one alternative scaffold for integrating signaling in these cells. We do not argue that the specific solution presented here is the most potent one and more work is required before promoting such treatment into the clinic. We have added a sentence to the Discussion section that stress that issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 5H, the authors demonstrate the ability of the chimeric receptor construct to deplete tumor cells in vitro. The ms would improve if the authors could show the chimeric receptor construct results in tumor cell death and/or prevention in an in vivo model. Similarly, if combined stimulation with IgG and IgM complexes enhances tumor response, this should be incorporated into the therapeutic strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a wonderful suggestion. To address that, we challenged C57Bl/6 mice with B16F10 melanoma and allowed them to grow until it reached a palpable size of approximately 25 mm2. Concomitantly, we cultured bone marrow dendritic cells from syngeneic mice and transfected them with a linear mRNA of the alpha/mu construct. Tumor bearing mice were then treated with alpha/mu and sham transduced BMDC alone, or in combination with antibody against the melanoma antigen Trp1 (TA99). The results were added as Figure 5K and to Supplementary Figure S4h-S4I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>While a significant portion of immunotherapy research has focused on the pivotal role of T cells in tumor immunity, their effectiveness may be limited by the suppressive nature of the tumor environment.

Addressing this issue would support the notion that these cells lack the ER chaperones required for folding immunoglobulin variable chains.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a wonderful suggestion. To assess that possibility, we cloned the alpha chain of anti-Trp1 TCR and transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages. Importantly, we could not detect expression on this construct in macrophages, further supporting our findings with scFv in these cells. We added this result to Figure 4J and Supplementary Figure S3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be valuable to determine whether, after the degradation of scFv fragments by myeloid cells, they are presented on MHC-I and MHC-II.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. To address that, we generated a genetic construct where we fused the anti-CD19 scFv to a polypeptide composed from the MHCI and the MHCII fragments of Ova Albumin. Next, DC 2.4 were transfected with this construct and measured their capacity to stimulate the proliferation of CD8+ T cells from OT-I and CD4+ from OT-II mice. DC transfected with this construct efficiently stimulated the proliferation of both T cells, suggesting that both Ova fragments are indeed presented on MHCI and MHCII. Nonehteless, DC transfected with polypeptide of MHCI and MHCII fragments of Ova Albumin only (with no scFv), were almost equally effective in stimulating OT-I and OT-II T cell proliferation. We added that result to Supplementary Figure S3D-S3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some methodological details, such as the vaccination protocol and high-resolution microscopy procedures, are missing from the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these issues. We added the missing details to the revised version of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
