Here we provide evidence that co-occurrence of mutations in these two genes is deleterious. In transgenic mice programmed to express both mutant oncogenes in the lung epithelium, the resulting tumors express only one oncogene. We also show that forced expression of a second oncogene in human cancer cell lines with an endogenous mutated oncogene is deleterious. The most prominent features accompanying loss of cell viability were vacuolization, other changes in cell morphology, and increased macropinocytosis. Activation of ERK, p38 and JNK in the dying cells suggests that an overly active MAPK signaling pathway may mediate the phenotype. Together, our findings indicate that mutual exclusivity of oncogenic mutations may reveal unexpected vulnerabilities and therapeutic possibilities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06907.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06907.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06907.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A person develops cancer when changes in a cell's DNA (called mutations) allow the cell to grow rapidly and spread around the body.

These efforts have revealed mutations in well-known tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes; in genes with normal functions not previously associated with neoplasia (such as RNA splicing and chromatin modification); and in genes unlikely to have any role in carcinogenesis (putative ‘passenger mutations’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoadley et al., 2014</xref>). In several tumor types, genomic studies have revealed alterations in specific genes or signaling pathways that are highly associated with tumor origins, such as mutations affecting HIF-1 signaling in renal clear cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013</xref>), in the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>), and, more broadly, in the growth factor receptor-RAS-PIK3CA or–AKT pathways in a variety of cancers including lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>). These studies have been vital for understanding the genetic mechanisms driving tumorigenesis and revealing new targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>However, these initial analyses are just beginning to explore more complex issues such as the co-incidences and temporal sequences of mutations, which may reveal processes driving tumor evolution and influence new strategies for targeted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). For example, numerous investigators have noted the apparent ‘mutual exclusivity’ of oncogenic alleles of well-known proto-oncogenes in certain types of cancer, but, aside from a few instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sensi et al., 2006</xref>), without experimentally verified explanations.</p><p>One of the first and most apparent of these mutually exclusive mutational combinations involves two well-studied proto-oncogenes, <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic>, in human lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). This finding is especially provocative because of the frequencies of mutant alleles of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> occurring separately in LUAD: ∼30% for <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations and ∼15% for <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>). The explanation generally provided for the mutual exclusivity is that the products of these two loci operate in the same or overlapping signaling pathways and hence are functionally redundant. However, this idea has not been experimentally tested, and there is reason to question its validity. For example, since they are differently positioned in a signaling network (EGFR senses and transmits external signals from the cell membrane; RAS serves as a cytosolic node), the consequences of the mutations would not be expected to be identical. Hence mutations in both genes might be expected to offer a selective advantage over a mutation in just one of them. Furthermore, and tellingly, KRAS mutations are rarely, if ever, encountered in mutant EGFR-driven tumors that become resistant to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), when a ‘downstream’ mutation in <italic>KRAS</italic> would be expected to provide a strong selective advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One way to reconcile these observations is to propose that oncogenic mutation of both of these genes in the same cell confers an unexpected inhibitory phenotype, such as synthetic lethality, that is selected against during tumor development. In this study, we aimed to determine whether an inhibitory phenotype can account for the mutual exclusivity of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations in LUAD and to characterize the specific cellular effects that result from co-expression of both mutant alleles in lung cancer cells. Through analysis of available sequences of human tumor samples, generation of transgenic mouse models that express mutant KRAS and EGFR in the lung epithelium, and functional tests of these mutant genes in cultured tumor cells, we conclude that synthetic lethality is responsible for the mutually exclusive nature of activating mutations in these genes. We propose that this type of gene interaction may reveal vulnerabilities in lung and other cancers that suggest novel therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EGFR and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive in lung adenocarcinoma</title><p>Although oncogenic mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> occur in a significant fraction of human LUAD, they are rarely—if ever—observed together in the same tumor. Since these two genes are in the same pathway and activate similar downstream targets, it is generally assumed that there is no selective pressure to favor cells with both mutations over cells with a mutation in one of them. If complete functional redundancy explains the mutual exclusivity of these mutations, assessing a large panel of samples might reveal tumors with both genes mutated. To this end, we reviewed published somatic mutation data for <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> from 662 LUAD that were profiled as part of four separate studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imielinski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>). We excluded data from studies that profiled only specific exons or mutation hotspots in these two genes, as restricted sequencing might not detect recently characterized oncogenic mutations such as those in exon 20 of <italic>EGFR</italic> and codon 61 of <italic>KRAS</italic> or changes in codons not associated with gene activation. In total, 186 (28.2%) and 110 (16.6%) tumors had somatic mutations that changed the amino acid sequences (non-silent mutations) of KRAS and EGFR proteins, respectively—frequencies similar to those previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heist and Engelman, 2012</xref>). Moreover, all mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> and 93.6% of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations were identified as oncogenic (see ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Attempts to estimate the expected frequency of finding coincident mutations in any two genes in a tumor cell population are influenced by a variety of potentially confounding factors, such as the size and transcriptional activity of the genes; mutation rates for cells in the tumor lineage and for individual genes; the point in the evolution of a tumor when a mutation occurs (since that will affect the percentage of cells containing the mutant allele); and the selective advantage or disadvantage of the mutation for the growth and survival of the cell in which it occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2014</xref>). These factors make predictions complex. In the simplest terms, if we define mutations in these genes as independent events with similar selective advantage that occur at a specific frequency across the population of tumors—and assume that they are not influenced by the factors stated above—the expected co-incidence of the mutations can be derived from a simple calculation (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A). On these terms, we would anticipate that that approximately 31 tumors in the cohort presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> would contain mutations in both genes. However, we observed only a single tumor in which this was the case; moreover, the EGFR mutation (R574L) in this tumor (which also harbored a KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> mutation) has not been previously identified as oncogenic, lies outside the kinase domain and hence is unlikely to be activating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A left-tailed 2X2 Fisher's Exact Test indicates a significant negative association between the mutations (p = 8.62e<sup>−17</sup>), confirming the mutually exclusive nature of these mutant alleles. Furthermore, even when analyzing tumors from smokers and never-smokers separately—which are known to have different frequencies of mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic>—a statistically significant negative association between the co-occurrence of mutations in these genes was still observed (p = 4.43e<sup>−10</sup> and p = 0.002, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our failure to identify any tumors with co-existing oncogenic mutations of these two genes in this combined data set strengthened the possibility that the observed mutual exclusivity might imply more than functional redundancy—for example, a toxic effect of co-existing oncogenic mutations.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06907.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutations in KRAS and EGFR in lung adenocarcinoma are mutually exclusive.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coincidence of <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in 662 lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD).

To do this, we devised a method that explores whole-exome DNA sequencing data on a global scale. Tumors were stratified based on the somatic mutation status of a known proto-oncogene (e.g., <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic>, as well as other genes). The number of tumors containing mutations in both the specified proto-oncogene and every other gene in the genome was then calculated on a gene-by-gene basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–H</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of selective pressures resulting from a second mutation, it would be anticipated that the more times a gene is mutated in the sample set, the more often it should co-occur in a tumor with a mutation in the proto-oncogene. Plotting these values on the y-axis against the total number of tumors with a mutation in those second genes on the x-axis would be expected to reveal a linear relationship. However, if selective pressures are involved, so that dual mutation enhances or restricts cell growth or survival, the value for a given gene will fall either above or below this line. If the additive effect confers a selective advantage, and a mutation of the second gene occurs more frequently in combination with the mutant proto-oncogene than expected, the result is displayed as a red dot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see legend for details). If a mutation in the second gene occurs less frequently than expected in combination with the mutant proto-oncogene, it is presumed to provide a selective disadvantage and the result is shown as a green dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>From these so-called ‘exclusivity plots’, left and right 2 × 2 Fisher's Exact Tests can be performed between mutations in each gene and the proto-oncogene to confirm the degree of enhanced or diminished co-occurrence and, correspondingly, the potential degree of positive and negative selection conferred by the combinations. However, the confidence in any selective effect, reflected by a low p-value, should not be confused with the strength of the effect, since the number of mutations will influence the p-value. Therefore, since the numbers of mutations for the great majority of genes are relatively small in our data sets, we can place only a modest degree of confidence on the selective effects. However, in some cases, for example, TP53 plus KRAS mutations, there may be a highly significant but still relatively minor deviation from expected rates of co-occurrence. The deviations of greatest interest are therefore caused by those combinations of mutations, such as KRAS plus EGFR, that produce a major deviation from expectation at a high level of confidence because both genes are frequently mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>; discussed further in ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>To test the validity of this approach, we first assessed the frequency of synonymous mutations in many genes and their co-occurrence with non-silent mutations in KRAS—non-synonymous point mutations and small insertions and deletions—in LUAD. (Details of the analysis are provided in ‘Materials and methods’.) Synonymous mutations—point mutations that do not change the amino acid sequence of a protein, also referred to here as ‘silent’ mutations—should be neutral (i.e., offer no selective advantage or disadvantage). Thus the more frequently a given gene contains a silent mutation, the more frequently such mutations should co-occur with a <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation, so that the number of co-mutations should increase in a linear fashion as described above.</p><p>To test these possibilities, we used whole-exome sequence data from an expanded set of 520 LUAD profiled as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) initiative (including 229 that were used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of these tumors, 145 had a somatic, non-silent mutation in <italic>KRAS</italic>. Silent mutations in any other gene co-occurred with a <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation as expected based on their respective frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For example, <italic>TTN</italic>, one of the largest genes in the genome, is known to have a very high mutation rate in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>). This gene incurred frequent silent mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (indicated by a yellow dot) that overlapped with mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic>, much as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>When this analysis was repeated, however, with non-silent mutations in genes, numerous statistically significant outliers were uncovered. For these genes, the number of mutations co-occurred more frequently or less than expected in concert with non-silent mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). <italic>EGFR</italic> is the gene with a co-mutation rate most significantly different from the expected number, demonstrating a negative association with mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>. Likewise, when this analysis was reversed by stratifying samples based on non-silent <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations (n = 67), <italic>KRAS</italic> is the only major outlier, demonstrating a similar negative association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The apparently negative association of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations is not a general phenomenon among known lung cancer proto-oncogenes. For example, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations co-occurred as frequently as anticipated with either <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations (as indicated by the yellow dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

Numerous genes that showed a similar frequency of non-silent mutations as <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> among the 520 samples co-occurred with mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic>, within the range expected by chance in the absence of selective pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This indicates that potential confounding factors, such as mutation rates and sensitivities of sequencing methods, are unlikely to be responsible for the data implying the exclusivity of mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic>; a more general skewing of the data would be anticipated if this was the case. Furthermore, although one tumor contained mutations in both <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic>, the <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation, D33E, is not known to be activating. (Note that the tumor with KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and EGFR<sup>R574L</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> was not part of this expanded dataset.)

Furthermore, in other tri-transgenic mice carrying the same <italic>CCSP-rtTA</italic> transgene, most if not all tumors expressing the oncogenic <italic>TetO-EGFR</italic><sup><italic>L858R</italic></sup> transgene also expressed a <italic>TetO-Cre</italic> transgene, as judged by elimination of a floxed <italic>Erbb3</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that our observations here reflect the incompatibility of mutant Kras and EGFR and not an inability to express both doxycycline-dependent transgenes.</p><p>Since <italic>TetO-Kras</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> is the more potent oncogenic transgene in our mouse model, we supposed that if only one oncogenic transgene were expressed it would be the <italic>Kras</italic> transgene.

Expanding the use of the qRT-PCR assay to examine over 90 tumor nodules from 14 mice, 8 of which were tri-transgenics, confirmed that tumors from tri-transgenic mice almost always contained RNA from a single transgenic oncogene, either <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>Kras</italic>, and the amounts of RNA were similar to those found in tumors from the bi-transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Furthermore, there were animals in which a different transgene, <italic>Kras</italic> or <italic>EGFR,</italic> was expressed in individual tumor nodules (e.g., mouse number 798), implying that tumors from mice carrying oncogenic alleles of both <italic>Kras</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> have evolved by selecting against cells that express both mutant transgenes, further suggesting that expression of both these genes is detrimental.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, some tumor nodules appear to contain both <italic>Kras</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> transgenic RNAs, but we could not determine unequivocally whether this means that a few tumors expressed both oncogenes or that multiple tumors may have grown too closely together to separate during macrodissection. To address the latter possibility, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to ask whether <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>Kras</italic> transgenes are expressed in the same cells by assessing levels of human EGFR and by measuring phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) as readout of MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling. This analysis, however, cannot definitely address co-expression as the intensity of p-ERK signaling may be enhanced by induction of either transgene alone.

We observed a similar pattern for phospho-ERK (p44/42) and phospho-p38, the latter not being associated with normal EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The most consistent change in both cell lines was the phosphorylation of JNK, a stress-activated kinase. The activation of JNK can occur through the Rho family of GTPases, and the Rho protein family has also been implicated in RAS-dependent increases in macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhanot et al., 2010</xref>). The kinase that phosphorylates both JNK and p38, MKK4, has been shown to be activated by the small molecule vacquinol-1, an inducer of macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitambi et al., 2014</xref>); this is discussed further below.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest a general mechanism that is similar to the collective observations of other groups: increased activity of p38 and JNK MAPK pathways, increased macropinocytosis, and vacuolization lead to cell death.

Because multiple rounds of mutation are followed by clonal selection during tumor evolution, selection against cells with lethal combinations of mutations will produce mutual exclusivity. This general concept could have important implications for the design of therapeutic strategies, as well as tumor evolution. Recent efforts to design new treatments have focused on mutant genes that, when inhibited, decrease the viability of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sawyers, 2009</xref>). In contrast, combinations of mutations that are not found in tumor types may suggest synthetically lethal effects that could be exploited therapeutically—for instance, by using signaling agonists to provoke events that are lethal only in the presence of another mutant oncogene.</p><p>In this study, we focused on one synthetically lethal relationship—oncogenic mutations of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> in LUAD. We have used three approaches to ascertain the relationship.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i. First, by analyzing available DNA sequences from large numbers of LUAD, we confirmed that activating mutations in these two genes are mutually exclusive, regardless of the smoking history of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we found that this kind of relationship is rare. No other mutated pairs of genes demonstrated a similarly negative association in lung adenocarcinoma, further arguing that the mutual exclusivity of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations is due to negative selection. By applying the same ‘exclusivity analysis’ to mutation data from other tumor types, however, we identified or confirmed other pairs of mutations—mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> in COAD, mutant <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> in GBM, and mutant <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> in SKCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sensi et al., 2006</xref>)—that may be synthetically lethal in those tumors. Additionally, this analysis confirms previous co-operative mutations (e.g., <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>LKB1</italic>) and reveals potentially new, testable gene pairs that are selected for during tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, we note that this analysis was confined to alleles with altered sequences in coding domains and did not include gene rearrangements and amplifications. Thus we cannot draw conclusions about whether certain kinds of combinations, such as amplification of one proto-oncogene and sequence mutation of another, create synthetic lethalities. Moreover, the data sets we examined were derived by profiling cancers from patients who had not received medical treatment; hence the relationship of drugs or drug resistance to synthetic lethality has not been examined, and we would not have detected the recently reported amplification of wild type <italic>KRAS</italic> in a COAD with a mutant <italic>BRAF</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahronian et al., 2015</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>ii. Second, we obtained strong support for the concept of synthetic lethality of mutant KRAS and EGFF proteins in LUAD by attempting to co-express doxycycline-inducible transgenes encoding the two proteins in mouse models. Although each oncogenic transgene could initiate lung tumorigenesis on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fisher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Politi et al., 2006</xref>), if both were present in the same mouse, the resulting tumor nodules expressed only one of the two transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); this implies selection against cells that maintain expression of both.</p></list-item><list-item><p>iii. Finally, to observe the proposed synthetic lethality more directly, we engineered an inducible second oncogene into human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines carrying a mutant <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 3–6</xref>). We found that expression of the introduced second oncogene was detrimental in cells expressing both oncogenes.</p></list-item></list></p><p>By taking advantage of cell lines that can be induced to express the second oncogene in a lethal combination, we have been able to study the manner and mechanisms of cell death in this context. We were motivated to pursue these issues to seek insight into the factors governing the synthetic lethality of mutant EGFR and KRAS and to identify opportunities to exploit this knowledge for therapeutic benefit. We found that the expression of both oncogenes caused the death of lung cancer cells within a week, mostly in a non-canonical manner. While we observed some markers of classical apoptosis and autophagy and small changes in cell cycle distribution in one line, the dominant features were cell enlargement and vacuolization, activation of stress-associated protein kinases (as judged by phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK), and increased macropinocytosis, with a subsequent loss of cell viability.</p><p>Macropinocytosis and vacuolization have been observed previously in cells with augmented RAS signaling, nutrient acquisition, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Overmeyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>), although not as an explanation of synthetic lethality caused by multiple oncogenes. Expression of H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> in glioblastoma and gastric cancer cell lines generates vacuoles associated with increased cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chi et al., 1999</xref>), a phenomenon dubbed ‘methuosis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maltese and Overmeyer, 2014</xref>). These findings were subsequently linked to induction of uncontrolled macropinocytosis though activation of the Rac1 GTP-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhanot et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, a small molecule screen for inhibitors of glioblastoma cell lines identified a quinine derivative (vacquinol-1) that induced cell vacuoles, membrane ruffling, and increased macropinocytosis, similar to the effects of RAS activation alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitambi et al., 2014</xref>). This process was found to be dependent on MKK4, part of the MAP2K family, that can phosphorylate both p38 and JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitambi et al., 2014</xref>). As Rac1 is known to activate both p38 and JNK kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coso et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minden et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olson et al., 1995</xref>) these findings imply the existence of a common mechanism whereby RAS-mediated activation of Rac1 stimulates p38 and JNK, prompting uncontrolled macropinocytosis, vacuolization, and subsequent cell death. Despite these supportive studies, however, the findings that implicate JNK and p38 pathways in the mechanism of synthetic lethality induced by mutant KRAS and EGFR co-expression are only correlative at this point. Additional studies will be needed to determine whether activation of one or both of these pathways is required for cell death and whether it causes or results from macropinocytosis and vacuolization.</p><p>Parts of this scenario, however, may not always be detrimental. Commisso et al. have shown that KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induces macropinocytosis unaccompanied by vacuolization and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that macropinocytosis may augment amino acid uptake, as required by cells growing rapidly under the influence of RAS signaling. In the context of active EGFR and KRAS, it is possible that both mutant alleles together increase RAS-MAPK-mediated signaling beyond a tolerable threshold, resulting in increased activation of Rac1 and subsequent stimulation of p38 and JNK, kinases that are not typically activated to high levels by mutant KRAS or EGFR alone. Indeed, our data demonstrate increased activation of KRAS signaling and activation of stress kinases p38 and JNK upon co-induction of mutant KRAS and EGFR. Furthermore, these signaling events may be accompanied by, uncontrolled macropinocytosis, resulting in the accumulation of macropinosomes in the cytosol that overwhelm the capacity of the cells to adapt to the presence of large vacuoles. Thus, unlike a situation in which macropinocytosis favors cell survival, this would result in cell death. Future work will be required to determine the biochemical details of this process, such as the role of Rac1, and to test whether the observed mutual exclusivity of other combinations of mutant genes in other tumor types are attributable to such mechanisms.</p><p>Our findings also have potential implications for understanding mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in lung adenocarcinoma. While inhibitors of EGFR have produced dramatic responses when used to treat EGFR-mutant tumors, acquired resistance to these compounds inevitably emerges (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong and Janne, 2013</xref>]). Tumor cells acquire resistance to these compounds through multiple mechanisms, including a second-site mutation (T790M) in <italic>EGFR</italic>, amplification of <italic>MET</italic> or <italic>ERBB2,</italic> and conversion to a small cell lung cancer phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings and those from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sharifnia et al., 2014</xref>) demonstrate that mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> can also confer resistance to TKIs in <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cell lines. Yet mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> have not been found to explain acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Synthetic lethality could explain this observation. Acquired resistance is generally caused by the selection of a minor clone initially present in a heterogenous tumor, in which the resistance mutation exists in a subset of cells prior to TKI treatment. However, if expression of both mutant <italic>EGFR</italic> and mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> is detrimental, co-mutated cells are unlikely to survive during tumor evolution; therefore, they are unlikely to explain TKI resistance in an <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant tumor.</p><p>Taken together, our findings offer convincing evidence that the mutual exclusivity of mutant KRAS and EGFR in lung adenocarcinoma is dictated by synthetic lethality. These findings may have major implications for the future development of new agonistic treatment strategies for a substantial fraction of lung cancers driven by mutant KRAS or EGFR.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequence data and exclusivity analyses</title><p>To investigate the association between KRAS and EGFR mutations in human LUAD, sequence data was obtained from four different sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imielinski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>).

The resulting values for each gene (the number of samples with mutations in a gene and the proto-oncogene, number of samples with mutation in the gene and not the proto-oncogene, number of samples without mutations in the gene and with mutation in proto-oncogene, and number of samples without mutation in either) were then compared using the Fisher's Exact Test function in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).

Both polyclonal cell lines and single cell-derived clonal cell lines were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protein extractions and western blots</title><p>Cells were lysed in buffer (9803, Cell Signaling) containing complete protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (78410, Life Technologies). Lysates were sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentration determined by BCA protein assay kit (Life Technologies). Samples were denatured by boiling in loading buffer (7722, Cell Signaling). 30 μg of lysates were loaded on 4–20% Novex tris-glycine gels (Life Technologies), transferred to Immobilon (PVDF) membranes (EMD Millipore), blocked in TBST (0.1% Tween-20) and 5% milk. Primary incubation with antibodies was overnight at 4°, followed by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and detected using ECL plus (32132, Life Technologies) or Femto chemiluminescent substrate (34096, Life Technologies). Antibodies used were obtained from Cell Signaling and raised against the following proteins: phospho p-38 (4511), p38 (8690), p-p44/p42 (4370), p44/p42 MAPK (4695), p-SAPK/JNK (4668), SAPK/JNK (9258), p-EGFR (2234), EGFR (2232), LC3A (4599), p-Akt (13038), Akt (9272), PARP (9542), GAPDH (2118). Additionally, we used antibodies against KRAS (F234, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and GFP (A-21311, Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Tests for cell viability</title><p>To determine the number of viable cells over a 7-day time course, cells were seeded in triplicate in 6-well plates at 20,000 cells/well (PC9 derivatives) or 40,000 cells/well (H358 derivatives). Cells were seeded into doxycycline (100 ng/ml) and/or erlotinib (1 μM). Media (with or without doxycycline or erlotinib) were not replenished during the 7 days. At indicated time points, media was aspirated and replaced with media containing Alamar Blue (Life Technologies). Fluorescence intensities from each well were read in quadruplicate on a FluoStar Optima instrument (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC) and data plotted in Prism (GraphPad). Cells were counted using Trypan Blue (Lonza) and automated cell counter Countess (Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Measures of apoptosis</title><p>Cells were seeded in the same format as for the 7-day time course. On day 5, media was collected and adherent cells removed by Accutase (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and cells stained with PE-Annexin V and 7-AAD (BioLegend, San Diego, CA). Cells were analyzed on a BD FACS Calibur and data processed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>Cells were seeded in the same format as for cell viability studies. Over a 7-day time course, cell culture media was aspirated and adherent cells removed by Accutase (BioLegend). Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 66% ethanol on ice, incubated overnight at 4°, pelleted, washed in PBS, and stained in propidium iodide/RNase staining solution (4087, Cell Signaling). Cells were analyzed on a BD FACScan BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with a Cytek dxp8 (Cytek, Fremont, CA) upgrade and data processed using FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell imaging</title><p>Phase contrast images were taken on a AxioObserver.A1 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For EM, cells were processed and embedded as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonda et al., 1976</xref>). Cells cultured in a 6-well plate were fixed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing glutaraldehyde (2% vol/vol) for 1 hr at room temperature, washed three times in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), and post fixed in osmium tetroxide (1% vol/vol) for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells were stained in 0.5% wt/vol uranyl acetate (0.5% vol/vol) in acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5) for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were gradually dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (35%, 50%, 75%, 95%, and 100%). Cells were washed in a pure epoxy resin three times after 100% ethanol, and then embedded in the resin. The resin was cured in an oven (55°C) for 48 hr. The cured resin blocks were separated from the plate by submerging in liquid nitrogen. The cells were examined under an inverted microscope and areas selected for preparing 80 to 90 nm sections, which were then mounted on 200 copper mesh grids and counter-stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The grids were carbon coated in a vacuum evaporator. The grids were examined and imaged in the electron microscope operated at 80 kv and digital images were captured by a CCD camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measurement of macropinocytosis</title><p>Cells were seeded in 12-well plate in phenol red-free RPMI (Life Technologies) and 10% Tetracycline-free FBS (Clontech) and doxycycline (100 ng/ml), as indicated.

Cells were analyzed on a BD FACScan with a Cytek dxp8 upgrade and data were processed using FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Gene expression profiling</title><p>H358 and PC9 cells and their derivatives were grown in 6-well plates, treated with or without 100 ng/ml dox in duplicate for 24 hr, and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) as described above. Sample quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and subsequent sample preparation, array hybridization, and data acquisition was performed by the National Human Genome Research Institute's Microarray Core facility. GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were used according to the manufacture's protocols. Raw data (Affymetrix CEL files) were normalized by robust multiarray analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Irizarry et al., 2003</xref>) and subsequently analyzed to detect genes differentially expressed between dox-treated and untreated cultures, using the ANOVA function in Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek, St. Louis, MO); a Benjamini–Hochberg corrected p value of &lt;0.01 was considered significant. Overlap between differentially expressed genes among the cell lines was determined using VENNY software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliveros, 2007</xref>) and those significantly deregulated upon the addition of dox in both H358-TetO-EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> and PC9-TetO-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells and not their respective TetO-GFP controls were selected for further analyses. DNA probes that detected significant differences were mapped to genes using Partek Genomics Suite; those not mapping to annotated genes were removed. An average fold-change for dox treated vs untreated H358-TetO-EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> and PC9-TetO-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells was calculated and these values, along with the corresponding probe IDs, were uploaded to IPA software (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen) and analyzed using the Canonical Pathways function. Canonical pathways with a z-score ≥0.25 and a p value ≤0.05 were considered activated, whereas those with a z-score ≤ −0.25 and a p value ≤0.05 were considered inactivated. GSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) was also performed on the same gene list using the pre-ranked GSEA function and the transcription factor targets gene sets within the C6: Oncogenic Signatures Collection from the Molecular Signature Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Genes were ranked according to their average fold change for the dox treated TetO-Oncogene cells (described above) and GSEA was run with default settings except ‘Min size: exclude smaller set = 10’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Suiyuan Zhang (National Human Genome Research Institute Bioinformatics and Scientific Programming Core) and Raj Chari (Harvard Medical School, Department of Genetics) for their help with the genome-wide data analyses.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Chi Dang, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Unni et al. explore the potential explanations for an intriguing clinical observation, namely the absence of co-occurring activating mutations in KRAS and EGFR in lung adenocarcinoma despite the relatively frequent occurrence of these mutations. Importantly, they were unable to find similar associations between other commonly occurring mutations in this tumor type suggesting that their co-existence is detrimental. Further the authors demonstrate using transgenic mouse models that simultaneous induction of these mutated oncogenes resulted overwhelmingly with tumors that carry either mutated genes but not both. This exclusivity was further documented in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, in which co-expression of these oncogenes resulted in loss of viability, vacuolization, and evidence of macropinocytosis and autophagy. These intriguing results, however, were not further pursued at the mechanistic level, which was explicitly stated to be beyond the scope of the current work. Nonetheless, molecular signatures of cells co-expressing these oncogenes revealed activation of MAPK/JNK pathways. Whether co-expression of these oncogenes resulted in profound metabolic stress would be of great interest in future studies. In particular, whether autophagy is a survival or a death mechanism in this model remains to be established. The reported findings have significance regarding the evolution of human tumors and potential have implications for the application of targeted therapies. The work is high quality and would be of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><p>Key issues to address:</p><p>1) The authors should provide addition statistical analysis and provide error bars where available. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> graph for H358KRASG12C-TetOEGFR-L808R shows no error bars (unless they are extremely small).</p><p>2) The authors also show other examples of potential “synthetic lethal” interactions including concomitant mutation of BRAF and KRAS in colorectal cancer. In this regard, recent work from Ryan Corcoran and colleagues (Ahronian et al., Cancer Discov. 2015 April;5(4):358-67. doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-14-1518">10.1158/2159-8290.CD-14-1518</ext-link>.

The authors' data should therefore be discussed in light of these recent published findings. The implications of these recent findings with regards to therapy should also be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers bring up an important point regarding the mutual exclusivity of other oncogenes and the influence of treatment on these observed relationships. First, it should be noted that our study looked only at sequence level mutation and not copy number status, an important consideration in the context of the work by Corcoran and colleagues. Thus, we would not record the co-incidence of oncogenic mutation of BRAF with amplification of KRAS in colorectal cancers or similar relationships between oncogenes in other cancer types. However, it should be noted that mutation and amplification, while both “activating” in their effect on oncogenes, work through different mechanisms and are likely to have different effects on signaling. For example, unlike lung adenocarcinomas with sequence-altering mutations of EGFR, tumors with amplifications of EGFR do not acutely respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This finding and others suggest that mutations in EGFR potentiate signaling to a greater degree than amplification of wild-type EGFR. Therefore, in the context of synthetic lethality, when signaling intensity may need to exceed thresholds to induce toxicity, a combination of mutation of one oncogene and amplification of another may not create mutual exclusivity even though other mutational combinations might do so. Thus, as described in the paper by Corcoran and colleagues, a pre-existing population of cells within a tumor may carry both a BRAF mutation and KRAS amplification and those cells would have a selective advantage that upon treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Likewise, since our study examined tumors before treatment, it is possible that oncogenic alleles that appear to be excluded by the presence of certain mutations in the cancer types we examined may occur and be tolerated upon treatment with targeted therapies. Since we tested directly only the lethality of EGFR and KRAS mutations, we cannot exclude these and other possibilities. We pointed out in our original manuscript the need for such direct tests of the mechanism of observed mutual exclusivities.</p><p>To clarify the scope of our analysis, the important distinctions between amplifications and mutations, and the influence of factors such as drug treatment and resistance, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion and included a reference to Corcoran et al.</p><p><italic>3) The analysis of gene expression profiles in cancer cells expressing EGFR and KRAS, as well as confirmatory immunoblots, suggest that the activation of MAP kinase signaling is one of the consequences of concomitant oncogene expression. The data suggest that the JNK pathway may be most robustly activated. One possibility therefore is that JNK inhibition would ameliorate the lethality observed following combined EGFR and KRAS activation. This is a straightforward experiment to execute and would provide critical support for the proposed mechanisms underlying the induced lethality. Otherwise, the presented in vitro data are correlative. This issue could also be addressed in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ suggestion that additional experiments are required to determine whether the enhanced kinase activities of JNK and p38 cause synthetic lethality or are simply correlated with the biological effects, even though a link between these pathways and the phenotype observed after co-expression of KRAS and EGFR (increased macropinocytosis and vacuolization) is reported in the literature. To determine if inhibition of JNK and p38 can rescue the lethality observed upon co-expression of mutant EGFR and KRAS, we performed several experiments with siRNAs and small molecule inhibitors directed at these kinases in cells, using the inducible cell lines previously deployed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of our original manuscript. While we observed some amelioration of the lethal effects of induction of a second oncogene, there were confounding issues with these experiments that precluded adding them to the manuscript. First, while described as specific inhibitors for JNK and p38, the compounds used, like other small molecules, are known to affect the activity of other proteins (kinases) as well. Thus, it is difficult to attribute the effects observed solely to inhibition of the targeted kinases and not additional off-target effects. Second, as both JNK and p38 have multiple family members (i.e. JNK1-3 and p38 alpha, beta, gamma and delta) that mediate their signaling cascades, we could not reliably silence all family members concurrently with siRNAs.</p><p>Addressing these two experimental issues, by optimizing conditions, testing more compounds, and monitoring effects on multiple kinases, would require substantial efforts and unnecessarily further delay the publication of our central findings regarding mutual exclusivity and synthetic lethality. Therefore, while it is important to establish the downstream events mediating the observed lethality, these experiments are better suited to follow-up studies.</p><p>However, to add caveats about the association of JNK and p38 hyperactivity with synthetic lethality, we have added text to the Discussion to describe the correlative nature of the observations and the need for additional experiments.</p><p><italic>4) The authors suggest that enhanced macropinocytosis could potentially contribute to the reduced fitness following co-expression of EGFR and KRAS. However, given the published data of Commisso et al.

Epub 2013 May 12.), which the authors refer to, it is unclear why the authors believe that enhanced macropinocytosis would be detrimental in this case. Further discussion of this point would be beneficial</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified what we believe to be the difference between “controlled” macropinocytosis such as that observed by Commisso et al. and the “uncontrolled” macropinocytosis observed in cells expressing mutant KRAS and mutant EGFR. To summarize, we believe that the increased signaling induced by co-expression of both mutant oncogenes promotes macropinocytosis to levels or durations greater than those seen with expression of KRAS alone, resulting in profound cell defects such as vacuolization (Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
