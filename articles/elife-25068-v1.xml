This pathway is deregulated in various human cancers, and compounds that modulate its activity might have promise as new anticancer agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ye and Eisinger-Mathason, 2016</xref>). The TEAD (<italic>TEA</italic>/ATTS <italic>d</italic>omain, TEAD 1–4) transcription factors are the most downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, and several coactivator proteins interact with them, regulating their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pobbati and Hong, 2013</xref>). Amongst these coactivators, the YAP (<italic>Y</italic>es-<italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>p</italic>rotein) protein is often overexpressed in cancers, and targeting the YAP:TEAD interaction is emerging as a new therapeutic strategy in oncology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Felley-Bosco and Stahel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Santucci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, the study of the YAP:TEAD interaction is important not only to support drug discovery activities, but also to understand the regulation of TEAD transcription factors.</p><p>The TEAD binding site of mouse YAP (mYAP) was initially mapped to the N-terminus of this protein (mYAP<sup>32-139</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vassilev et al., 2001</xref>) and later on more precise knowledge was gained when the structure of the YAP:TEAD complex was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In these studies, large protein fragments, hYAP<sup>50-171</sup> (human YAP) or mYAP<sup>35-92</sup>, were used for crystallization, but electron density was only observed for the hYAP<sup>50-100</sup> and mYAP<sup>47-85</sup> regions. Subsequent binding studies showed that hYAP<sup>50-171</sup> and hYAP<sup>50-99</sup> have a similar affinity for TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting that the regions outside the fragment YAP<sup>50-99</sup> have little importance for the interaction. Bound hYAP<sup>50-100</sup> contains from the N- to C-terminus: a β-strand, an α-helix, a long loop and an Ω-loop. The study of hYAP<sup>2-268</sup> by nuclear magnetic resonance reveals that it is natively unfolded in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2010</xref>) and the online ANCHOR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dosztányi et al., 2009</xref>) predicts hYAP<sup>50-100</sup> to be disordered (data not shown). This together with the structural data available on the bound form of YAP indicates that hYAP<sup>50-100</sup> becomes structured upon binding to TEAD. In contrast, the comparison of the free and bound forms of TEAD shows that it is permanently folded and does not undergo large conformational changes upon binding to YAP (the root mean square deviation of atomic positions between TEAD in the YAP:TEAD1 complex (pdb 3KYS) and apo TEAD3 (pdb 5EMW) is 0.443 Å).</p><p>The contribution to binding of the β-strand from the TEAD-binding site of YAP is modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>) and mainly due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the main chain atoms of YAP and TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Studies with synthetic peptides mimicking the α-helix and the Ω-loop regions of YAP show that only Ω-loop mimetics have a weak (around 70 µM) but measurable affinity for TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pobbati et al., 2015</xref>). Data obtained from cellular assays reveal that mutations in the Ω-loop have a greater impact on the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex than mutations of α-helix residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, mutations of TEAD in its Ω-loop binding pocket affect the interaction with YAP to a greater extent than mutations in its α-helix binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Overall this indicates that YAP interacts with TEAD mainly via two distinct secondary structure elements, an α-helix and an Ω-loop, and that the latter contributes most to the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. However, the majority of the data available today provide only semi-quantitative information on the contribution to binding of the residues located at the YAP:TEAD interface. To better understand how these two proteins interact, a more quantitative knowledge needs to be developed. In this report, we conduct a detailed analysis of the YAP:TEAD interface and examine the contribution of several key residues located on both proteins to the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. This work, which is based on an analysis of the effect of single mutations and on the coupling energies measured from double mutant cycles, gives a new insight into the energetics of the events taking place during the association between YAP and TEAD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and dicussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations in the α-helix and Ω-loop regions of hYAP<sup>50-171</sup></title><p>Analysis of the structure of different YAP:TEAD complexes (pdb 3KYS and 3JUA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>), the data from cellular assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2010</xref>) and the results obtained from structure function studies carried out with synthetic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mesrouze et al., 2016</xref>) allowed us to select several YAP residues that should contribute significantly to the interaction with TEAD. In the α-helix (hYAP<sup>61-73</sup>) region, hYAP Leu65, Leu68, and Phe69 belong to the LxxLF motif, which is known to bind to hydrophobic grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Santucci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In the YAP:TEAD complex, these three residues are located on the same side of the α-helix making hydrophobic interactions with TEAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the Ω-loop region (hYAP<sup>85-99</sup>), hYAP Met86, Leu91, and Phe95 are involved in hydrophobic interactions with TEAD, and they interact with each other to form a hydrophobic core within the bound Ω-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). hYAP Arg89 interacts with hTEAD4 Asp272 and Gln269 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) while hYAP Ser94 is within hydrogen bond distance from hTEAD4 Glu263 and Tyr429 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The amino acid hYAP Phe96 does not provide any direct interaction with TEAD. It is located above the hydrophobic core formed by hYAP Met86, Leu91 and Phe95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and it interacts also with the guanidinium group of hYAP Arg87 (not shown, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al.

This residue was included in this study because it may contribute to the stabilization of the bound Ω-loop.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25068.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the YAP:TEAD complex.</title><p>The α-helix (<bold>A</bold>) and Ω-loop (<bold>B</bold>) binding interfaces.

The hYAP Leu68Ala mutation is the least destabilizing (ΔΔG = ΔG<sub>mutant</sub> – ΔG<sub>wt</sub> = 1.92 kcal/mol) and the Leu91Ala mutation is the most destabilizing (ΔΔG = 4.4 kcal/mol). In the α-helix region, the hYAP Phe69Ala mutation has the greatest effect on binding (ΔΔG = 3.48 kcal/mol). This residue, which is strictly conserved both in the YAP proteins and in the other TEAD coactivators TAZ and VGLL, is therefore key for the interaction between the α-helix region of YAP and TEAD. All the mutations in the Ω-loop region have a major effect on the YAP:TEAD interaction, reducing the binding energy by more than 2.5 kcal/mol. However, great caution is warranted in interpreting these data. In contrast to hYAP Leu65, Leu68 and Phe69, which show few (if any) intramolecular interactions with each other in the bound α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), hYAP Met86, Leu91, Phe95, and Phe96 show intramolecular hydrophobic interactions that may help in stabilizing the bound Ω-loop. Alanine mutations of these residues may disturb these stabilizing interactions in addition to disrupting contacts with TEAD. The results obtained with hYAP Phe96 are a good example of the impact that intramolecular interactions have on the binding of the Ω-loop. This residue is not in direct contact with TEAD, and it is above the hydrophobic core of the bound Ω-loop formed by hYAP Met86, Leu91, and Phe95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The large decrease in binding (ΔΔG &gt; 3 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) measured for hYAP Phe96Ala is therefore due not to the loss of interactions with TEAD, but most probably to a destabilization of the bound Ω-loop. Mutations of residues located in the hydrophobic core of the Ω-loop may therefore affect both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, explaining why they are often more destabilizing than the mutations in the α-helix. The hYAP Arg89Ala and Ser94Ala mutations trigger a large decrease in affinity (ΔΔG &gt; 3 kcal/mol). This is in agreement with earlier work showing the importance of the interactions made between these two amino acids and TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutations in the α-helix and Ω-loop binding pockets of hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup></title><p>The structure of the YAP:TEAD complex (pdb 3KYS) was analyzed to find the TEAD residues that are located in the surrounding (within 5 Å) and have the potential to interact with the 9 YAP amino acids studied above. This led to the identification of 15 TEAD residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) that were mutated to determine their role in the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. In contrast to the TEADbinding domain of YAP, which is natively unfolded in solution, the free form of TEAD is folded. Mutations of TEAD may therefore affect its structure, making an analysis of the role played in the interaction by the mutated residues more challenging. To estimate the impact of the mutations on hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup>, the mutant proteins were studied in a fluorescence-based thermal shift assay, a technique commonly used to assess the effect of mutations on proteins (see for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavinder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bultema et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decroos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rumora et al., 2016</xref>]). The melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of the 15 TEAD mutant proteins was measured, and their difference in thermal stability compared with that of wt hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup> was calculated: ΔT<sub>m</sub> = T<sub>m</sub><sup>wt</sup> – T<sub>m</sub><sup>mutant</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The mutations reduced the thermal stability of hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup> between 0.1°C and 6.6°C. Using ΔT<sub>m</sub> &gt;4°C as cut-off value, the five mutations hTEAD4 Lys273Ala, Leu295Ala, Lys297Ala, Tyr369Ala, and Leu377Ala were considered too destabilizing, and the corresponding proteins were not further studied. We shall assume in the following that the other mutations did not substantially affect the overall TEAD structure. The affinity of these proteins for wt hYAP<sup>50-171</sup> was measured by SPR. The localization of these residues at TEAD surface is given on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25068.004</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Properties of the different hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup> proteins.

The corresponding mutations in hTEAD1 or mTEAD4 also have a modest effect in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2010b</xref>).</p><p>Within the Ω-loop binding pocket, hYAP Ser94 makes a hydrogen bond with hTEAD4 Glu263 and Tyr429 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and the hTEAD4 Glu263Ala and Tyr429Phe mutations destabilize binding with ΔΔG = 1.48 and 0.81 kcal/mol, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This reveals that the loss of the hydrogen bond between hYAP Ser94 and hTEAD4 Glu263 has a greater impact on binding than the loss of the hydrogen bond between hYAP Ser94 and hTEAD4 Tyr429. The mutation corresponding to hTEAD4 Glu263Ala in hTEAD1 (Glu240) also has a significant effect on the YAP:TEAD interaction in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In cells, the change to alanine/histidine in hTEAD1-2 or mTEAD4 of the tyrosine residue corresponding to hTEAD4 Tyr429 markedly reduces the interaction between YAP and TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). These alanine/histidine mutations are therefore more destabilizing than the phenylalanine mutation studied here. The hTEAD1 Tyr421His mutation (equivalent to hTEAD4 Tyr429His) is also detrimental in a more physiologic context, since it is associated with Sveinsson’s chorioretinal atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fossdal et al., 2004</xref>). Bringing together the published data with our results suggests that the histidine mutation probably has additional effects on the YAP:TEAD interaction beyond just preventing the formation of a hydrogen bond with hYAP Ser94.</p><p>The residues hTEAD4 Phe337, Lys376, Leu380, and Val389 are located in the α-helix binding pocket of TEAD, making hydrophobic contacts with bound YAP. hTEAD4 Phe337 is in the vicinity of hYAP Leu68. hTEAD4 Lys376 is close to hYAP Leu65 and Phe69. hTEAD4 Leu380 and Val389 are within van de Waals distance from hYAP Phe69. The mutation of these residues to alanine decreases ΔG by more than one kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), showing that they contribute to the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. Some of these mutations (Phe337Ala and Leu380Ala) also affect the interaction between YAP and TEAD in cell-based assays when carried out at equivalent positions in mTEAD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>In the Ω-loop binding pocket, the mutation of hTEAD4 Val265, which is in the vicinity of hYAP Leu91, has a significant effect on YAP binding (ΔΔG ~ 1 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The mutation of the equivalent residue in hTEAD1 has a modest effect in cells on the YAP:TEAD interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). The Asp272Ala mutation has a major impact on the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex with ΔΔG &gt; 3.5 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Similar results were obtained with different hTEAD4 Asp272Ala protein preparations (data not shown). The mutation does not modify the T<sub>m</sub> of hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup> (ΔT<sub>m</sub> = 0.1°C, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and it does not significantly affect hTEAD4 structure since the circular dichroism spectra of hTEAD4 Asp272Ala and wt hTEAD4 are identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the available structures of unbound TEAD (pdb 3L15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2010</xref>], pdb 5EMV and 5EMW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noland et al., 2016</xref>], pdb 5HGU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2016</xref>]), this residue is exposed to the solvent and does not seem to be involved in well-defined intramolecular interactions (data not shown). In the YAP:TEAD complex, it only interacts via its carboxylic group with the guanidinium moiety of hYAP Arg89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since the hYAP Arg89Ala mutation also significantly reduces binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>]), the interaction between these two residues appears to be key for the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. The role of hYAP Arg89 in the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex has been demonstrated in cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). However, hTEAD4 Asp272 (or the corresponding residue in the TEAD 1–3) has not been studied in the different structure-function analyses known to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). To determine if this residue is also important for formation of the YAP:TEAD complex in cells in the context of the full length proteins, we used two different cellular assays. The effect of the hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutation was assessed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). N-terminally V5-tagged hTEAD4 (wt or Asp272Ala) and wt hYAP were co-transfected into HEK293FT cells. YAP was immunoprecipitated and the TEAD4 protein complexed to it was detected by Western blot. While wt TEAD4 co-immunoprecipitates with YAP, the hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutant does not to detectable levels. This shows that the hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutation prevents the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex in cells. To confirm this result in a more functional assay, we used a YAP:TEAD-responsive gene reporter assay where the expression of the luciferase gene is under the control of multiple MCAT sites, which function as TEAD recognition sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michaloglou et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The transfection of wt hYAP together with wt TEAD4 in HEK293::MCAT cells stimulates the MCAT-based reporter, leading to marked luciferase activity. Under the same conditions, induction of luciferase activity is significantly reduced when hYAP is co-transfected with hTEAD4 Asp272Ala. This indicates that the mutation compromises the ability of YAP to stimulate TEAD4 transcriptional activity. These cellular data demonstrate that the hTEAD4 Asp272 mutation affects the interaction between the full-length YAP and TEAD4 proteins in a cellular context. Together with the published data on hYAP Arg89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>) this demonstrates that the hYAP Arg89:hTEAD4 Asp272 interaction is also key for the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex in a cellular environment.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25068.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of the hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutation in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-immunoprecipitation: N-terminally V5-tagged hTEAD4 (wild-type (wt) or Asp272Ala mutant) were co-transfected with wt hYAP into HEK293FT cells.

The expression level of hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutant versus wt hTEAD4 was quantified by Image J software to be reduced by a factor of approx. 1.6, indicating that the approximate fourfold reduction in MCAT_Luc reporter signal cannot be solely attributed to expression differences, but does truly reflect a reduced activity of the hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutant.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25068.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25068.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-25068-fig2-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25068.006</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the structure of the unbound hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutant protein by Circular Dichroism (CD).</title><p>Proteins were dialyzed in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM KF, 0.25 mM TCEP and diluted in this buffer to 0.2 mg.mL<sup>−1</sup>.

DMCAs, which were initially conducted to study interactions within a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carter et al., 1984</xref>), have been extended to study protein-protein interactions (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiber and Fersht, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bradshaw and Waksman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Naider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elliot-Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gianni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jemth et al., 2014</xref>]). They allow the coupling (or interaction) energy, ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> (see Materials and methods section for details), between two residues at the interface of a protein complex to be calculated. The two residues are independent, and their effect on binding energy is additive when ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> = 0. In the other cases (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> ≠ 0), they are energetically coupled (they exert an energetic effect on each other), and coupling is favorable when ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> &lt; 0 or unfavorable when ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> &gt; 0.</p><p>The YAP:TEAD interface is a particularly attractive model to carry out DMCA since it is formed of two distant elements. DMCA should allow us not only to gain more insight into the interactions taking place within each of these pockets, but also to determine whether residues from the two different pockets are energetically coupled. The YAP and TEAD mutations that destabilize the hYAP<sup>50-171</sup>:hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup> interaction by more than 1 kcal/mol were selected for this analysis. The pairwise study of these different YAP and TEAD proteins led to the measurement of 80 different K<sub>d</sub> values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which enabled us to construct 63 double mutant cycles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>The ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values obtained from this analysis are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. We shall start by studying pairs of residues that are not located at the same binding interface. ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> could not be determined for 7 of such pairs (n. m. in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) because the K<sub>d</sub> values for the mutantYAP:mutant TEAD interaction fall outside the scope of our experiment (&gt;200 µM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For the remaining pairs, most of the ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values are within experimental error (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> = 0 ± 0.5 kcal/mol, see Materials and methods). This means that the residues in these pairs are not energetically coupled and that they act independently of the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. Earlier work on long-range effects on the additivity of mutations showed that ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> decreases with the distance between the two mutated residues with no coupling above 7 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiber and Fersht, 1995</xref>) and that additivity is observed for distant mutations at rigid protein-protein interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wells, 1990</xref>).

This coupling energy, though moderate, is significant. Non-additivity in long-range interactions has also been observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gianni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jemth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LiCata and Ackers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Istomin et al., 2008</xref>). This ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> value is not linked to a specific protein preparation of hYAP Arg89 or hTEAD4 Lys376, as similar results were obtained with different batches of these proteins (data not shown). While they are located in two distant pockets at the YAP:TEAD interface, these two residues appear to act in a synergistic manner (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> &lt; 0) on the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. There is no straightforward explanation for this result, but this pair is the only one that involves two charged residues (of the same charge) located at the two binding pockets. Since electrostatic interactions have a long-distance effect, an electrostatic component may explain the ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> value measured between these amino acids. Using ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> = −0.5 kcal/mol as the minimum value for significant energetic coupling between two residues, we calculated the K<sub>d</sub> (K<sub>d</sub><sup>calc</sup>) of the mutant YAP:mutant TEAD interaction for the seven pairs for which no ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> could be measured (n. m. in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). For 3 of these pairs (hYAP Leu91:hTEAD4 Phe337, hYAP Phe95:hTEAD4 Phe337 and hYAP Leu65:hTEAD4 Asp272), we arrived at K<sub>d</sub><sup>calc</sup> &lt;150 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting that if these residues had been coupled with ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> ≤ −0.5 kcal/mol, it would have been possible to measure the K<sub>d</sub> for the interaction between the two mutant proteins. For the remaining pairs – hYAP Phe69:hTEAD4 Asp272, hYAP Arg89:hTEAD4 Val389, hYAP Leu91:hTEAD4 Val389, and hYAP Phe95:hTEAD4 Val389 – it is not possible to draw a conclusion, since the K<sub>d</sub><sup>calc</sup> values are either just below or &gt;200 µM, our upper limit for K<sub>d</sub> determination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>We shall now look at the coupling energy between YAP and TEAD residues located in the same binding pocket. ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values larger than the experimental error limit were obtained with several pairs of residues. These values are all negative, indicating a favorable energetic coupling between these residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Within the α-helix, 5 ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values below −0.5 kcal/mol were measured for residues located in close proximity: hYAP Leu65:hTEAD4 Lys376 (−0.65 kcal/mol), hYAP Leu68:hTEAD4 Phe337 (−0.65 kcal/mol), hYAP Phe69:hTEAD4 Lys376 (−1.28 kcal/mol), Leu380 (−1.01 kcal/mol) and Val389 (−1.11 kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These low to moderate ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values may reflect the van der Waals nature of the interactions between these residues, since such interactions usually give lower coupling energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiber and Fersht, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman et al., 1997</xref>). hYAP Phe69 is significantly coupled (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> &lt; −0.95 kcal/mol) to the 4 TEAD residues studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), highlighting once more the importance of this residue at the α-helix binding interface. Significant ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values were also measured between residues that are not directly in contact: hYAP Leu65:hTEAD4 Val389 (−0.52 kcal/mol) and hYAP Phe69:hTEAD4 Phe337 (−0.95 kcal/mol). Experimental bias (e.g. effect of the mutations on the unbound conformation of the proteins) cannot be ruled out, but, |ΔΔG<sub>int</sub>| values below 0.5 kcal/mol were measured in other pairs involving hYAP Leu65 or Phe69 and hTEAD4 Phe337 or Val389 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), suggesting the mutation of these residues does not systematically lead to high ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values. Therefore the residues of these two pairs are likely to be energetically coupled. ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> is high (~1 kcal/mol) between the two hydrophobic residues hYAP Phe69 and hTEAD4 Phe337 that are not in direct contact. hYAP Phe69 and hTEAD4 Phe337, which are located at each side of the bound α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), may act synergistically in holding/orienting the hYAP α-helix in its correct bound orientation.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25068.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Coupling energies at the α-helix and Ω-loop binding pockets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) α-helix interface.

Significant coupling (−0.96 kcal/mol) was observed between hYAP Ser94 and hTEAD4 Glu263, two residues within hydrogen bond distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). hYAP Arg89, Leu91, and Phe95 are also coupled to hTEAD4 Glu263, albeit to a lesser extent. Since these 3 YAP residues are not in contact with hTEAD4 Glu263, coupling might be indirect and mediated via hYAP Ser94. Secondary coupling via a third side chain was previously described in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiber and Fersht, 1995</xref>). Moderate ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values were also obtained between hTEAD4 Val265 and hYAP Arg89 (−0.58 kcal/mol) and Phe95 (−0.61 kcal/mol) residues that are also not in direct contact. The largest coupling energy was observed between hYAP Arg89 and hTEAD4 Asp272, ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> = −3.49 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The double mutant cycle shows that, once hYAP Arg89 is mutated, the hTEAD4 Asp272Ala mutation has little effect on binding (ΔΔG<sub>4</sub> = 0.04 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is in agreement with the structural data showing that hYAP Asp272 interacts only with hYAP Arg89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The larger effect on binding of the hYAP Arg89Ala mutation against an hTEAD4 Asp272Ala background (ΔΔG<sub>2</sub> = 0.85 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) can be explained by the loss of both additional intermolecular interactions with TEAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and intramolecular stabilizing interactions in the bound YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>). hTEAD4 Asp272 is also strongly coupled (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> &lt; −1.6 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) to each of the hYAP Ω-loop residues studied. This effect is limited to these amino acids, since no significant coupling energy was measured between hTEAD4 Asp272 and hYAP Leu68, which is located in the α-helix region (ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> = −0.02 kcal/mol, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). These hydrophobic/polar Ω-loop residues are therefore indirectly coupled to hTEAD4 Asp272 via hYAP Arg89, because they make no direct contact with this amino acid. The hYAP Arg89:hTEAD4 Asp272 interaction is thus crucial for the binding of the Ω-loop, since it allows several residues to act in a synergistic manner on the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. Several proline residues – hYAP Pro85, Pro92, Pro98, and Pro99 – are also present in the Ω-loop, where they play a role in complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, these residues are difficult to study with the techniques used in this report, because their mutation may affect the local structure of YAP in addition to disrupting interactions with TEAD.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25068.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Double mutant cycle for the hYAP Arg89:hTEAD4 Asp272 interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The binding energies (kcal/mol) measured for the different pairwise interactions are indicated in boxes, and the differences between these binding energies (ΔΔG<sub>1-4</sub>) are shown.

Our analysis, which was focused on a subset of key residues located at the YAP:TEAD interface, provides the first quantitative mapping on the individual contribution of these amino acids to the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. We show that hYAP Phe69 is a ‘hot-spot’ residue at the α-helix interface. We find that hYAP Arg89 and hTEAD4 Lys376, which are not located at the same binding interface, act in a synergistic manner in the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. We reveal that the hYAP Arg89:hTEAD4 Asp272 interaction is essential for the interaction between the Ω-loop region of YAP and TEAD. We provide evidence for the key role of hTEAD4 Asp272 in the interaction between YAP and TEAD both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a cellular context. Overall, our study provides a set of new information on the YAP:TEAD interaction, which is a key effector node in the Hippo pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning, expression, purification and analysis</title><p>The MCAT_Luc reporter construct in pLENTI6TR backbone has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michaloglou et al., 2013</xref>).

This mix was added to 384-well, thin-walled Hard-Shell PCR microplates (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Before reading, the plates were covered by optically clear adhesive seals. Measurements were carried out with a CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The temperature was increased from 25°C to 85°C at 0.5°C / 30 s and the fluorescence intensity was measured with the excitation and emission filters set to 465 and 590 nm, respectively. The melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) were determined by analyzing the thermal denaturation curves with CFX Manager (BioRad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)</title><p>All the experiments were carried out with a Biacore T200 optical biosensor and Series S sensor Chip SA (Biacore AB, GE Healthcare, United Kingdom). The chips were washed three times with 1 M NaCl/50 mM NaOH, and the N-Avitagged hTEAD4<sup>217-434</sup> proteins were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in SPR immobilization buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 0.25 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.05% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4). Kinetic experiments were performed at 25°C with a flow rate of 50 μl/min in SPR running buffer (SPR immobilization buffer containing 2% (v/v) DMSO). The YAP proteins were diluted in SPR running buffer. After baseline equilibration with a series of buffer blanks, a DMSO correction series was performed from 1% to 3%. Each cycle consisted of an injection phase of YAP<sup>50-171</sup> (25 to 230 s) and a dissociation phase (75 to 450 s). All data were referenced for a blank streptavidin reference surface and blank injections of running buffer to minimize the influence of baseline drift upon binding.</p><p>A 6-step workflow was applied to obtain the dissociation constants measured at equilibrium (K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup>). Steps 1 to 3 ensure that only high-quality sensorgrams are selected for K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> determination. Steps 4 to 6 ensure that K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> is measured in experimental conditions at or near to TEAD saturation.</p><p>Step 1. The sensorgrams were globally fitted with a 1:1 interaction model using the Biacore T200 evaluation software.</p><p>Step 2. Each sensorgram was visually inspected and low-quality experiments (e.g. large bulk effects, unstable signal at equilibrium, inappropriate YAP concentration range, etc.) were not further analyzed.</p><p>Step 3. Experiments with a standard error on fitted K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> higher than 20% K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> or a fitted maximum binding capacity (R<sub>max</sub><sup>fitted</sup>) &lt;70% theoretical R<sub>max</sub> (R<sub>max</sub><sup>theo</sup>) (R<sub>max</sub><sup>theo</sup> = (MW<sup>YAP</sup>/ MW<sup>TEAD</sup>) x R<sub>TEAD</sub> x n with MW<sup>YAP</sup> and MW<sup>TEAD</sup> molecular weight of YAP and TEAD4, respectively, R<sub>TEAD</sub> level of immobilization of TEAD4 in response unit (RU) and in stoichiometry here n = 1) were discarded.</p><p>Step 4. K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> values from experiments meeting criteria of steps 1–3 for which at least the highest YAP concentration used in the dose response was &gt;10 K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> (saturation or near saturation conditions) are reported in the text.</p><p>Step 5. For the experiments that did not meet step four criteria, R<sub>max</sub> at saturation (R<sub>max</sub><sup>sat</sup>) were calculated. R<sub>max</sub><sup>sat</sup> values correspond to the signal that should be measured for a YAP:TEAD pair when all the reactive immobilized TEAD molecules are bound to YAP (saturation conditions). R<sub>max</sub><sup>sat</sup> = R<sub>max</sub><sup>theo</sup> x (R<sub>max</sub><sup>meas*</sup> / R<sub>max</sub><sup>theo*</sup>). R<sub>max</sub><sup>theo</sup> values were calculated for each YAP:TEAD pair as defined above. R<sub>max</sub><sup>theo*</sup> and R<sub>max</sub><sup>meas*</sup> values were obtained from measurements done with exactly the same TEAD protein preparation but using wt hYAP<sup>50-171</sup> as analyte. The ratio R<sub>max</sub><sup>meas*</sup> / R<sub>max</sub><sup>theo*</sup> is an experimental estimate of the fraction of TEAD available for binding in conditions where saturation is achieved, since it was always obtained with wt hYAP<sup>50-171</sup> used as analyte. Experiments for which the signal measured at equilibrium (R<sub>eq</sub>) at the highest YAP concentration (500 µM) did not exceed 75% of R<sub>max</sub><sup>sat</sup> were considered not suitable for accurate K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> determination because they were too far from saturation conditions. These experiments are not reported.</p><p>Step 6. For the experiments meeting step five criteria, the R<sub>eq</sub> determined at different YAP concentrations with the Biacore T200 evaluation software were fitted using a one site binding with background equation with Prism v7 (GraphPad Software) including in the analysis the additional point: [YAP] = 50 K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> (estimated from initial global fits of the sensorgram); R<sub>eq</sub> = R<sub>max</sub><sup>sat</sup>. Simulations made on several experimental data sets show that the inclusion of this point significantly improves the accuracy of the fit, and the standard error of the fitted K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> was always lower than 10% K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup>. The dissociation constants determined under such conditions are reported in the text.</p><p>Within our experimental conditions, the limit for accurate K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> determination is 200 µM. All the pairs with a lower affinity are reported in the text as K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> &gt; 200 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Double mutant cycle analysis</title><p>The double mutant cycles were constructed measuring K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> for four different pairwise interactions: wtYAP:wtTEAD (wY:wT), mutantYAP:wtTEAD (mY:wT), wtYAP:mutantTEAD (wY:mT) and mutantYAP:mutantTEAD (mY:mT). The binding-free energies were calculated from K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> with the formula ΔG = RTLn K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> (R = 1.986 cal.mol<sup>−1</sup>K<sup>−1</sup>, T = 298°K). The interaction energy between two residues, ΔΔG<sub>int</sub>, were calculated according to the formula ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> = ΔG<sub>mY:mT</sub> + ΔG<sub>wY:wT</sub> – ΔG<sub>mY:wT</sub> – ΔG<sub>wY:mT</sub>. Standard errors (SE) on ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> were derived from SE<sub>ΔΔGint</sub> = (SE<sub>ΔGmY:mT</sub><sup>2</sup> + SE<sub>ΔGwY:wT</sub><sup>2</sup> + SE<sub>ΔGmY:wT</sub><sup>2</sup> + SE<sub>ΔGwY:mT</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>, where SE is the standard error. Large experimental errors in K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> determination are a source of considerable uncertainty on ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> because of error propagation in the calculations. As a consequence, only high ΔΔG<sub>int</sub> values may become significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pons et al., 1999</xref>). Within our experimental conditions, the SE for K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> did not exceed 15% K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Since SE<sub>ΔG</sub> = RT (SE<sub>Kdeq</sub> / K<sub>d</sub><sup>eq</sup>), the maximum SE<sub>ΔG</sub> = 0.09 kcal/mol and as a consequence the maximum SE<sub>ΔΔGint</sub> is 0.18 kcal/mol. Using a 2SE threshold (95% confidence interval), |ΔΔG<sub>int</sub>| &gt; 0.36 kcal/mol should be significant. However, we shall only consider |ΔΔG<sub>int</sub>| &gt; 0.5 kcal/mol to be high enough to reflect an energy coupling between two residues.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank E Billy, H Niu and ME Digan (Novartis) for generating the HEK293T::MCAT_Luc reporter model and A Leu (Novartis) for derivation of the nV5-TEAD4 construct.

The difference in binding energy between the two interactions wt hYAP:wt hTEAD4 and hYAP Arg89Ala:wt hTEAD4 is ΔΔG = 4338 cal/mol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, ΔΔG<sub>1</sub> double mutant cycle for hYAP Arg89:hTEAD4 Val389).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dissection of the interaction between the intrinsically disordered YAP protein and the transcription factor TEAD&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jane Clarke (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tim Sharpe (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a meticulous biophysical dissection of the interaction between human YAP and TEAD4, predominantly using protein engineering and surface plasmon resonance. The study identifies residues from both proteins that are energetically important for binding at the interface of hTEAD with both the α-helical and Ω-loop regions of hYAP.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers all thought the study was well executed and of general interest. They were enthusiastic and recommended acceptance. The points below are revisions you should make to clarify the manuscript, make it easier to read, and easier for the more general, less &quot;biophysical&quot; reader to appreciate.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) You might like to consider the way things are presented. The manuscript is dense and the results are hard to follow: Use of the &quot;Results and Discussion&quot; format is not ideal here. The details of what interactions being probed can then be left to the detailed discussion of the results and the general picture of the mode of binding can be discussed later.</p><p>2) It would be nice to have a structural figure showing some of the hTEAD residues that have been mutated in their structural context. And a figure showing the whole bound YAP peptide, so that the whole conformation can better be visualised without needing to refer to the structure. It might be useful to make a figure in which the ddGint data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> are presented in the context of the structure, perhaps with some kind of color code to visualize the coupling energies.</p><p>3) Some discussion comparing the results of such a double mutant cycle analysis of IDP:protein with that of two folded proteins would be of interest. (and make the paper more generally interesting to the audience. Perhaps consider issues of the size of interfaces, the relative burial of the key residues, the cooperativity detected…</p><p>4) In this context one reviewer comments &quot;Subsection “Double mutant cycle analyses”, third paragraph: perhaps the context is different here, since YAP is disordered before binding. Is it possible that either the α-helical region or Ω-loop region could completely dissociate from the interface with sufficient destabilisation and become disordered, while the other site remained bound? Would this have different entropic consequences (e.g. end effects) than one would observe for two spatially-separated contact points between folded proteins? This is only a philosophical point, since it appears that there's no significant coupling between the sites apart from electrostatics. A study of the unbound and bound-state conformational dynamics of selected YAP mutants by NMR might be an interesting follow-up (definitely not required for this paper though).&quot;</p><p>5) In the Discussion you say: &quot;On the basis of this finding, a binding mechanism can be proposed for the Ω-loop.&quot; And then go on to propose such a mechanism. It may be tempting to do this, but as I know you are aware it is not possible to propose a mechanism without kinetics. This should be removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25068.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) You might like to consider the way things are presented.

I apologize for this. Our study is a structure-function analysis and it is difficult to uncouple the results from their immediate analysis/interpretation. When I try to write the manuscript as suggested in the review “The details of what interactions being probed can then be left to the detailed discussion of the results” and afterward “the general picture of the mode of binding”, I repeat in the Discussion section several observations/comments already made in the Results section. So, the article is becoming repetitive and it does not gain in clarity.</p><p><italic>2) It would be nice to have a structural figure showing some of the hTEAD residues that have been mutated in their structural context. And a figure showing the whole bound YAP peptide, so that the whole conformation can better be visualised without needing to refer to the structure. It might be useful to make a figure in which the ddGint data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> are presented in the context of the structure, perhaps with some kind of color code to visualize the coupling energies.</italic></p><p>Two new figures have been inserted in the text. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> represents the TEAD residues mutated in the α-helix pocket and for which a K<sub>d</sub> has been measured. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> represents the TEAD residues mutated in the Ω-loop pocket and for which a K<sub>d</sub> has been measured. Since the α-helix and the Ω-loop interfaces are distant from each other, it is not possible to make a single figure showing the interactions in both pockets at the same time. The text and the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> have been updated.</p><p>We also introduced a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. This figure represents the coupling energies between residues at the two binding interfaces. This is a good suggestion from the reviewers because it gives a summary of our data in a visual manner easier to interpret than the table in the text. This figure may help the reader in getting a general picture of the findings presented in the manuscript (see point 1 above).</p><p><italic>3) Some discussion comparing the results of such a double mutant cycle analysis of IDP:protein with that of two folded proteins would be of interest. (and make the paper more generally interesting to the audience. Perhaps consider issues of the size of interfaces, the relative burial of the key residues, the cooperativity detected.</italic></p><p>This topic is interesting and could the subject of a future review article. However, we do not think that sufficient double mutant cycle analyses on IDP:protein interactions are available today in the literature to make such comparison and to lead to convincing conclusions. For example, most of the ΔGint measured by Jemth et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 289 5528, 2014) for the interaction between NCBD (molten globule) and ACTR (IDP) are positive while they are negative for YAP:TEAD. This already shows differences amongst IDPs suggesting that comparisons between different systems might be challenging.</p><p><italic>4) In this context one reviewer comments &quot;Subsection “Double mutant cycle analyses”, third paragraph: perhaps the context is different here, since YAP is disordered before binding. Is it possible that either the α-helical region or Ω-loop region could completely dissociate from the interface with sufficient destabilisation and become disordered, while the other site remained bound? Would this have different entropic consequences (e.g. end effects) than one would observe for two spatially-separated contact points between folded proteins? This is only a philosophical point, since it appears that there's no significant coupling between the sites apart from electrostatics. A study of the unbound and bound-state conformational dynamics of selected YAP mutants by NMR might be an interesting follow-up (definitely not required for this paper though).&quot;</italic></p><p>We do not have experimental data to answer this question, but, some of our previous results ([Hau et al., 2013] in the manuscript) show that peptides mimicking the isolated α-helix and the Ω-loop of YAP have an affinity &gt;150 and ~70 μM, respectively. This suggests that if the α-helix or the Ω-loop is mutated such that it can completely dissociate from the interface, the remaining site will have alone a very weak affinity for TEAD and most probably it will dissociate also from the interface. We therefore speculate that if a mutation prevents one interface to be formed the complex will not be created or will be highly unstable.</p><p><italic>5) In the Discussion you say: &quot;On the basis of this finding, a binding mechanism can be proposed for the Ω-loop.&quot; And then go on to propose such a mechanism. It may be tempting to do this, but as I know you are aware it is not possible to propose a mechanism without kinetics. This should be removed.</italic></p><p>Yes we agree: binding mechanisms cannot be established without the support of kinetic data. We even wrote this in the submitted manuscript: “Binding kinetic experiments may help to determine experimentally whether the interaction between YAP and TEAD follows such a mechanism or not.” We are surprised that the reviewers did not take into consideration this warning sentence when making their comment. The misunderstanding may come from our phrasing. Instead of “On the basis of this finding, a binding mechanism can be proposed for the Ω-loop.” we should have written: “On the basis of this finding, one could hypothesize a binding mechanism for the Ω-loop.” We think that scientific articles should (and many do) contain hypotheses/models that trigger future activities to prove or disprove them. In our case the mapping of the transition state could be the way to check the proposed mechanism. Of course, the technical feasibility of such experiments remains to be demonstrated since many of our mutant proteins have high K<sub>d</sub>. This is why we wrote in our warning sentence: “Binding kinetic experiments <italic>may</italic> help …” We feel that this paragraph gives perspectives beyond the current work and makes the link between the current thermodynamic data and future (if technically feasible) kinetic measurements.</p><p>Nevertheless we – sadly – followed the recommendation of the reviewers and removed this paragraph from the manuscript. The word “mechanistic” was removed from the Abstract. The sentence “Finally, our data provide an insight into the interactions taking place at the Ω-loop binding pocket, suggesting a binding mechanism for this secondary structure element.” was also removed from the conclusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
