Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here, we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We adopted a task for head-fixed mice that assays perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In science, it is of vital importance that multiple studies corroborate the same result. Researchers therefore need to know all the details of previous experiments in order to implement the procedures as exactly as possible. However, this is becoming a major problem in neuroscience, as animal studies of behavior have proven to be hard to reproduce, and most experiments are never replicated by other laboratories.</p><p>Mice are increasingly being used to study the neural mechanisms of decision making, taking advantage of the genetic, imaging and physiological tools that are available for mouse brains. Yet, the lack of standardized behavioral assays is leading to inconsistent results between laboratories. This makes it challenging to carry out large-scale collaborations which have led to massive breakthroughs in other fields such as physics and genetics.</p><p>To help make these studies more reproducible, the International Brain Laboratory (a collaborative research group) et al. developed a standardized approach for investigating decision making in mice that incorporates every step of the process; from the training protocol to the software used to analyze the data. In the experiment, mice were shown images with different contrast and had to indicate, using a steering wheel, whether it appeared on their right or left. The mice then received a drop of sugar water for every correction decision. When the image contrast was high, mice could rely on their vision. However, when the image contrast was very low or zero, they needed to consider the information of previous trials and choose the side that had recently appeared more frequently.</p><p>This method was used to train 140 mice in seven laboratories from three different countries. The results showed that learning speed was different across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete the mice behaved consistently, relying on visual stimuli or experiences to guide their choices in a similar way.</p><p>These results show that complex behaviors in mice can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, providing an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools for studying decision making. This work could serve as a foundation for other groups, paving the way to a more collaborative approach in the field of neuroscience that could help to tackle complex research challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

and reproduced across laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>). Such assays are common in fields such as astronomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fish et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdalla et al., 2018</xref>), physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">CERN Education, Communications and Outreach Group, 2018</xref>), genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>), and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bycroft et al., 2018</xref>), and perhaps rarer in fields such as sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Camerer et al., 2018</xref>) and psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Forscher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Makel et al., 2012</xref>). They are also rare in neuroscience, a field that faces a reproducibility crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Button et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Reproducibility has been a particular concern for measurements of mouse behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kafkafi et al., 2018</xref>). Although the methods can be generally reproduced across laboratories, the results can be surprisingly different (‘methods reproducibility’ vs. ‘results reproducibility’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodman et al., 2016</xref>). Even seemingly simple assays of responses to pain or stress can be swayed by extraneous factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chesler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref>) such as the sex of the experimenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sorge et al., 2014</xref>). Behavioral assays can be difficult to reproduce across laboratories even when they share a similar apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chesler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sorge et al., 2014</xref>). This difficulty is not simply due to genetic variation: behavioral variability is as large in inbred mice as in outbred mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tuttle et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Difficulties in reproducing mouse behavior across laboratories would hinder the increasing number of studies that investigate decision making in mice. Physiological studies of decision making are increasingly carried out in mice to access the unrivaled arsenal of genetic, imaging, and physiological tools available for mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glickfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Connor et al., 2009</xref>). Our collaboration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">International Brain Laboratory, 2017</xref>, aims to leverage these approaches by exploring the neural basis of the same mouse behavior in multiple laboratories. It is thus crucial for this endeavor that the relevant behavioral assays be reproducible both in methods and in results.</p><p>Studying decision-making requires a task that places specific sensory, cognitive, and motor demands over hundreds of trials, affording strong constraints to behavior. The task should be complex enough to expose the neural computations that support decision-making but simple enough for mice to learn, and easily extendable to study further aspects of perception and cognition. Moreover, it can be invaluable to have ready access to the brain for neural recordings and manipulations, a consideration that favors tasks that involve head fixation.</p><p>To meet these criteria, we adopted a modified version of the classical ‘two-alternative forced-choice’ perceptual detection task. In the classical task, the subject indicates the position of a stimulus that can be in one of two positions with equal probability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanner and Swets, 1954</xref>). In the modified version, the probability of the stimulus being in one position changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Terman and Terman, 1972</xref>). This change in probability may affect sensory decisions by directing spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liston and Stone, 2008</xref>) and by biasing the decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanks et al., 2011</xref>). It modifies the expected value of the choices, echoing changes in reward probability or size, which affect perceptual choices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whiteley and Sahani, 2008</xref>) and drive value-based choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corrado et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herrnstein, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lau and Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the task, mice detect the presence of a visual grating to their left or right, and report the perceived location with a simple movement: by turning a steering wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). The task difficulty is controlled by varying the contrast across trials. The reward for a correct response is a drop of sugar water that is not contingent on licking the spout. The probability of stimulus appearance at the two locations is asymmetric and changes across blocks of trials. Mice thus make decisions by using both their vision and their recent experience. When the visual stimulus is evident (contrast is high), they should mostly use vision, and when the visual stimulus is ambiguous (contrast is low or zero), they should consider prior information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whiteley and Sahani, 2008</xref>) and choose the side that has recently been more likely.</p><p>We here present results from a large cohort of mice trained in the task, demonstrating reproducible methods and reproducible results across laboratories. In all laboratories, most mice learned the task, although often at a different pace. After learning they performed the task in a comparable manner, and with no significant difference across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted a comparable reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability.</p><p>To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, we adopt an open science approach: we describe and share the hardware and software components and the experimental protocols. It is increasingly recognized that data and techniques should be made fully available to the broader community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beraldo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Forscher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koscielny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>). Following this approach, we established an open-access data architecture pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonacchi et al., 2020</xref>) and use it to release the &gt;5 million mouse choices at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.internationalbrainlab.org/">data.internationalbrainlab.org</ext-link>. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across laboratories, enabling collaborative studies of brain function in behaving mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To train mice consistently within and across laboratories we developed a standardized training pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

During the subsequent recovery period, we handled the mice and weighed them daily. Following recovery, we put mice on water control and habituated them to the experimental setup (<italic>IBL Protocol for mice training</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">The International Brain Laboratory, 2020b</xref>]). Throughout these steps, we checked for adverse effects such as developing a cataract during surgery or pain after surgery or substantial weight loss following water control (four mice excluded out of 210) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Standardized pipeline and apparatus, and training progression in the basic task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The pipeline for mouse surgeries and training.

Out of 206 mice that started training, 140 achieved proficiency in the basic task, and 98 in the full task (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1d</xref> for training progression and proficiency criteria). The basic task is purely perceptual: the only informative cue is the visual stimulus. The full task instead invites integration of perception with recent experience: when stimuli are ambiguous it is best to choose the more likely option.</p><p>To facilitate reproducibility, we standardized multiple variables, measured multiple other variables, and shared the behavioral data in a database that we inspected regularly. By providing standards and guidelines, we sought to control variables such as mouse strain and provider, age range, weight range, water access, food protein, and fat. We did not attempt to standardize other variables such as light-dark cycle, temperature, humidity, and environmental sound, but we documented and measured them regularly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voelkl et al., 2020</xref>). Data were shared and processed across the collaboration according to a standardized web-based pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonacchi et al., 2020</xref>). This pipeline included a colony management database that stored data about each session and mouse (e.g. session start time, animal weight, etc.), a centralized data repository for files generated in the task (e.g. behavioral responses and compressed video and audio files), and a platform which provided automated analyses and daily visualizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.internationalbrainlab.org/">data.internationalbrainlab.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yatsenko et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Mice were trained in a standardized setup involving a steering wheel placed in front of a screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). The visual stimulus, a grating, appeared at variable contrast on the left or right half of the screen. The stimulus position was coupled with movements of the response wheel, and mice indicated their choices by turning the wheel left or right to bring the grating to the center of the screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). Trials began after the mouse held the wheel still for 0.2–0.5 s and were announced by an auditory ‘go cue’. Correct decisions were rewarded with sweetened water (10% sucrose solution), whereas incorrect decisions were indicated by a noise burst and were followed by a longer inter-trial interval (2 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The experimental setups included systems for head-fixation, visual and auditory stimuli presentation, and recording of video and audio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These were standardized and based on open-source hardware and software (<italic>IBL protocol for setting up the behavioral training rig</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">The International Brain Laboratory, 2021a</xref>]).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Training progression in the basic task</title><p>We begin by describing training in the basic task, where stimuli on the left vs. right appeared with equal probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). This version of the task is purely visual, in that no other information can be used to increase expected reward.</p><p>The training proceeded in automated steps, following predefined criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <italic>IBL Protocol for mice training</italic>). Initially, mice experienced only easy trials with highly visible stimuli (100% and 50% contrast). As performance improved, the stimulus set progressively grew to include contrasts of 25%, 12%, 6%, and finally 0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1b-c</xref>). Stimuli with contrast &gt;0 could appear on the left or the right and thus appeared twice more often than stimuli with 0% contrast. For a typical mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), according to this automated schedule, stimuli with 25% contrast were introduced in training day 10, 12% contrast in Day 12, and the remaining contrasts in Day 13. On this day the 50% contrast trials were dropped, to increase the proportion of low-contrast trials. To reduce response biases, incorrect responses on easy trials (high contrast) were more likely to be followed by a ‘repeat trial’ with the same stimulus contrast and location.</p><p>On each training day, mice were typically trained in a single uninterrupted session, whose duration depended on performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Sessions lasted at most 90 min and ended according to a criterion based on number of trials, total duration, and response times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For instance, for the example mouse, session on Day 2 ended when 45 min elapsed with &lt;400 trials; sessions on Days 7, 10, and 14 ended when trial duration increased to five times above baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The criterion to end a session was not mandatory: some sessions were ended earlier (5,316/10,903 sessions) and others ended later (5,587/10,903 sessions). The latter sessions typically continued for an extra 19 ± 16 trials (median ±m.a.d., 5,587 sessions) longer.</p><p>To encourage vigorous motor responses and to increase the number of trials, the automated protocol increased the motor demands and reduced reward volume over time. At the beginning of training, the wheel gain was high (8 deg/mm), making the stimuli highly responsive to small wheel movements, and rewards were large (3 μL). Once a session had &gt;200 complete trials, the wheel gain was halved to 4 deg/mm and the reward was progressively decreased to 1.5 μL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1b-c</xref>).</p><p>Mouse performance gradually improved until it provided high-quality visual psychometric curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). At first, performance hovered around or below 50%. It could be even below 50% because of no-response trials (which were labeled as incorrect trials in our analyses), systematic response biases, and the bias-correcting procedure that tended to repeat trials following errors on easy trials (at high contrast). Performance then typically increased over days to weeks until mice made only rare mistakes (lapses) on easy trials (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, Day 14).</p><p>Animals were considered to have reached proficiency in the basic task when they had been introduced to all contrast levels, and had met predefined performance criteria based on the parameters of the psychometric curves fitted to the data (Materials and methods). These parameters and the associated criteria were as follows: (1) response bias (estimated from the horizontal position of the psychometric curve): maximum absolute value of &lt;16% contrast; (2) contrast sensitivity (estimated from the slope of the psychometric curve): maximum threshold (1/sensitivity) of 19% contrast; (3) lapse rates (estimated from the asymptotes of the psychometric curve): maximum of 0.2 for their sum. These criteria had to be fulfilled on three consecutive training sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> , <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table d</xref>). The training procedure, performance criteria, and psychometric parameters are described in detail in IBL Protocol for mice training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">The International Brain Laboratory, 2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Training succeeded but with different rates across mice and laboratories</title><p>The training procedures succeeded in all laboratories, but the duration of training varied across mice and laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). There was substantial variation among mice, with the fastest learner achieving basic task proficiency in 3 days, and the slowest after 59 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Estimates of contrast threshold did not vary much during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), with an interquartile range that slightly decreased from 12–29% during the first 10 training days, and 11–23% thereafter.

Mice across laboratories were not systematically biased towards a particular side and the absolute bias was similar across laboratories (9.8 ± 12.1 [s.d.] on average). Likewise, measures of contrast threshold stabilized after the first ~10 sessions, which was on average 17.8 ± 11.7% on average across institutions.</p><p>The variability in performance across mice decreased as training progressed, but it did not disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Variability in performance was larger in the middle of training than towards the end. For example, between training days 15 and 40, when the average performance on easy trials of the mice increased from 80.7% to 91.1%, the variation across mice (s.d.) of performance on easy trials decreased from 19.1% to 10.1%.</p><p>To some extent, a mouse’s performance in the first five sessions predicted how long it would take the mouse to become proficient. A Random Forests decoder applied to change in performance (% correct with easy, high-contrast stimuli) in the first five sessions was able to predict whether a mouse would end up in the bottom quartile of learning speed (the slowest learners) with accuracy of 53% (where chance is 25%). Conversely, the chance of misclassifying a fast-learning, top quartile mouse as a slow-learning, bottom quartile mouse, was only 7%.</p><p>Overall, our procedures succeeded in training tens of mice in each laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Indeed, there was a 80% probability that mice would learn the task within the 40 days that were usually allotted, and when mice were trained for a longer duration, the success rate rose even further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). There was, however, variability in learning rates across mice and laboratories. This variability is intriguing and would present a challenge for projects that aim to study learning. We next ask whether the behavior of trained mice was consistent and reproducible across laboratories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Performance in the basic task was indistinguishable across laboratories</title><p>Once mice achieved basic task proficiency, multiple measures of performance became indistinguishable across laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–e</xref>).

The median time from stimulus onset to feedback (trial duration, a coarse measure of reaction time) was 468 ± 221 ms, showing some differences across laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>, p=0.004, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test). Mice on average performed 719 ± 223 trials per session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). This difference was significant (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, one-way ANOVA) but only in one laboratory relative to the rest.</p><p>Variation in performance across laboratories was so low that we were not able to assign a mouse to a laboratory based on performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Having found little variation in behavioral variables when considered one by one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–e</xref>), we asked whether mice from different laboratories may exhibit characteristic combinations of these variables. We thus trained a Naive Bayes classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>), with 2000 random sub-samples of eight mice per laboratory, to predict lab membership from these behavioral variables. First, we established a positive control, checking that the classifier showed the expected behavior when provided with an informative variable: the time zone in which animals were trained. If the classifier was given this variable during training and testing it performed above chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <italic>Positive control</italic>) and the confusion matrix showed clusters of labs located in the same time zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Next, we trained and tested the classifier on a null distribution obtained by shuffling the lab labels, and as expected we found that the classifier was at chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <italic>Shuffle</italic>). Finally, we trained and tested the classifier on the behavioral data, and found that it performed at chance level, failing to identify the laboratory of origin of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <italic>Mouse behavior</italic>). Its mean accuracy was 0.12 ± 0.051, and a 95th percentile of its distribution included the chance level of 0.11 (mean of the null distribution). The classifications were typically off-diagonal in the confusion matrix, and hence incorrect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Similar results were obtained with two other classifier algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d–i</xref>).</p><p>This consistency across laboratories was not confined to the three sessions that led to proficiency, and was observed both in earlier and in later sessions. We repeated our analyses for three sessions that led to mice achieving a looser definition of proficiency: a single criterion of 80% correct for easy stimuli, without criteria on response bias and contrast threshold. In these three sessions, which could be earlier but not later than the ones analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, mouse behavior was again consistent across laboratories: a decoder failed to identify the origin of a mouse based on its behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, we repeated our analysis for sessions obtained after the mouse achieved proficiency in the basic task. We selected the first three sessions of the full task, and again found no significant difference across laboratories: mice had similar performance at high contrast, similar contrast threshold, and similar response bias across laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Performance in the full task was indistinguishable across laboratories</title><p>After training the mice in the purely sensory, basic task, we introduced them to the <italic>full task</italic>, where optimal performance requires integration of sensory perception with recent experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). Specifically, we introduced block-wise biases in the probability of stimulus location, and therefore the more likely correct choice. Sessions started with a block of unbiased trials (50:50 probability of left vs. right) and then alternated between blocks of variable length (20–100 trials) biased toward the right (20:80 probability) or toward the left (80:20 probability) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In these blocks, the probability of 0% contrast stimuli was doubled to match the probability of other contrasts. The transition between blocks was not signaled, so the mice had to estimate a prior for stimulus location based on recent task statistics.

Mice incorporated block priors into their choices already from the first sessions in which they were exposed to this full task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5a</xref>). To assess proficiency in the full task, we used a fixed set of criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We considered performance in the three sessions in which mice reached proficiency on the full task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). For mice that reached full task proficiency, the average training from start to finish took 31.5 ± 16.1 days, or 20,494 ± 10,980 trials (s.d., n = 98). The example mouse from Lab 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, black) took 19 days. The fastest learner achieved proficiency in 8 days (4691 trials), the slowest 81 days (61,316 trials). The curves for the 20:80 and 80:20 blocks were shifted relative to the curve for the 50:50 block, with mice more likely to choose right in the 20:80 blocks (where right stimuli appeared 80% of the time) and to choose left in the 80:20 blocks (where left stimuli appeared 80% of the time). As expected, block structure had the greatest impact on choices when sensory evidence was absent (contrast = 0%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In these conditions, it makes sense for the mice to be guided by recent experience, and thus to choose differently depending on the block prior.</p><p>Changes in block type had a similar effect on mice in all laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>). The average shift in rightward choices was invariably highest at 0% contrast, where rightward choices in the two blocks differed by an average of 28.5%. This value did not significantly differ across laboratories any more than it differed within laboratories (one-way ANOVA F(6) = 1.345, p=0.2455, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>).</p><p>An analysis of the psychometric curves showed highly consistent effects of block type, with no significant differences across laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–i</xref>). Changes in block type did not significantly affect the contrast threshold (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, p=0.85, n = 98 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). However, it did change the lapse rates, which were consistently higher on the left in the 20:80 blocks and on the right in the 80:20 blocks (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, lapse left; p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, lapse right; p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). Finally, as expected there was a highly consistent change in overall bias, with curves shifting to the left in 20:80 trials and to the right in 80:20 trials (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>).

Moreover, neither choice fractions nor bias shifts showed within-lab consistency that was larger than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>).

This behavior can arise from insensitivity to the outcome of previous trials and from slow drifts in the decision process across trials, arising from correlations in past choices independently of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lak et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mendonça et al., 2018</xref>). To disentangle these two factors, we corrected for slow across-trial drifts in the decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lak et al., 2020a</xref>). This correction revealed a win-stay/lose-switch strategy in both the basic and full task, which coexists with slow drifts in choice bias across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Moreover, the dependence on history- was modulated by confidence in the previous trial <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lak et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mendonça et al., 2018</xref>). These effects were generally consistent across laboratories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across laboratories, and more generally suggest a path toward improving reproducibility in neuroscience. To study mouse behavior across laboratories, we developed and implemented identical experimental equipment and a standard set of protocols. Not only did mice learn the task in all laboratories, but critically, after learning they performed the task comparably across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories had similar psychophysical performance in a purely sensory version of the task and adopted similar choice strategies in the full task, where they benefited from tracking the stimulus prior probability. Behavior showed variations across sessions and across mice, but these variations were no larger across laboratories than within laboratories.</p><p>Success did not seem guaranteed at the outset, because neuroscience faces a crisis of reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Button et al., 2013</xref>) particularly when it comes to measurements of mouse behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chesler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kafkafi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sorge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tuttle et al., 2018</xref>). To solve this crisis, three solutions have been proposed: large studies, many teams, and upfront registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>). Our approach incorporates all three of these solutions. First, we collected vast amounts of data: 5 million choices from 140 mice. Second, we involved many teams, obtaining data in seven laboratories in three countries. Third, we standardized the experimental protocols and data analyses upfront, which is a key component of pre-registration.</p><p>An element that may have contributed to success is the collaborative, open-science nature of our initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wool and International Brain Laboratory, 2020</xref>). Open-science collaborative approaches are increasingly taking hold in neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beraldo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Forscher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koscielny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>). Our work benefited from collaborative development of the behavioral assay, and from frequent and regular meetings where data were reviewed across laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These meetings helped identify problems at the origin, provide immediate feedback, and find collective solutions. Moreover, our work benefited from constant efforts at standardization. We took great care in standardizing and documenting the behavioral apparatus and the training protocol (see Appendices), to facilitate implementation across our laboratories and to encourage wider adoption by other laboratories. The protocols, hardware designs and software code are open-source and modular, allowing adjustments to accommodate a variety of scientific questions. The data are accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.internationalbrainlab.org/">data.internationalbrainlab.org</ext-link>, and include all &gt;5 million choices made by the mice.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Contribution diagram.</title><p>The following diagram illustrates the contributions of each author, based on the CRediT taxonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brand et al., 2015</xref>).

Previous failures to reproduce mouse behavior across laboratories typically arose in studies of unconstrained behavior such as responses to pain or stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chesler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kafkafi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sorge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tuttle et al., 2018</xref>). Operant behaviors may be inherently more reproducible than the assays used in these studies. To be able to study decision making, and in hopes of achieving reproducibility, we designed a task that engages multiple brain processes from sensory perception and integration of evidence to combination of priors and evidence. It seems likely that reproducibility is easier to achieve if the task requirements are substantial (so there is less opportunity to engage in other behaviors) but not so complex that they fail to motivate and engage. Tasks that are too simple and unconstrained or too arbitrary and difficult may be hard to reproduce.</p><p>There are of course multiple ways to improve on our results, for example by clarifying, and if desired resolving, the differences in learning rate across mice, both within and across laboratories. The learning rate is a factor that we had not attempted to control, and we cannot here ascertain the causes of its variability. We suspect that it might arise partly from variations in the expertise and familiarity of different labs with visual neuroscience and mouse behavior, which may impede standardization. If so, perhaps as experimenters gain further experience the differences in learning times will decrease. Indeed, an approach to standardizing learning rates might be to introduce full automation in behavioral training by reducing or even removing the need for human intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poddar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Variability in learning rates may be further reduced by individualized, dynamic training methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bak et al., 2016</xref>). If desired, such methods could also be aimed at obtaining uniform numbers of trials and reaction times across laboratories.</p><p>It would be fruitful to characterize the behavior beyond the turning of the wheel, analyzing the movement of the limbs. Here we only analyzed whether the wheel was turned to the left or to the right, but to turn the wheel the mice move substantial parts of their body, and they do so in diverse ways (e.g. some use two hands, others use one, and so on). Through videography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) one could classify these movements and perhaps identify behavioral strategies that provide insight in the performance of the task and into the diversity of behavior that we observed across sessions and across mice.</p><p>We hope that this large, curated dataset will serve as a benchmark for testing better models of decision-making. The model of choice that we used here, based on stimuli, choice history, reward history, and bias, is only a starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busse et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the ‘perseverance’ that we represented by the reward history weights can arise from slow fluctuations in decision process over trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lak et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mendonça et al., 2018</xref>) and history-dependence is modulated by confidence in the previous trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lak et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lak et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Urai et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, our data can help investigate phenomena such as the origin of lapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwood et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pisupati et al., 2021</xref>), the tracking of changes between prior blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norton et al., 2019</xref>), the effect of fluctuating engagement states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>), and the dynamics of trial-by-trial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roy et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To encourage and support community adoption of this task, we provide detailed methods and protocols. These methods and protocols provide a path to training mice in this task and reproducing their behavior across laboratories, but of course we cannot claim that they constitute the optimal path. In designing our methods, we made many choices that were based on intuition rather than rigorous experimentation. We don’t know what is crucial in these methods and what is not.</p><p>The reproducibility of this mouse behavior makes it a good candidate for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying decision making. A reproducible behavioral task can be invaluable to establish the neural basis of behavior. If different studies use the same task, they can directly compare their findings. There are indeed illustrious examples of behavioral tasks that serve this role. For studying decision-making in primates, these include the tactile flutter comparison task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Lafuente and Romo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Romo et al., 2012</xref>) and the random dots visual discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ding and Gold, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newsome et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>). Both tasks have been used in multiple studies to record from different brain regions while enabling a meaningful comparison of the results. Conversely, without a standardized behavioral task we face the common situation where different laboratories record from different neurons in different regions in different tasks, likely drawing different conclusions and likely not sharing their data. In that situation it is not possible to establish which factors determine the different conclusions and come to a collective understanding.</p><p>Now that we have developed this task and established its reproducibility across laboratories, the International Brain Laboratory is using it together with neural recordings, which are performed in different laboratories and combined into a single large data set. Other laboratories that adopt this task for studies of neural function will then be able to rely on this large neural dataset to complement their more focused results. Moreover, they will be able to compare each other’s results, knowing that any difference between them is unlikely to be due to differences in behavior. We also hope that these resources catalyze the development of new adaptations and variations of our approach, and accelerate the use of mice in high quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates of decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures and experiments were carried out in accordance with the local laws and following approval by the relevant institutions: the Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body of University College London; the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Princeton University, and University of California at Berkeley; the University Animal Welfare Committee of New York University; and the Portuguese Veterinary General Board.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals (all female and male C57BL6/J mice aged 3–7 months obtained from Jackson Laboratory or Charles River) were co-housed whenever possible, with a minimum enrichment of nesting material and a mouse house.

Then the head was positioned such that there was a 0 degree angle between bregma and lambda in all directions.

Briefly, all labs installed standardized behavioral rigs consisting of an LCD screen (LP097Q × 1, LG), a custom 3D-printed mouse holder and head bar fixation clamp to hold a mouse such that its forepaws rest on a steering wheel (86652 and 32019, LEGO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). Silicone tubing controlled by a pinch valve (225P011-21, NResearch) was used to deliver water rewards to the mouse. The general structure of the rig was constructed from Thorlabs parts and was placed inside an acoustical cabinet (9U acoustic wall cabinet 600 × 600, Orion). To measure the precise times of changes in the visual stimulus (which is important for future neural recordings), a patch of pixels on the LCD screen flipped between white and black at every stimulus change, and this flip was captured with a photodiode (Bpod Frame2TTL, Sanworks). Ambient temperature, humidity, and barometric air pressure were measured with the Bpod Ambient module (Sanworks), wheel position was monitored with a rotary encoder (05.2400.1122.1024, Kubler) connected to a Bpod Rotary Encoder Module (Sanworks). Video of the mouse was recorded with a USB camera (CM3-U3-13Y3M-CS, Point Grey). A speaker (HPD-40N16PET00-32, Peerless by Tymphany) was used to play task-related sounds, and an ultrasonic microphone (Ultramic UM200K, Dodotronic) was used to record ambient noise from the rig. All task-related data was coordinated by a Bpod State Machine (Sanworks). The task logic was programmed in Python and the visual stimulus presentation and video capture was handled by Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>) and the Bonsai package BonVision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lopes et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Habituation, training, and experimental protocol</title><p>For a detailed protocol on animal training, see Protocol 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">The International Brain Laboratory, 2020b</xref>). Mice were water restricted or given access to citric acid water on weekends. The advantage of the latter solution is that it does not require measuring precise amounts of fluids during the weekend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Urai et al., 2021</xref>). Mice were handled for at least 10 min and given water in hand for at least two consecutive days prior to head fixation. On the second of these days, mice were also allowed to freely explore the rig for 10 min. Subsequently, mice were gradually habituated to head fixation over three consecutive days (15–20, 20–40, and 60 min, respectively), observing an association between the visual grating and the reward location. On each trial, with the steering wheel locked, mice passively viewed a Gabor stimulus (100% contrast, 0.1 cycles/degree spatial frequency, random phase, vertical orientation) presented on a small screen (size: approx. 246 mm diagonal active display area). The screen was positioned 8 cm in front of the animal and centralized relative to the position of eyes to cover ~102 visual degree azimuth. The stimulus appeared for ~10 s randomly presented at −35° (left),+35° (right), or 0° (center) and the mouse received a reward in the latter case (3 µl water with 10% sucrose).</p><p>On the fourth day, the steering wheel was unlocked and coupled to the movement of the stimulus. For each trial, the mouse must use the wheel to move the stimulus from its initial location to the center to receive a reward. Initially, the stimulus moved 8°/mm of movement at the wheel surface. Once the mouse completed at least 200 trials within a session, the gain of the wheel for the following sessions was halved, to at 4°/mm. At the beginning of each trial, the mouse was required to not move the wheel for a quiescence period of 200–500 ms (randomly drawn from an exponential distribution with a mean of 350 ms). If the wheel moved during this period, the timer was reset. After the quiescence period, the stimulus appeared on either the left or right (±35° azimuth, within the field of binocular vision in mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seabrook et al., 2017</xref>) with a contrast randomly selected from a predefined set (initially, 50% and 100%). Simultaneously, an onset tone (5 kHz sine wave, 10 ms ramp) was played for 100 ms. When the stimulus appeared, the mouse had 60 s to move it. A response was registered if the center of the stimulus crossed the ±35 deg azimuth line from its original position (simple threshold crossing, no holding period required) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). If the mouse correctly moved the stimulus 35° to the center of the screen, it immediately received a 3 μL reward; if it incorrectly moved the stimulus 35° away from the center (20° visible and the rest off-screen), it received a timeout. Reward delivery was therefore not contingent on licking, and as such licking was not monitored online during the task. If the mouse responded incorrectly or failed to reach either threshold within the 60 s window, a noise burst was played for 500 ms and the inter-trial interval was set to 2 s. If the response was incorrect and the contrast was 'easy' (≥50%), a ‘repeat’ trial followed, in which the previous stimulus contrast and location was presented with a high probability (see Protocol 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">The International Brain Laboratory, 2020b</xref>]). When in the rig, the animal was monitored via a camera to ensure the experiment was proceeding well (e.g. lick spout reachable, animal engaged).</p><p>To declare a mouse proficient in the basic task (‘Level 1’) we used two consecutive sets of criteria. The first set, called ‘1a’, were introduced in September 2018, before training started on the mice that appear in this paper (January 2019). These criteria were obtained by analyzing the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lak et al., 2020b</xref> and were verified on pilot data acquired in 3 of our labs. The second set, called ‘1b’, was introduced shortly afterwards (September 2019) and was applied to 60 of the 140 mice. It was more stringent, to offset possible decreases in performance that may occur during subsequent neural recordings. For a thorough definition of the training criteria, see Appendix 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">The International Brain Laboratory, 2020b</xref>) section ‘Criteria to assess learning &gt;Trained’. Briefly, the 1a/1b criteria called for the mouse to reach the following targets in three consecutive sessions: 200/400 completed trials; performance on easy trials &gt; 80%/90%; and fitted psychometric curves with absolute bias &lt;16%/10%, contrast threshold &lt;19%/20%, lapse rates &lt; 0.2/0.1. Additionally, the 1b criteria required for median reaction times across the three sessions for the 0% contrast trials to be &lt;2 s.</p><p>Out of the 206 mice that we trained, 66 did not complete Level one for the following reasons: 16 mice died or were culled due to infection, illness or injury; 17 mice could not be trained due to experimental impediments (e.g. too many mice in the pipeline, experimenter ill, broken equipment); 14 mice did not learn in 40 days of training due to extremely high bias and/or low trial count (n = 9) or an otherwise low performance (n = 5); 12 mice reached at least the first level within 40 days but progressed too slowly or were too old. For the remaining seven mice, the reason was undocumented.</p><p>Once an animal was proficient in the basic task, it proceeded to the full task. Here, the trial structure was identical, except that stimuli were more likely to reappear on the same side for variable blocks of trials, and counterbiasing ‘repeat’ trials were not used. Each session began with 90 trials in which stimuli were equally likely to appear on the left or right (10 repetitions at each contrast), after which the probability of the stimulus appearing on the left alternated between 0.8 and 0.2 for a given block. The number of trials in each block was on average 51, and was drawn from a geometric distribution, truncated to have values between 20 and 100.</p><p>To declare a mouse proficient in the full task, its performance was assessed using three successive sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). For each of the sessions, the mouse had to perform at least 400 trials, with a performance of at least 90% correct on 100% contrast trials. Also, using a combination of all the trials of the three sessions, the lapses (both left and right, and for each of the block types) had to be below 0.1, the bias above 5, and the median reaction time on 0% contrast over 2 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Psychometric curves</title><p>To obtain a psychometric curve, the data points were fitted with the following parametric error function, using a maximum likelihood procedure:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>/</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the probability of a rightward choice, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the stimulus contrast, and the rest are fitted parameters:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>γ is the lapse rate for left stimuli</p></list-item><list-item><p>λ is the lapse rate for right stimuli</p></list-item><list-item><p>µ is the response bias</p></list-item><list-item><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the contrast threshold.</p></list-item></list><p>The procedures to fit these curves and obtain these parameters are described in detail in Protocol 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">The International Brain Laboratory, 2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Classification of laboratory membership</title><p>Three different classifiers were used to try to predict in which laboratory a mouse was trained based on behavioral metrics: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary</p><p>In this manuscript, the International Brain Laboratory, an international consortium for systems neuroscience, reports their development of a mouse 2-alternative forced choice behavioral paradigm that incorporates both a perceptual decision (visual detection of a grating stimulus on the left side or right side) and the effect of priors/expectation on that decision (disproportionate presentation of the grating on the left or right side in alternating blocks of trials). The goal of the project was to develop a standardized task to address the crisis of reproducibility in rodent behavioral studies, with the overarching contention that variance in experimental results could be due to behavioral variability arising from methodological differences between labs. To address this issue, the consortium labs collectively planned the task and standardized the apparatus, software and training regimen for the 2AFC task; they set unified benchmarks for performance at different timepoints; and they met frequently to update each other on progress and to address pitfalls.</p><p>The results were mostly similar across laboratories, only with significant differences in the learning rates, and behavioral metrics that were not explicitly trained (trial duration and number of trials). However, once the mice learned the task, the behavior was extremely similar. Indeed, using the results from all laboratories, a classifier could not identify better from which laboratory the results came from in comparison to the shuffled results. Although it appears that the remaining variability in learning rates and some other task parameters still present some limitations in their standardization, the authors present evidence supporting a successful standardization in a behavioral paradigm.</p><p>Overall, all three reviewers thought that this is an important report that warrants publication at <italic>eLife</italic>. One reviewer thought that this is a landmark paper, which reports a fruitful, admirable, and convincing effort to demonstrate it is possible to achieve reproducibility in both methods and results of a perceptual decision-making task, across different laboratories around the world. However, all the reviewers raised various concerns regarding the methodology as well as the validity of specific conclusions. Furthermore, two reviewers thought that it would be helpful to clarify the merit of standardization in neuroscience. We therefore would like to invite the authors to respond to these concerns and suggestions before making a final decision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. One of the main points of the manuscript is that standardization of equipment, training procedures, and behavioral results has been achieved across labs. We regard this as a great achievement. Some of the metrics demonstrating this are shown in Figure 3b,c,d,e. However, these metrics are shown only for successfully trained animals, and the definition of successful training is that the animal has reached a given threshold on these metrics. In other words, only animals that have a metric within a narrow range are chosen to be included in the plots, and therefore, to some extent it is not surprising that all the animals in the plot lie within a narrow range. Furthermore, to someone reading the manuscript quickly, they might get the impression that the tight similarity across labs in 3b,c,d,e was not a result of selecting mice for inclusion in the figure, but instead a more surprising outcome. The main point here is that it would help if the authors expanded on this point and emphasized further clarity on it, since it is so central to the manuscript. (For example, if the criteria for successful training were simply a threshold on % correct, would one find similarity across labs in the chosen metrics to the same degree as with the selection procedure currently used?)</p><p>Along this line, to increase the clarity, it would be helpful to add some of the key parameters of the behavioral experiment to the methods, which are currently likely included only in the appendix. For example, what are the criteria for a successful trial? (how far can the mouse overshoot for it to count as a correct choice, how large is the target zone, how long does the stimulus need to be held there, or does it simply need to move it across the center line). Furthermore, how and at which stage in the project were these criteria for successful trials and animal exclusions established – before or after collecting the data?</p><p>2. Out of 210 mice, at least 66 subjects did not learn the basic task, and another 42 mice did not learn the full task version. It would be valuable to know which steps made the learning of the task difficult for these subjects and propose alternatives that might improve the number of subjects that learns the task. Were the subjects having difficulties to stop licking? Were mice not learning how to turn the wheel?</p><p>3. Related to the above point, do the authors know that the standardized protocol actually reduced end-point variability? One reviewer expressed that any behavioral neuroscientist would expect that if labs were really careful and open in standardizing their methodology, they should obtain similar behavioral performance from animals. Or to restate, how would one have interpreted the alternative result, that the different labs had found different performance? The obvious assumption would be that one or more labs screwed up and didn't follow the standardized protocol closely enough. We understand that the manuscript is intended as a technical resource but there is something vaguely disquieting about a report for which one possible outcome, non-uniform mouse behavior among labs, is almost surely discarded. If the effort is testing a hypothesis such as standardization enables consistent results, it would have been better to have conducted the study with pre-registration of the experiments and hypotheses, with a test of an alternative hypothesis (less strict standardization is sufficient). While the findings of uniform behavior is satisfying, we would like to hear how the authors would address these concerns.</p><p>4. In addition to the difference in learning rates, there was a significant difference in the number of trials. This could be due to differences in the session duration, which was not fixed but an experimenter would decide when it was convenient to end it. Thus, it could be that subjects that had longer sessions had the opportunity to complete a higher number of trials, and then learn the task in fewer sessions. Is the number of days to reach the learning criterion less variable across labs and mice if you group mice into sets of mice with similar not-explicitly trained variables (e.g., similar session durations, or similar number of trials per session)?</p><p>5. In motivating the task design, the authors claim to have combined perceptual decision-making with an assay from value-based decision making specifically two-armed bandits in referring to their stimulus-probability manipulation. However, all the references that the authors cite and two-armed bandits in general, manipulate probability/magnitude of rewards and NOT stimuli. In fact, the stimulus probability manipulation falls squarely under the realm of perceptual tasks (such as Hanks et al., 2011). Authors should remove their claims about value-based decision-making and cite appropriate studies for this stimulus prior manipulation instead of the incorrect references to bandit tasks.</p><p>6. Two reviewers raised the concern that it is unclear whether standardization in neurobiological experiments really facilitates scientific developments in the field. It would be useful for the field if the authors add some speculation of why they think it will be important to use a standardized behavioral protocol (i.e. where they see the advantage and how it will accelerate our understanding of brain function). Currently, most of the arguments are of the form 'standardization for the sake of standardization' – one could argue that a standardized task has similar potential pitfalls as if everybody would work on mouse visual cortex to try to understand cortical function. This would be up to the authors but given that a paper like this is rather rare, it would inspiring if the authors did that.</p><p>7. The authors used the animals' accuracy on the highest contrast gratings as a measure of progress in learning the task. However, this information is not immediately available had to dig into the figure legends to realize that. It would be helpful to label the y-axis on those figures to indicate that accuracy was defined for the highest-contrast trials.</p><p>8. It would be very helpful to have supplementary figures similar to the panels in Figure 2, but for bias and sensitivity (starting from when bias and sensitivity can be measured, of course.)</p><p>9. The reward is a very important component of the task. However, important details about the reward delivery system and whether licking is being tracked (through voltage/LED sensor or through video?) are missing. Is the reward immediately delivered after the correct response is emitted, even if the mouse has not licked the spout yet? Or is reward delivery contingent with licking? The reward delivery system is not included in the set-up scheme (Figure 1).</p><p>10. Please define precision and recall variables in Equation 1.</p><p>11. Please add an explanation of why a Frame2TTL is necessary &quot;LCD screen refresh times were captured with a Bpod Frame2TTL (Sanworks)&quot;. Could it be that it allows a higher temporal precision track of when the stimuli are being delivered?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Standardized and reproducible measurement of decision-making in mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Michael Frank (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>In this manuscript, the International Brain Laboratory, an international consortium for systems neuroscience, reports their development of a mouse 2-alternative forced choice behavioral paradigm that incorporates both a perceptual decision and the effect of priors/expectation on that decision. The authors find that the behavioral performance of the mice was largely consistent across the laboratories although there was some variability in the learning rate. This study provides the neuroscience community with valuable information regarding their efforts to achieve consistent behaviors as well as detailed protocols.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and all reviewers agreed that the manuscript warrants publication at <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are several remaining issues that the reviewers raised. The reviewers therefore would like to ask the authors to address these points before finalizing the manuscript.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers thought that the manuscript has been greatly improved. While Reviewers 1 and 2 thought that the authors have fully addressed the previous concerns, Reviewer 2 asks several clarifications to which the authors should be able to address by revising the text. Reviewer 3 remains concerned that the authors' conclusions are still based on animals selected based on performance although the authors have now provided less selective criterion. Please revise the manuscript to address these issues before finalizing the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have adequately addressed my initial concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>We feel the paper could be published as is. We have a few final minor comments that could be straightforwardly addressed in writing.</p><p>1. The authors have corrected their description of the prior manipulation in the main text, clarifying that what they study in the manuscript is not what is usually studied in value-based decision-making tasks. However, they have not modified the abstract. The claim in the abstract about combining &quot;established assays of perceptual and value-based decision-making&quot; is not really correct. Please update this.</p><p>2. Overall, we believe the authors may have missed a good opportunity. Two out of the three reviewers felt the manuscript did not sufficiently articulate the value of the approach. A few lines were added to the discussion, but we feel more could have been done.</p><p>3. It would be helpful to readers if the authors comment on why this study and Roy 2021 (which analyzes the very same dataset) reach different conclusions about the evolution of contrast threshold over training. Roy 2021 claims that the contrast threshold decreases (i.e. sensory weights increases) over trials but the authors here report that it doesn't change much during training. (Lines 187-190).</p><p>4. The authors did explain why some subjects did not complete level 1, which include death, illness, or technical reasons. However, some subjects struggled with learning the first stage of the task (high bias, low performance, slow progress; n = 26 or 32), and another 42 mice did not learn the full task version. It would be desirable that the authors identify steps during training that hinder learning and which modifications would be made to tackle this issue. Maybe identifying the phase of the training when the learning curve of this slow- or non-learners diverges from proficient-subjects would allow further insight.</p><p>5. &quot;All the papers on the subject told us that we should expect failure to replicate behavioral results across laboratories.&quot; Most of the papers cited did not report issues in replicating highly-stereotyped operant (i.e., turn left-right, press lever, lick) rodent behavior. If the authors have references describing highly-stereotyped operant rodent behavior that, used by different laboratories, turned out in discrepant behavioral results, these would be great to add.</p><p>6. Please include a section in Methods about how contrast threshold, bias etc. as reported in Figure 1-4 were inferred from choices.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>It appears there is a key piece of information missing in the authors responses describing their new analysis to address the concern of circularity in their conclusions (only including animals that learned to compare learning across laboratories). I can't find any information on how many mice were included in this less restrictive analysis (i may be missing this – but then this should be made more prominent). Why do the authors not include all mice for all analysis? Would that not be the point of standardizing behavior?</p><p>Overall, I do not feel the manuscript has improved much. Happy to provide a more thorough review, but the question above would seem central to answer first. Also, if this is the authors idea of a vision statement (or the reason for doing this in the first place) &quot;Now that we have developed this task and established its reproducibility across laboratories, we are using it together with neural recordings, which are performed in different laboratories and combined into a single large data set. Other laboratories that adopt this task for studies of neural function will then be able to rely on this large neural dataset to complement their more focused results. Moreover, they will be able to compare each other's results knowing that any difference between them is unlikely to be due to differences in behavior.&quot; We, as a field, are in dire straits.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63711.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Following the reviewers’ suggestions we added an additional analysis: instead of setting criteria on all three measures of behavior (% correct at high contrast, response bias, and contrast threshold), we set a criterion only on the first measure, putting the threshold at 80% correct. The sessions that led to this looser criterion thus were generally earlier, and no later, than the 3 sessions in Figure 3. The results are shown in a new figure (Figure 3 – supplement 4). As explained in Results, this new analysis gave similar results as the previous one: we found no significant differences in bias and sensory threshold across laboratories. Indeed, similar to the result obtained with the original training criteria, a decoder failed to identify the origin of a mouse based on its psychometric performance. This new analysis, therefore, confirms our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along this line, to increase the clarity, it would be helpful to add some of the key parameters of the behavioral experiment to the methods, which are currently likely included only in the appendix.

If the effort is testing a hypothesis such as standardization enables consistent results, it would have been better to have conducted the study with pre-registration of the experiments and hypotheses, with a test of an alternative hypothesis (less strict standardization is sufficient). While the findings of uniform behavior is satisfying, we would like to hear how the authors would address these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not have discarded our results if they had been negative because we are part of a large open-science effort that was known to the public (we published our manifesto in <italic>Neuron</italic> in 2018) and that involved a large number of stakeholders: multiple funders, multiple labs, multiple students and postdocs. Whatever the result, we would have had to publish it, both for reasons of scientific fairness and of duties to the funders and more practically to recognize the work done by students and postdocs.</p><p>A similar consideration, indeed, applies to previous efforts to replicate behavioral results across labs. Indeed, there are many papers on failure to replicate mouse behavior across labs, and zero papers about success. Whenever multiple labs get together and try to establish methods that are shared and reproducible, one can expect a paper reporting the results.</p><p>This is arguably another advantage of team science, it keeps things honest, preventing the burying of negative results. In this sense, it is a form of pre-registration. At a larger scale, this happens routinely in high-energy physics: it is widely known that a particle accelerator is being run on a certain experiment, so we can be sure that the results of the experiment will be released whether they are positive or negative.</p><p>As for the alternative hypothesis, it is possible that a somewhat lower degree of standardization would have sufficed, but none of our standardized procedures would be particularly onerous on a lab that would like to adopt our methods, so we do not see this as a pressing matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In addition to the difference in learning rates, there was a significant difference in the number of trials. This could be due to differences in the session duration, which was not fixed but an experimenter would decide when it was convenient to end it. Thus, it could be that subjects that had longer sessions had the opportunity to complete a higher number of trials, and then learn the task in fewer sessions. Is the number of days to reach the learning criterion less variable across labs and mice if you group mice into sets of mice with similar not-explicitly trained variables (e.g., similar session durations, or similar number of trials per session)?</p></disp-quote><p>We see the reviewer’s point: mice that performed longer sessions might learn in fewer days simply because they are doing more trials per day. To address this possibility we have made a new Supplementary figure (Figure 2 – supplement 1) where we plotted performance as a function of trial number rather than day of training. The results remained the same. This is now discussed in a new paragraph in Results. We also added results about learning as a function of trials in Figure 2 – supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In motivating the task design, the authors claim to have combined perceptual decision-making with an assay from value-based decision making specifically two-armed bandits in referring to their stimulus-probability manipulation. However, all the references that the authors cite and two-armed bandits in general, manipulate probability/magnitude of rewards and NOT stimuli. In fact, the stimulus probability manipulation falls squarely under the realm of perceptual tasks (such as Hanks et al., 2011). Authors should remove their claims about value-based decision-making and cite appropriate studies for this stimulus prior manipulation instead of the incorrect references to bandit tasks.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and for alerting us to the study by Hanks and colleagues, which we now cite. We have rewritten that paragraph in Introduction, to make more links to studies of perceptual decision making, and to clarify that the analogy with two-armed bandit tasks applies only to the case where there are no stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Two reviewers raised the concern that it is unclear whether standardization in neurobiological experiments really facilitates scientific developments in the field. It would be useful for the field if the authors add some speculation of why they think it will be important to use a standardized behavioral protocol (i.e. where they see the advantage and how it will accelerate our understanding of brain function). Currently, most of the arguments are of the form 'standardization for the sake of standardization' – one could argue that a standardized task has similar potential pitfalls as if everybody would work on mouse visual cortex to try to understand cortical function. This would be up to the authors but given that a paper like this is rather rare, it would inspiring if the authors did that.</p></disp-quote><p>The current situation for labs where animals perform tasks is that every lab does a slightly different task and records from different neurons. If results disagree, one does not know if that’s because the task is different or because the neurons are different. We are trying to remedy this situation, providing a standard that could be useful to many laboratories. Such standards are sorely needed whenever there is an effort that requires more than one laboratory.</p><p>We think this comes across in the paper but to be sure it does, we have added sentences in the last paragraph of Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors used the animals' accuracy on the highest contrast gratings as a measure of progress in learning the task. However, this information is not immediately available had to dig into the figure legends to realize that. It would be helpful to label the y-axis on those figures to indicate that accuracy was defined for the highest-contrast trials.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed Figure 1e to clarify that it’s performance on easy trials, and we added a clarification in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It would be very helpful to have supplementary figures similar to the panels in Figure 2, but for bias and sensitivity (starting from when bias and sensitivity can be measured, of course.)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we have added 16 panels to Figure 2 to show this. New text in Results describes those data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The reward is a very important component of the task. However, important details about the reward delivery system and whether licking is being tracked (through voltage/LED sensor or through video?) are missing. Is the reward immediately delivered after the correct response is emitted, even if the mouse has not licked the spout yet? Or is reward delivery contingent with licking? The reward delivery system is not included in the set-up scheme (Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the Methods to explain that reward was not contingent on licking, and therefore licking was not tracked online. We also added a sentence mentioning the video tracking of the animal during the experiment. We replaced the schematic of the rig in Figure 1c, to include the reward spout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Please define precision and recall variables in Equation 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now simplified the language and the description, and we now have dropped the words “F1 score”, “precision”, and “recall”, opting for the simpler “decoding accuracy”. The equation that describes accuracy ( equation 1) is simpler but it is mathematically equivalent to our previous equation defining F1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Please add an explanation of why a Frame2TTL is necessary &quot;LCD screen refresh times were captured with a Bpod Frame2TTL (Sanworks)&quot;. Could it be that it allows a higher temporal precision track of when the stimuli are being delivered?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, which led us to explain this rationale in Methods.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers thought that the manuscript has been greatly improved. While Reviewers 1 and 2 thought that the authors have fully addressed the previous concerns, Reviewer 2 asks several clarifications to which the authors should be able to address by revising the text. Reviewer 3 remains concerned that the authors' conclusions are still based on animals selected based on performance although the authors have now provided less selective criterion. Please revise the manuscript to address these issues before finalizing the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>We feel the paper could be published as is. We have a few final minor comments that could be straightforwardly addressed in writing.</p><p>1. The authors have corrected their description of the prior manipulation in the main text, clarifying that what they study in the manuscript is not what is usually studied in value-based decision-making tasks. However, they have not modified the abstract. The claim in the abstract about combining &quot;established assays of perceptual and value-based decision-making&quot; is not really correct. Please update this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have now fixed this. We replaced “designed” with “adopted”, and we removed “combines”. The resulting sentence reads: “We adopted a task for head-fixed mice that assays perceptual and value-based decision making.” Indeed, the task assays perceptual decision making because performing it well requires sensory processing; it assays value-based decision making because at zero contrast it is exactly the same as a two-armed bandit task. In Introduction we clarify that the task was developed by people who study perceptual decision making, as the reviewers have pointed out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Overall, we believe the authors may have missed a good opportunity. Two out of the three reviewers felt the manuscript did not sufficiently articulate the value of the approach. A few lines were added to the discussion, but we feel more could have been done.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pushing us in this direction.</p><p>We have made some edits to the Introduction, where the first three paragraphs explain that (1) Progress in science depends on reproducibility, but neuroscience faces a crisis of reproducibility; (2) Reproducibility has been a particular concern for measurements of mouse behavior; (3) A difficulty in reproducing mouse behavior across laboratories would be problematic for the increasing number of studies that investigate decision making in the mouse. Also in Introduction, we have strengthened the point about the value of Open Science approaches.</p><p>We have also added a paragraph in Discussion: “A reproducible behavioral task can be invaluable to establish the neural basis of behavior. If different studies use the same task, they can directly compare their findings. There are indeed illustrious examples of behavioral tasks that serve this role. For studying decision-making in primates, these include the tactile flutter comparison task […] and the random dots visual discrimination task […]. Both tasks have been used in multiple studies to record from different brain regions while enabling a meaningful comparison of the results. Conversely, without a standardized behavioral task we face the common situation where different laboratories record from different neurons in different regions in different tasks, likely drawing different conclusions and likely not sharing their data. In that situation it is not possible to establish which factors determine the different conclusions and come to a collective understanding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be helpful to readers if the authors comment on why this study and Roy 2021 (which analyzes the very same dataset) reach different conclusions about the evolution of contrast threshold over training. Roy 2021 claims that the contrast threshold decreases (i.e. sensory weights increases) over trials but the authors here report that it doesn't change much during training. (Lines 187-190).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up. We have added some quantification, which shows a modest decrease in threshold during the first days of training. We also added a summary across laboratories that illustrates this effect more clearly (black curve in Figure 2e-f).</p><p>However these effects cannot be directly compared to those examined by Roy et al. (2021), for two reasons: (1) Roy et al. use a method that can look at all sessions, even the earliest ones where there are only two (high) contrasts per side, whereas our analysis requires having more contrasts so that we can fit a psychometric curve; (2) The model by Roy et al. involves no equivalent of a lapse rate. Mice can improve the performance in the task by both decreasing their lapse rate and/or putting more weight on the sensory evidence. Our psychometric model parametrizes both of these features separately; (3) The paper by Roy et al. (2021) used some mice as examples, without attempting to describe a vast dataset as we do here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors did explain why some subjects did not complete level 1, which include death, illness, or technical reasons. However, some subjects struggled with learning the first stage of the task (high bias, low performance, slow progress; n = 26 or 32), and another 42 mice did not learn the full task version. It would be desirable that the authors identify steps during training that hinder learning and which modifications would be made to tackle this issue. Maybe identifying the phase of the training when the learning curve of this slow- or non-learners diverges from proficient-subjects would allow further insight.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. This is an area of ongoing research in our collaboration. To summarize the main result that we have so far, we have added the following paragraph to Results: “To some extent, a mouse’s performance in the first 5 sessions predicted how long it would take the mouse to become proficient. A Random Forests decoder applied to change in performance (% correct with easy, high-contrast stimuli) in the first 5 sessions was able to predict whether a mouse would end up in the bottom quartile of learning speed (the slowest learners) with accuracy of 53% (where chance is 25%). Conversely, the chance of misclassifying a fast-learning, top quartile mouse with a slow-learning, bottom quartile mouse, was only 7%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. &quot;All the papers on the subject told us that we should expect failure to replicate behavioral results across laboratories.&quot; Most of the papers cited did not report issues in replicating highly-stereotyped operant (i.e., turn left-right, press lever, lick) rodent behavior. If the authors have references describing highly-stereotyped operant rodent behavior that, used by different laboratories, turned out in discrepant behavioral results, these would be great to add.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we do already point this out: “Previous failures to reproduce mouse behavior across laboratories typically arose in studies of unconstrained behavior such as responses to pain or stress.” Following the reviewer’s comment we have now added a sentence: “Operant behaviors may be inherently more reproducible”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please include a section in Methods about how contrast threshold, bias etc. as reported in Figure 1-4 were inferred from choices.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Those methods were previously described in the Appendix 2 and we have now moved them to Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>It appears there is a key piece of information missing in the authors responses describing their new analysis to address the concern of circularity in their conclusions (only including animals that learned to compare learning across laboratories). I can't find any information on how many mice were included in this less restrictive analysis (i may be missing this – but then this should be made more prominent). Why do the authors not include all mice for all analysis? Would that not be the point of standardizing behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that this comment refers to the new analysis that we performed in the last round of review, where instead of setting criteria on all three measures of behavior (% correct at high contrast, response bias, and contrast threshold), we set a criterion only on the first measure, putting the threshold at 80% correct. The sessions that led to this looser criterion thus were generally earlier, and no later, than the 3 sessions in Figure 3. This analysis is shown in Figure 3 – supplement 4. Of course we have run this analysis on all mice that passed that criterion (80% correct on easy trial), with no other data selection. We have now updated the figure legend to give the exact number: n = 150.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I do not feel the manuscript has improved much. Happy to provide a more thorough review, but the question above would seem central to answer first. Also, if this is the authors idea of a vision statement (or the reason for doing this in the first place) &quot;Now that we have developed this task and established its reproducibility across laboratories, we are using it together with neural recordings, which are performed in different laboratories and combined into a single large data set. Other laboratories that adopt this task for studies of neural function will then be able to rely on this large neural dataset to complement their more focused results. Moreover, they will be able to compare each other's results knowing that any difference between them is unlikely to be due to differences in behavior.&quot; We, as a field, are in dire straits.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer does not give us guidance as to what would constitute an appropriate “vision statement” in our Discussion. We are thus not sure what is being requested. In hopes of hitting the mark, we have added a new paragraph: “A reproducible behavioral task can be invaluable to establish the neural basis of behavior. If different studies use the same task, they can directly compare their findings. There are indeed illustrious examples of behavioral tasks that serve this role. For studying decision-making in primates, these include the tactile flutter comparison task […] and the random dots visual discrimination task […]. Both tasks have been used in multiple studies to record from different brain regions while enabling a meaningful comparison of the results. Conversely, without a standardized behavioral task we face the common situation where different laboratories record from different neurons in different regions in different tasks, likely drawing different conclusions and likely not sharing their data. In that situation it is not possible to establish which factors determine the different conclusions and come to a collective understanding.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
