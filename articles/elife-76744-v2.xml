Dietary fatty acids can act as inflammatory stimuli, but it is unknown if they can act as the primary stimuli to induce trained immunity. Here we find mice fed a diet enriched exclusively in saturated fatty acids (ketogenic diet; KD) confer a hyper-inflammatory response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased mortality, independent of diet-induced microbiome and hyperglycemia. We find KD alters the composition of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and enhances the response of bone marrow macrophages, monocytes, and splenocytes to secondary LPS challenge. Lipidomics identified enhanced free palmitic acid (PA) and PA-associated lipids in KD-fed mice serum. We found pre-treatment with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA induces a hyper-inflammatory response to LPS in macrophages, and this was dependent on the synthesis of ceramide. In vivo, we found systemic PA confers enhanced inflammation and mortality in response to systemic LPS, and this phenotype was not reversible for up to 7 days post-PA-exposure. Conversely, we find PA exposure enhanced clearance of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Lastly, we show that oleic acid, which depletes intracellular ceramide, reverses PA-induced hyper-inflammation in macrophages and enhanced mortality in response to LPS<italic>.</italic> These implicate enriched dietary SFAs, and specifically PA, in the induction of long-lived innate immune memory and highlight the plasticity of this innate immune reprogramming by dietary constituents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trained immunity</kwd><kwd>innate immune memory</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>palmitic acid</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd><kwd>oleic acid</kwd><kwd>endotoxemia</kwd><kwd>Ketogenic diet</kwd><kwd>Western diet</kwd><kwd>Candida albicans</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIGMS/NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Napier</surname><given-names>Brooke A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Napier</surname><given-names>Brooke A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>US Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VA CDA2 BLRD 1K2BX004523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Napier</surname><given-names>Ruth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enriched dietary SFAs, specifically palmitic acid (PA), induce a broad and long-lived innate immune memory response which is harmful during disease exacerbated by inflammation, but beneficial for pathogen clearance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Historically, immune memory has been defined as a trait limited to the adaptive immune system; however, it is now well established that innate immune cells have the capacity for metabolic, epigenetic, and functional reprogramming that leads to long-lasting increases in host resistance to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Netea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, trained immunity is an adaptation of innate host defense in vertebrates and invertebrates that results from exposure to a primary inflammatory stimulus and leads to a faster and greater response to a secondary challenge. Unlike adaptive memory responses, trained immunity does not require genome rearrangements, B and T lymphocytes, and receptors that recognize specific antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Netea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, trained immunity has been documented in organisms that lack canonical adaptive immune responses, such as plants and invertebrates, suggesting this is a primitive immune memory system that is conserved throughout vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lanz-Mendoza and Contreras-Garduño, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and yeast β-glucans are canonical inducers of trained immunity in humans and stimulate long-lasting metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of myeloid-lineage cells resulting in hyper-responsiveness upon restimulation with heterologous or homologous inflammatory stimuli. This innate immune memory has been shown to be heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katzmarski et al., 2021</xref>) and can last up to months in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Netea et al., 2016</xref>) and, thus, likely evolved to provide non-specific protection from secondary infections. Most recently, it was described that countries with higher rates of BCG vaccine at birth had fewer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Covián et al., 2020</xref>) making this immunological phenomenon extremely relevant. Importantly, it is easily ascertained that inflammatory hyper-responsiveness could be deleterious in the context of diseases where more inflammation can lead to greater pathology (e.g. acute septic shock, autoimmune disorders, and allergies). Thus, trained immunity can be regarded as a double-edged sword – providing increased resistance to tissue-specific infection but exacerbating diseases exacerbated by systemic inflammation. Consequently, identifying novel inducers of trained immunity will provide clinically relevant insight into harnessing innate immune cells to attain long-term therapeutic benefits in a range of infections and inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Typically, the primary inflammatory stimulus that initiates trained immunity is danger- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs); however, recent publications have shown that β-glucan found in mushrooms, baker’s and brewer’s yeast, wheat and oats, and unknown components of bovine milk can induce trained innate immune memory in monocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Splunter et al., 2018</xref>). Our data reported here contribute to the growing evidence supporting the multifaceted immunoregulatory role of certain dietary constituents.</p><p>Currently, Westernized nations are increasingly dependent on diets enriched in saturated fatty acids (SFAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Swinburn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Popkin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christ and Latz, 2019</xref>), which have been shown to mimic PAMP effects on inflammatory cells, regulate innate immune cell function, and alter outcomes of inflammatory disease and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lancaster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meikle and Summers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reyes et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, we have shown the Western diet (WD), a diet enriched in sucrose and SFAs, correlates with increased disease severity and mortality in response to systemic LPS, independent of the diet-dependent microbiota, demonstrating the possibility that the dietary components of this diet may be driving the hyper-responsiveness to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Napier et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, it is unknown if enriched dietary SFAs alone mediate trained immunity.</p><p>Our work presented herein identifies a ketogenic diet (KD) enriched exclusively in SFAs, and not sucrose, confers an increased systemic response to LPS independent of diet-associated microbiome, ketosis, or glycolytic regulation during disease, and alters inflammatory capacity and composition of the hematopoietic compartment. While others have shown that the WD induces trained immunity in atherosclerotic mice (Ldrl<sup>−/−</sup>), we are the first to show that trained immunity, including its hallmark long-term persistence, can be induced in wild-type (WT) mice with exposure to enriched SFAs alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christ et al., 2018</xref>). A lipidomic analysis of blood fat composition after KD exposure revealed a significant increase of free palmitic acid (PA; C16:0) and fatty acid complexes containing PA. PA is known to act synergistically with LPS to enhance intracellular ceramide levels and proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages; however, it is currently unknown if ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid (SG), specifically mediates a heightened inflammatory response to LPS following pre-exposure to PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schilling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Here we find macrophages pre-treated with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA followed by a secondary exposure to LPS lead to enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression and release, which were reversible with the inhibition of ceramide.</p><p>We find that both short- and long-term exposure to PA, the predominant SFA found in high-fat diets, enhance systemic response to microbial ligands in mice even after a 7-day rest period from PA exposure. Thus, our data suggest exposure to PA leads to a long-lasting innate immune memory response in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, trained immunity is induced when a primary inflammatory stimulus changes transcription of inflammatory genes, the immune status returns to basal levels, and challenge with a secondary stimulus enhances transcription of inflammatory cytokines at much higher levels than those observed during the primary challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Divangahi et al., 2021</xref>). While the dynamics of an initial inflammatory event induced by PA in vivo are not defined in this paper, we show that basal levels of <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Il1b,</italic> and <italic>Il10</italic> in the blood of mice pre-exposed to PA were comparable to control mice immediately prior to endotoxin challenge, indicating that mice were not in a primed state prior to disease. This suggests that the hyper-inflammation and poor disease outcome we show in PA-exposed mice are not due to priming but a trained immune response.</p><p>The dual nature of trained immunity is also a hallmark feature of the phenomenon, in that non-specific innate immune memory can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on the disease context. The majority of research has demonstrated the protective role of trained immunity against a variety of infections, such as with BCG vaccination and B-glucan stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). Our work is unique because we focus on the detrimental role that trained immunity has on disease characterized by inflammatory dysregulation; however, we also highlight the beneficial nature of this novel phenotype by showing that when mice lacking adaptive immunity (<italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) are pre-exposed to systemic PA, they exhibit enhanced clearance of kidney fungal burden compared to control mice.</p><p>We further identify a novel role of SFA-dependent intracellular ceramide required for the enhanced systemic response to microbial ligands, and show intervention with OA, a mono-unsaturated fatty acid that depletes PA-dependent ceramide, can reverse these phenotypes in macrophages and in vivo. Our data presented here highlight the dynamic plasticity of dietary intervention on inflammatory disease outcomes. These data are consistent with the current knowledge that SFAs and ceramide are immunomodulatory molecules, and build on these by highlighting a previously unidentified role of PA in driving long-lived trained immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diets enriched in SFAs increase endotoxemia severity and mortality</title><p>To examine the immune effects of chronic exposure to diets enriched in SFAs on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, we fed age matched (6–8 weeks), female BALB/c mice either with a WD (enriched in SFAs and sucrose), a KD (enriched in SFAs and low-carbohydrate), or standard chow (SC; low in SFAs and sucrose), for 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We defined 2 weeks of feeding as chronic exposure, because this is correlated with WD- or KD-dependent microbiome changes and confers metaflammation in WD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Napier et al., 2019</xref>), sustained altered blood glucose levels in WD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and elevated levels of ketones in the urine and blood in KD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). We then induced endotoxemia by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS. We measured hypothermia as a measure of disease severity and survival to determine outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Napier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Napier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saito et al., 2003</xref>). WD- and KD-fed mice showed significant and prolonged hypothermia, starting at 10 hr post-injection (p.i.), compared to the SC-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In accordance with these findings, WD- and KD-fed mice displayed 100% mortality by 26 hr p.i. compared to 100% survival of SC-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hypoglycemia is a known driver of endotoxemia, and each of these diets has varying levels of sugars and carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raetzsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filkins and Cornell, 1974</xref>). However, mice in all diet groups displayed similar levels of LPS-induced hypoglycemia during disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that potential effects of diet on blood glucose were not a driver of enhanced disease severity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diets enriched in saturated fatty acids lead to enhanced endotoxemia severity and altered systemic inflammatory profiles, independent of diet-associated microbiome.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) Age-matched (6–8 weeks) female BALB/c mice were fed standard chow (SC), Western diet (WD), or ketogenic diet (KD) for 2 weeks and injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) with 6 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Thus, we wanted to assess if enriched dietary SFA induces in vivo reprogramming of monocytes and splenocytes, leading to an enhanced response to LPS ex vivo. First, we fed age-matched (6–8 weeks) female BALB/c mice SC, WD, or KD for 2 weeks, isolated bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) via magnetic negative selection using bone marrow extracted from femurs and tibias, and determined baseline expression of inflammatory cytokines.

Thus, we next wanted to identify target SFAs enriched in the blood of mice fed a diet exclusively enriched in SFAs that may be altering the systemic inflammatory response to LPS. Considering that the KD is enriched in SFAs and not sucrose, and that KD-fed mice showed distinct HSC alterations and LPS-induced hyper-inflammation in BMDMs, BMMs, and splenocytes treated ex vivo, the subsequent studies were performed exclusively on KD-fed mice. We used mass spectrometry lipidomics to create diet-dependent profiles of circulating fatty acids in SC- and KD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). Age matched (6–8 weeks), female BALB/c mice were fed SC or KD for 2 weeks, then serum samples were collected and analyzed using qualitative tandem liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize how samples within each data set clustered together according to diet, and how those clusters varied relative to one another in abundance levels of free fatty acids (FFA), triacylglycerols (TAG), and phosphatidylcholines (PC). For all three groups of FAs, individual mice grouped with members of the same diet represented by a 95% confidence ellipse with no overlap between SC- and KD-fed groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>).

However, it remains unknown if PA can act as a primary inflammatory stimulus to induce a hyper-inflammatory response to a secondary heterologous stimulus in primary cells. Thus, we next wanted to determine if pre-exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of PA altered the macrophage response to a secondary challenge with LPS. Current literature indicates a wide range of serum PA levels, between 0.3 and 4.1 mM, reflects a high-fat diet in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelmagid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallego et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchanan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perreault et al., 2014</xref>). We aimed to use a physiologically relevant concentration of PA reflecting a human host for our in vitro studies, thus we treated primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with and without 1 mM of PA containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 12 hr, removed the media, subsequently treated with LPS (10 ng/mL) for an additional 24 hr, and measured expression and release of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β. Importantly, the BSA dissolved in the media used for PA treatment solutions was endotoxin- and FA-free to ensure aberrant TLR signaling would not occur via BSA contamination, and fresh PA was conjugated to BSA-containing media immediately prior to use. We found that BMDMs pre-treated with PA (1 mM) for 12 hr expressed significantly higher levels of <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic> in response to secondary treatment with LPS, compared to naïve BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). <italic>Il1b</italic> expression was significantly lower in cells pre-treated with PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>); however, secretion of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β was enhanced in BMDMs pre-treated with PA (1 mM) for 12 hr and challenged with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref>).

Together, these data show systemic OA can abrogate KD-dependent hypothermia and survival defect in response to LPS in mice-fed diets enriched solely in SFA and highlight the fascinating plasticity of dietary fatty acid reprogramming of innate immune cell populations and disease dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we showed that mice-fed diets enriched in SFA exhibit hyper-inflammation during endotoxemia and poorer outcomes, compared with mice fed a standard low-SFA diet, independent of the diet-associated microbiome, ketosis, and the impact of each diet on LPS-induced hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, we found that before LPS treatment, healthy mice fed a diet solely enriched in SFAs (KD) displayed significant expansion of HSCs, including MPPs, and harbored BMDMs, BM monocytes, and splenocytes that were not inherently more inflamed, but when challenged with LPS exhibited increased production of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Netea et al., 2020</xref>) we did not confer the hyper-inflammatory phenotype in BMDMs, BMMs, and splenocytes with WD, but only from KD-fed mice, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>) the KD is only enriched in SFAs and contains no sucrose, allowing us to ask questions specifically about SFAs, we chose to focus on the KD for the remainder of the study.</p><p>Considering the immunogenic properties of some dietary SFAs enriched in the KD, and that excess dietary SFAs are found circulating throughout the blood and peripheral tissues, we used lipidomics to identify dietary SFAs that may be directly reprogramming innate immune cells to respond more intensely to secondary inflammatory stimuli. Our study identified enriched PA (C16:0; PA) and PA-associated fatty acids in the blood of KD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). And, when we treated macrophages with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA, we found that PA alone induces a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary challenge with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines in response to secondary heterologous stimuli has been shown in previous models of innate immune memory, specifically trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christ et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekkering et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, our data suggests PA induces trained immunity by showing that circulating inflammatory levels in PA-injected mice were not upregulated or in a primed state prior to LPS stimulation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), and PA-associated enhanced endotoxemia severity and mortality are still shown in mice rested for 7 days post-PA exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). Importantly, we have not fully defined the initial inflammatory response to PA in our model, thus our data only suggests trained immunity is induced by PA exposure. However, we do find that PA exacerbates the acute phase of endotoxin challenge and correlates with increased mortality but also enhances resistance to infection independent of mature lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Together, our data concludes PA exposure can lead to hallmark phenotypes associated with canonical trained immunity models in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Interestingly, the in vivo blood expression of cytokines for KD-fed mice following endotoxin challenge is mild in comparison to the cytokine secretion we show for BM monocytes, splenocytes, and BMDMs isolated from KD-fed mice treated with LPS ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The media used for culturing and treating BM monocytes and splenocytes ex vivo with LPS contained a high-glucose concentration (4.5 g/L; 25 mM). However, high-glucose media does not alter TNF, IL-6, or IL-1β secretion, or mitochondrial metabolic activity, in WT BMDMs treated with LPS following 7 days of differentiation in high-glucose media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, in these studies, metabolic adaptation likely takes place within 48 hr for BMDMs cultured in high-glucose media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala et al., 2019</xref>); thus, we suggest it is unlikely that high glucose contributed to the significant augmentation of LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 secretion for BMDMs from KD-fed mice compared to controls, following 7 days of differentiation in high-glucose media prior to LPS challenge. However, further studies on the metabolic flexibility of the SC- and KD-BMDMs will be required to answer this question directly.</p><p>Additionally, we have previously shown that WD-induced weight gain does not correlate with enhanced endotoxemia severity and mortality in conventional mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Napier et al., 2019</xref>). This is important to address because of the “obesity paradox” that describes the diversity in sepsis severity and mortality exhibited within the obese patient population, with some studies showing that obesity may even be protective in certain disease contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ng and Eikermann, 2017</xref>). Humans on an animal-based KD that contains 76% fat with 30% SFA content, and 10% carbohydrates, experience ketosis within 1–2 weeks characterized by a three- to fourfold elevation in blood BHB levels and exhibit greater energy expenditure and weight loss compared to humans on a low-fat, plant-based diet that contains 10% fat and 75% carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hall et al., 2021</xref>). Likewise, KD-fed mice do not gain weight but show enhanced energy expenditure after 5 weeks of diet administration, and a trend toward weight loss during 9 weeks of diet exposure, compared to mice fed an SC diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kennedy et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, neither weight gain nor the obesity paradox is the confounding feature for the data we present here showing that both KD and dietary PA mediate innate immune memory in vivo during endotoxemia.</p><p>Furthermore, the metabolism of dietary SFAs is a key element of immune system function, and metabolic intermediates enhanced by SFAs and PA alone, such as ceramide, serve as signaling lipids in diseases of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galadari et al., 2013</xref>). Mechanistically, we show that inhibiting ceramide synthesis or diverting metabolism away from ceramide synthesis using OA protects macrophages from PA-induced trained immunity, suggesting that dietary intervention may help regulate inflammatory dysregulation during disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). And, to complement our in vitro mechanistic findings we show that three single i.p. injections of OA prior to endotoxin stimulation protects KD-fed mice from enhanced disease severity and mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Our findings align with the growing body of evidence indicating that trained immunity is a double-edged sword, where the phenomenon can be beneficial for resistance to infection but detrimental in the context of diseases exacerbated by systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DiNardo et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, we show that PA-induced memory is beneficial in that it promotes clearance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection in the kidneys of <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In stark contrast, PA-induced memory is detrimental in the context of endotoxemia, a disease driven by organ damage due to acute hyper-inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beutler et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Furthermore, it is known that trained immunity is a key feature of BCG vaccination, which has been shown to enhance resistance to infections, and is a possible mechanism that drives increased resistance to severe COVID-19 in the BCG-vaccinated population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Netea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escobar et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, future research in understanding the plasticity of the SFA- and PA-regulated immune memory responses, enhanced pathogen clearance, and the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon, will be of interest to the larger medical community.</p><p>Mechanistically, it is appreciated that PA is not acting as a ligand for the pattern recognition receptor TLR4; however, the presence of TLR4 (independent of TLR4 signaling capability) is required for PA-dependent inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lancaster et al., 2018</xref>). Our data and others contribute to the growing evidence that PA is inducing cell intrinsic stress through alterations in metabolism. The crosstalk between glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, and epigenetics, is crucial for trained immunity in human monocytes, and metabolic intermediates of the TCA cycle directly modify histone methylation patterns associated with proinflammatory cytokines upregulated in trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ryan and O’Neill, 2020</xref>). While ceramides are known to modify histone acetylation and DNA methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silva et al., 2022</xref>), the interplay between ceramide metabolism and epigenetics within innate immune cells has not been explored. Though we have shown that PA-dependent ceramide production leads to innate immune memory, the impact of these alterations on the epigenome remains unknown. Therefore, the influence of ceramide metabolism on epigenetics will be important to consider in future trained immunity studies where PA serves as the primary stimulus.</p><p>Interestingly, we find here that immunoparalysis, which is associated with a prolonged septic response and is enhanced in patients with poorer outcomes, is greater in mice-fed diets enriched in SFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gogos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Dissel et al., 1998</xref>). However, we found that this SFA-dependent enhanced immunoparalysis is abrogated in GF mice, suggesting, for the first time, that the microbial species within the SFA-fed mice may be regulating the late immunoparalytic phase of endotoxin shock. Considering the clinical correlation of immunoparalysis and increased sepsis mortality, it will be imperative to explore the identity of the SFA-dependent microbiome and the host/microbe mechanisms that drive sepsis-associated immunoparalysis.</p><p>Importantly, previous seminal studies concluded that mice treated with antibodies to the TNF receptor and challenged with systemic LPS increased survival from 0% to nearly 100%, suggesting that acute inflammation driven by TNF is responsible for endotoxemia-related mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beutler et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohler et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that TNF is required for acute renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>), lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), and liver damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhong et al., 2016</xref>) during LPS challenge. These data show that acute inflammation, specifically the bioactivity of TNF, drives endotoxemia mortality and organ damage in conventional mice. It has also been shown that acute inflammation, specifically TNF production, is a driver of endotoxemia in GF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Souza et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, although our conventional mice show increased immunoparalysis, we suggest that early acute systemic inflammation is the driver of disease severity and mortality in both our conventional and GF endotoxemia mouse models; however, the data we present here is not sufficient to make this conclusion.</p><p>In conclusion, this unappreciated role of dietary SFAs, specifically PA, may provide insight into the long-lasting immune reprogramming associated with a high-SFA fed population, and lends insight into the complexity of nutritional immunoregulation. Considering the results in this study, we suggest the potential for SFAs such as PA to directly impact innate immune metabolism and epigenetics associated with inflammatory pathways. Thus, our findings are paramount not only for potential dietary interventions, but also treatment of inflammatory diseases exacerbated by metabolic dysfunction in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>RAW 264.7 macrophages (from ATCC), CASP-1KO BMDMs, BMDMs, and BMMs were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and high glucose supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; GE Healthcare, SH3039603).

diet and the more extreme ketogenic diet for 2 weeks enhance monocyte-driven immune responsiveness. This leads to a deadly hyper-inflammatory state in the mice in response to an endotoxin challenge in vivo and enhances the clearance of pathogens.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Maziar Divangahi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the shortcomings of the paper, which are detailed in the reviews below, are such that the work required for an acceptable revision cannot be delivered within the 8 weeks that we allow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Presumably Figure 1 panels J-N are data stemming from both male and female mice. Although this is great for sexual diversity and representation in scientific studies. This decision is weakened by 2 issues (1) the sample sizes are very small, and therefore don't allow the authors to investigate sex specific difference in the mice's response to diet and LPS. (2) In humans males and females show hugely different responses to endotoxemia challenge [PMID: 17452928]. According to a fairly recent PLoS ONE publication [PMID: 27631979] these sex differential responses are also present in mice, where male mice have a greater inflammatory response and have more severe outcomes. Since readers aren't given any insight into the sex distribution of the mice in each group it is impossible to decide if the data are skewed/biased. In order to improve the robustness of the authors findings, these studies should be repeated with mice sharing a single sex, or be performed with greater numbers (n=&gt;12) with equal distribution of sexes in each dietary group.</p><p>2. Figure 4 D – F shows the OA for 12h followed by LPS for 24h induces the greatest levels of cytokines. In fact, what's worrying with these data is that the effect of &quot;PA-12h◊LPS-24h&quot; vs &quot;LPS-24h&quot; is not recapitulated from the previous results shown in Figure 4 panels A – C; at least the authors don't display the results of statistical tests for panels D – F, however comparing the cytokine levels it's clear that the PA treatment didn't generate the same cytokine levels. How do the authors explain these results? Also why isn't the highly cytokine inducing potential of OA not described in the Results section? In fact what is shown in Panels D – F is that PA treatment reverses the inflammation induced by OA, rather than the other way around that the authors claim to be the case. These experiments should be repeated, showing a significant change from &quot;LPS-24h&quot; to &quot;PA-12h--&gt;LPS-24h&quot; as in panels Figure 4 A – C. The authors should also address the effect of OA on LPS responsiveness.</p><p>I would like to politely highlight a concern of mine, the authors appear to have purposefully chosen their color scheming to throw the eye off from noticing the effect of &quot;OA-12h--&gt;LPS-24h&quot;. Notice how in panels A – C &quot;PA-12h--&gt;LPS24h&quot; is colored in blue, while in panels D – F &quot;PA-12h◊LPS-24h&quot; is colored in grey and &quot;OA-12h--&gt;LPS-24h&quot; is colored in blue. Skimming of the figures, one could easily mistake that both blue columns represent &quot;PA-12h--&gt;LPS-24h&quot;, completely overlooking that OA is inducing high levels of cytokines and that the authors failed to reproduce their own results. The authors should use the same color coding for both sets of figures.</p><p>3. Dietary intervention studies are difficult, and often difficult decisions have to be made when designing your studies. One of these difficult decisions is how to design the macronutrient contributions to the total caloric intake of the mice. A choice could be made to, for example, to fix the percentage or mg of protein to the caloric total. In this way it is possible control for the effect that altering protein availability will have on LPS challenge. For example protein intake effects the survivaly of critically ill patients – some with sepsis [PMID: 29709380]. Can the authors justify their decision for the nutrient composition used in their study?</p><p>4. In basic/functional science it's important to make reductionist groupings for the sake of clear comparisons (also for financial reasons). However, what may give you the clearest separation in your analysis may impact the translatability of the data to the broader, medical context. Here the authors have decided to compare standard chow diets (SC) with the ketogenic diet (KD), as opposed to the potentially more interesting (from the epidemiological perspective at least) Western-diet (WD). It is unsurprising that eliminating most carbohydrates from ones diet will result in gross changes in systemic metabolism and circulating lipid profiles. However how common are septic events in people practicing the ketogenic diet? For a lay audience this may convey the message that ketogenic diet – per se – is a major contributor to septic death. Naturally the authors tie these results to dietary palmitic acid, where supplementation alone is able to confer these negative effects. However I think the manuscript would benefit from a small sentence in the results prior to Figure 2 outlining why they chose to focus on KD rather than WD.</p><p>5. The description of the methods are rather poor, but also there appear to be many inconsistencies in the methods themselves. In the legend of Figure 1 the authors use &quot;conventional mice&quot; aged 4-6 weeks for the data shown in panel A – F, while through panel G – N the switch to C57BL/6 mice that are 19-23 weeks old female or 14-23 weeks for male mice; using a unreported mixture of the sexes. Additionally, the younger mice receive 6 mg/kg of LPS, while the older mice receive 50 mg/kg of LPS. Later on in Figure 5, switching back to the younger 4-6 week mice (all female), the authors switch again to 10 mg/kg of LPS. The RAG -/- mice are represent a third age group used in the study (8-9 weeks old). I see this as a major, and limiting aspect of the presented work. If it's within the power of the authors, I would advocate for repeating the mice studies in the paper with a single, standardized protocol. Using mice from the same background, sex, age, and to receive the same injection of LPS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;Dietary palmitic acid induces innate immune memory via ceramide production that enhances severity of acute septic shock and clearance of infection&quot; Seufert and colleagues have investigated how saturated fatty acids increase susceptibility of the host in a murine model of LPS-mediated septic shock. They have shown that pretreatment of macrophages with palmitic acid (PA) reprograms macrophages towards hyper-inflammatory phenotype, which was dependent on ceremide. Importantly, depletion of macrophages intracellular ceremide with oleic acid reverse their hyper-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, while PA was harmful in the LPS-acute septic shock model, it was beneficial in clearance of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in Rag deficient mice lacking both B and T cells. While this is an exciting study, the presented data don't fully support the central hypothesis and the link with trained immunity is currently weak.</p><p>1. Training: As the authors described in the result section the difference between priming and training: &quot;priming occurs when the first stimulus enhances transcription of inflammatory genes and doesn't return to basal levels before the secondary stimulation. In contrast, trained immunity occurs when the first stimulus changes transcription of inflammatory genes, the immune status then returns to basal levels, and challenges with homologous or heterologous stimulus enhances transcription of inflammatory cytokines at much higher levels than those observed during the primary challenge&quot;. However, the presented in vitro data are priming (Figure 3 and 4) and not training, as the interval between the first (PA) and secondary (LPS) stimulus was extremely short. Indeed, PA often increased the expression or production of inflammatory cytokines, in which was augmented following LPS stimulation. Epigenomic/transcriptomic approaches can more precisely distinguish between priming and training. I would suggest the authors to move the definition of priming vs training from the result section to the introduction.</p><p>2. Microbiome: In Figure 1H-N, by using GF-mice, the authors indicated that SFA-driven enhanced responses to systemic LPS was independent of microbiome. However, the mortality was increased by 50% in SC-GF (Figure 1I) mice compared to SC-WT (Figure 1B) mice. Thus we could argue that the increased mortality in control groups was dependent on microbiome while it was masked in super susceptible WD/KD groups. This needs to be carefully addressed.</p><p>3. Cellular sources: In Figure 1, the authors assess the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes as well as an anti-inflammatory gene in blood, which composed of 90% lymphocytes and only 5-10% myeloid cells. Thus it is not clear to this reviewer that how the increased expression of these genes are linked to trained innate immunity. Similarly, in Figure 2, the authors showed that the expression of TNF was increased in splenocytes (&gt;80% lymphocytes) of KD mice after ex-vivo stimulation with LPS. So, without knowing the cellular sources of these cytokines, it is challenging to directly link the expression of inflammatory genes to innate cells. Furthermore, the authors need to provide the level of circulating cytokine by simply using ELISA. Considering the overlapping error bars in evaluating of many gene expressions statistical analysis needs to be double checked.</p><p>4. Hematopoietic stem cells: In Figure 2, the authors showed that monocytes isolated from BM of KD-mice expressed higher levels of TNF and IL6 following ex-vivo LPS stimulation. These data indicate that the potential impact of SFAs is on HSCs and progenitor cells. I would highly recommend the authors to consdier two experiments to provide more direct link between SFAs and trained immunity. First, to assess the impact of SFAs or PA on HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells by FACS as it has been done in the BCG model (Kaufmann et al., 2018). Second, to generate BMDM from SFAs and SC mice and then stimulate them with LPS or infect them with <italic>C. albicans</italic>, ex-vivo. As the generation of BMDM will take 5-7 days, any initial imprinting by SFAs can be transmitted from the progenitor cells to macrophages. Thus if there is an alteration in HSCs and progenitor cells, this can provide mor evidence of central training and its long-term effects on immunity to sterilized immunity (LPS) or infections (e.g. <italic>C. albicans</italic>). This will also provide more support for Figure 5H-I.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Enriched dietary saturated fatty acids induce trained immunity via ceramide production that enhances severity of acute septic shock and clearance of infection&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jos van der Meer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have wonderfully addressed the comments, and have resubmitted a very strong and thorough study on the role of dietary fatty acids on the induction of in vivo trained immunity. The manuscript is nearly ready for publication, especially considering the novelty and strength of their findings, not to mention the relevance to the field of trained immunity as well as metainflammation. There are however a few final comments on the present manuscript.</p><p>The first thing is the so-called 'obesity paradox'. People overweight or with obesity are generally protected from deadly/lethal septicemia when compared to normal or underweight individuals. Two weeks of high-fat feeding may not be sufficient to induce obesity, however, it would be interesting to know if the mice have gained weight. It would be of interest to briefly discuss the clinical conundrum of the 'obesity paradox', especially given the highly lethal phenotype of WD and KD-fed mice in for example Figure 1B.</p><p>With sepsis, the general course of the disease is indeed hyper-inflammation leading to organ failure and death, or immune paralysis and increased risk of mortality via secondary infection. Given that your data suggest that the mice indeed enter into the immune-paralyzed state, do you have any data to show whether the mice died from organ failure or secondary infections? Regardless of the phenotype, WD or KD-fed mice are more susceptible to lethal responses to LPS. Germ-free mice similarly show lethality making the effect clearer to being the result of organ failure/damage. Though, the cytokines, especially IL-10 make this distinction even murkier. The germ-free clearly look as though they are dying from hyper-inflammation, while the BALB/c mice are seemingly dying in the immune-paralyzed state; given they aren't germ-free and are susceptible to secondary infection with commensals. How would the authors rationalize this?</p><p>Sepsis is a medical term that describes an infection of the blood. In your model, LPS is used to induce systemic inflammation. Although many of the symptoms and effects overlap profoundly with those seen in sepsis, we advise against using the term sepsis to describe your model since no infection is established. Endotoxin challenge, or endotoxin stimulation, is more appropriate/accurate semantics.</p><p>Page 17 lines 461 – 463 reading: &quot;Our findings align with the growing body of evidence indicating that trained immunity is a double-edged sword, where the phenomenon can be beneficial for resistance to infection, but detrimental in the context of inflammatory disease.&quot; This reads a bit off given that, in fact, your model uses a bacterial-derived stimulus to induce a lethal inflammatory response in WD and KD-'trained' mice. You could hardly call this a beneficial effect of trained immunity.</p><p>A technical hurdle for figure 3 is that the mice are on a ketogenic diet, cells are harvested, and then brought into culture with glucose-enriched media. We wonder then how the sudden overabundance of glucose might contribute to the elevated cytokine responsiveness seen in the data presented in these figure panels, as opposed to the ketogenic diet per se giving rise to increased immune responsiveness. It is worth saying that the in-vivo cytokine responses are much milder than what's seen ex vivo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76744.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

This is extremely important to mention more clearly in the results text, because the Reviewer 1 is correct, sexual dimorphism and age differences can have very large effects on LPS treatment outcome.

From their data (Figure 1A), we calculated that after 600mM of i.v. injection (total = 267uL within 14h; 0.2L/min) there was ~420uM absolute PA within the blood. They were using C57BL/6 mice that were 23g on average. Using these results, we extrapolated that one single 200uL injection of a 750mM PA solution within 6–8-week female BALB/c mice (~15-18g) would equate to ~500-1mM of PA within the blood. Considering obese healthy and unhealthy humans vary widely in total PA concentrations in the blood (0.3-4.1 mM) (<italic>1, 2</italic>), we moved forward with these calculations. Considering this, we thank the reviewer for this advice, and we agree that we have not definitively shown we are increasing systemic levels of PA. Thus, we ran a lipidomic analysis of serum from SC-fed mice with Veh or PA for 12 h. We show that a 750 mM i.p. injection of ethyl palmitate enhances free PA levels in the serum to 173-425 μM at 2 h post-injection, which is within the reported range for humans on high-fat diets (0.34.1mM). We have added this new data to Figure S7A of the main manuscript.</p><p>Importantly, the concentration in the PA-treated mice is greater than that of the Veh-treated mice, however we believe the value shown is an underestimate of maximum serum PA levels enhanced by i.p. injection, because free PA is known to be packaged into chylomicrons within enterocytes and travel through the circulation with a half-life of less than an hour (<italic>3, 4</italic>). Thus, serum concentrations of free PA are only transiently enhanced by i.p. injection, and is quickly taken up by adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, heart, and liver tissue. These complex lipid transport processes make it difficult to determine maximum concentrations of free PA in the serum.</p><p>While all of the details concerning PA circulation following an i.p. injection are unknown, we suggest that this method of “force-feeding” is similar to dietary intake in that uptake of PA into the circulation occurs within the peritoneal space prior to traveling to the blood via the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct (<italic>5</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Our diets are created by Envigo, and each diet (SC, WD, and KD) contain the same vitamin mixes, carbohydrate, and fat sources.</p><p>We originally conducted experiments in SC and WD to understand the role of high SFA and sucrose on reprogramming innate immune populations (<italic>7</italic>). However, in this study we wanted identify if enriched SFA alone could recapitulate these results. The mice were tolerant to the Envigo KD, so we continued our studies. We specifically state this within the Results section, but considering this important point, we have added these diet details within the Supplemental Table 1.</p><p>It is important to note, the KD has depleted protein (9.1% compared to 17% and19% in SC and WD, respectively). Our studies have not ruled out that low protein is involved in the response to systemic LPS; however, we have recapitulated these results in short-term PA-treated mice (fed SC; Figure 4A-F) and long-term PA-treated mice (fed SC; Figure 4G-H) suggesting that regardless of the effect of low protein on this model, enriched SFA is sufficient to drive hyper-sensitivity to systemic LPS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We chose the KD diet because it was only enriched in SFA and not glucose, like the WD. We agree with the reviewer that a sentence in the Results prior to Figure 3 outlining why we chose the KD rather than the WD is needed. Thus, we have addressed the reviewers concern and have explained why we chose to focus on the KD diet exclusively in the beginning of the Results section, “Palmitic acid (PA) and PA-associated fatty acids are enriched in the blood of KD-fed mice.” We state, “Considering that the KD is enriched in SFAs and not sucrose, and that KD-fed mice showed distinct HSC alterations and LPS-induced hyper-inflammation in BMDMs, BMMs, and splenocytes treated ex vivo (Figure 2; S2), the subsequent studies were performed exclusively on KD-fed mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We are aware of sex differences in the endotoxemia model, which is why we specifically use female mice in our studies (<italic>6, 7</italic>). This is mentioned twice in the methods under the sections “Endotoxin-induced model of sepsis” and “Ethical approval of animal studies”. We have added these specifics of our model to all Results and Figure Legend sections for clarification.</p><p>2) For Germ-free models, it is notoriously difficult to breed C57BL/6 germ-free mice. It was inherently difficult to obtain enough mice within the same sex and age to carry out these experiments, however since we have published in this model before with mixed sex and age we were aware that our WD phenotype is robust enough in these backgrounds (<italic>7</italic>). Further, we believe that seeing our robust phenotype independent of age or sex within germ-free mice provides more evidence of the strength of this phenotype. It is important to note that we induce endotoxemia within Germ-free mice with 50mg/kg, instead of 6mg/kg which is used in conventional mice, because this is our reported LD50 for mixed sex Germ-free C57BL/6, as we have published previously in detail (<italic>7</italic>). This difference is due to the presence of the microbiota (<italic>8, 9</italic>) and also germ-free mice have an immature immune system that correlates with a hypo-responsiveness to microbial products (<italic>10-12</italic>). We agree with the reviewer that the ages of the C57BL/6 germ-free mice are significantly older than our conventional 6-8 week mice, thus we confirmed that WD- and KD-fed conventional C57BL/6 female mice aged 20 – 21 weeks old still show enhanced disease severity and mortality in an LPS-induced endotoxemia model, compared to mice.</p><p>3) In our preliminary results, we stratified survival during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection between male and female C57BL/6 and found no notable difference in survival at 40h post IP infection with <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-B</xref>).

We agree, and thus, we have added to Introduction of the manuscript, we describe the difference between priming and trained immunity with the following, “Importantly, trained immunity is induced when a primary inflammatory stimulus changes transcription of inflammatory genes, the immune status returns to basal levels, and challenge with a homologous or heterologous stimulus enhances transcription of inflammatory cytokines at much higher levels than those observed during the primary challenge (<italic>14</italic>). While the dynamics of basal inflammation are not defined in this paper, we show that basal levels of <italic>tnf</italic>, <italic>il-6</italic>, <italic>il-1β</italic> and <italic>il-10</italic> in the blood of mice pre-exposed to PA were comparable to control mice immediately prior to LPS-induced sepsis, indicating that mice were not in a primed state prior to disease. This suggests that the hyper-inflammation and poor disease outcome we show in PA-exposed mice is due to trained immunity, and not priming.”</p><p>Importantly, the additional ex vivo experiments this Reviewer suggests in point #4 has addressed this trained immunity phenotype further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Microbiome: In Figure 1H-N, by using GF-mice, the authors indicated that SFA-driven enhanced responses to systemic LPS was independent of microbiome. However, the mortality was increased by 50% in SC-GF (Figure 1I) mice compared to SC-WT (Figure 1B) mice. Thus we could argue that the increased mortality in control groups was dependent on microbiome while it was masked in super susceptible WD/KD groups. This needs to be carefully addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer brings up a very important point. We have addressed these issues thoroughly and specifically in our previous publication: Napier, et al. <italic>Western diet regulates immune status and the response to LPS-driven sepsis independent of diet-associated microbiome</italic>. PNAS. 2019 (Figure 4A-D). However, we were not clear enough in our text and will change: “Diets enriched in SFAs drive enhanced responses to systemic LPS independent of microbiome” to à “Diets enriched in SFAs drive enhanced responses to systemic LPS independent of diet-associated microbiome”, where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Cellular sources: In Figure 1, the authors assess the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes as well as an anti-inflammatory gene in blood, which composed of 90% lymphocytes and only 5-10% myeloid cells. Thus it is not clear to this reviewer that how the increased expression of these genes are linked to trained innate immunity. Similarly, in Figure 2, the authors showed that the expression of TNF was increased in splenocytes (&gt;80% lymphocytes) of KD mice after ex-vivo stimulation with LPS. So, without knowing the cellular sources of these cytokines, it is challenging to directly link the expression of inflammatory genes to innate cells. Furthermore, the authors need to provide the level of circulating cytokine by simply using ELISA. Considering the overlapping error bars in evaluating of many gene expressions statistical analysis needs to be double checked.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, typically only 4 and 10% of leukocytes in the blood, in mice and humans respectively, are considered myeloid cells. Additionally, within the first 24 hours after systemic LPS exposure in humans (in vivo) the % of classical monocytes (expressing inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1b; CD14<sup>hi</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup>) increases in the blood, and to a lesser degree nonclassical monocytes (expressing TNF, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8; CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>hi</sup>) increase in the blood (<italic>15</italic>). These systemic pools of monocytes are then recruited to peripheral tissues whereby they differentiate into tissue resident macrophages and DCs [Reviewed here Ginhoux, 2014, Nature Reviews Immunology].</p><p>In mice, after exposure to systemic LPS, inflammatory bone marrow monocytes (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> – mouse Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are equivalent to human CD14<sup>hi</sup> monocytes), lung monocytes, and splenic monocytes [Reviewed here: Teh <italic>et al.</italic>, Frontiers in Immunology, 2019] are recruited to peripheral tissues through the blood. These blood monocyte populations are typically transient, and decrease after inflammation resolves.</p><p>Further, we have specifically seen that 10h post-LPS inject, inflammatory monocytes (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD115<sup>+</sup>) are increased within the blood in SC mice (<italic>7</italic>). Other labs have shown, inflammatory (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD115<sup>+</sup>Ly6<sup>hi</sup>) monocytes are recruited to peripheral tissues, like the liver, 24h post-LPS treatment [Reviewed here Ginhoux, 2014, Nature Reviews Immunology]. This suggests there is a transitory period that inflammatory monocytes producing cytokines are traveling within the blood, and may be responsible for this acute increase in cytokine expression 5-20h after LPS induction (Figure 1).</p><p>This topic is of immense interest to our lab, and we are currently working to identify the leukocytes responsible for increased expression of inflammatory cytokines within the blood during endotoxemia between diets.</p><p>To address the last comments, we assessed cytokine secretion within the mice during LPS through 10uL tail vein bleeding – allowing us to track the progression of disease and expression of cytokines throughout disease within each mouse. This volume of blood does not allow for ELISA analysis and would require sacrificing mice. Lastly, we have provided all statistical analysis of our cytokine expression data within the reference source data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Hematopoietic stem cells: In Figure 2, the authors showed that monocytes isolated from BM of KD-mice expressed higher levels of TNF and IL6 following ex-vivo LPS stimulation. These data indicate that the potential impact of SFAs is on HSCs and progenitor cells. I would highly recommend the authors to consdier two experiments to provide more direct link between SFAs and trained immunity. First, to assess the impact of SFAs or PA on HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells by FACS as it has been done in the BCG model (Kaufmann et al., 2018). Second, to generate BMDM from SFAs and SC mice and then stimulate them with LPS or infect them with C. albicans, ex-vivo. As the generation of BMDM will take 5-7 days, any initial imprinting by SFAs can be transmitted from the progenitor cells to macrophages. Thus if there is an alteration in HSCs and progenitor cells, this can provide mor evidence of central training and its long-term effects on immunity to sterilized immunity (LPS) or infections (e.g. C. albicans). This will also provide more support for Figure 5H-I.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for these suggestions, and we believe that these suggested experiments have bolstered our results significantly. As the reviewer suggested, we have used a modified version of the Kaufmann <italic>et al.</italic> 2018 FACs panel (Figure 1) to identify the proportions of long-term HSCs, short-term HSCs, and multipotent progenitors after 2 weeks of diet exposure (SC, WD, and KD). Further, we quantified MPP3s, though we had too low MPP4s to conclude results. We suggest the identity of MPP4s may be different in BALB/c mice (used here) compared to C57BL/6 mice (used by Kaufmann <italic>et</italic> al). Figure 2 now shows the analysis of LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, and MPPs sub-types from the bone marrow of SC-, WD-, and KD-fed mice.</p><p>Supplemental Figure 2A shows quantified MPP3 data and Figure S3 shows our gating schemes.</p><p>Additionally, we isolated BMDMs from mice fed SC, WD, and KD for 2 weeks, expand and differentiate these cells 7 days and then stimulated with LPS to analyze cytokine release. We now have found BMDMs from KD-fed mice treated ex vivo with LPS after 7 days of macrophage differentiation shows enhanced cytokine production compared to SC- and WD-fed mice (Figure 2D-E), highlighting the intriguing biology behind KD-dependent trained immunity. We have since concluded KD is inducing a trained immunity response and have added this to the title and within the analysis.</p><p>References for revision:</p><p>1. M.

The manuscript is nearly ready for publication, especially considering the novelty and strength of their findings, not to mention the relevance to the field of trained immunity as well as metainflammation. There are however a few final comments on the present manuscript.</p><p>The first thing is the so-called 'obesity paradox'. People overweight or with obesity are generally protected from deadly/lethal septicemia when compared to normal or underweight individuals. Two weeks of high-fat feeding may not be sufficient to induce obesity, however, it would be interesting to know if the mice have gained weight. It would be of interest to briefly discuss the clinical conundrum of the 'obesity paradox', especially given the highly lethal phenotype of WD and KD-fed mice in for example Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an important point. We have previously addressed this paradox question in our model of endotoxemia and diet-induced weight gain in Napier, <italic>et al.</italic> 2019, PNAS. However, it’s important for the reader to understand the context and application of our studies, thus we have added a paragraph to the Discussion that explores this idea in the context of our findings (Lines 452-463).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With sepsis, the general course of the disease is indeed hyper-inflammation leading to organ failure and death, or immune paralysis and increased risk of mortality via secondary infection. Given that your data suggest that the mice indeed enter into the immune-paralyzed state, do you have any data to show whether the mice died from organ failure or secondary infections? Regardless of the phenotype, WD or KD-fed mice are more susceptible to lethal responses to LPS. Germ-free mice similarly show lethality making the effect clearer to being the result of organ failure/damage. Though, the cytokines, especially IL-10 make this distinction even murkier. The germ-free clearly look as though they are dying from hyper-inflammation, while the BALB/c mice are seemingly dying in the immune-paralyzed state; given they aren't germ-free and are susceptible to secondary infection with commensals. How would the authors rationalize this?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, it is important to discuss the implications of immunoparalysis driving mortality in the endotoxemia model in the context of our findings. Previous seminal studies concluded that mice treated with antibodies to the TNF receptor and challenged with systemic LPS increased survival from 0% to nearly 100%, suggesting that acute inflammation driven by TNF is responsible for endotoxemia-related survival (<italic>1, 2</italic>). Further, it has been shown that TNF is required for acute renal failure (<italic>3</italic>), lung injury (<italic>4</italic>), and liver damage (<italic>5</italic>) during LPS challenge. In agreeance with conventional mouse data, it has also been shown that acute inflammation, specifically TNF production, is a driver of endotoxemia in germ-free (GF) mice (<italic>6</italic>). These data suggest that acute inflammation, specifically the bioactivity of TNF, drives endotoxemia mortality and organ damage in conventional and GF mice. Thus, although our conventional mice show signs of immunoparalysis, we believe that the acute (515h) enhanced <italic>Tnf</italic> in the blood of both conventional and GF mice is responsible for endotoxemia mortality and subsequent organ failure, as seen in previous publications. Considering this, we agree that this is important to mention in the context of our results, thus we have added a section in the Discussion that mentions these previously published data (Lines 501-510).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sepsis is a medical term that describes an infection of the blood. In your model, LPS is used to induce systemic inflammation. Although many of the symptoms and effects overlap profoundly with those seen in sepsis, we advise against using the term sepsis to describe your model since no infection is established. Endotoxin challenge, or endotoxin stimulation, is more appropriate/accurate semantics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and though we define our disease model as “LPS-induced acute septic shock”, it is important that the readers understand that we are using the traditional “endotoxemia” model. We have changed all references to this disease model to “endotoxemia”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 17 lines 461 – 463 reading: &quot;Our findings align with the growing body of evidence indicating that trained immunity is a double-edged sword, where the phenomenon can be beneficial for resistance to infection, but detrimental in the context of inflammatory disease.&quot; This reads a bit off given that, in fact, your model uses a bacterial-derived stimulus to induce a lethal inflammatory response in WD and KD-'trained' mice. You could hardly call this a beneficial effect of trained immunity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this statement as-is is confusing, thus we have changed the wording: “Our findings align with the growing body of evidence indicating that trained immunity is a double-edged sword, where the phenomenon can be beneficial for resistance to infection, but detrimental in the context of diseases exacerbated by systemic inflammation” (Lines 71-73; 472-476), and include a detailed explanation of our statement in the Discussion (Lines 472-476).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A technical hurdle for figure 3 is that the mice are on a ketogenic diet, cells are harvested, and then brought into culture with glucose-enriched media. We wonder then how the sudden overabundance of glucose might contribute to the elevated cytokine responsiveness seen in the data presented in these figure panels, as opposed to the ketogenic diet per se giving rise to increased immune responsiveness. It is worth saying that the in-vivo cytokine responses are much milder than what's seen ex vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an interesting and important point. It has been shown that TNF, IL-6, or IL-1b secretion is enhanced in WT BMDMs treated for a short period (48 h) with high-glucose media (<italic>7</italic>). However, high-glucose media does not alter TNF, IL-6, or IL-1b secretion, or mitochondrial activity, in WT BMDMs treated with LPS following 7 d of differentiation in high glucose media (<italic>7</italic>). Thus, since metabolic adaptation takes place within a few days for BMDMs cultured in high glucose media and does not alter inflammatory cytokine secretion following LPS challenge after 7d in high glucose media, we suggest it is unlikely that high glucose media after 7 d contributed to the significant augmentation of LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 secretion for BMDMs from KD-fed mice compared to controls (<italic>7</italic>). Further, the speed of metabolic shifts (or metabolic flexibility) from glycolysis to ketosis (and reversed) are often similar in lean adults (regardless of fat-intake), suggesting that both SC- and KD-fed mice will have similar metabolic flexibility in response to 7 d of high-glucose (<italic>8, 9</italic>). We have not analyzed the exact metabolic flexibility of the mitochondria within SC- or KD-derived BMDMs, but this is an intense area of interest for our lab and we are currently researching this topic.</p><p>Lastly, while LPS-challenged macrophages preferentially utilize glucose as their main energy source in order to upregulate expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, there are several variables that may contribute to the mismatch between cytokine mRNA expression in the blood and expression or secretion of cytokines by differentiated immune cells in response to LPS (<italic>10</italic>). Specifically, monocytes (the major producer of systemic cytokines during LPS challenge) are only approximately 4% of the leukocytes in the blood in mice. Thus, we are seeing a diluted response, whereas in vitro we would be directly assessing monocyte (only) responses.</p><p>We agree this is an important point to mention within the manuscript and have since added a section in the Discussion covering this topic (Lines 441-451).</p><p>References</p><p>1.
