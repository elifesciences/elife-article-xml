PP2A methylesterase 1 (PME-1) is a cancer-promoting enzyme and undergoes methylesterase activation upon binding to the PP2A core enzyme. Here, we showed that PME-1 readily demethylates different families of PP2A holoenzymes and blocks substrate recognition in vitro. The high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of a PP2A-B56 holoenzyme–PME-1 complex reveals that PME-1 disordered regions, including a substrate-mimicking motif, tether to the B56 regulatory subunit at remote sites. They occupy the holoenzyme substrate-binding groove and allow large structural shifts in both holoenzyme and PME-1 to enable multipartite contacts at structured cores to activate the methylesterase. B56 interface mutations selectively block PME-1 activity toward PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and affect the methylation of a fraction of total cellular PP2A. The B56 interface mutations allow us to uncover B56-specific PME-1 functions in p53 signaling. Our studies reveal multiple mechanisms of PME-1 in suppressing holoenzyme functions and versatile PME-1 activities derived from coupling substrate-mimicking motifs to dynamic structured cores.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein phosphatase 2A</kwd><kwd>PME-1</kwd><kwd>demethylation</kwd><kwd>short linear motifs</kwd><kwd>P53</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM137090-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xing</surname><given-names>Yongna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-10-153-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xing</surname><given-names>Yongna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jordan's Guardian Angels Foundation and Jordan's Syndrome research consortium fund from the State of California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A19-3376-5007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xing</surname><given-names>Yongna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM096060-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xing</surname><given-names>Yongna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The coupling of the enzyme/structure core to different short linear motifs represents a novel mechanism to diversify and expand the function of signaling proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major and the most abundant serine/threonine phosphatase in mammalian cells and dephosphorylates ~half cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Sears, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Virshup, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wlodarchak and Xing, 2016</xref>). The cellular functions of PP2A rely on the formation of structurally distinct diverse heterotrimeric holoenzymes; each consists of a dimeric core enzyme formed by the scaffolding A and catalytic C (C or PP2Ac) subunits and a diverse set of regulatory B subunits. The regulatory subunits belong to four major families (B/B55/PR55, B′/B56/PR61, B″/PR72, and B⁗/Striatin), and dictate specific substrate recognition. Recent studies arrive at a merging theme that PP2A holoenzymes recognize substrates by binding to short linear motifs (SLiMs) in substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2017a</xref>). SLiMs are extremely powerful in synthesizing regulation nodes and signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davey and Morgan, 2016</xref>). Similar observations were also made to substrates of other phosphatases in the PPP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heroes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nasa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ueki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wigington et al., 2020</xref>). PP2A holoenzymes are highly regulated by carboxymethylation of the PP2Ac tail, which is reversibly controlled by PP2A-specific leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (LCMT-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Baere et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and Stock, 1993</xref>) and methylesterase (PME-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1996</xref>). Dysregulation of PP2A holoenzymes or alteration of holoenzyme functions causes many human diseases, including cancer, heart diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janssens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sontag et al., 2004</xref>). Consistently, LCMT-1 is essential for cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Pallas, 2007</xref>), and the deletion of PME-1 in mice is perinatally lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ortega-Gutiérrez et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The activity of LCMT-1 and PME-1 is strictly controlled for proper PP2A holoenzyme homeostasis by multiple layers of structural mechanisms. Their activity on the PP2Ac tail, ‘TPDYFL’ relies on binding to the phosphatase active site, which induces significant changes in LCMT-1 to accommodate the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stanevich et al., 2011</xref>) and global conformational changes in PME-1 to create the substrate-binding pocket and the active configuration of the catalytic triads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). The LCMT-1 activity is enhanced by the activation of PP2Ac and its association with the A-subunit and is thus highly selective toward the active core enzyme, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stanevich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stanevich et al., 2014</xref>), ensuring that PP2A is either in latent, inactive or in active substrate-specific forms.</p><p>Whether PME-1 also specifically acts on the core enzyme remain controversial. PP2A holoenzymes are predominately methylated in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tolstykh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that PME-1 might not directly demethylate holoenzymes. Holoenzymes are also thermaldynamically the most stable form of PP2A and have nanomolar intersubunit binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, PP2A interacts with dynamic regulatory proteins with micromolar binding affinities, such as LCMT-1, PME-1, TIPRL (TOR signaling pathway regulator-like), and α4. Structural overlay of PP2A holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wlodarchak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2006</xref>) and the PP2A core enzyme–PME-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xing et al., 2008</xref>) indicates that PP2A regulatory subunits would hinder PME-1 binding and prevent it from acting on holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A recent discovery, however, starts to question the static view on cellular PP2A holoenzymes. TIPRL/α4 readily disassemble unmethylated PP2A holoenzymes by perturbing the phosphatase active site and inducing global conformational changes in PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2017b</xref>). Furthermore, PP2A holoenzymes were found to be cofractionated with PME-1 in tissue extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tolstykh et al., 2000</xref>). Robust PP2A demethylation was detected after the mammalian cells were lysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yabe et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that PP2A holoenzymes might be demethylated upon their spatial separation from PME-1 was disrupted.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PP2A methylesterase 1 (PME-1) directly interacts with and demethylates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structural overlay of the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme (PDB code: 2NPP) to the PP2A core enzyme–PME-1 complex (PDB code: 3C5W) aligned via PP2Ac (<bold>c</bold>) and the C-terminal five huntingtin-elongation-A-subunit-TOR (HEAT) repeats of the A-subunit.

B56γ1 represents the conserved common core in B56 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Consistent with this notion, we also observed stoichiometric comigration of PME-1 and the PP2A-B56ε holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We probed the holoenzyme conformation using an A-subunit FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wlodarchak et al., 2013</xref>), in which TC-FLASH produced by tetracysteine peptide (TC) fused to the C-terminus serves as an acceptor for the CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) fused to the N-terminus. The energy transfer efficiency of the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme containing this FRET sensor is much higher than the core enzyme, but is reduced significantly upon the addition of PME-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These data showed that that PME-1 interacts with B56 holoenzymes and induces a more open holoenzyme conformation.</p><p>We next validated the PME-1–B56 holoenzyme interactions in mammalian cell lysates. We coexpressed PME-1-mRuby fusion protein and recombinant B56 regulatory subunits harboring HA-tag and assessed their interactions by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). PME-1-mRuby readily interacts with PP2Ac and multiple HA-tagged regulatory subunits in the B56 family, B56β, B56γ1, B56γ3, and B56δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), supporting the earlier notion that PME-1 interacts with the common core in B56 subunits. Compared to other B56 family members, B56δ interacts with a much higher ratio of PP2Ac over PME-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between PME-1 and the PP2A-B56δ holoenzyme might be reduced by other structural elements unique to B56δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Consistently, a much lower stoichiometric amount of PME-1 comigrates with the PP2A-B56δ holoenzyme over gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). The recombinant B56δ associates with PP2Ac at a much higher level compared to other B56 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The resistance of this holoenzyme to PME-1 likely renders it less prone to demethylation and TIPRL/α4-mediated holoenzyme disassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PME-1 catalyzes direct demethylation of three families of PP2A holoenzymes</title><p>PME-1 activation relies on its binding to the PP2A active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). The holoenzyme conformational changes induced by PME-1 above might alleviate steric hindrance and allow PME-1 to interact with the PP2A active site. To test this hypothesis, we assembled the core enzyme and three representative PP2A holoenzymes from three families using Bα, B56γ1, and PR70 with higher than 90% in vitro methylation. After incubation with PME-1, the methylation level of all three holoenzymes decreases significantly, comparable to that of the core enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Our results suggest that PME-1-PP2A holoenzyme interactions enable all sequential events needed for PME-1 activation, allowing PME-1 to demethylate PP2A holoenzymes directly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping of PME-1 disordered regions in binding to PP2A regulatory subunits and holoenzymes</title><p>The ability of PME-1 to induce conformational changes in PP2A holoenzymes and overcome the steric hindrance of regulatory subunits led us to search for additional contacts made by PME-1 prior to its interaction with the PP2A active site. PME-1 has two ~40-residue disordered regions at the N-terminus and the internal loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The latter harbors a SLiM (<sup>251</sup>VEGIIEE<sup>258</sup>E) highly similar to B56 substrates that interact with the conserved B56 common core via a signature motif ‘LxxIxE’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2017a</xref>). The GST-tagged PME-1 B56 SLiM peptide (247–263) binds to B56γ1 with a binding affinity of ~13 μM measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

The deletion of the internal loop harboring the B56-SLiM (ΔIL) abolishes their interaction completely and deletion of N-terminal 18 residues (ΔN18) reduces the binding affinity by ~eightfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <italic>middle and right</italic>). We observed that a complete deletion of the N-terminal disordered region or deletion of N-terminal residues beyond residue 18 tends to cause PME-1 aggregate or a poorer protein behavior. PME-1 ΔN18 was thus used to test the function of the N-terminal disordered region. We also mapped the contribution of PME-1 motifs in interactions with PR70 and Bα. PME-1 binds directly to PR70 with a binding affinity of 0.7 μM. ΔIL reduces the binding affinity by ~twofold, and ΔN18 completely abolishes this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Using titration pulldown assay, we showed that PME-1 also interacts with Bα, which was weakened by ΔN18 but barely affected by ΔIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We did not use ITC for Bα due to its relatively lower thermal stability. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, these data indicate that the PME-1 internal loop harbors a primary B56-docking motif, and the N-terminal disordered region possesses a Bα- and PR70-docking motif.</p><p>We further investigated how PME-1 disordered regions contribute to the interactions with holoenzymes. PME-1 comigrates with all three PP2A holoenzymes over gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). ΔN18 decreased PME-1 interactions with all three PP2A holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>), consistent with the critical role of the N-terminal motif in binding to all three regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similarly, ΔIL had a major effect on interaction with the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) but a minor effect on interactions with PP2A-Bα and PP2A-PR70 holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the data summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> demonstrate that the N-terminal motif of PME-1 contributes to the interaction with all three regulatory subunits and holoenzymes with an essential role for interactions with Bα and PR70. The internal loop plays a dominant role in interaction with B56 but a minor role for interactions with Bα and PR70. Despite the dual interactions of the PME-1 core to the PP2A active site and PP2Ac-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xing et al., 2008</xref>), these data demonstrate direct interactions between PME-1 disordered motifs and PP2A regulatory subunits that are essential for interactions with PP2A holoenzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PME-1-binding inhibits substrate recognition by PP2A holoenzymes</title><p>Since the B56-binding motif in the PME-1 internal loop is similar to SLiMs in substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), we examined the potential role of PME-1 in blocking substrate recognition by PP2A holoenzymes. Previously, we elucidated the SLiM-based interactions that target PP2A-B56 to its substrates using proteomic peptide phage display (ProP-PD). SYT16 peptide was the strongest hit of B56 substrates identified by ProP-PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2017a</xref>). The GST-SYT16 peptide (LSSIAEEE) binds to B56γ1 with a binding affinity of 0.6 μM measured by ITC. By competition pulldown assay, we showed that the interaction between the SYT16 peptide and PP2A-B56γ1 was blocked by increasing concentrations of PME-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, left and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>).

Nonetheless, peptide motifs from a few substrates have been identified or are under investigation for these holoenzymes. Bα was recently reported to interact with CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 3 (CRTC3) and regulates CRTC3 phosphorylation and CREB transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sonntag et al., 2019</xref>). To investigate the effect of PME-1 on substrate recognition by the PP2A-Bα holoenzyme, we mapped the disordered regions of CRTC3, and identified a peptide motif that specifically recognizes this holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>). PME-1 competes with this CRTC3 motif for interaction with the PP2A-Bα holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, middle and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). The PR70 regulatory subunit was previously shown to recognize a peptide motif in Cdc6 and control the cellular level of Cdc6 during cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wlodarchak et al., 2013</xref>).

Parallel to ProP-PD phage selection to identify SLiMs for the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2017a</xref>), we also performed ProP-PD for the holoenzyme in complex with PME-1. The data showed that the presence of PME-1 blocked the binding of all peptide motifs recognized by the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme and reduced the counts for all B56-binding motifs to zero in phage selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>).

Structures overlaid via PP2Ac showed that the last five huntingtin-elongation-A-subunit-TOR (HEAT) repeats of the A-subunit remain mostly unchanged. The N-terminal 10 HEAT repeats shift significantly by increasing distances of 4–12 Å from HEAT repeat 10 to 1, resulting in a 12 Å shift in B56 that alleviates the steric hindrance for PME-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This structural observation is consistent with the signal changes in the holoenzyme FRET sensor in response to PME-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The structural shifts in B56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) allow juxtaposition of the PP2Ac–PME-1 interactions between PME-1 M342/Val 343 and PP2Ac Val126/Y127 to a portion of the PP2Ac–B56 interface in the holoenzyme–PME-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). The juxtaposed interfaces are associated with minor changes to this portion of the PP2Ac–B56 interface in the holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Most prominently, the interactions of the B56γ1 internal loop (IL, 110–130) to PP2Ac near the phosphatase active site in the holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) were abolished in the holoenzyme–PME-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). The perturbation of this loop might be at least in part due to PME-1 binding to the PP2A active site. Finally, the methylated PP2Ac tail no longer occupies the A–B56 interface compared to the holoenzyme. The latter two observations are described in detail later.</p><p>The mode of PME-1 binding underlies four coherent mechanisms that suppress the holoenzyme functions. In addition to binding directly to the phosphatase active site and demethylating the holoenzyme, PME-1 also occupies the B56 protein groove for recruiting substrates. PME-1 undergoes a significant angular movement away from B56 up to 6 Å pivoted at the PME-1 helix that contacts the phosphatase active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). The PME-1-PP2A active site interface remains essentially the same compared to the core enzyme–PME-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). It is important to note that Arg268 in PP2Ac near the phosphatase active site forms several H-bond interactions with PME-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), displacing its multiple H-bond contacts with the B56 internal loop in the holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The partially overlapping interfaces likely prevent the interactions of the B56 internal loop to PP2Ac in the holoenzyme–PME-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>). The negatively charged B56 internal loop would facilitate the phosphorylation site next to a positive patch to enter the holoenzyme active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). PME-1 binding and perturbation of the B56 internal loop in the holoenzyme would suppress this mechanism. The PME-1 angular shift further accommodates B56–PME-1 interactions. PME-1 ungergoes global allosteric changes for methylesterase activation as revealed by structural comparison of the PME-1 apo-enzyme and its complex with the PP2A core enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). The PME-1’s angular structural shift in its complex with the holoenzyme underscores the ability of PME-1 to undergo different modes of dynamic changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>B56–PME-1 interfaces</title><p>B56γ1 interacts with PME-1 at three separate interfaces involving both PME-1 structured core and disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Consistent with the mapping and sequence analysis earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the B56-docking SLiM in PME-1 occupies the substrate-binding groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), similar to the substrate peptide from BubR1 (<sup>669</sup>LDPIIE<sup>675</sup>D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). Five residues (V251, E252, I254, I255, and E256) in this SLiM form sidechain interactions with the B56γ1 substrate-binding groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <italic>interface I</italic>). Next to this protein groove features a network of salt-bridge and H-bond interactions between the PME-1 core (residues N192, Q195, N196, and R199) and B56γ1 (residues D180, K183, E226, and Q266), centered at the R199–E226 salt bridge interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <italic>interface II</italic>). Interface III is two HEAT repeats away from interface I and involves both the PME-1 structured core and its N-terminal disordered region (1–40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a, d</xref>). This interface harbors three widely separated salt bridge interactions between PME-1 residues, K217, R39, and R37, and B56γ1 residues, D313, E353, and E399 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The rest of the N-terminal disordered region (1–36) is invisible in the electron density map, but our earlier mapping of PME-1 disordered regions suggested that PME-1 N-terminal residues 1–18 also contribute to B56γ1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating the fourth interface between PME-1 and B56.

Furthermore, PME-1 mutations from each interface also reduced PME-1 binding to the PP2A-B56ɛ holoenzyme, another B56 family member; the combined mutations from three interfaces (I254K/R199E/R39E), hereafter referred to as 3MU, completely disrupted this binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). These results demonstrate that B56–PME-1 interfaces are crucial for PME-1 interactions with different PP2A-B56 holoenzymes, consistent with the earlier data that detected interactions between the recombinant PME-1 and multiple B56 subunits in mammalian cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Selective effects of PME-1 mutations at B56 interfaces compared to PME-1 inhibitor</title><p>We reason that B56–PME-1 interfaces dictate PME-1’s activity specifically toward PP2A-B56 holoenzymes, but not the core enzyme or holoenzymes from other families.

While the methylesterase activity toward the holoenzyme is detected biochemically, the entry of the PP2Ac tail into the PME-1 active site pocket is not captured by the cryo-EM structure, likely because this pocket is highly dynamic and is the most dynamic structure in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Different effects of PP2A methylesterase 1 (PME-1) inhibitor and B56–PME-1 interface mutations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The time-dependent demethylation curves of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-B56γ1 holoenzyme (upper left), the AC dimeric core enzyme (upper right), PP2A-Bα holoenzyme (lower left), and PP2A-PR70 holoenzyme (lower right) by PME-1 WT and mutant (3MU).

We next dissected PME-1’s functions in p53 signaling using B56 interface mutations and a PME-1 inhibitor, ABL127. Overexpression of PME-1-mRuby elevates p53 phosphorylation at Thr55, and ABL127 reduces this elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a, b</xref>).

In vitro dissection of PP2A regulation complexes arrives at a strictly controlled linear pathway for PP2A holoenzyme biogenesis: (1) stabilization of the partially folded, latent PP2Ac by α4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>); (2) PP2Ac activation by phosphatase activator (PTPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2014</xref>); (3) methylation of the active core enzyme by LCMT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stanevich et al., 2011</xref>); and (4) methylation-facilitated formation of stable holoenzymes in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bryant et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tolstykh et al., 2000</xref>). Together with this pathway, holoenzyme demethylation and disassembly form a regulation loop for holoenzyme biogenesis and recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which provides a plausible mechanism for up- and downregulation of PP2A holoenzymes in cellular signaling.

Our study reveals detailed mechanisms of elevated PME-1 expression in suppressing p53 activity both under basal conditions and during DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), corroborating the oncogenic function of PME-1. Furthermore, PME-1 activity is spatially controlled in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Longin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Turowski et al., 1995</xref>). Robust PP2A demethylation was detected after the mammalian cells were lysed and predominantly affected PP2A-B55 and PP2A-PR72 holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yabe et al., 2018</xref>). These holoenzymes are likely spatially separated from PME-1 in intact cells but interact upon disruption of cellular organelles. Since PP2A regulatory subunits are highly varied in tissue, organ, and cellular distributions, holoenzyme demethylation might occur in strictly and spatiotemporally controlled manners under distinct signaling contexts. How PME-1 activities are regulated and how its broad covalent modifications (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phosphosite.org">http://phosphosite.org</ext-link>) regulate its activities remain to be investigated.</p><p>The cryo-EM structure of the PP2A-B56 holoenzyme–PME-1 complex reveals remarkable structural malleability of both the holoenzyme and PME-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This observation reinforces the dynamic nature of PP2A regulation, although holoenzymes are thermodynamically the most stable forms of PP2A. The structural dynamic not only accommodates the unexpected binding but is also crucial for methylesterase activation. The structured cores and disordered regions make at least six separate contacts between PME-1 and PP2A-B56 holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). These contacts involve multiple functionally important sites, including the PME-1 active site, the phosphatase active site, and the B56 substrate-binding groove, providing a coherent structural basis for holoenzyme demethylation and for suppressing PP2A holoenzyme activity. In summary, the mode of PME-1 binding to the PP2A-B56 holoenzyme underlies four coherent mechanisms to control the holoenzyme functions: (1) holoenzyme demethylation to prime holoenzyme for decommissioning; (2) reducing the efficacy of substrate-entry to the phosphatase active site by direct binding to the PP2A active site and by (3) perturbing the B56 internal loop near the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>); (4) blocking the protein groove for the LxxIxE motif in substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a, b</xref>). Reciprocally, the shared holoenzyme-binding motifs in PME-1 and substrates also render holoenzymes engaged with substrates less prone to demethylation. The PME-1 disordered regions synthesize novel activities by three mechanisms: tethering holoenzymes, enabling large structural shifts, and blocking holoenzyme–substrate recognition. Such structural and functional intricacy is likely a common theme for PME-1 interactions with other families of PP2A holoenzymes.</p><p>Our in vitro structural and biochemical insights provide a foundation for dissecting complex cellular PME-1 activities. Both holoenzyme–substrate and holoenzyme–PME-1 interactions are highly dynamic and flimsy in cells, making cellular investigation extremely challenging. The strict control of cellular location and activities of PME-1 also requires experimental strategies to dissect PME-1 functions in intact cells. The general effects of PME-1 inhibitor and the selective effects of B56-specific interface mutations allow us to pinpoint the function of PME-1 toward PP2A-B56 holoenzymes in controlling inhibitory p53 phosphorylation at Thr55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The PCR products were extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer with the following exceptions: (1) Gel extracts were resolved at room temperature (RT); (2) DNA was eluted with 30 μl low Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Molarities of the eluted library DNA were determined on the 2100 Bioanalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Template preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction using the Ion PGM Template OT2 200 Kit on the Ion OneTouch 2 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twenty-five µl of 5 pM library DNA (1.25 × 10<sup>−4</sup> pmol) was used in the template reaction. Sequencing was conducted on the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer using the Ion PGM Sequencing 200 Kit v2 and the Ion 314 Chip v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manuals. Signal processing and base calling were done using the Torrent Suite Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79736.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sohn</surname><given-names>Jungsan</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" object-id-type="id" object-id="10.1101/2022.07.01.498399" link-type="continued-by" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.01.498399"/></front-stub><body><p>Xing and colleagues used a combination of biochemical assays and cryo-EM to investigate the role of PME-1 in regulating PP2A, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Notably, they reveal here that PME-1 inserts an unstructured loop into the B-domain of the PPA2 holoenzyme and allosterically regulates the activity of the catalytic domain. This novel mechanism then plays a key role in controlling the cellular homeostasis of PP2A. Together, the work presented here provides new insights into mechanisms for an oncogenic function of PME-1 in regulating (inhibiting) p53 phosphorylation via PP2A-B56 holoenzymes under normal and DNA damage response conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79736.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sohn</surname><given-names>Jungsan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Whitaker</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0567t7073</institution-id><institution>Fox Chase Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.01.498399">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498399v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We added the Y-axis to all SEC profiles in Figure 1b and Figure S1b-d. We often use a variety of complexes and proteins with different molecular weights in the lab to normalize our size exclusion columns. In response to this reviewer’s comment, we added the peak positions of the PP2A free catalytic subunit (36 kDa), the PP2A core enzyme (100 kDa), and the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme (150 kDa) as one set of lab standards to Figure 1b. The description of these standards was added to the figure legend for Figure 1b. We also marked the peak positions and molecular weights of the PP2A- B56γ1 holoenzyme, PME-1 alone, and the PME-1-holoenzyme complex in Figure S1b-d to demonstrate further the relationships between elution volumes and different molecular weights of the proteins/complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1d: what is the band marked by asterisk. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. The bands marked by the asterisk were the heavy chain of the anti-HA antibody. We apologize for missing this point in the initial submission. The anti-HA antibody was immobilized on the Protein G beads and used to pull out the HA-tagged B56 and its associated proteins. It was then eluted together with the target proteins. The clarification was added to the figure legend of Figure 1d as suggested by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2b-d: the presentation of the SEC data and SDS-PAGE gels needs improvement:</p><p>– Please add MW standards.</p></disp-quote><p>The MW standards were added as in Figure 1b and described in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– All SEC profiles should be in the same elution volume range of 6-18ml for better comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Great suggestion. The SEC profiles in Figure 2b-d were revised as the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It's not clear why gels have different numbers of lanes, such as 7 to 9? The gel quality can be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer hinted at an important point that using the same number of lanes for the fractions in the same volume range would aid better comparison. The number of lanes varied because the peak fractions varied from profile to profile due to different binding affinities of the full-length or truncated PME-1 to different holoenzymes. We further cropped the SDS-PAGE image to keep the main fractions for the peak. In response to this reviewer's comment, we showed eight lanes for all profiles except Figure 2d right panel, which used nine lanes to reflect better the dissociation of PME-1 ∆N18 from the ACBα holoenzyme. Due to the tendency of free Bα to form aggregates, Bα is slightly sub-stoichiometric to the core enzyme. Therefore, a fraction of the PP2A core enzyme is associated with PME-1 ∆N18, and an additional lane was needed to show the excess amount of PME-1. Furthermore, as shown in Figure s2c, PME-1 ∆N18 reduces, rather than abolishes, the PME-1 binding to the ACBα holoenzyme. Therefore, a small amount of ACBα-PME-1 ∆N18 was still observed in the profile, resulting in a broader peak range.</p><p>As much as we attempted to present the fractions from the same range of elution volumes, there are still slight differences from profile to profile. Therefore, we also labeled the range of elution volumes for the fractions examined on SDS-PAGE for better clarity.</p><p>The image quality was in part compromised by the large number of PP2A complexes handled in parallel. The assembly of merely one PP2A holoenzyme complex is challenging for the majority of trainees. Handling a large number of complexes in parallel requires absolutely tenacious efforts. Even with a large batch of purified PP2Ac, after all the assembly and purification processes, the amounts of materials recovered for each complex became quite small. Therefore, a much larger volume for each fraction was boiled to a reduced volume for loading. We hope the reviewer recognizes the efforts behind those data and finds that the SDS-PAGE data are conclusive for whether PME-1 comigrates with the holoenzymes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2d right panel: the elution volume doesn't make sense. Why ACBα eluted at 14ml instead of 12ml?</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate that the reviewer identified this problem. The student used a different SEC column for this complex. Based on the MW standards, this profile is now normalized to the main column used for all other profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should provide an explanation of why ∆N18 deletion of PME-1 is used in their study.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this reviewer’s comment, we added a brief clarification in the revised manuscript, lines 184-187:</p><p>“We observed that a complete deletion of the N-terminal disordered region or deletion of N-terminal residues beyond residue 18 tends to cause PME-1 aggregate or a poorer protein behavior. PME-1 ΔN18 was thus used to test the function of the N-terminal disordered region.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Page 17, line 345: '…similar to the substrate peptide from BubR1', please add the reference and BubR1 substrate sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested information was added to the revised manuscript, line 358: “similar to the substrate peptide from BubR1 (<sup>669</sup>LDPIIE<sup>675</sup>D) (J. Wang et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Page 20, line 401: 'PME-1- 'should be 'PME-1.'</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the break of the phrase “PME-1-holoenzyme interactions” by the insertion of Figure 5. Figure 5 was inserted after the entire paragraph in the revised manuscript. This phrase is now in line 413.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 5d: for the latch-to-induce-and-lock model, the authors should comment on the possible effect on PME-1 binding to PP2A if changing the length of the linker between SLiM and PME-1 catalytic domain.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer made a very interesting point. We elaborated on this point in the revised manuscript, lines 453-459:</p><p>“It is important to mention that the length of the PME-1 internal loop (239-282) is crucial in this “latch-to-induce-and-lock” model for the B56 SLiM (<sup>251</sup>VEGIIE<sup>257</sup>E) within the loop to reach the substrate SLiM-binding pocket of B56. As reflected in Figure 3a, the internal loop provides two invisible 12-residue and 25-residue linkers, 239-250 and 258-282, to span the direct distances of 23 Å and 31 Å, respectively, from the enzyme core to the two termini of the SLiM. Deleting any residues in the first linker might compromise the “latch-to-induce-and-lock” model.”</p><p>The addition of this structural analysis further supports the model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
