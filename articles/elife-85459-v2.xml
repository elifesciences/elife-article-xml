The subcortical thalamic-basolateral amygdala (BLA) pathway serves as a shortcut for salient stimuli ensuring rapid processing. Here, we show that BLA neuronal and thalamic axonal activity in mice mirror the defensive behavior evoked by an innate visual threat as well as an auditory learned threat. Importantly, perturbing this pathway compromises defensive responses to both forms of threats, in that animals fail to switch from exploratory to defensive behavior. Despite the shared pathway between the two forms of threat processing, we observed noticeable differences. Blocking β-adrenergic receptors impairs the defensive response to the innate but not the learned threats. This reduced defensive response, surprisingly, is reflected in the suppression of the activity exclusively in the BLA as the thalamic input response remains intact. Our side-by-side examination highlights the similarities and differences between innate and learned threat-processing, thus providing new fundamental insights.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>innate threat</kwd><kwd>learned threart</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>beta-adrenergic receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF16OC0023368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AUFF NOVA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danish National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting grant 22736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabavi</surname><given-names>Sadegh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The subcortical amygdala pathway, which has been traditionally associated with learning threats, is also required for processing an innate threat.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Survival is the direct product of maximizing gains and avoiding harms.

Such capacity can be acquired through learning, a mechanism widely believed to rely on synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mongeau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tierney, 1986</xref>). However, specific sensory stimuli could be innately appetitive or aversive and evoke approach or defensive behaviors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pereira and Moita, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Rapid and continuous integration of innate and learned mechanisms promotes survival. This integration is ideally carried out as a timely and appropriate reaction to sensory stimuli. While cortical processing is necessary for cognitively demanding tasks, it is not well suited for rapid threat detection and response. However, subcortical processing serves as a neural shortcut that can crudely and rapidly elicit defensive behaviors, bypassing the more deliberate and intricate cortical processing. This efficient processing is partially explained by the fact that subcortical areas are among the earliest brain areas that receive sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McFadyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pessoa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that the subcortical circuit from the multisensory thalamus, lateral thalamus (LT) to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is necessary for the acquisition and the recall of auditory learned threat conditioning in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edeline and Weinberger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwata et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeDoux et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Romanski and LeDoux, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Romanski and LeDoux, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Romanski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). However, the role of the subcortical LT-BLA pathway is underemphasized and understudied in processing innate threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we sought to examine this pathway for processing innate threats as well, with the view that a side-by-side comparison may lead to a new mechanistic insight into the similarities and differences between circuits processing innate and learned threats.</p><p>Here, we show that, as with the learned threat conditioning, the LT-BLA pathway is essential for processing the innately aversive looming stimulus. Inactivation of either the BLA or the BLA-projecting neurons in the LT was sufficient to impair defensive responses to innate and learned threats. Additionally, fiber photometry from the BLA neurons or the LT axons projecting to the BLA showed a rapid rise in their activity to both forms of stimuli. However, the activity was reduced as mice showed habituation to the aversive stimuli. Despite similarities in processing the innate and learned threat, we found that propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor blocker, specifically impairs the innate defensive response, while the response to the learned threat remains intact.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BLA activity is required for processing a visual innately aversive threat and aversive conditioning</title><p>Threat conditioning is an associative learning paradigm where an initially neutral tone (conditioned stimulus [CS]) is repeatedly paired with an aversive footshock (unconditioned stimulus [US]).

To test whether the BLA is required for visually evoked innate defensive response, we applied a loss-of-function approach by transiently inactivating the BLA. We infected the BLA pyramidal neurons with hM4Di (Gi-coupled human muscarinic M4 designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug [iDREADD]) tagged with m-Cherry fluorescent proteins. We validated that the efficacy of iDREADDs’ agonist, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), mediated inhibition by performing optical stimulation of LT axons and in vivo electrophysiology recording in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, the LT axons projecting to the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and the neurons within the BLA produce time-locked activity to each looming stimulus in mice showing defensive responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). With repeated exposure to looming stimuli, the neuronal activity, along with defensive responses, gradually fades. The habituation to looming stimuli was rapid (within-session) and long-lasting (for the entire duration of the experiment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). A recent study has shown that upon repeated exposure to a looming stimulus neuronal response within deeper layers of superior colliculus (SC) undergo rapid visual habituation. A form of short-term depression has been proposed to underlie the fast habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon may underlie the within-session habituation that we observed here. This is consistent with the gradual reduction in the activity of the BLA-projecting neurons within LT, a region downstream of the deep layers of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benavidez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Linke et al., 1999</xref>). The long-lasting habituation, on the other hand, cannot be explained by such a visual adaptation or habituation that lasts on the order of seconds to minutes and not days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boehnke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wark et al., 2009</xref>). The long-term form of the habituation largely occurs upstream of the BLA as observed in the reduced activity in the LT projections to the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). If, as we suspect, the signal for the looming stimulus to the LT originates from the SC (see below), the long-term form of the habituation may, at least in part, be processed within the LT. Further studies are necessary to test this possibility.</p><p>Although reduced defensive response to an innately aversive signal such as a looming stimulus has been categorized as habituation, we observed physiological similarities between habituation to a looming stimulus and extinction to a cued conditioning stimulus. Both phenomena reduce the heightened evoked activity of the LT projections as well as the BLA neurons. Additionally, while mice injected with propranolol did not show defensive response to a looming stimulus, 2 d later in the absence of the drug the same mice showed robust freezing response to the stimulus. This is similar to a study reporting that mice injected with propranolol before a cued fear recall have reduced freezing response to the cue, while in the following day the mice show a heightened freezing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leal Santos et al., 2021</xref>); unlike this study, however, we did not observe a physiological or behavioral effect of propranolol on cued conditioning (see below for discussion). The cellular and circuit mechanisms of extinction have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orsini and Maren, 2012</xref>). These studies may provide mechanistic insight into the habituation that we have observed here. Further investigations in this line may have fundamental and translational value.</p><p>An overlap in processing innate and learned threats is not unique to the LT-BLA pathway. The lateral habenula and the central amygdala control the processing of a number of innate and learned threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecca et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lecca et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mondoloni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sachella et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Isosaka et al., 2015</xref>). Since both types of threats share a similar repertoire of defensive responses, such as freezing and escaping, the wiring economy favors the layout where there is closer physical proximity between the two circuits, as we observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klyachko and Stevens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stevens, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Direct and indirect evidence shows that the LT-BLA pathway processes other forms of innate threats as well. Recently, studies have demonstrated that inactivation of thalamic-BLA pathway reduces freezing response to intense sound and looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kang et al., 2022</xref>), as well as innately aversive ultrasound activates the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mongeau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shukla and Chattarji, 2022</xref>). Moreover, the use of live predators as an innate threat has further supported this notion by showing that the BLA lesion in rodents eliminates defensive responses to the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bindi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martinez et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Since the LT is widely regarded as an auditory relay region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rogan and LeDoux, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weinberger, 2011</xref>), its role as the main source of innately aversive visual signal to the BLA may seem unexpected. However, it has been known that the LT receives auditory, somatosensory, visual, and multimodal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bordi and LeDoux, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Linke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Linke, 1999</xref>). The lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP) has been proposed as another direct source conveying a looming stimulus signal to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Our reversible disconnection of the LT-BLA pathway, which largely spares the LP, argues otherwise. The LT lesion not only abolishes the defensive responses to the looming stimulus but also largely eliminates the stimulus-evoked activity in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Although the input source of the looming stimulus to the LT is unknown, we speculate the SC could be a likely candidate as it encodes threat and escape behavior to looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evans et al., 2018</xref>) and sends monosynaptic connections to the LT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Linke et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, it has been shown that the SC may trigger defensive responses to the looming stimulus by conveying the signals to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evans et al., 2018</xref>) or indirectly to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). It is relevant to note that the BLA conveys learned aversive signals directly to the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>) and indirectly through the CeA to the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). It will be of particular interest to test whether the information signaling the innate threat is communicated through the same channel. As the SC and the BLA, the two essential regions in processing the innate visual threat, share similar downstream targets, their specific contribution to the process deserves further inquiry.</p><p>Consistent with the notion that the innate and learned aversive stimuli are conveyed through the LT inputs to the BLA, the activities of these two regions largely mirrored each other; however, noticeable differences were observed. For example, in line with previous studies on innate defensive response to predators odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Do Monte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), in mice injected with propranolol, the defensive responses to the looming stimulus diminished significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and E</xref>); the stimulus-induced activity, however, was reduced only in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), with the response of the axons of the BLA-projecting LT neurons remaining unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This indicates that the looming stimulus conveyed through the thalamic input is essential but not sufficient to activate BLA neurons and trigger defensive responses, and the activation of β-adrenergic receptors by the release of norepinephrine is required. The neuromodulator may enhance the excitability of the pyramidal neurons directly by downregulating potassium channels in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faber et al., 2008</xref>) or indirectly by reducing excitability of inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tully et al., 2007</xref>). Given the time-locked neuronal activity to the stimuli, the modulation of excitability, a comparably slow process, may be achieved through a tonic release of norepinephrine. As for the LT, to the best of our knowledge, there is little published work regarding its modulation by norepinephrine or even if β-adrenergic receptors are expressed in this region. Therefore, at this stage, we have no grounds to speculate about the ineffectiveness of propranolol in blocking the LT projection response to the looming stimulus. Here, we should point out that administration of propranolol prior to the conditioning or recall had no effect on freezing response. The literature on the role of norepinephrine in cued conditioning is mixed. While intraperitoneal injection of propranolol prior to a cued memory recall reduces freezing to the tone in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2009</xref>), the drug may reduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leal Santos et al., 2021</xref>) or have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cain et al., 2004</xref>) on the freezing response in mice. The differences in species or strains used or experimental parameters may contribute to the variability in the effect of the drug in freezing response.</p><p>Regarding the processing of the learned threat, again, we observed some differences between the LT projections to the BLA and the BLA itself. As animals learned the CS-US association, we observed an enhanced short-onset auditory response in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>). We did not detect a similar conditioning-correlated change in the activity of the LT axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). It must be noted that because of our use of calcium indicators, we cannot exclude millisecond changes in the auditory response latency in the LT axons. However, previous works using sub-millisecond single-unit recording also showed similar patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bordi and LeDoux, 1992</xref>). The BLA also differed from the incoming LT projections in its response to the CS after an extensive extinction protocol. While activity of the LT axons returned to its preconditioning value, the CS-evoked activity of the BLA neurons after the extinction was significantly reduced compared to its value prior to the conditioning. This strongly suggests that other inputs to the BLA contribute to such a pronounced reduction. Feedforward inhibition of excitatory neurons in the BLA through synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Polepalli et al., 2010</xref>) or dopaminergic modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bissière et al., 2003</xref>) of the local inhibitory neurons may to some extent dampen the CS-evoked response after the extinction. Also, it has been proposed that norepinephrine can promote extinction through the activation of the infralimbic region, which in turn blunts the BLA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giustino and Maren, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). It is pertinent to mention that we have used an extensive multiple-session extinction training. Recently, it has been shown that such an extensive extinction protocol may involve a different mechanism by which the original fear memory is erased, and the extinguished CS becomes habituated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although not the focus of this work, we observed several intriguing physiological features during the conditioning and recall sessions. The conditioning increases the tone-induced activity in the BLA and reduces the response time onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bordi et al., 1993</xref>). The increased response and decreased time onset were significantly more pronounced on the recall day. We observed a similar pattern in the LT input where there was a significant enhanced activity during the recall session, which was not visible during the conditioning. This is in line with previous studies using single-cell imaging in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grewe et al., 2017</xref>). This significant change between the last trial of the conditioning and the first trial of the recall is puzzling. We speculate that a lack of a <italic>detectable</italic> increase in the CS-evoked activity at the later stages of the conditioning could be caused by a masking effect from a transient increase in firing rate during the conditioning. Although we did not observe a difference in the overall baseline activity during the conditioning (data not shown), downregulation as well as upregulation of the basal neuronal activity of subpopulations of neurons during the conditioning has been reported. This counteracting phenomenon could produce a net effect of no change in the baseline activity at the population level, while a subset of neurons with increased basal firing rate, possibly caused by enhanced excitability, may undergo plasticity. The plasticity within this population, however, will be masked during the conditioning by the transient increase in the basal firing rate. Alternatively, synaptic potentiation may occur at the dendritic compartments, which through local inhibitory circuits is uncoupled from somatic activity.</p><p>The LT-BLA pathway typically has been evaluated in relation to associative learnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2008</xref>), especially associative learned threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Recent works on associative learned threats have particularly solidified the importance of associative plasticity in the LT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study has further documented the critical role of the LT in processing different forms of innate threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kang et al., 2022</xref>). Our main aim in this work was to investigate the similarities and differences in processing an innate threat, which relies on pre-wired circuits, and a learned threat, which requires synaptic plasticity. By conducting a side-by-side comparison within the same animals, we not only gained new insights about shared and distinct features of processing the two forms of threats in the LT-BLA pathway, but also learned that, despite being monosynaptically connected, the LT and the BLA differ in important ways, as we detailed in our discussion. This provides new avenues for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

No shelter was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shang et al., 2018</xref>). The exposure to the looming stimulus was performed during the dark period (between 6 PM and 10 PM). Mice were placed in the center of the arena and explored freely for 8–10 min before exposure to the looming stimulus. The looming stimulus consisted of an expanding black disk over a gray background, and it consisted of five repetitions, from 2° to 20° of visual angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). The loom widens in 250 ms and remains at the same size for 250 ms with 2 s of pause between each loom. The experimenter was blind to the treatment and manually delivered the looming stimulus. The behavioral responses were recorded with a top camera (Phihong POE21U-1AF). All the animals were exposed at least 2–3 times to the looming stimulus, and only the one eliciting the greatest defensive response was analyzed. The defensive responses were analyzed automatically and manually using ANY-maze software (Stoelting, Ireland) for the 30 s following the onset of the looming stimulus. An experimenter, blind to the treatment, analyzed each mouse’s freezing percentage, tail rattling, escape events, and rearing events. Freezing was defined as a complete lack of movements, except for the respiratory movements, that lasted for at least 1 s. Tail rattling was defined as an event in which the mouse moved the tail vigorously. Escape events were defined as a sharp increase in the locomotor speed three times greater than the average speed before the exposure to the looming stimulus. Rearing was defined as an event in which the mouse stood on its hindpaws, and they were quantified for the 30 s preceding (baseline) and following the looming stimulus presentation. The differential score was calculated by subtracting the rearing events following the looming stimulus subtracted by the rearing events during the baseline period. Note that positive differential score values indicate an increase in rearing events compared with the baseline period, whereas negative scores indicate a decrease in rearing events compared with the baseline period.</p><p>For the reversible disconnection experiment, we tested the effect of the inhibition of the LT-BLA pathway on the locomotion and on the anxiety levels. Locomotion was indicated by line crosses in the looming arena during the first 8 min of habituation. Anxiety-like behavior was measured as the percentage of time spent in the center part of the looming arena during the same time period.</p><p>For the fiber photometry experiments, a white looming stimulus was used as a neutral control stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). It was presented in a pseudorandom order alternated with the black looming stimulus. The white looming stimulus presented the same repetitions and speed as the black looming stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Aversive conditioning</title><p>The apparatus consisted of an open-top cage (24 × 20 × 30 cm) with metal floor bars placed in a soundproof cubicle (55 × 60 × 57 cm) (Ugo Basile, Italy). Two different behavioral protocols were used in this study. In one, the mice were conditioned by using five pairings consisting of 20 s, 5 kHz, sinewave tone (CS) co-terminating with a 2 s footshock (US) 0.6 mA. On the other hand, the animals were conditioned using four pairings consisting of 25 s, 7 kHz, sinewave tone co-terminating with 2 s foot shock 0.5 mA. After the conditioning, the animals stayed isolated for 10–15 min before returning to their home cage. Short-term (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) recall were assessed in a new context 2 hr or 24 hr after the conditioning, respectively. After 2 min of acclimation to the new context, the mice were presented to four or five CS presentations without the footshock. The intertrial interval ranged between 35 s and 120 s for both conditioning and testing sessions. The behavioral response was recorded by a top camera and/or side-view camera, and freezing was scored automatically by ANY-maze software. The freezing percentage indicates the time the mouse spent freezing during the CS presentation, divided by the CS length multiplied by 100. For the conditioning session, the freezing percentage is calculated for each CS presentation. For the recall session, the freezing percentage is the average of four CS presentations, with the only exception of the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, in which the freezing percentage is the average of five CS presentations. The pre-CS freezing percentage is calculated as the average of the freezing time during the 25 s before each CS presentation.</p><p>For the fiber photometry experiments, the mice underwent an extinction protocol for 2 d. On each day, the CS was played 12 times in the recall context without the footshock.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Drugs</title><p>Propranolol hydrochloride (20 mg/kg, 500 µL; Merck, P0884) or sotalol hydrochloride (10 mg/kg, 500 µL; Merck, S0278) or clozapine N-oxide dihydrochloride (CNO water-soluble, HelloBio, HB6149; 10 mg/kg, 400 µL) or saline (0.9% NaCl, 400/500 µL) were administered by intraperitoneal injection. After the injection, the mice were isolated for 30 min before the beginning of the experimental procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Electrophysiology recordings</title><p>As previously described, mice were injected with inhibitory DREADDs or mCherry in the BLA. The same cohort of mice was injected with undiluted AAV-5/2-hSyn1-chI-ChrimsonR_tdTomato (titer: 5.3 × 10E12 vg/mL) in the LT. After 4–5 wk of expression, the mice were anesthetized using 0.5 mg/kg FMM with the following mixture: 0.05 mg/ml of fentanyl ([Hameln, 007007] 0.05 mg/kg), plus 5 mg/mL of midazolam ([Hameln, 002124] 5 mg/kg), and 1 mg/mL of medetomidine (VM Pharma, 087896). After the induction of the anesthesia, the mice were placed on the stereotaxic frame. A 32-channel optoelectrode (Poly3, Neuronexus) was placed at the following coordinates: AP: 1.6 mm; ML: 3.48; DV: 3.5 ± 0.1. The neural data were amplified and digitized at 25 kHz. The input–output curve was recorded 30 min before and 1 hr after the CNO injection using a pulse of 0.5/1 ms, 638 nm.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and brains were extracted and kept in 10% formalin for 24 hr. Afterward, the brains were processed to confirm viral expression and electrode location.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Fiber photometry recordings and analysis</title><p>All the recordings were performed with Doric fiber photometry system composed of an LED-driver, a fiber photometry console, and a Doric minicube with 460–490 nm for GCaMP excitation, 415 nm for isosbestic excitation, and 580–650 nm for optical stimulation [ilFMC5-G2_IE(400-410)_E(460-490)_F(500-540)_O(580-680)_S]. A low-autofluorescence patch cord (200 nm or 300 nm, 0.37 NA) and a pigtailed rotary joint (200 nm, 0.37 NA) were used. The latter were bleached for 5 hr before each experiment via a 473 nm laser at 15–17 mW. The GCaMP signal was amplified with a Doric amplifier with a 10× gain and recorded with Doric Neuroscience Studio software (version 5.4.1.23) at 11 kHz. The signal was downsampled at 120 Hz for analysis. Light power at the patch cord tip was set between 30 and 35 µW for 470 nm excitation.</p><p>For synchronization with the looming stimulus presentation, a National Instrument board (NI USB 6003) was used to time-stamp the looming stimulus presentation over the calcium signal. For synchronization of the tone and shock presentation, an input–output box connected to the aversive conditioning system was used.</p><p>After 4–5 wk of virus expression, mice were handled for 2–3 d before the beginning of the experiments. Before each recording, the fiber-optic cannula was cleaned with CleanClicker (Thorlab; USA). To reduce bleaching during the behavioral experiments, the habituation to the looming stimulus and the extinction to the tone were conducted without recording the GCaMP signal.</p><p>A customized MATLAB script was used for the analysis. All the traces with a sudden change in the isosbestic signal were discarded in the final analysis. The code used for the analysis is freely available at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NabaviLab-Git/Photometry-Signal-Analysis">https://github.com/NabaviLab-Git/Photometry-Signal-Analysis</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nabavi Lab, 2022</xref>). Briefly, the signals were downsampled to 120 Hz using local averaging. A first-order polynomial was fitted onto the data using the least-squares method. To calculate the relative change in fluorescence, the raw GCaMP signal was normalized using the fitted signal according to the following equation: deltaF/F = (GCaMP signal fitted signal)/(fitted signal). Behavioral events of interest were extracted and standardized using the mean and standard deviation of the baseline period. In all the plots, we used only individual trials for each animal.</p><p>The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by using a built-in function in GraphPad Prism 9. All the peaks with a distance below 10% between the minimum and the maximum were discarded. For the AUC analysis for the looming stimulus, a baseline period of 2 s was considered and the first 2 s of the looming stimulus presentation. For the CS, we used the 1.5 s as the baseline period and first 2 s of the CS presentation. For the US, we analyzed the AUC for 0.5 s preceding and following the footshock presentation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We collectively agree that the authors' report of a role for projections from the lateral thalamus to the basolateral amygdala in innate defensive responses to visual stimuli could be an important contribution to neurosciences. However, following a consultation session between the Reviewing Editor and the Reviewers several concerns were raised regarding the interpretation of the data and the methods employed. Based on these, we have enumerated the following recommendations that we encourage the authors to carefully address. In addition, the assessment from each of the reviewers is included below. With your revision, please include a point-by-point response to each reviewer comment.</p><p>1) All three Reviewers and the Reviewing Editor agree that proper histological characterization of the lateral thalamic-amygdalar pathway studied by the authors is required. This is critical given that although the authors solely refer to MGN there appears to be labeling in regions like PIL/SPFp and SG which are known to project to BLA and whose contributions to auditory fear conditioning are well established. Please attend to the authors specific suggestions. It would also help to have schematics of viral expression and placement maps showing spread and placements for all subjects for each experiment.</p><p>2) The Reviewers raise several methodological concerns that the authors should carefully consider. Note that addressing some of these may require additional experiments (e.g., circuit manipulations during memory retrieval).</p><p>3) In general, the Reviewers feel that the authors should discuss the interpretation of their data in further detail.</p><p>4) Please ensure your manuscript complies with the <italic>eLife</italic> policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report summary statistics (e.g., t, F values) and degrees of freedom, exact p-values, and 95% confidence intervals wherever possible. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.</p><p>5) Please include a key resource table.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The paper would be strengthened by showing that optogenetic inhibition of the MGM-BLA pathway precisely during auditory tone or looming stimulus presentation decreases freezing. It is odd that the authors used disconnections and lesions instead of projection optogenetic inhibition, which would provide the authors with much-needed temporal resolution in their manipulations.</p><p>– It is unclear if the MGM pathway is necessary only for timed stimulus-evoked freezing or whether this circuit generally alters the defensive state. Measuring the loss of function effects on open-field anxiety behavior would be informative in this regard.</p><p>– Not all figures contain photos of representative histology. Please add histology to all figures that are missing it. Please show that MGM virus expression did not spread into the visual lateral geniculate nucleus</p><p>– The authors show that the defensive response induced by the looming stimulus rapidly habituates, as shown by other groups. The authors should discuss why this phenomenon occurs, as it is highly unusual. Mice do not rapidly habituate to any other innate fear or anxiety-inducing stimuli, such as predators or open spaces.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Additional specific comments to the authors:</p><p>a) Given that the regions (and a significant proportion of individual neurons) that project to the BLA also project to the neocortex, and in turn neocortex projects strongly to the amygdala as well, based on the presented data it is possible to interpret that the observed role of the MGN-BLA in threat processing is not merely direct as concluded in the study but could also be indirect through the cortex. The function of these two pathways to BLA is a major topic in the field, and the study would thus benefit from a discussion about this alternative interpretation.</p><p>b) A main claim of the authors is that mice with disrupted MGN-BLA fail to switch from exploration to freezing. May the authors quantify this directly to support this claim?: for example, rearing before vs. after stimulus onset. On similar lines, is it possible that instead of decreasing freezing, disrupting the pathway is increasing escape responses? It does not seem to be the case by looking at the supplementary figures, but making this explicit in the text would help.</p><p>c) The freezing behaviour and pathway activity mostly go hand-in-hand, but it would be relevant to discuss: 1) at the end of the conditioning phase freezing is increased but not the CS evoked response in MGN axons. 2) the MGN-BLA activity decays with habituation and extinction, but these are different cognitive processes. What is the interpretation in both cases?</p><p>d) The white looming stimulus is a good control. Have the authors considered using a nonaversive black stimulus?</p><p>e) Authors state that the time locking of the calcium signals to stimuli is evident, but it would be good to support it with a quantification. Why does the BLA signal have a shorter delay than the MGN axons signal? This is not expected.</p><p>f) Some methodological issues are not clarified and generate confusion:</p><p>1) When is freezing or rearing measured with respect to stimuli presentation (looming, sounds, foot-shocks)?</p><p>2) Are we looking at averages of trials in the data or individual trials?</p><p>3) How is habituation to looming stimuli defined? Is there habituation in the first session already?</p><p>4) Why is memory recall sometimes 2h and others 24 hs after conditioning throughout the work?</p><p>5) In the selective lesion experiments, where were GFP+ neurons counted in the anterior-posterior axis, and how were the areas defined?</p><p>6) How were AUC and z-score quantified?</p><p>g) On similar lines the clarity of the figures should be improved:</p><p>1) Define unit in rearings plots. Is it a number of rearings?</p><p>2) For fiber-photometry recordings and ethograms, please indicate the duration of stimuli in the plot (looming, sounds, foot-shocks), and label it on the plot. It would also help to use the same time scale across similar plots, e.g. in 3H-J and 5E-G.</p><p>3) Figure 1a: can you show the placement of the recording electrode?</p><p>4) Figure 1b: is it possible that the two first traces without and with CNO are identical? The term &quot;baseline&quot; is confusing here; maybe you could say &quot;before CNO&quot;. State the meaning of fEPSP.</p><p>5) Figure 1c. What is presented in the picture exactly? the mCherry expression looks way outside the BLA. Is it maybe not the best representative image?</p><p>6) Figure 1E legend mistake: &quot;rearing is reduced&quot;.</p><p>7) For figure 1h and all other equivalent quantifications in the manuscript, what are baseline freezing levels (before sound presentation) in memory recall? It is important to show that freezing is evoked by the sound.</p><p>8) Figure 2c. I stumbled upon this picture. Green neurons are visible in the MGNv and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, regions that do not project to BLA. How is it possible?</p><p>9) Font sizes are sometimes too small and difficult to read.</p><p>h) The design of the propranolol experiment makes the interpretation of results difficult. An alternative explanation to the one offered by the authors is that propranolol impairs habituation and the concomitant decrease in MGN axons activity.</p><p>i) Typo in the main text: figure S10D-I is cited instead of S6D-I.</p><p>j) Methods indicate that &quot;all the data were screened for outliers&quot;. What happened if outliers were found?</p><p>k) Given that the main findings are about similarities, rather than differences, between innate and learnt threat, maybe the title could be modified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The viral infection in the BLA at least from Figure 1C seems to have some spread to the surrounding regions, especially the central amygdala.</p><p>Since the central amygdala is known to play a predominant role in the generation of freezing responses, it would be important to exclude that viral leakage to this region is the basis of the effects on freezing described in Figure 1D-H. A detailed representation of the spread of each infection is needed. Lesions and Caspase3 experiments also show a similar spread to the CEA</p><p>2. The authors should provide a much more detailed description of fiber photometry analysis. For example, they should specify in which time interval the AUC was calculated.</p><p>3. A more detailed analysis of fiber photometry signals may add important information. The AUC is certainly a good starting point and tells us there is a statistically significant activation. From the plots it looks like the responses ramp up quite slowly. I wonder if this is not related to the defensive responses induced by looming rather than by the looming itself. To disentangle this, it would be important to align traces to freezing bouts inside and outside looming stimuli.</p><p>4. A more detailed analysis of the timing of photometry responses in Figure 3 and Figure 5 would add a lot to the manuscript.</p><p>5. In Figure 5 A-G the authors nicely show that lesions of the MGN abolish looming stimulus-mediated responses observed in the BLA. This result in itself is clear and very convincing. However, I have some doubts about the control group. The control group shows activity in the BLA in response to looming stimuli. From both the average traces in 5C and the heat maps in 5E, it looks like the delay between the start of the looming stimulus and the activity increase is about 250 ms, while in Figure 3F-H the delay is clearly longer (500 ms). If the MGN is upstream of the BLA, how is it possible that it has a longer delay?</p><p>6. Similarly, in Figure 5J the delays of the responses for the control group are puzzling in many aspects. First, in the recall group, again the delay of BLA neurons is much shorter than the one described for MGN neurons, which should be their inputs according to the author's hypothesis. Second, the delay of responses changes a lot between recall and the first and last CS groups. This deserves a detailed analysis and elaboration on what are the possible mechanisms at the basis of this in the discussion. Third, while in the MGN CS responses during conditioning and extinction are comparable, in the BLA neurons display CS responses during extinction that are much lower than the ones during conditioning. This is a marked discrepancy between MNG and BLA activity that suggests that other BLA inputs contribute to the active inhibition of BLA neurons during extinction. This may indeed be somehow related to adrenergic inputs which also show functional differences in Figure 6. This should be elaborated on in the discussion.</p><p>7. It is nice to see that the results are very much in line with what was recently reported by Kang and colleagues in 2022 who showed that SPFp (a part of the MGN) responds to unconditioned cues including looming stimuli. Similarly, Taylor et al. 2021 showed that MGB neurons projecting to the BLA respond to tones and are modulated by fear conditioning. Nevertheless, these two studies impinge on the novelty of the findings here. Can the authors help the reviewers clarify what are the important novel findings of this study?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85459.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We collectively agree that the authors' report of a role for projections from the lateral thalamus to the basolateral amygdala in innate defensive responses to visual stimuli could be an important contribution to neurosciences.

With your revision, please include a point-by-point response to each reviewer comment.</p><p>1) All three Reviewers and the Reviewing Editor agree that proper histological characterization of the lateral thalamic-amygdalar pathway studied by the authors is required. This is critical given that although the authors solely refer to MGN there appears to be labeling in regions like PIL/SPFp and SG which are known to project to BLA and whose contributions to auditory fear conditioning are well established. Please attend to the authors specific suggestions. It would also help to have schematics of viral expression and placement maps showing spread and placements for all subjects for each experiment.</p><p>2) The Reviewers raise several methodological concerns that the authors should carefully consider. Note that addressing some of these may require additional experiments (e.g., circuit manipulations during memory retrieval).</p><p>3) In general, the Reviewers feel that the authors should discuss the interpretation of their data in further detail.</p><p>4) Please ensure your manuscript complies with the eLife policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report summary statistics (e.g., t, F values) and degrees of freedom, exact p-values, and 95% confidence intervals wherever possible. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.</p><p>5) Please include a key resource table.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The paper would be strengthened by showing that optogenetic inhibition of the MGM-BLA pathway precisely during auditory tone or looming stimulus presentation decreases freezing. It is odd that the authors used disconnections and lesions instead of projection optogenetic inhibition, which would provide the authors with much-needed temporal resolution in their manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous email to the editors, we mentioned work by Kang et al., 2022 (See Figure 5 and Figure 6 in Kang et al), which address this in a slightly different form. In the new revision, we refer to this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear if the MGM pathway is necessary only for timed stimulus-evoked freezing or whether this circuit generally alters the defensive state. Measuring the loss of function effects on open-field anxiety behavior would be informative in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the effects of inhibition of the LT-BLA pathway in mice injected contralaterally with hM4Di and CNO on locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors. These data are now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Not all figures contain photos of representative histology. Please add histology to all figures that are missing it. Please show that MGM virus expression did not spread into the visual lateral geniculate nucleus</p></disp-quote><p>In the corresponding supplementary figures, we show the maps of viral expression and optic fiber location for all the mice. In addition, we included a representative image to show that injection in the LT (MGN) does not spread into the LGN (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). As seen, there is no detectable cell body in the LGN. We observe axonal labeling in the auditory cortex and in the Zona Incerta, regions receiving projections from the LT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors show that the defensive response induced by the looming stimulus rapidly habituates, as shown by other groups. The authors should discuss why this phenomenon occurs, as it is highly unusual. Mice do not rapidly habituate to any other innate fear or anxiety-inducing stimuli, such as predators or open spaces.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new revision, we discuss this phenomenon: (A recent study has shown that upon repeated exposure … Further studies are necessary to test this possibility.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Additional specific comments to the authors:</p><p>a) Given that the regions (and a significant proportion of individual neurons) that project to the BLA also project to the neocortex, and in turn neocortex projects strongly to the amygdala as well, based on the presented data it is possible to interpret that the observed role of the MGN-BLA in threat processing is not merely direct as concluded in the study but could also be indirect through the cortex. The function of these two pathways to BLA is a major topic in the field, and the study would thus benefit from a discussion about this alternative interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a new experiment showing that inactivation of the cortical region does not interfere with animals’ ability to produce defensive responses to looming stimulus (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) A main claim of the authors is that mice with disrupted MGN-BLA fail to switch from exploration to freezing. May the authors quantify this directly to support this claim?: for example, rearing before vs. after stimulus onset. On similar lines, is it possible that instead of decreasing freezing, disrupting the pathway is increasing escape responses? It does not seem to be the case by looking at the supplementary figures, but making this explicit in the text would help.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the differential score for rearing events before and after the looming stimulus presentation. These data are now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, and Figure 4—figure supplement 2H. Information about how the differential score was calculated is now included in the method section.</p><p>Mice with compromised LT-BLA pathway do not show freezing or escape behavior: (More specifically, upon exposure to an innate visual threat, animals with a compromised LT-BLA pathway fail to switch from exploratory to defensive behaviors, displaying neither freezing nor escape reaction)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The freezing behaviour and pathway activity mostly go hand-in-hand, but it would be relevant to discuss: 1) at the end of the conditioning phase freezing is increased but not the CS evoked response in MGN axons. 2) the MGN-BLA activity decays with habituation and extinction, but these are different cognitive processes. What is the interpretation in both cases?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscripts we have discussed both points: (This significant change between the last trial …which through local inhibitory circuits is uncoupled from somatic activity.); (Although reduced defensive response to an innately aversive…Further investigations in this line may have fundamental and translational value.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The white looming stimulus is a good control. Have the authors considered using a nonaversive black stimulus?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested a non-aversive black stimulus. We agree with the reviewer that the use of a non-aversive black stimulus, such as an expanding black stimulus illuminated from bottom, is a valuable control. We will consider this in our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Authors state that the time locking of the calcium signals to stimuli is evident, but it would be good to support it with a quantification. Why does the BLA signal have a shorter delay than the MGN axons signal? This is not expected.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the time-to-peak of GCaMP signals in response to looming and CS stimuli. The quantification is included in the legends for figures 3 and 5.</p><p>The difference in the delay can be attributed to the type of calcium indicators we used in the two different regions. GCaMP8s, which was used in the LT (MGN) projections, is suited to detect smaller signals produced by axonal activity, has a higher S/N but a slower rise time whereas GCaMP8m used in the BLA neurons has a faster rise time (Zhang et al., 2023).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Some methodological issues are not clarified and generate confusion:</p><p>1) When is freezing or rearing measured with respect to stimuli presentation (looming, sounds, foot-shocks)?</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the relevant Y-axis to indicate in which period the freezing was measured. We measured rearing only during the looming sessions (please see methods). In the method section, under the heading Behavioral procedures we define the period used to measure freezing and rearing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are we looking at averages of trials in the data or individual trials?</p></disp-quote><p>In the updated methods section, we clarify whether the data represent individual or averaged trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How is habituation to looming stimuli defined? Is there habituation in the first session already?</p></disp-quote><p>Habituation was defined as a reduction in all measured defensive responses after repeated exposure to the stimulus. We observed habituation occurs within the first session (data not shown), but the phenomenon was more pronounced in the second session (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why is memory recall sometimes 2h and others 24 hs after conditioning throughout the work?</p></disp-quote><p>We used a 2-hr versus a 24-hr recall to assess the effect of our manipulations on short-term and long-term memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the selective lesion experiments, where were GFP+ neurons counted in the anterior-posterior axis, and how were the areas defined?</p></disp-quote><p>This is now clarified in the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How were AUC and z-score quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>This is now clarified in the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) On similar lines the clarity of the figures should be improved:</p><p>1) Define unit in rearings plots. Is it a number of rearings?</p></disp-quote><p>The reported counts are the number of rearing events. We changed the y-axis in the relevant figures to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For fiber-photometry recordings and ethograms, please indicate the duration of stimuli in the plot (looming, sounds, foot-shocks), and label it on the plot. It would also help to use the same time scale across similar plots, e.g. in 3H-J and 5E-G.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the duration of the CS and US epochs in the main figures. Also, the onset and offset time of the looming stimulus is shown in the ethograms. We used different scales for GcaMP7s and GcaMP8m reflecting their different kinetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1a: can you show the placement of the recording electrode?</p></disp-quote><p>A representative image of the recording site is now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1b: is it possible that the two first traces without and with CNO are identical? The term &quot;baseline&quot; is confusing here; maybe you could say &quot;before CNO&quot;. State the meaning of fEPSP.</p></disp-quote><p>Although they appear identical, the first two traces in figure 1b represent before and after CNO application. The light-evoked response during the whole recording period was stable. For clarity, we now overlay the standard error of the mean as a shaded area on the traces (figures 1B and 4D).</p><p>fEPSP is now defined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1c. What is presented in the picture exactly? the mCherry expression looks way outside the BLA. Is it maybe not the best representative image?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we replaced this with another image. In the majority of the cases, we observed either a lateral (cortical) or a medial (striatal) spread of the virus (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). An experimenter who was blind to the treatments (hM4di-CNO, mCherry-CNO, and hM4di-Vehicle) and to the behavioral results evaluated the histological samples. Accordingly, mice lacking expression in the BLA or showing major leakage outside the BLA were excluded regardless of the behavioral outcome. We must note that it is technically challenging to obtain AAV expression that is confined within a deep brain region such as the BLA. Our results from the disconnection experiment, in which only one BLA and the contralateral LT were silenced with hM4di confirm that the LT-BLA pathway is necessary for innate and learned threat processing. In this experiment, the spared (unsilenced) BLA and contralateral LT serve as a control for off-target silencing of neighboring regions that occurred in silencing the BLA experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1E legend mistake: &quot;rearing is reduced&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this is now corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For figure 1h and all other equivalent quantifications in the manuscript, what are baseline freezing levels (before sound presentation) in memory recall? It is important to show that freezing is evoked by the sound.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of the pre-CS freezing is now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2I, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and Figure 4—figure supplement 2J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 2c. I stumbled upon this picture. Green neurons are visible in the MGNv and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, regions that do not project to BLA. How is it possible?</p></disp-quote><p>It is probably due to some leakage while retracting the pipette after the virus injections. However, the labeling observed is highly sparse (1 to 2 cells). This is unlikely to confound the interpretation of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Font sizes are sometimes too small and difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We increased the font size in the relevant parts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) The design of the propranolol experiment makes the interpretation of results difficult. An alternative explanation to the one offered by the authors is that propranolol impairs habituation and the concomitant decrease in MGN axons activity.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we discuss these scenarios: (Additionally, while mice injected with propranolol…These studies may provide mechanistic insight into the habituation that we have observed here.); (This indicates that the looming stimulus conveyed through the thalamic input…blocking the LT projection response to the looming stimulus.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) Typo in the main text: figure S10D-I is cited instead of S6D-I.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this is now corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>j) Methods indicate that &quot;all the data were screened for outliers&quot;. What happened if outliers were found?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not find any outliers in our data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>k) Given that the main findings are about similarities, rather than differences, between innate and learnt threat, maybe the title could be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>The title has been changed to “Subcortico-amygdala pathway processes innate and learned threats”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The viral infection in the BLA at least from Figure 1C seems to have some spread to the surrounding regions, especially the central amygdala.</p><p>Since the central amygdala is known to play a predominant role in the generation of freezing responses, it would be important to exclude that viral leakage to this region is the basis of the effects on freezing described in Figure 1D-H. A detailed representation of the spread of each infection is needed. Lesions and Caspase3 experiments also show a similar spread to the CEA</p><p>2. The authors should provide a much more detailed description of fiber photometry analysis. For example, they should specify in which time interval the AUC was calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have provided a detailed description of fiber photometry analysis in the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A more detailed analysis of fiber photometry signals may add important information. The AUC is certainly a good starting point and tells us there is a statistically significant activation. From the plots it looks like the responses ramp up quite slowly. I wonder if this is not related to the defensive responses induced by looming rather than by the looming itself. To disentangle this, it would be important to align traces to freezing bouts inside and outside looming stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>We have aligned the traces to freezing periods during the looming stimulus and the CS presentation in the recall session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In many instances, freezing outlasted the looming stimulus. Mice did not initiate freezing behavior outside the stimulus periods.</p><p>Author response mage 1 shows freezing events aligned to the looming presentation (left) and to the first CS in the recall session (right) in mice expressing GCaMP8m in the BLA (Figure IA) or GCaMP7s in the LT (MGN) axons (figure IB). As shown, there is no detectable correlation between BLA and the LT activity and freezing onsets.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85459-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A more detailed analysis of the timing of photometry responses in Figure 3 and Figure 5 would add a lot to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the legends for figures 3 and 5, we now add the values for time-to-peak of GCaMP signals in response to different stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 5 A-G the authors nicely show that lesions of the MGN abolish looming stimulus-mediated responses observed in the BLA. This result in itself is clear and very convincing. However, I have some doubts about the control group. The control group shows activity in the BLA in response to looming stimuli. From both the average traces in 5C and the heat maps in 5E, it looks like the delay between the start of the looming stimulus and the activity increase is about 250 ms, while in Figure 3F-H the delay is clearly longer (500 ms). If the MGN is upstream of the BLA, how is it possible that it has a longer delay?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in the delay can be attributed to the type of calcium indicators we used in the two different regions. GCaMP8s, which was used in the LT (MGN) projections, is suited to detect smaller signals produced by axonal activity. This indicator has a higher S/N but a slower rise time. GCaMP8m used in the BLA neurons, on the other hand, has a faster rise time (Zhang et al., 2023).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Similarly, in Figure 5J the delays of the responses for the control group are puzzling in many aspects. First, in the recall group, again the delay of BLA neurons is much shorter than the one described for MGN neurons, which should be their inputs according to the author's hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the delay of responses changes a lot between recall and the first and last CS groups. This deserves a detailed analysis and elaboration on what are the possible mechanisms at the basis of this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-analyzed our data, for example, by using the pre-CS1 period as the baseline for all the CSs, but results remain the same (data not shown). In the section Discussion, we offer some possible explanations for this phenomenon: (This significant change between the last trial of the conditioning…which through local inhibitory circuits is uncoupled from somatic activity.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, while in the MGN CS responses during conditioning and extinction are comparable, in the BLA neurons display CS responses during extinction that are much lower than the ones during conditioning. This is a marked discrepancy between MNG and BLA activity that suggests that other BLA inputs contribute to the active inhibition of BLA neurons during extinction. This may indeed be somehow related to adrenergic inputs which also show functional differences in Figure 6. This should be elaborated on in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed this in the revised manuscript: (The BLA also differed from the incoming LT projections in its response… by which the original fear memory is erased and the extinguished CS becomes habituated (An et al., 2017)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It is nice to see that the results are very much in line with what was recently reported by Kang and colleagues in 2022 who showed that SPFp (a part of the MGN) responds to unconditioned cues including looming stimuli. Similarly, Taylor et al. 2021 showed that MGB neurons projecting to the BLA respond to tones and are modulated by fear conditioning. Nevertheless, these two studies impinge on the novelty of the findings here. Can the authors help the reviewers clarify what are the important novel findings of this study?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we put in perspective our findings to those from the labs of Dr. Mátyás, Dr. Han, and Dr. Gründemann: (Recents works on associative learned threats…This provides new avenues for further investigation.)</p></body></sub-article></article>
