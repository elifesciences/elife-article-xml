Cdc45–MCM–GINS (CMG) complex, at the replication origins. The initiation factor Sld3 is a central regulator of Cdc45 and GINS recruitment, working with Sld7 together. However, the mechanism through which Sld3 regulates CMG complex formation remains unclear. Here, we present the structure of the Sld3 Cdc45-binding domain in complex with Cdc45 (Sld3CBD–Cdc45), showing detailed interactions and conformational changes required for binding to each other. The mutant analysis indicated that the binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 could be broken easily. We also revealed that Sld3CBD, GINS, and MCM bind to different sites on Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD–CMG model, indicating that after recruitment of Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3 could remain in Cdc45–MCM until CMG formation. The consistency between the particle size of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 and the distance between Sld3CBDs in the Cdc45–MCM dimer indicated the binding manner of the Cdc45–Sld3–[Sld7]<sub>2</sub>–Sld3–Cdc45 off/on MCM double hexamer. A DNA-binding assay of Sld3 and its complexes with single-stranded ARS1 (autonomously replicating sequence 1) fragments revealed a relationship between the dissociation of Sld7–Sld3 from CMG and the unwound single-stranded DNA. These findings help to further our understanding of the molecular basis of the regulation of CMG complex formation by Sld3.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication initiation</kwd><kwd>initiation factor Sld3</kwd><kwd>recruiting Cdc45</kwd><kwd>eukaryotes</kwd><kwd>budding yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>K. marxianus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKENHI Grant-in-aid for Scientific Research(B)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H01754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, Platform Project for Supporting Drug Discovery and Life Science Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18am0101071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, Platform Project for Supporting Drug Discovery and Life Science Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19am0101083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crystal structure of Sld3CBD-Cdc45 shows its intermolecular interactions, and subsequent Sld3CBD-CMG model construction and binding assays enable a proposal for the mechanism of Cdc45 recruitment and Sld3 release.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication in the cell cycle, a tightly regulated process that ensures precise gene copying, begins with the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), including the formation of an active helicase CMG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka and Araki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa and Diffley, 2022</xref>). In the G1 phase of the yeast cell cycle, two inactive helicase Mcm2–7 hexamer rings (Mcm2–6–4–7–3–5) are loaded onto autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) of dsDNA to form a double hexamer (MCM DH) at the replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>). To facilitate this loading, Cdt1 binds to the Mcm2–7 hexamer ring and stabilizes a gap formation between the Mcm2 and Mcm5, which serves as a dsDNA entry gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Samel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bochman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frigola et al., 2017</xref>). Next, the MCM DH on dsDNA is phosphorylated by Dbf4-dependent protein kinase (DDK, also known as Cdc7 kinase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), allowing the key factor Sld3 and its partner Sld7 to recruit Cdc45 (Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45) to each MCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamimura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakajima and Masukata, 2002</xref>). Subsequently, the phosphorylation of Sld3 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) regulates GINS assembly onto MCM DH with Dpb11, CDK-phosphorylated Sld2, and DNA polymerase ε to form CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhingra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masumoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, the factors Sld2, Sld3, Sld7, and Dpb11 are released by elusive mechanisms from an active CMG, and bidirectional replication by translocating along the 3′ to 5′ direction of the DNA strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) is facilitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szambowska et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As a central regulator of CMG formation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Sld3 functions as a bridge protein in the Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 complex to recruit Cdc45 to DDK-phosphorylated MCM DH. This Sld3 contains three domains, each of which binds mainly to one of Sld7, Cdc45, and MCM. The N-terminal domain of Sld3 (Sld3NTD: M1–L116) binds to the N-terminal domain (M1–D130) of Sld7 (Sld7NTD) (Sld7 C-terminal domain [Sld7CTD: K168–S257] is a self-dimerization domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itou et al., 2015</xref>). Following the NTD of Sld3, the middle part is a central portion, the Cdc45-binding domain (Sld3CBD: S148–K430) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamimura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itou et al., 2014</xref>). A previous study also demonstrated that a region (L510–R530) in the Sld3 C-terminal domain (Sld3CTD: T445–T679) binds to Mcm4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>). CDK-dependent phosphorylation of two residues (T600 and S622) downstream of Sld3CTD initiates the binding of GINS-carrying Dpb11 to Cdc45–MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>). In addition to its role as a bridge in the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS, Sld3 binds to two single-stranded DNA fragments of ARS1 (ssARS) identified as the origin of DNA replication (ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5), but not to the corresponding double-stranded ARS1 (dsARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruck and Kaplan, 2011</xref>). This specific Sld3–ssDNA association is not affected by CDK phosphorylation.

Cdc45 belongs to the DHH superfamily of proteins defined by the conserved triad motif DHH (Asp-His-His), and contains a DHH-associated domain (DHHA1: R523–L650) at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simon et al., 2016</xref>). Recent single-molecule biochemical assays have reported the stepwise recruitment of multiple Cdc45s to the MCM DH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Jesús-Kim et al., 2021</xref>). However, how Sld3–Sld7 recruits Cdc45 onto the MCM for CMG formation to regulate the initiation of DNA replication remains unclear.</p><p>The present study aimed to understand how Sld3 recruits Cdc45 to the MCM DH with Sld7 for CMG formation through structure and particle analyses. We determined the structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sld3CBD–Cdc45 at 2.6 Å resolution and presented the detailed interactions between Sld3 and Cdc45, confirmed through in vitro and in vivo mutant analyses. Compared to the monomer structures, the conformation of Sld3CBD and Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex changed significantly for binding to each other. Based on the structural similarity of Cdc45 in Sld3CBD–Cdc45 and CMG, we modelled Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA (Sld3CBD–CMG–dsDNA) as a snapshot of how helicase CMG forms. The models demonstrated that Sld3CBD, MCM, and GINS bind to different sites on Cdc45, indicating that Sld7–Sld3 could remain at the Cdc45–MCM until CMG formation after GINS loading. Consistency between the particle size of Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 (Sld3ΔC: M1–K430; truncated the C-terminal domain) as per spectroscopic analysis, and the distance of Sld3CBDs in the Cdc45–MCM dimer suggested that the ternary complex of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 forms a dimer off/on the MCM DH for recruiting Cdc45. Furthermore, ssDNA-binding analysis of ARS1 fragments suggested that the release of Sld3–Sld7 could be associated with ssARS1, unwound by CMG. Our findings illustrate the recruit–release function of Sld3 in CMG formation, expanding our knowledge of the initiation process of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The overall structure of Sld3CBD and Cdc45 complex</title><p>We obtained a recombinant Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and determined its crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution using molecular replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).

Interestingly, a disordered part in monomeric Sld3CBD was visualized as a C-terminal part of long bent helix α8 (F294–R316; hereafter referred to as α8CTP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Cdc45 (M1–L650) is an α/β structure composed of three β-sheets (anti-parallel: β1-β6-β5-β4-β2-β3, anti-parallel: β7-β8, mixed: β9-β10-β11-β13-β12) surrounded by 21 α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Owing to the poor electron density map, the regions D106–K110, D166–K227, S306–V310, and T438–D460 on the molecular surface could not be built. In contrast to the monomeric human Cdc45 (huCdc45) and the CMG form (Cdc45 in the yeast CMG complex), the N-terminal part of the protruding long helix α7 D219–H231 was disordered in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex.

Two helices (α8 and α9) of Sld3CBD formed a plier structure and gripped the C-terminal domain DHHA1 (R523–L650) of Cdc45 through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The C-terminal loop (L646–L650) and the C-terminal part of α7 (E232–S242) of Cdc45 sandwiched the helix α8CTP of Sld3CBD.

When Sld3 is alone, it is disordered but folds into a visualizable helix coupled to the binding partner Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Previous studies reported that this α8CTP is essential for binding to Cdc45, as its deletion inhibited cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itou et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, proline substitution for Cdc45 Ser242 (strain Cdc45-35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamimura et al., 2001</xref>), which interacts with L307 and T310 in Sld3CBD α8CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), conferred temperature-sensitive growth to yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although an increase in the number of copies of Sld3–Sld7 could weakly suppress cell growth defects, it did not recover the disrupted interaction.</p><p>The α9 (L337–E360) of Sld3CBD is the secondary Cdc45-binding region, which is located at a shallow dent formed by the C-terminal helix and a loop with the following β-strand (K520–Q531) of Cdc45 DHHA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D and E</xref>). Three hydrophobic residues (I352, I355, and L356) in Sld3CBD α9 interact with the C-terminal sheet (L522, L527, and V529) and helix (L641 and L647) of Cdc45 DHHA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while the side chains of two negatively charged residues (D344 and D348) form hydrogen bonds through a water molecule to the main and side chains of R523 on a loop of Cdc45 DHHA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A disordered region, L527–V529, of Cdc45 DHHA1 in the isolated form forms a β-sheet in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex and binds to I352 and I355 of Sld3CBD α9. We substituted single, double, or triple positively charged or hydrophilic residues at D344, D348, I352, I355, and L356 of Sld3CBD α9 (D344R/D348R: Sld3-2R, I352Y: Sld3-Y, I352S/I355S/L356S: Sld3-3S, I352E/I355E/L356E: Sld3-3E). Based on the CD spectra, we confirmed that these mutants retained the structural elements of Sld3CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Double and triple mutants Sld3-2R, Sld3-3S, and Sld3-3E eliminated Cdc45-binding affinity, whereas the single mutant Sld3-Y seemed to retain a faint interaction with Cdc45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also substituted the single, double, or triple residues R523, L522, L527, V529, L637, and L641 of Cdc45 on Sld3CBD α9 binding sites (L637S/L641S: Cdc45-IIS, L637E/L641E: Cdc45-IIE, L522S/L527S/V529S: Cdc45-IIIS, L522E/L527E/V529E: Cdc45-IIIE, and Cdc45-A: R523A). All Cdc45 mutants disrupted the binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45, except for Cdc45-A, as surmised from the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although mutant Cdc45-A eliminated three hydrogen bonds with D344 of Sld3CBD, the remaining hydrogen-bond network maintains contact between Sld3CBD and Cdc45. Furthermore, in vivo genetic studies confirmed the importance of these Sld3 residues. Expression of Sld3-3S, Sld3-3E, and Sld3-2R in Sld3 caused no growth, while the Sld3-Y strain maintained cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the cooperative action of these residues is essential for Cdc45 binding, and loss of Sld3’s Cdc45-binding affinity inhibits Cdc45 recruitment and subsequent formation of active replicative helicase CMG for DNA replication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutation analysis of interacting residues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro binding analysis was checked using SDS-PAGE after Ni-affinity chromatography extraction of co-overexpressed Cdc45 with each Sld3 mutant.

The approximate molecular weight of Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 was estimated to be &gt;400 kDa according to a weight calibration of size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Given that the molecular weight calculated from its amino acid sequences was 158 kDa, the purified complex should be a dimer. Considering the Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 dimer should be a long, rod-shaped molecule, the estimated value from SEC could be larger than the theoretical values. Subsequently, using dynamic light scattering (DLS), the particle size (hydrodynamic diameter) of the tripartite complex was estimated to be around 232 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with the distance of Sld3CBDs in the model of Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM dimer. To further validate the SEC and DLS results, we performed size-exclusion chromatography coupled with small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS), which suggested a molecular weight of 370–420 kDa, and an Rg &gt;85 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Considering that the domains of Sld7 (NTD: Sld3NTD-binding, CTD: self-dimerization) and Sld3 (NTD: Sld7NTD-binding, CBD: Cdc45-binding, CTD: MCM-binding) function independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itou et al., 2014</xref>), we estimated a dimer model of Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.

The DONSON dimer is loaded at the GINS site on MCM, which is the opposite of Sld3CBD in the SCMG-dsDNA model. Interestingly, in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA models, we found that a part (S358-D383) of Sld3CBD, containing the C-terminal of α9, a disordered fragment, and α10, was in contact distance with Mcm2CTD. In addition, the Sld3CBD-bound Cdc45 DHHA1 appeared to be close to Mcm2CTD. In contrast, the Cdc45 DHHA1 does not contact Mcm2–7 or GINS in the CMG structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Also, Sld7–Sld3ΔC showed the ssDNA-binding affinity similar to that of Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45, implying that the ssDNA-binding of Sld7–Sld3ΔC is independent of Cdc45.

Owing to the lack of structural information on Sld3 complexed with Cdc45 or MCM, how Sld3 regulates the formation of activated helicase CMG with other factors remains unknown. Here, we present the structure of the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex and particle size of the Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 complex to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying CMG formation.</p><p>Sld3 exhibits high conservation across eukaryotes, whereas its functional ortholog in metazoans, Treslin (also known as TICRR), has a distinct size and sequence, except for the Cdc45-binding domain (Sld3CBD). Sequence alignment of Sld3CBD among Sld3 and Treslin revealed that all Cdc45-binding residues in α8 and α9 identified in our study were almost conserved or exhibited conserved changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). This conservation suggests that these regions provide a similar interaction manner between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 in the regulation of metazoan DNA replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that Treslin may load Cdc45 as observed in yeast Sld3 and Sld7.</p><p>By structural comparison, we found that Sld3CBD and Cdc45 changed their conformations to bind to each other. The conformational changes in Cdc45 DHHA1 upon binding to Sld3CBD also caused the contact between Cdc45 and Mcm2NTD in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA models, whereas DHHA1 interacted with neither MCM nor GINS in the CMG structure. Taking the structural information together, Sld3 seems to play a guiding role in helping Cdc45 bind to MCM at the right position. Furthermore, Sld3CBDs in each monomer of the Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM dimer were located at a distance of more than 230 Å, which is consistent with the results of a particle size analysis of the Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 complex off MCM DH in solution. Therefore, we propose that a binding manner of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 in a flexible long-shaped dimer Cdc45–Sld3–(Sld7)<sub>2</sub>–Sld3–Cdc45 off/on MCM DH is advantageous for efficiently recruiting two Cdc45 molecules to an MCM DH, consequently leading to the formation of a pair of CMG helicases.</p><p>In the SCMG–dsDNA complex model, Cdc45 bound to Sld3CBD, MCM, and GINS on different sides (with contact surfaces of 6.7, 4.8, and 5.1% of the total Cdc45 surface, respectively). Our structure of Sld3CBD-Cdc45 and models show that these bindings occur at distinct sites on Cdc45, suggesting that Sld3CBD, Cdc45, and GINS could bind to MCM together without steric clash. The competition between Sld3 and GINS for binding to Cdc45 or Cdc45-MCM (by mixing them in vitro) reported by Bruck et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruck and Kaplan, 2011</xref>) may be caused by the conformational change of Cdc45 DHHA1 or the lack of other auxiliary initiation factors, indicating that activated CMG formation requires regulation. In particular, Sld3 and GINS bind to opposite positions of Cdc45 and MCM ring (Mcm2–4–6 vs Sld3 and Mcm5–3–7 vs GINS), suggesting that the GINS-recruitment protein should cross a long distance in an MCM monomer or MCM DH to access the phosphorylation site (T600 and S622) of Sld3. Furthermore, our SCMG–dsDNA model revealed that Sld3CBD on CMG appears to contact an N-terminal helix of Mcm2CTD, while Sld3CTD may extend to bind to Mcm4NTD through interaction with the Mcm2NTD and Mcm6NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Interestingly, the mutant analysis demonstrates that disrupting a single binding site between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 suffices to dissociate Sld3CBD and Cdc45, indicating that a functionally critical binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 can be broken easily. Furthermore, our binding analysis of ssARS1 fragments to Sld3CBD, Sld3CBD–Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 and Sld7–Sld3ΔC showed the sequence specificity to ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5 fragments, not others. Considering that ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5 are on both sides of MCM DH-bound dsDNA at replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2011</xref>), the origin unwinding by CMG generates ssDNA and further sequesters the Sld7-Sld3 complex onto ssDNA to remove Sld7-Sld3 from CMG. As a bridge protein, Sld3 recruits Cdc45 to MCM, and its next phosphorylated state regulates the subsequent recruitment of GINS loading with Dpb11–Sld2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muramatsu et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the release of Sld3 and Sld7 from CMG could be associated with unwound ssARS1 and may also be related to the dissociation of Dpb11–Sld2 from CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>).

This structure provides crucial insights into the intermediate steps of CMG formation, and the particle analysis and model predictions compellingly describe the mechanism of Cdc45 loading. Building upon previously known Sld3 and Cdc45 structures, this study offers new perspectives on how Cdc45 is recruited to MCM DH through the Sld3-Sld7 complex. The most notable finding is the structural rearrangement of Sld3CBD upon Cdc45 binding, particularly the α8-helix conformation, which is essential for Cdc45 interaction and may also be relevant to its metazoan counterpart, Treslin. Additionally, the conformational shift in the DHHA1 domain of Cdc45 suggests a potential mechanism for its binding to Mcm2NTD. Furthermore, Sld3's ssDNA-binding experiments provide evidence of its novel functions in the DNA replication process in yeast, expanding our understanding of its role beyond Cdc45 recruitment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is generally well-written, with a precise structural analysis and a solid methodological section that will significantly advance future studies in the field. The predictions based on structural alignments are intriguing and provide a new direction for exploring CMG formation, potentially shaping the future of DNA replication research. This research also opens up several new opportunities to utilize structural biology to unravel the molecular details of the model presented in the paper.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the manuscript lies in the lack of detailed structural validation for the proposed Sld3-Sld7-Cdc45 model, and its CMG bound models, which could be done in the future using advanced structural biology techniques such as single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It would also be interesting to explore how Sld7 interacts with the MCM helicase, and this would help to build a detailed long-flexible model of Sld3-Sld7-Cdc45 binding to MCM DH and to show where Sld7 will lie on the structure. This will help us to understand how Sld7 functions in the complex. Also, future experiments would be needed to understand the molecular details of how Sld3 and Sld7 release from CMG is associated with ssARS1 binding.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposals based on this study provide new knowledge of the CMG formation process.

The comparisons between Sld3-CBD, Sld3CBD-Cdc45, and Sld7-Sld3CBD-Cdc45 involve complexes from different species, limiting the comparisons' value.</p><p>Although the study reveals that Sld3 binds to different residues of Cdc45 than those previously shown to bind Mcm or GINS, the data in the paper do not shed any additional light on how GINS and Sld3 binding to Cdc45 or Mcms. would affect each other. Other previous research has suggested that the binding of GINS and Sld3 to Mcm or Cdc45 may be mutually exclusive. The authors acknowledge that a structural investigation of Sld3, Sld7, Cdc45, and MCM during the stage of GINS recruitment will be a significant goal for future research.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is better to use all samples from a source; however, due to limitations in protein expression, we used Sld7-Sld3CBD-Cdc45 from a different source. The two sources used in this study belong to the same family, and the proteins Sld7, Sld3 and Cdc45 share sequence conservation with similar structures predicted by Alphafold3 (RMSD = 0.356, 1.392, and 0.891 for Ca atoms of Sld7CTD, Sld7NTD-Sld3NTD, and Sld3CBD-Cdc45). Such similarity in source and proteins allows us to do the comparison. We also mentioned that a cryo-EM study of Sld3-Sld7-Cdc45-MCM and Sld3-Sld7-CMG structures will be a significant goal for future research in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Li et al. describes the crystal structure of a complex of Sld3-Cdc45-binding domain (CBD) with Cdc45 and a model of the dimer of an Sld3-binding protein, Sld7, with two Sld3-CBD-Cdc45 for the tethering.

I am satisfied with most of their replies, however, upon second reading I have a few more suggestions which could help to improve the manuscript further and make an impact in the field. My comments are listed below.</p><p>(1) In general, the manuscript is well structured, but I feel that it requires professional English correction. In many places it was difficult to understand the sentences and I had to read it several times to understand it. Also, very long sentences should be avoided. The flow should be easy to read and understand, and that is why I feel it requires professional English correction.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the comment, we checked English carefully and shortened the very long sentences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 5, line 103, please include molecule after the word complex to make it like- &quot;Only one complex molecule exists within an asymmetric unit.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We revised this sentence (P5/L103).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 113- more than the N-terminal half of the protruding long helix α7 113 was disordered in the Sld3CBD-Cdc45 complex. This sentence is not clear. What does it mean more than the N-terminal half? Please rewrite it.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised this sentence to give the corresponding residue number “(D219–H231)” (P5/L114).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Page 5, result 2- Conformation changes in Sld3CBD and Cdc45 for binding each other, this section may require a little restructuring. Line 130-131- &quot;Therefore, the helix α8CTP seems to be an intrinsically disordered segment when Sld3 alone but 130 folds into a helix coupled to the binding partner Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD-Cdc45 complex.&quot; This statement is the crux of the structural finding and therefore, I feel it should move after the first sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.

(P5/L128-131)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In my question 4- &quot;Can authors add a supplementary figure showing the probability of disordernes...&quot;., I meant to use a disorder prediction tool like IUPred for the protein sequences and show that α8 is predicted to be a disordered upon sequence analysis. This will help to show the inherent property of α8 helix, and it could add up to the understanding that a disordered region is being structured in the complex structure.</p></disp-quote><p>The structures showed that α8CTP is stabilized by binding with Cdc45, but disordered in Sld3CBD alone, indicating that this part is flexible, like an intrinsically disordered segment. We have deposited the structure to PDB, so predictions like IUPred cannot show meaningful information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Question 9 regarding Supplementary Figure 8- Please include your statement in the figure legend - &quot;WT Sld3CBD was prepared in a complex with Cdc45, while the mutants of Sld3CBD existed alone, we calculated the elements of secondary structure from the crystal structure of Sld3CBD-Cdc45. The concentration of samples was controlled to the same level for CD measurement.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Following the comment, we optimized the figure legend of Supplementary Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Question 13- I understand that negative staining and SEC-SAXS experiments could be very tricky for such protein complexes, which have very long loops and are flexible. Did authors try a GraFix cross-linking before doing the negative staining TEM? If it is not being tried, then it might be a good idea to try it and it may help to get much cleaner particles and easier class averaging. Although I completely understand the technical challenges the authors describe and I agree with them, I still feel that one good experiment that shows this dimer model would be very helpful to strengthen the claim. I am concerned because if people start using a similar DLS experiment to calculate intermolecular distances, citing your paper, in many cases it might be a wrong interpretation. In case the negative staining still does not work, at least discuss your technical challenges in the discussion section and mention that SEC-SAXS showed a similar length of the complex and show the Guinier plot and Porod plots in the supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that DLS is one of the methods for analyzing the single particle size. Of course, the confirmation by multiple methods will give compelling evidence. Following the comment, we added SEC-SAXS data in the [Results] (P7/L194-196) (Cdc45 recruitment to MCM DH by Sld3 with partner Sld7) and Supplementary Figure 11. The Sld7-Sld3-Cdc45 forms a flexible, long shape. Each binding domain is rigid but linked by the long loops. The flexibility problems are caused by the long loop linkers, but not by binding. So, we did not try to use the cross-linking method for analysis experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Page 8, line 221- litter sequence specificity: Correct the word &quot;litter&quot; with little. Also, the word shaped is written as sharped at a few places in the manuscript. Please correct it.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for making such mistakes. We have modified these words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Page 9, line 237-238: Would it be possible to add a lane showing Sld7 binding to the ssDNA in figure 4. I recommend showing this to understand the ssDNA binding affinity of Sld7 by itself and it will also help us to compare when it is in complex with Sld3.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering that Sld7 on CMG is always a complex with Sld3, the ssDNA binding affinity should use the Sld3-Sld7 complex. Additionally, we attempted to overexpress Sld7, but could not obtain the target protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Thank you for the improved manuscript. The following sentence is unclear: &quot;Cdc45 binds tighter to long ssDNA (&gt;60 bases) with a litter sequence specificity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for making such a mistake. We modified “litter” to “little”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found it challenging to understand which species were used while reading the results section and figure legends. I recommend that the authors revise the text in both the results and figure legends to clearly indicate when proteins from different species are being compared. Additionally, it would be valuable to explicitly acknowledge this limitation in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the comment, we added a description for using different species in results (P8/L224-225) and figure legends (Supplementary Figure 14). We added more information in the Methods to explain why we used two species for preparing proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) The current title is not appropriate for the general readers. At least, DNA replication or DNA replication initiation should be added and abbreviations such as CBD should be avoided.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the comment, we added “DNA replication” into the title. Regarding “CBD”, since the full name of “Cdc45 binding domain” is too long, we continue to use Sld3CBD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As in my previous review, I asked for quantification of the EMSA assay shown in Figure 4 and Supplemental Figures 13 and 14. Since some signals of the bands are very weak, it is hard to conclude something. Given different protein concentrations used in the experiment, the authors should provide any kinds of value. For example, Sld3CBD-CDC45 shows weaker DNA binding than Sld3CBD alone (line 231). Is this true (or reproducible)? It is hard to conclude without any quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the EMSA assay four or more times with different rods of overexpression, purification and DNA synthesis, indicating that the EMSA assay is reproducible. In this revision, we changed the DNA stain and adjusted the ratio between the protein and ssDNA with increasing concentrations. The smeared bands of ssDNA with Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 or Sld7–Sld3ΔC exhibit enhanced discernibility, and the ssDNA bands are intense enough for grayscale calculations (Figure 4 in the second revised version). We used a series of t-tests to confirm a significantly ssDNA residual level between Sld3CBD–Cdc45 to Sld3CBD, Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45, and Sld7–Sld3ΔCS (t-test, ****: P&lt;0.0001). We also carefully controlled the sample amount in the EMAS assay and described it in the [Methods].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, in this EMSA assay (in Figure 4), the authors suggest that the disappearance of ssDNA bands corresponds with the binding of the protein to the DNA. However, it is also possible that the DNA is degraded. It is very important to show the band of protein-DNA complexes on the gel (a whole gel, not the parts of the gel shown in Figure). Why did the authors use this &quot;insensitive&quot; assay using SyberGreen, not radio-labelled ssDNA?</p></disp-quote><p>In this revision, we added a negative control of no ssDNA-binding by using ssARS1-3_3 for all protein samples (Sld3CBD, Sld3CBD–Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 and Sld7–Sld3ΔC), which were the same rod of expression and purification for bound to ssARS1s (ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5) (Figure 4), showing that the disappearance of ssDNA bands is caused by binding to proteins, not degradation. Moreover, this time, by changing the DNA stain and increasing the concentration of the samples, the smeared ssDNA bands exhibit enhanced discernibility in the high molecular weight regions when mixed with Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 or Sld7–Sld3ΔC, whereas no bands appeared in the NC (ssARS1-3_1). The positions of smeared ssDNA bonds correspond to those of protein in the protein-stain pages, indicating that ssARS1 were complexed with proteins. Following the comment, we show all bands on the gel in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 14. Compared to Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 or Sld7–Sld3ΔC, Sld3CBD and ssDNA bonds could not be observed because the pI value of Sld3CBD, which affects the entry of the samples into the gel.</p><p>We agree that using radio-labelled ssDNA can obtain a sensitive binding assay. However, current laboratory constraints did not allow us to use radio-labelled ssDNA. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of our target proteins, Sld3CBD, Sld3CBD–Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45, and Sld7–Sld3ΔC, we planned to perform the binding assay in a more natural state without any modifications, labelling or linkers. Additionally, we have attempted to use ITC experiments but failed in the measurements. Presumably, the conformational flexibility of Sld7-Sld3-Cdc45 and Sld7-Sld3 caused a thermodynamic anomaly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Line 215, 80b: This should be &quot;80 nucleotides(nt)&quot;.
