including 4H leukodystrophy. Disease onset occurs from infancy to early adulthood and is associated with a variable range and severity of neurological and non-neurological features. The molecular basis of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease pathogenesis is unknown. We developed a postnatal whole-body mouse model expressing pathogenic <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutations to examine the molecular mechanisms by which reduced Pol III transcription results primarily in central nervous system phenotypes. <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant mice exhibit behavioral deficits, cerebral pathology and exocrine pancreatic atrophy. Transcriptome and immunohistochemistry analyses of cerebra during disease progression show a reduction in most Pol III transcripts, induction of innate immune and integrated stress responses and cell-type-specific gene expression changes reflecting neuron and oligodendrocyte loss and microglial activation. Earlier in the disease when integrated stress and innate immune responses are minimally induced, mature tRNA sequencing revealed a global reduction in tRNA levels and an altered tRNA profile but no changes in other Pol III transcripts. Thus, changes in the size and/or composition of the tRNA pool have a causal role in disease initiation. Our findings reveal different tissue- and brain region-specific sensitivities to a defect in Pol III transcription.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA polymerase III</kwd><kwd>Polr3-related disease</kwd><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>innate immune response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS123730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moir</surname><given-names>Robyn D</given-names></name><name><surname>Willis</surname><given-names>Ian M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 NS129951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willis</surname><given-names>Ian M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A global reduction in tRNA differentially affects brain regions and tissues in a mouse model of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease leading to activation of integrated stress and innate immune responses and neurodegeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biallelic pathogenic mutations in multiple subunits of RNA polymerase (Pol) III are causally associated with a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lata et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watt et al., 2023</xref>). These <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disorders include a prevalent form of leukodystrophy with hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H leukodystrophy) as distinguishing features along with cerebellar atrophy, myopia and short stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wolf et al., 2014</xref>). Patients with <italic>Polr3</italic>-related leukodystrophy typically present in early childhood with motor deficits and developmental delay. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, is progressive and exhibits wide ranging phenotypic severity from premature death during infancy to mild forms that have been diagnosed in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watt et al., 2023</xref>). The neurologic and non-neurologic manifestations of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disorders are variably penetrant. Notably, initial findings of hypomyelination, suggesting oligodendrocyte involvement, are not universal as some patients have normal or near normal myelination but distinct MRI and neuropathological changes that suggest a largely neuronal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perrier et al., 2022</xref>). Other atypical forms of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lata et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watt et al., 2023</xref>). The bases for these different disease presentations are unclear. It is also unclear why mutations in Pol III, a ubiquitously-expressed, essential enzyme responsible for the synthesis of critical non-coding RNAs central to protein synthesis, pre-mRNA splicing, secretion and other processes, result in phenotypes primarily of the central nervous system.</p><p>Phenotypic variability in <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease is likely to reflect differences in the abundance of Pol III, its residual activity and how these changes affect the Pol III transcriptome at sensitive periods during embryonic and postnatal development. These properties are difficult to assess given the structural complexity of the 17 subunit Pol III enzyme and the fact that most patients carry compound heterozygous mutations that are likely to differentially affect enzyme function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wolf et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic modifiers of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related phenotypes are also likely given the observed phenotypic variation between unrelated patients with the same <italic>Polr3</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perrier et al., 2020</xref>). Few studies have examined the effect of pathogenic <italic>Polr3</italic> mutations on the levels of Pol III-derived transcripts in mammalian cells. Collectively, experiments with patient-derived fibroblasts and CRISPR-Cas9 engineered cell lines show that precursor tRNA levels are generally lower but only one of four mature tRNAs tested in two different studies were reduced, suggesting that high tRNA stability can compensate for defects in synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choquet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorboz et al., 2018</xref>). 7SL RNA levels were uniformly lower in agreement with a separate analysis of Pol III-derived transcripts in patient blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azmanov et al., 2016</xref>). Other Pol III-transcribed RNAs (5 S RNA) showed discordant results or, based on one report, <italic>U6</italic>, <italic>Y</italic>, <italic>Rpph1</italic>, <italic>Rmrp</italic> and <italic>7SK</italic> RNAs were unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choquet et al., 2019</xref>). The extent to which the preceding findings reflect altered RNA levels in the brain is unknown.</p><p>In previous work we showed that brain-specific expression of pathogenic <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutations (W671R/G672E) in the mouse Olig2 lineage resulted in impaired growth and developmental delay, deficits in cognitive, sensory, and fine sensorimotor function, and hypomyelination in multiple regions of the cerebrum and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>). We report here a new model of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease in which expression of a Pol III enzyme bearing the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation is broadly induced postnatally in adolescent mice. Overt pathology was noted only in the exocrine pancreas and cerebrum despite similarly efficient recombination in multiple tissues. Analysis of the Pol III transcriptome reveals a decrease in pre-tRNA and mature tRNA populations and few if any changes among other Pol III transcripts across multiple tissues. Analysis of the Pol II transcriptome reveals activation of the integrated stress response in cerebra but not in other surveyed tissues. The molecular and cellular changes that underlie cerebral neurodegeneration in <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant mice, which include induction of an innate immune response and activation of microglia, indicate different brain region-specific sensitivities to defective Pol III activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A postnatal whole-body <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant mouse</title><p>Patients with <italic>Polr3</italic>-related leukodystrophy express mutant forms of Pol III in all their cells. We sought to generate mice with a similarly broad cellular distribution of a Pol III enzyme bearing the <italic>Polr3a</italic> W671R/G672E mutation. To circumvent the embryonic lethality of the mutation, we employed a ubiquitously expressed tamoxifen-inducible CAGGCre-ER transgene to knockin the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant allele postnatally in diverse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi and McMahon, 2002</xref>). Five tamoxifen injections were administered every other day starting at postnatal day 28 (P28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Recombination frequencies determined by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy using a dual tdTomato-EGFP reporter were ~60% in liver, ∼70% in cerebrum, ∼80% in cerebellum and kidney and ~90% in heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Tamoxifen-induced knockin mice (denoted as Polr3a-tamKI mice) have significantly lower body weights than tamoxifen-injected WT controls. Body weight differences appear in both sexes at P34 and become progressively larger as Polr3a-tamKI mice lose weight while the control mice gain weight over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These differences are due in part to the smaller body size of Polr3a-tamKI mice post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting a growth defect. Notably, a growth defect was reported previously for Polr3a-Olig2KI mice (formerly Polr3a-cKI mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>), consistent with the reduced stature of many patients with Pol III-related leukodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watt et al., 2023</xref>). However, in contrast to the current model, Polr3a-Olig2KI mice gain weight, albeit more slowly than controls, from adolescence to adulthood despite their smaller size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the loss of body weight in Polr3a-tamKI mice demonstrates a more severe failure to thrive phenotype, in line with the widespread expression of the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Body weight, length, and histological characteristics of Polr3a-tamKI mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the modified Polr3a locus showing floxed WT sequences encoding exons 15–31 with adjacent sequences for termination and polyadenylation (pA) and Polr3a exon15 containing the leukodystrophy mutations.

Gross morphology was assessed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and in the CNS, myelin and neurons were examined using Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) and Nissl, respectively. LFB staining of coronal sections of the cerebrum revealed impaired myelin deposition in Polr3a-tamKI cortex, hippocampus and thalamus with qualitatively greater differences in the cortex at P90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, LFB- and Nissl-stained sagittal sections of the cerebellum showed no differences in myelin or granular layer neurons, respectively, and no difference in Purkinje cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). The absence of a myelination defect in the cerebellum was previously noted in Polr3a-Olig2KI mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>). Non-CNS tissues (&gt;20 examined) were histologically normal except for the pancreas. Polr3a-tamKI mice exhibit pronounced and severe exocrine pancreatic atrophy at P42 and P90, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This condition is characterized by insufficient production of digestive enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleeff et al., 2017</xref>) and correlates with the lower body weight of Polr3a-tamKI mice, the marked reduction in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue at P90, and the poor health of the mice at this age. In contrast to the paucity of body fat at P90, echoMRI measurements at P42 showed that body fat as a percentage of total body weight was comparable to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To assess whether the exocrine pancreatic defect might extend to the endocrine pancreas, glucose homeostasis was examined in adolescent mice. Blood glucose concentrations increased upon feeding, as expected, and were not significantly different between Polr3a-tamKI and WT mice in either the fasted or the refed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Similarly, a glucose tolerance test showed comparable responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These data suggest that endocrine pancreatic functions controlling glucose homeostasis are not significantly impaired at P42 by the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Polr3a-tamKI mice exhibit multiple behavioral changes</title><p>A behavioral spectrometer with video tracking and pattern-recognition software was used to quantify ~20 home cage-like behaviors in a longitudinal study of behavior. Testing began at P42 and was continued at weekly intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). No differences were observed in anxiety-like behavior, which was assessed using metrics that measure the natural tendency of mice to avoid open spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). However, overall locomotor activity was decreased in Polr3a-tamKI mice as indicated by the reduced track length at P42, P49, P56, and P63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Polr3a-tamKI mice also spent less time running and more time standing still at all time points compared to WT mice, consistent with a locomotor deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Risk assessment was measured by orientation behavior according to three discrete metrics that can be summed to provide an overall evaluation of this behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodkin et al., 2014</xref>). Individual orientation behaviors were significantly lower in Polr3a-tamKI mice at all time points compared to WT mice, except for Orient-shuffle at P42 where there was a trend towards lower performance in the knockin mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). The sum of these behaviors shows that Polr3a-tamKI mice spend less time assessing risk at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Exploratory behavior was investigated via three rearing motions performed when the mice are standing on their hind legs. Polr3a-tamKI mice spent less time performing these motions at most timepoints and a tendency towards diminished performance at other times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). When all three rearing metrics were combined, Polr3a-tamKI mice showed lower levels of exploration compared to WT mice at all timepoints although the data did not reach significance at P49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Grooming behavior was evaluated by measuring the time each animal spent attending to a specific region of their body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J, K</xref>). The Polr3a-tamKI mice spent less time grooming their legs and back compared to WT mice starting at P49 and progressing to P63. Head grooming was also reduced at P63. In summary, the findings reveal behavioral phenotypes in Polr3a-tamKI mice at the earliest time point in the study, two weeks after introduction of the mutation, consistent with neurobehavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodkin et al., 2014</xref>). As none of the affected behaviors were apparent in Polr3a-Olig2KI mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>), the data further demonstrate that the mutation has a more severe impact on animal behavior when its expression is induced postnatally in many cell types than when it is induced during embryonic development only in the Olig2 lineage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavioral studies of WT and Polr3a-tamKI mice.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Locomotor activity is reported as the total distance traveled (Track length) and the total time during which the mice are running (Run sum) or standing still (Still sum).

This revealed changes in the relative proportions of some tRNAs. For example, tRNA<sup>Val</sup>(AAC) and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(GTA) were proportionally less abundant than tRNA<sup>His</sup>(GTG), and seven other tRNAs, respectively. These changes coupled with the overall decrease in tRNA abundance have the potential to change the kinetics of tRNA binding to the ribosome (decoding speed) as well as the kinetic competition with near-cognate tRNAs for ribosome binding. The most severely affected decoders were tRNA<sup>Val</sup>(AAC) (to 48% of the WT level), tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(GTA) (to 50%), tRNA<sup>Sup</sup>(TCA) (to 53%), tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGA) (to 63%) and tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(CTG) (to 64%). In mouse, tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(AGA) and tRNA<sup>Val</sup>(AAC) decode 41% and 42% of their respective codons (accounting for 3<sup>rd</sup> base wobble), tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(CTG) decodes 75% of glutamine codons and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(GTA) decodes 100% of tyrosine codons. These findings suggest that the decrease in tRNA decoders is likely to negatively affect the tRNA decoding potential at the earliest stage of disease pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>All tRNA isodecoder families are reduced in Polr3a-tamKI cerebellum but few decoders are affected</title><p>An initial analysis of the Pol III transcriptome in Polr3a-tamKI cerebella at P42 revealed comparable findings to the cerebra with decreases in several precursor and mature tRNAs and no effects on other Pol III transcripts (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). QuantM-tRNA-seq indicated that total tRNA abundance was reduced in cerebella by ~23% in the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), similar to cerebra, and the expression of tRNA isodecoders was broadly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). However, a comparative DE analysis showed that fewer tRNAs (30 vs 108) and fewer tRNA decoders (11 vs 30) achieved statistical significance in Polr3a-tamKI cerebella compared to cerebra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) and the distribution of fold change values spanned a narrower range and was shifted towards smaller differences relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition, the tRNA profile was minimally altered in cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

To gain insight into this neural sensitivity, we introduced a pathogenic <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation into mice using a ubiquitously expressed tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase and examined the effects of reduced Pol III transcription in various tissues in a largely post-developmental state. The paucity of gross phenotypes identified by histopathology across many <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant tissues reflects that cell-specific requirements for a minimum threshold of Pol III transcription have mostly been met. At the molecular level, our analysis of heart, kidney, cerebella, and cerebra showed that Pol III transcription, as reported by pre-tRNA levels, was substantially reduced at P75, 6 weeks after induction of the mutation. These changes were paralleled by smaller decreases in mature tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) suggesting that tRNA half-lives are either much longer than expected in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nwagwu and Nana, 1980</xref>) and/or that tRNA turnover is decreased in the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant. Surprisingly, the levels of non-tRNA Pol III transcripts were not decreased in heart or kidney and only <italic>7SL</italic> and <italic>Rmrp</italic> RNAs were lower in cerebella at P75. In contrast, reductions among non-tRNA transcripts were widespread in cerebra at the same age although two RNAs remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Given the levels of recombination in these tissues (which were higher in cerebella, kidney, and heart than in cerebra, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), the results point to a particularly high sensitivity of cerebra to the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation and a remarkable insensitivity of many non-tRNA transcripts in cerebella, kidney and heart to the reduction in Pol III activity. This insensitivity of non-tRNA transcripts may result from tissue-specific differences in the recruitment of the mutant Pol III to its genes, differences in the stability or nuclease accessibility of the RNA in specific ribonucleoprotein complexes, the ability of some Pol III promoters to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dergai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">James Faresse et al., 2012</xref>) or other effects that remain to be defined.</p><p>The higher sensitivity of cerebra versus cerebella, heart, and kidney to the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation was apparent at both P42 and P75. In cerebella, only 13 DE genes were identified at P42 whereas in cerebra the number of DE genes was more than an order of magnitude higher and included a nascent ATF4-dependent ISR that was absent in cerebella at this age. Moreover, while the induction of ISR genes in cerebra increased at P75, there was no appreciable ISR induction in cerebella, heart, and kidney. Together, these data suggest different thresholds of sensitivity to defects in Pol III transcription in different tissues and/or cell populations. Indeed, within the cerebra, the more robust activation of microglia in the striatum versus the cortex suggests significant differences in sensitivity to the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation between these regions. Thus, different thresholds of Pol III activity may be needed to support the functions of these regions, for example the continuing maturation of cortical thickness and myelination that occurs from P28 into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammelrath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishiyama et al., 2021</xref>) versus the functions other cells such as medium spiny neurons that comprise ~95% of the neurons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tepper and Bolam, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the cerebra, the apparent insensitivity of the cerebella to the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation may reflect that neurogenesis and synapse formation is largely complete by P21, before introduction of the mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zeiss, 2021</xref>). However, it remains possible that more subtle phenotypes such as dendritic pruning, which continues in the cerebellum through 2 months of age, may be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leto et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, our developmental oligodendrocyte lineage model (Polr3a-Olig2KI mice), which showed reduced growth and neurological deficits along with hypomyelination in the cerebra and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>), also did not show cerebellar phenotypes. Together, these observations suggest that oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the cerebellum have a different threshold for minimal Pol III activity through development and maturation than in other regions of the brain.</p><p>The sensitivity of the mouse exocrine pancreas to the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation was unexpected given the absence of reports on acinar dysfunction associated with <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease but is consistent with the knowledge that a <italic>Polr3b</italic> mutation disrupts development of the exocrine pancreas and intestine in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yee et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, our finding may inform undiagnosed digestive issues in the patient population. The unique codon usage of mouse and human pancreatic acinar cells, which differs from most other cell types and is skewed by the codon composition of highly expressed secreted proteins may underlie this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, the <italic>Polr3a</italic> pancreatic phenotype may reflect unique differences in the development of rodent versus human pancreata: The increase in the size of mouse pancreas from birth to adulthood results largely from an increase (~19-fold) in the volume of acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzi et al., 2018</xref>). This hypertrophy of murine acinar cells is attributed to their higher biosynthetic rate and tetraploid genome content. In contrast, postnatal growth of human pancreas involves an increase in cell number, with acinar cells maintaining a constant volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Pol III dysfunction and the reduction in the cerebral tRNA population at P42 coincides with behavioral deficits and precedes substantial downstream alterations in the Pol II transcriptome, which include induction of an innate immune response (IR) and an ISR, and indicators of neurodegeneration (i.e. activation of cell death pathways and loss of mitochondrial DNA). These findings suggest a causal role for the lower tRNA abundance and/or altered tRNA profile in disease progression. Whether the decrease in the abundance of other Pol III transcripts in the cerebrum at later times contributes to disease progression is an open question. These changes may represent secondary effects of IR/ISR signaling or cell death stressors and may be occurring in cells that have already committed to a pathway of programmed cell death.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that decreased levels of a single cytoplasmic tRNA isoacceptor or deletion/mutation of a single nuclear-encoded tRNA gene is sufficient to alter translation and cause neuronal dysfunction: Dominant mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease CMT2D, cause sequestration of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, neuropathy, impair neuronal translation and induce the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spaulding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuko et al., 2021</xref>).

Global deletion of the <italic>n-TFgaa7</italic> (aka <italic>tRNA-Phe-1–1</italic>) isoacceptor is sufficient to cause transcription and proteomic changes, neurological deficits, increased ribosome stalling, and altered protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes et al., 2023</xref>). In the cerebra of Polr3a-tamKI mice, the induction of an ATF4-dependent ISR at P42 and its enhancement at P75 is a clear indicator that translation kinetics have been impacted by the global decrease in tRNA abundance, which extends across most decoders and changes the tRNA profile. Accordingly, the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation is predicted to compromise translation efficiency and change the frequency and sites of ribosome pausing and/or stalling. These events can trigger ISR induction via protein misfolding or unresolved ribosome collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2021</xref>).

Medicine (AECOM). Mice were housed in a barrier facility at 22 °C on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with constant access to food (PicoLab Mouse Diet 20) and water. C57BL/6J-<italic>Polr3a<sup>tm1Iwil</sup></italic> mice were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>) and were bred to B6.Cg-<italic>Tg(CAG-cre/Esr1*5Amc/J</italic>) mice (CAGGCre-ER, #004682) and to B6.129(Cg)-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo</sup>/J</italic> mice (tdTomato-EGFP, #007676). Whole-body inducible <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant mice and Cre-minus WT controls were obtained by breeding male mice heterozygous for both the floxed <italic>Polr3a</italic> allele and Cre recombinase to female mice homozygous for the floxed <italic>Polr3a</italic> allele. The breeding of mice to assess recombination used females homozygous for the tdTomato-EGFP reporter. Experimental animals (knockin mutants and WT controls) were treated with tamoxifen (6 mg/40 g body weight, five injections i.p.) every other day starting at P28. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed with male and female mice and the data were pooled for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Recombination efficiency</title><p>Single-cell suspensions of dissected cerebrum and cerebellum were prepared using an adult brain dissociation kit (Miltenyi). Flow analysis was performed on a LSRII-U flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with single color controls to establish gating prior to sample analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merheb et al., 2021</xref>). For liver, heart and kidney, fixed, sectioned tissue was mounted with ProLong diamond antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen) and imaged using a 3D Histech p250 high-capacity slide scanner.

Locomotor activity was tracked and stereotyped behaviors were measured algorithmically using Viewer Software (BiObserve) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodkin et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, locomotor classes of behavior include Run, Trot, Walk, and Still (not moving) metrics. Locomotor activity - open field-like behavior is defined by Track Length (total distance travelled in the arena). Exploratory classes of behavior include Rearing and Orientation behaviors. Rearing movements include Rear Climb (e.g. trying to climb walls), Rear Bob (moving body in an up/down vertical motion) and Rear Sniff (head movement in a nodding arc) activities. Orientation movements include Orient Shuffle (repositioning of all 4 feet and facing a different direction), Orient Creep (repositioning 1–3 steps more or less in the same direction) and Orient Sniff (moving less than a body length with no head movement) motions. Grooming behaviors are defined by Scratches (involving the hind legs) and grooming of specific body parts (Genital, Tummy, Back, Leg, Head, Face, Nose, and Paw). Anxiety-like behavior is defined by Center visits and Center duration which score the number and duration of visits to a 15 cm<sup>2</sup> central area of the arena and Center track (total distance travelled in the central area). Individual mice were placed in the instrument for a total of 9 min and recorded in 3-min intervals (3 recordings in total). Behaviors are reported after 6 min (two recordings) and 9 min (all three recordings). Approximately, equal numbers of mice of both genders (five WT females, four WT males and three KI females, two KI males) were examined at weekly intervals on postnatal days 42, 49, 56, and 63. The data for each genotype at each age were combined for analysis. Significance was calculated by multiple t tests and one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice at P63-P66 were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), brains were removed and postfixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C before storage in 25% sucrose.

We appreciate the reviewer’s finding that our “claims and conclusions are supported by the presented data.”</p><p>We note that our findings on the temporal progression of transcriptional changes between P42 and P75 apply to both the Pol II and Pol III transcriptomes. Importantly, in the case of Pol III, only precursor and mature tRNAs are affected at P42 whereas at P75, numerous other Pol III transcripts are also changed. We therefore attribute the changes in tRNA as being causal in disease initiation since this is the earliest direct consequence of the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation.</p><p>To expand on the evidence demonstrating the progressive nature of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease in our mouse model, the revised manuscript includes new immunofluorescence data showing no change in microglial cell density in the cerebral cortex or the striatum at an early stage in the disease (Supplementary Fig. S6F, G). This is in striking contrast to the findings at later times (P75) where the number of microglia increased significantly in the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant and exhibit an activated morphology (Fig. 4G,H).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it will be interesting in the future to assess the impact of the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation in different neural cell types and to explore opportunities for suppressing disease phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study &quot;Molecular basis of neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Polr3 related disease&quot; by Moir et.al. showed that how RNA Pol III mutation affects production, maturation and transport of tRNAs. Furthermore, their study suggested that RNA pol III mutation leads to behavioural deficits that are commonly observed in neurodegeneration. Although, this study used a mouse model to establish theses aspects, the study seems to lack a clear direction and mechanism as to how the altered level of tRNA affects locomotor behaviour. They should have used conditional mouse to delete the gene in specific brain area to test their hypothesis. Otherwise, this study shows a more generalized developmental effect rather than specific function of altered tRNA level. This is very evident from their bulk RNA sequencing study. This study provides some discrete information rather than a coherent story. My enthusiasm for publication of this article in eLife is dampened considering following reasons mentioned in the weakness.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2’s summary contains two misstatements:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moir et.al. showed that how RNA Pol III mutation affects production, maturation and transport of tRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our experiments document the effect of a neurodegenerative disease-causing mutation in RNA polymerase III on the Pol III transcriptome with a particular focus on the tRNAome (i.e. the mature tRNA population).

Additional comments about tRNA maturation and export are provided under points 8 and 9 (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study seems to lack a clear direction and mechanism as to how the altered level of tRNA affects locomotor behaviour.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment misstates the purpose of our study while overlooking the important results.

The novelty and importance of the findings, as stated in the abstract, include the discovery that a global reduction in tRNA levels (and not other Pol III transcripts) at an early stage in the disease precedes the frank induction of integrated stress and innate immune responses, activation of microglia and neuronal loss at later times. These later events readily account for the observed neurobehavioral deficits that collectively include risk assessment, locomotor, exploratory and grooming behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study created a mouse model to investigate role of RNA PolIII transcription.

We hope the reviewer will agree that the fourth sentence of the abstract, unchanged from the initial submission, clearly outlines the objective of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How cerebral pathology and exocrine pancreatic atrophy are related? How altered tRNA level connects these two axes?</p></disp-quote><p>It is not known how cerebral pathology and exocrine pancreatic atrophy are related beyond their shared Pol III dysfunction in our mouse model of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease. We anticipate that altered tRNA levels connect these two axes. Indeed, the pancreas and the brain are both known to be highly sensitive to perturbations affecting translation (Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020 Science doi: 10.1126/science.aat5314). Changes to the tRNA population in the cerebrum and cerebellum of <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant mice were extensively documented in the manuscript (e.g. Figs. 3, 5 and 6). We also found reduced tRNA levels in the pancreas of the mutant mice but did not report these findings due to the absence of a stable reference transcript in total RNA from the atrophied pancreatic tissue, even at the earliest time point examined (P42).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Authors mentioned that previously observed reduction mature tRNA level also recapitulated in their study. Why this study is novel then?</p></disp-quote><p>Our study reports the novel finding that a pathogenic <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation causes a global reduction in the steady state levels of mature tRNAs, i.e. the levels of all tRNA decoders were reduced with the vast majority these reaching statistical significance (Fig. 6D and 6F). In the introduction we refer to several studies that examined the effect of pathogenic <italic>Polr3</italic> mutations on the levels of Pol III-derived transcripts. We noted that these studies examined only a small number of Pol III transcripts in CRISPR-Cas9 engineered cell lines, patient-derived fibroblasts and patient blood. Thus, no study until now has tested for or reported a global defect in the abundance of mature tRNAs in any model of <italic>Polr3</italic>-related disease. Moreover, no previous study of Polr3-related disease has analyzed Pol III transcript levels in the brain or in any other tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is very intuitive that deficit in Pol III transcription would severely affect protein synthesis in all brain areas as well as other organs. Hence, growth defect observed in Polr3a mutant mice is not very specific rather a general phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the simple assumption that a “deficit in Pol III transcription likely would affect protein synthesis in all brain areas as well as other organs”, this turned out not to be the case. In fact, a novel finding of our study is that not all <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant tissues show a translation stress response despite reduced Pol III transcription and reduced mature tRNA levels. This implies that in some tissues the reduction in tRNA levels caused by the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation is not sufficient to affect protein synthesis, at least to a point where the Integrated Stress Response is induced. The underlying basis for the growth deficit has not been defined in this work. However, we noted in the discussion that a growth defect was previously seen in mice where expression of the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation was restricted to the Olig2 lineage. In the present postnatal whole-body inducible model, we anticipate that the diminished growth of the mice results from a combination of hormonal and nutritional deficits caused by cerebral and pancreatic dysfunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Authors observed specific myelination defect in cortex and hippocampus but not in cerebellum. This is an interesting observation. It is important to find the link between tRNA removal and myelin depletion in hippocampus or cortex? Why is myelination not affected in cerebellum?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the specific myelin defect observed in the cortex and hippocampus, but not the cerebellum, is an interesting observation. Pol III dysfunction in this model and reduced tRNA levels are common to both cerebra and cerebella, yet the pathological consequences differ between these regions. While we do not know why this is the case, the cells that oligodendrocytes support in these regions are functionally different. We suggest in the discussion that subtle defects in oligodendrocyte function in the cerebellum may be uncovered using more sensitive or specific assays than the ones we have employed to date. In addition, consistent with our findings in other tissues where Pol III transcription and tRNA levels are reduced but phenotypes are lacking, we suggest that oligodendrocytes in the cerebellum may have a different minimum threshold for Pol III activity than in other regions of the brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) How was the locomotor activity measured? The detailed description is missing. Also, locomotion is primarily cerebellum dependent. There is no change in term of growth rate and myelination in cerebellar neurons. I do not understand why locomotor activity was measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We used a behavioral spectrometer with video tracking and pattern-recognition software to quantify ~20 home cage-like behaviors, including locomotor activity, as part of our phenotypic characterization of the mice. This experimenter-unbiased approach reported several metrics of locomotion, specifically, total Track length (the total distance traveled in the instrument), Center Track length and the time spent running (Run Sum) and standing still (Still Sum) in a longitudinal study (Figs. 2A-C and Supplemental Fig. S3A-C). The Materials and Methods section on mouse behavior has been amended to provide a detailed description of these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>locomotion is primarily cerebellum dependent</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that the cerebellum plays a critical role in balance and locomotion, regions of the cerebrum that are affected in our mice, including the primary motor cortex and the basal ganglia (Fig. 4), also have important roles in locomotor activity and control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The correlation with behavioural changes and RNA seq data is missing. There a number of transcripts are affected and mostly very general factors for cellular metabolism. Most of them are RNA Pol II transcribed. How a Pol III mutation influences RNA Pol II driven transcription? I did not find differential expression of any specific transcripts associated with behavioural changes. What is the motivation for transcriptomics analysis? None of these transcripts are very specific for myelination. It is rather a general cellular metabolism effect that indirectly influences myelination.</p></disp-quote><p>The differentially expressed mRNAs identified in our RNAseq analysis at P75 reflect both direct and secondary consequences of dysfunctional Pol III transcription on Pol II transcription. These effects can be achieved by multiple mechanisms. Induction of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) due to insufficient tRNA can be considered a direct consequence of diminished Pol III transcription on Pol II transcription. An example of a secondary response is the activation of microglia and the innate immune response (which is known to accompany prolonged activation of the ISR), and the loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes. These changes are documented in Figs. 3 and 4. Importantly, loss of neurons, activated microglia and reduced oligodendrocyte numbers are each readily reconciled with changes in behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>None of these transcripts are very specific for myelination</p></disp-quote><p>The RNAseq data at P75 indicates only a modest reduction in oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression (as defined by single-cell RNAseq studies of purified cell populations, Mackenzie et al., 2018 Sci. Rep. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-27293-5). Despite this, some oligodendrocyte-specific transcripts with well-known roles in myelination were down-regulated in the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant (e.g. Plp1, Mog and Mobp). In addition, steroid synthesis pathway transcripts involved in the production of cholesterol, an abundant and essential component of myelin, were also downregulated (Supplementary Fig. S4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) What genes identified by transcriptomics analysis regulates maturation of tRNA? Authors should at least perform RNAi study to identify possible factor and analyze their importance in maturation of tRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>Of the many proteins involved in the maturation of tRNA (Phizicky and Hopper, 2023 RNA doi: 10.1261/rna.079620.123), RNAseq analysis at P75 identified only amino-acyl tRNA synthetases as being differentially-expressed (fold change &gt;1.5, p adj. &lt; 0.05, Table S1). These genes are canonical indicators of the ATF4-dependent Integrated Stress Response and their upregulation is widely interpreted as an attempt to restore efficient translation. In addition, our analysis of Pol III transcripts at P75 identified a reduction in the level of RppH1 (Fig. 3C), the RNA component of RNase P, which removes the 5’ leader of precursor tRNAs. However, at P42, there was no effect on RppH1 abundance, or the expression of amino-acyl tRNA synthetase genes (Fig. 5C and Table S3). Thus, an RNAi study to identify and analyze a possible factor involved in the maturation of tRNA is neither warranted nor relevant to the current body of work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) What factors are influencing tRNA transport to cytoplasm? It may be possible that Polr3a mutation affect cytoplasmic transport of tRNA. Authors should study this aspect using an imaging experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis of tRNA populations in this study employed total cellular RNA and thus reflect the abundance of mature tRNA from all cellular compartments. We have not assessed whether the reduction in tRNA abundance caused by the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation alters the dynamics of tRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. However, we consider it highly unlikely that the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutation would have a significant effect on cytoplasmic transport of tRNA. Imaging experiments along these lines are beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Does alteration of cytoplasmic level of tRNA affects translation? Author should perform translation assay using bio-orthoganal amino acid (AHA) labelling.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not known whether the reduced tRNA levels affect translation globally in the <italic>Polr3a</italic> mutant, but we predict that this may not be the case. Since tissues (heart and kidney) and brain regions (cerebrum and cerebellum) that share a decrease in tRNA abundance do not share activation of the Integrated Stress Response (a reporter of aberrant translation), we anticipate that effects on translation may be limited to specific regions or cell populations and to specific mRNAs within these cells. The current study provides the foundation for further work to address these questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Below are a few comments, mostly regarding typographical errors, presentation, and clarity, that we believe would enhance this manuscript:</p><p>On the heatmaps generated, it would be ideal to place &quot;WT&quot; before &quot;KI,&quot; with &quot;WT&quot; on the left.
