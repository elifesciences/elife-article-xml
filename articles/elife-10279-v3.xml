Not all wild type TP53 tumors are sensitive to such inhibitors. In an attempt to improve selection of patients with TP53 wild type tumors, an mRNA expression signature based on 13 TP53 transcriptional target genes was recently developed (Jeay et al. 2015). Careful reanalysis of TP53 status in the study validation data set of cancer cell lines considered to be TP53 wild type detected TP53 inactivating alterations in 23% of cell lines. The subsequent reanalysis of the remaining TP53 wild type cell lines clearly demonstrated that unfortunately the 13-gene signature cannot predict response to TP53-MDM2 inhibitor in TP53 wild type tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10279.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10279.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10279.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Damaged cells in the human body can develop into tumors if left unchecked. TP53 (also called p53) is a protein that normally helps to repair or eliminate these damaged cells and prevent tumors from forming. About half of all cancerous tumors have mutations that prevent TP53 from working. In tumors with normal TP53 (called TP53 wild type tumors), another protein that acts to keep TP53 in check is often overly active. This overactive protein (called MDM2) prevents TP53 from suppressing tumor development. Many scientists are developing anticancer drugs called TP53-MDM2 inhibitors to target the potentially overactive protein in TP53 wild type tumors, and importantly only a tumor with working TP53 would have a chance of responding to this kind of inhibitor.</p><p>Earlier in 2015, a team of researchers at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research reported the results of a screen of hundreds of cancer cell lines that investigated which ones were sensitive to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors. Using mix of TP53 mutant and TP53 wild type cancer cell lines, the Novartis team identified a set of 13 genes that were highly expressed in cell lines that were sensitive to one of these inhibitors. This 13-gene signature was then suggested as a way to identify which cancer patients with TP53 wild type tumors would be the most likely to benefit from treatment with TP53-MDM2 inhibitors.</p><p>However, now Dmitriy Sonkin has reanalyzed the validation set of TP53 wild type cancer cell lines used by the Norvartis team and found that many of them had been mistakenly identified as TP53 wild type. That is to say around a quarter of the cell lines thought to have normal TP53 actually had mutations in the gene for TP53. Sonkin then repeated the analysis using only those cell lines that were from TP53 wild type tumors. This revealed that the 13-gene signature cannot predict how cancer cells from a TP53 wild type tumor will respond to a TP53-MDM2 inhibitor. Further work would be beneficial in order to find an accurate test to determine which cancer patients will benefit the most from treatment with TP53-MDM2 inhibitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10279.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10279.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TP53</kwd><kwd>MDM2</kwd><kwd>pharmacogenomics</kwd><kwd>inhibitor sensitivity</kwd><kwd>predictive signature</kwd><kwd>translational oncology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author declares that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A previously suggested expression signature based on thirteen TP53 transcriptional target genes does not predict the response of wild type TP53 tumors to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A number of TP53-MDM2 inhibitors are currently under investigation as therapeutic agents in a variety of clinical trials across multiple tumor types. Mechanistically, only tumors with wild-type (WT) TP53 can potentially be sensitive to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors as confirmed in part by sensitivity of WT MEFs cells and by the loss of sensitivity in TP53 knockout MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Efeyan et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, clinical trials of TP53-MDM2 inhibitors only include patients with WT TP53 tumors. Based on pre-clinical work, it is clear that not all WT TP53 tumors are sensitive to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors. Multiple attempts have been made to try to predict sensitivity to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors in WT TP53 tumors. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, there is currently no clinically validated and FDA-approved assay to identify WT TP53 tumors most likely to respond to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors.</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jeay et al., (2015)</xref> attempted to find a messenger RNA (mRNA) predictive expression signature to selective TP53-MDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 using a panel of cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>) with corresponding genetic and genomic datasets. As a result of this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jeay et al., (2015)</xref> described the mRNA signature based on 13 TP53 transcriptional target genes. The signature was generated using TP53-MDM2 inhibitor sensitive versus insensitive cell lines without regard to the TP53 status. As a critical part of the validation work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jeay et al., (2015)</xref> used an independent set of 52 cancer cell lines that were considered to be TP53 WT. Since the signature was generated without considering TP53 status and the fact that TP53-MDM2 inhibitors can only be effective in WT TP53 tumors, the signature is likely to represent a proxy for TP53 status. Therefore, it would not be expected to enhance the ability to predict sensitivity to TP53-MDM2 inhibitors in TP53 WT tumors, so the reported predictive ability of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jeay et al., (2015)</xref> signature in the set of 52 cancer cell lines considered by authors as TP53 WT is surprising.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>One potential explanation for the reported predictive ability of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jeay et al., (2015)</xref> signature in a validation set of 52 cancer cell lines that were considered TP53 WT is the possibility that some of these cell lines have TP53 inactivating alterations that were missed during cell lines selection. TP53 could be inactivated by a variety of mechanisms including inactivating mutations, DNA loss and loss of mRNA expression. The CCLE provides sequencing, copy number and mRNA expression data, enabling careful examination of TP53 status in the set of 52 cancer cell lines used for validation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jeay et al., (2015)</xref>.

The presented reanalysis of signature performance in this article strongly suggests that 13-gene signature is a proxy for TP53 status. In such case, one can put forward the hypothesis that HCC-95 may harbor an inactivating alteration(s) that has been missed.

Often the additional step of manual review of sequencing analysis results is added to the workflow to detect false positive/negative calls due to particular sequence composition or computational pipeline artifacts. In preclinical sequencing, such detailed workflow is often too expensive to obtain. In the CCLE, RainDance technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Mazutis et al., 2009</xref>) was used to fill some blind spots in the hybrid capture process, but such a process does not necessarily mitigate all problematic regions.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Expression signature based on TP53 target genes doesn't predict response to TP53-MDM2 inhibitor in wild type TP53 tumors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The current report by Sonkin challenges the conclusions of a recent paper by Jeay et al. reporting the discovery of a gene signature that could potentially predict the efficacy of small molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction in the treatment of tumors expressing wild-type p53. Upon reanalysis of the p53 mutational status of the cell lines employed, Sonkin determined that Jeay et al. had not assessed the mutational status of p53 correctly for a number of cell lines. When the analysis is repeated with the annotation by Sonkin, the gene signature no longer predicts drug efficacy, simply discriminating between wild-type and mutant cell lines. In this regard, the report by Sonkin is important, as it challenges some of the main conclusions in the report by Jeay et al. about the utility of the gene signature.</p><p>Having said that, it is surprising and unfortunate that neither the original nor the present paper has a clear description of how the variants were called. The original paper says, in the Materials and methods that &quot;gene level genetic alterations […] were compiled from the Sanger center COSMIC data and internal sources including Exome Capture Sequencing of 1600 cancer related genes&quot;, but it does not say exactly what methods were used to call and/or validate variants. Likewise, the present paper simply states: &quot;Careful examination of TP53 status identified 12 out of 52 cancer cell lines containing TP53 alterations…&quot;.</p><p>It is then necessary for Sonkin to provide additional evidence for the mutations he found, just so that the reader can better understand why Jeay et al. missed them. Based on <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, these mutations have a lot of reads with alternative alleles, meaning that most algorithms should have caught them. Why did Jeay et al. miss them? Are they in hard-to-capture regions? Perhaps IGV screenshots could be provided in the supplement (along with GC content or read density map from some exomes to show hard-to-capture areas?). What exactly is the 'careful examination' performed by Sonkin? Also, is Sonkin proposing that the information in the Sanger Center and COSMIC databases about p53 mutational status of these cell lines is wrong? Is the method by Sonkin challenging the annotation in these databases and should these repositories be notified about these potential mistakes?</p><p>In brief, a more thorough discussion of the various methodologies employed for variant calling and an effort to explain why Jeay et al. and the public databases are producing different results from those obtained by Sonkin would be required to advance publication of this work, whose potential impact is very high, as it would not only challenge the paper by Jeay et al., but also public databases employed by thousands of researchers around the world.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10279.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Having said that, it is surprising and unfortunate that neither the original nor the present paper has a clear description of how the variants were called.

COSMIC database contains sequencing data for 8 out of 10 cell lines with TP53 mutations listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> of my manuscript containing cell lines with inactivated TP53 in the validation set of cell lines considered to be TP53 wild type by Jeay et al. COSMIC database contains identical TP53 mutation(s) to the ones listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for each of these 8 cell lines. Therefore TP53 mutations listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> of my manuscript are in complete agreement with corresponding entries in COSMIC. I’ve added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref> which contains COSMIC information on mutations in cell lines listed in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and also includes COSMIC sample ID for each of the 8 cell lines. COLO-818 is one of the two cell lines from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> which does not have sequencing data in COSMIC, this cell line mRNA was sequenced by (Klijn et al., 2015) and it was found to contain C135R TP53 mutation, this is exactly the same mutation as listed for COLO-818 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>References:</p><p>Klijn, C., Durinck, S., Stawiski, E.W., Haverty, P.M., Jiang, Z., Liu, H., Degenhardt, J., Mayba, O., Gnad, F., Liu, J., et al.
