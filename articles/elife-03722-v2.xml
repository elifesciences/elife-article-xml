In the periphery, a transmission bottleneck constrains performance; thus efficient coding implies that natural signal components with a predictably wider range should be compressed. In a different regime—when sampling limitations constrain performance—efficient coding implies that <italic>more</italic> resources should be allocated to informative features that are more variable. We propose that this regime is relevant for sensory cortex when it extracts complex features from limited numbers of sensory samples. To test this prediction, we use central visual processing as a model: we show that visual sensitivity for local multi-point spatial correlations, described by dozens of independently-measured parameters, can be quantitatively predicted from the structure of natural images. This suggests that efficient coding applies centrally, where it extends to higher-order sensory features and operates in a regime in which sensitivity increases with feature variability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03722.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03722.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03722.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our senses are constantly bombarded by sights and sounds, but the capacity of the brain to process all these inputs is finite. The stimuli that contain the most useful information must therefore be prioritized for processing by the brain to ensure that we build up as complete a picture as possible of the world around us. However, the strategy that the brain uses to select certain stimuli—or certain features of stimuli—for processing at the expense of others is unclear.</p><p>Hermundstad et al. have now provided new insights into this process by analyzing how humans respond to artificial stimuli that contain controllable mixtures of features that found in natural stimuli. To do this, Hermundstad et al. selected photographs of the natural world, and measured the brightness of individual pixels. After adjusting images in a way that mimics the human retina, the brightest 50% of the pixels in each photograph were colored white and the remaining 50% were colored black.</p><p>Hermundstad et al. then used statistical techniques to calculate the degree to which the color of pixels could be used to predict the color of their neighbors. In this way, it was possible to calculate the amount of variation throughout the images, and then make computer-generated images in which pixel colorings were more or less predictable than in the natural images.</p><p>Volunteers then performed a task in which they had to locate a computer-generated pattern against a background of random noise. The volunteers were able to locate this target most easily when it contained the same kinds of patterns and features that were meaningful about natural images.</p><p>While this shows that the brain is adapted to prioritize features that are more informative about the natural world, understanding exactly how the brain implements this strategy remains a challenge.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03722.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03722.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>natural scene statistics</kwd><kwd>neural coding</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>normative theories</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY07977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Victor</surname><given-names>Jonathan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1058202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balasubramanian</surname><given-names>Vijay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWF P25651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balasubramanian</surname><given-names>Vijay</given-names></name><name><surname>Tkačik</surname><given-names>Gašper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vision Training Grant 5-T32-EY007035-32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balasubramanian</surname><given-names>Vijay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Pierre Gilles de Gennes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balasubramanian</surname><given-names>Vijay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Psychophysical measures of human sensitivity to visual patterns reveal that the brain preferentially processes those features of stimuli that are more variable in the natural world.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory receptor neurons encode signals from the environment, which are then transformed by successive neural layers to support diverse and computationally complex cognitive tasks. A normative understanding of these computations begins in the periphery, where the efficient coding principle—the notion that a sensory system is tuned to the statistics of its natural inputs—has been shown to be a powerful organizing framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barlow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simoncelli, 2002</xref>). Perhaps the best-known example is that of redundancy removal via predictive coding and spatiotemporal decorrelation. In insects, this is carried out by neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laughlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Hateren, 1992b</xref>); in vertebrates, fixational eye movements—which precede the first step of neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srinivasan et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atick and Redlich, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atick et al., 1992</xref>)—play a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuang et al., 2012</xref>). This approach was later extended to describe population coding, retinal mosaic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barlow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karklin and Simoncelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borghuis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramanian and Sterling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ratliff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuang et al., 2012</xref>), adaptation of neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brenner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fairhall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001</xref>), and early auditory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith and Lewicki, 2006</xref>). Taken together, normative theories based on efficient coding have been successful in explaining aspects of processing in the sensory periphery that are tuned to simple statistical features of the natural world.</p><p>Can we extend such theories beyond the sensory periphery to describe cortical sensitivity to complex sensory features? Normative theories have been successful in predicting the response properties of single cells, including receptive fields in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell and Sejnowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Hateren and Ruderman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Hateren and van der Schaaf, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyvarinen and Hoyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karklin and Lewicki, 2009</xref>) and spectro-temporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson and DeWeese, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2012</xref>), as well as distributions of tuning curves across individual cells in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewicki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguli and Simoncelli, 2011</xref>). Some complex features, however, might not be represented by the tuning properties of individual cells in any direct way, but rather emerge from the collective behavior of many cells. Instead of trying to predict individual cell properties, we therefore focus on the sensitivity of the complete neural population. Is there an organizing principle that determines how resources within the population are allocated to representing such complex features?</p><p>When the presence of complex features is predictable (i.e., can be accurately guessed from simpler features along with priors about the environment), mechanisms are best devoted elsewhere (See Discussion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Hateren, 1992a</xref>). In contrast, sensory features that are highly variable and not predictable from simpler ones can serve to determine their causes (e.g., to distinguish among materials or objects), a first step in guiding decisions. We will show that these ideas predict a specific organizing principle for aggregate sensitivities arising in cortex: the perceptual salience of complex sensory signals increases with the variability, or unpredictability, of the corresponding signals over the ensemble of natural stimuli.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we focus on early stages of central visual processing. Here, early visual cortex (V1 and V2) is charged with extracting edges, shapes, and other complex correlations of light between multiple points in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morrone and Burr, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oppenheim and Lim, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von der Heydt et al., 1984</xref>). We compare the spatial variation of local patterns of light across natural images with human sensitivity to manipulations of the same patterns in synthetic images. This allows us to determine how sensitivity is distributed across many different features, rather than simply determining the most salient ones. (We will say that a feature is more <italic>salient</italic> if it is more easily discriminated from white noise.) To this end, we parametrize the space of local multi-point correlations in images in terms of a complete set of coordinates, and we measure the probability distribution of coordinate values sampled over a large ensemble of natural scenes. We then use a psychophysical discrimination task to measure human sensitivity to the same correlations in synthetic images, where the correlations can be isolated and manipulated in a mathematically rigorous fashion by varying the corresponding coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chubb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Victor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Victor et al., 2013</xref>). Comparing the measurements, we show that human sensitivity to these multi-point elements of visual form is tuned to their variation in the natural world. Our result supports a broad hypothesis: cortex invests preferentially in mechanisms that encode unpredictable sensory features that are more variable, and thus more informative about the world. Namely, <italic>variance is salience</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As we recently showed, some informative local correlations of natural scenes are captured by the configurations of luminances seen through a ‘glider’, that is, a window defined by a 2 × 2 square arrangement of pixels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>). We use this observation first as a framework for analyzing the local statistical structure of natural scenes, then to characterize psychophysical sensitivities via a set of synthetic visual texture stimuli, and finally to compare the two.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analyzing local image statistics in natural scenes</title><p>The analysis of natural scenes is schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We collect an ensemble of image patches from the calibrated Penn natural image database (PIDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tkačik et al., 2011</xref>). We preprocess the image patches as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. This involves first averaging pixel luminances over a square region of <italic>N × N</italic> pixels, which converts an image of size <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> <italic>× L</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> pixels into an image of reduced size <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>/N × L</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>/N</italic> pixels. Images are then divided into <italic>R × R</italic> square patches of these downsampled pixels and whitened (see ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Image preprocessing</italic>, for further details). Since the preprocessing depends on a choice of two parameters, the block-average factor <italic>N</italic> and patch size <italic>R</italic>, we report results for multiple image analyses performed using the identical preprocessing pipeline but for various choices of <italic>N</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. After preprocessing, we binarize each patch to have equal numbers of black and white pixels (black = −1, white = +1). We characterize each patch by the histogram of 16 binary colorings (2<sup>2×2</sup>) seen through a square 2 × 2 pixel glider (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Translation invariance imposes constraints on this histogram, reducing the number of degrees of freedom to 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>). These degrees of freedom can be mapped to a set of image statistic coordinates that separates correlations based on their order: (<italic>i</italic>) one first-order coordinate, <italic>γ</italic>, describes overall luminance, (<italic>ii</italic>) four second-order coordinates, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>\</mml:mo></mml:msub><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, describe two-point correlations between pixels arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, (<italic>iii</italic>) four third-order coordinates, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">⌞</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">⌜</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">⌝</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">⌟</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, describe three-point correlations between pixels arranged into ⌞-shapes of different orientations, and (<italic>iv</italic>) one fourth-order coordinate, <italic>α</italic>, describes the single four-point correlation between all four pixels in the glider (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We used a four-alternative forced-choice task in which stimuli consisted of a textured target and a binary noise background (or vice-versa). Each stimulus was presented for 120ms and was followed by a noise mask. Subjects were then asked to identify the spatial location (top, bottom, left, or right) of the target. Experiments were carried out for synthetic stimuli in which the target or background was defined by first varying image statistic coordinates independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows examples of gamuts from which stimuli are built). Along each coordinate axis, threshold (1/sensitivity) was defined as the coordinate value required to support a criterion level of performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, inset). We then performed further experiments in which the target or background was defined by simultaneously varying pairs of coordinates. For measurements involving each coordinate pair (to which we will refer as a ‘coordinate plane’), we traced out an isodiscrimination contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) that describes the threshold values not only along the cardinal directions, but also along oblique directions. Measurements were collected for four individual subjects in each of 11 distinct coordinate planes (representing all distinct coordinate pairs up to 4-fold rotational symmetry; see ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Psychophysical methods</italic>, for further details).

However, it is known that image statistics covary substantially in natural images (as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and also that they interact perceptually (as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When pairs of natural image statistics covary, thus sampling oblique directions not aligned with the coordinate axes in the space of image statistics, our hypothesis predicts that human perceptual sensitivity is matched to both the degree and the direction of that covariation (we are referring here to the orientation of a distribution in the coordinate plane of a pair of image statistics, and not to an orientation in physical space). To test this idea, we proceeded as follows.</p><p>First, we fit the distribution of image statistics with a multidimensional Gaussian. When projected into pairwise coordinate planes, the isoprobability contours of this Gaussian capture the in-plane shape and orientation of the covariation of the distribution. Along single coordinate axes, the variation in natural image statistics predicts human perceptual sensitivities, as we have shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). More generally, we would predict that sensitivity should be be high along directions in which the distribution of natural image statistics has high standard deviation, because in those directions, the position of a sample cannot be guessed. Within coordinate planes, the quantitative statement of this idea is that the inverse covariance matrix, or precision matrix, predicts perceptual isodiscrimination contours. Sensitivity is expected to be low (and therefore threshold high) along directions in which the precision matrix has a high value and the position of a sample can be guessed a priori.</p><p>Results in each coordinate plane are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Across all subjects and all coordinate planes, we find that the shape and orientation of perceptual isodiscrimination contours (red ellipses) are predicted by the distribution of image statistics extracted from natural scenes (blue ellipses). As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the correspondence is very good, with mismatch that is comparable to the variability observed across image analyses and across subjects.</p><p>To quantify the correspondence between natural image and psychophysical analyses, we describe each ellipse by a single vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> that combines information about shape (eccentricity) and orientation (angular tilt), and we compute the scalar product between the image analysis vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NI</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and the subject-averaged psychophysical vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>PP</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This value, averaged across coordinate planes, ranges from 0.953 to 0.977 across image analyses. We compared this correspondence to that obtained under the null hypotheses that (<italic>i</italic>) the apparent correspondence between image statistic covariances and isodiscrimination contours is chance, or (<italic>ii</italic>) the apparent covariances in image statistics are due to chance. The observed correspondence is much greater than the value measured under either null hypothesis (<italic>p</italic> ≤.0003 for each image analysis under both hypotheses; see ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Analysis of image statistics in pairwise coordinate planes</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for comparisons of eccentricity and tilt, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2 tbl3">Tables 1–3</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Permutation tests</italic>, for statistical tests).</p><p>These findings confirm that the shape and orientation of human isodiscrimination contours, measured across all pairwise combinations of coordinates, can be quantitatively predicted from the covariation of image statistics extracted from natural scenes. The observed correspondence is maintained within the full 9-dimensional coordinate space (see ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Analysis of the full 9-dimensional distribution of image statistics</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> for principal component analyses, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2 tbl3">Tables 1–3</xref> and ‘Materials and methods‘, <italic>Permutation tests</italic>, for statistical tests), confirming that our hypothesis describes human sensitivity in the full 9-dimensional space of local image statistics extracted from natural scenes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>How should neural mechanisms be distributed to represent a diverse set of informative sensory features? We argued that, when performance requires inferences limited by sampling of the statistics of input features, resources should be devoted in proportion to feature variability. A basic idea here is that features that take a wider range of possible values are less predictable, and will better distinguish between contexts in the face of input noise. We used this hypothesis to successfully predict human sensitivity to elements of visual form arising from spatial multi-point correlations in images. This result is notable for several reasons. First, we successfully predicted dozens of independent parameters that describe human perceptual sensitivity. The only free parameter was a scale that converted between perceptual sensitivities and natural image statistics. Moreover, predictions about the rank ordering of sensitivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the shape and orientation of isodiscrimination contours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) do not even require a scale factor. Second, the theoretical predictions and their psychophysical test were derived from two very different sources. Psychophysical stimuli consisted of mathematically-defined synthetic binary textures with precisely-controlled correlational structure that is unlikely to occur outside of the laboratory. In contrast, the efficient coding predictions were derived from calibrated photographs of natural scenes in which many types of correlations are simultaneously present. Third, predictions refer to multi-point (and not just pairwise) correlations, which are critical for defining local features such as lines and edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oppenheim and Lim, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morrone and Burr, 1988</xref>). In contrast, previous normative theories have have mainly focused on explaining the linear receptive fields of neurons in primary visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell and Sejnowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Hateren and Ruderman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Hateren and van der Schaaf, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyvarinen and Hoyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karklin and Lewicki, 2009</xref>) and auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson and DeWeese, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2012</xref>), or on deriving symmetry- and coverage-based mesoscopic models of cortical map formation in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolf and Geisel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swindale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaschube et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the efficient coding prediction of greater sensitivity to more variable multipoint correlations is closely tied to the statistical structure of natural visual images. Specifically, this regime applies to highly variable multipoint correlations that cannot be predicted from simpler ones. Some other multipoint correlations (defined on configurations other than a 2 × 2 glider) are also highly variable, but they are predictable from simpler correlations. For these multipoint correlations, visual sensitivity is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>), and efficient coding is not applicable in the form proposed here.</p><p>In sum, the surprising predictive power and the high statistical significance of our results provide strong support for the proposed application of the efficient coding hypothesis to cortical processing of complex sensory features.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Perceptual salience of multi-point correlations likely arises in cortex</title><p>Although we did not record cortical responses directly, several lines of evidence indicate that that the perceptual thresholds we measured are determined by cortical processes. First, the stimuli had high contrast (100%) and consisted of pixels that were readily visible (14 arcmin), so retinal limitations of contrast sensitivity and resolution were eliminated. Second, the task requires pooling of information over wide areas (100–200 pixels, that is, a region whose diameter is 10–15 times the width of an image element; see Figure 7 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Victor and Conte, 2005</xref>). Retinal receptive fields are unlikely to do this, as the ratio of their spatial extent (surround size) to their resolution (center size) is typically no more than 4:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croner and Kaplan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kremers et al., 1995</xref>). Third, to account for the specificity of sensitivity to three- and four-point correlations, a cascade of two linear-nonlinear stages is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Victor and Conte, 1991</xref>); retinal responses are quite well-captured by a single nonlinear stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nirenberg and Pandarinath, 2012</xref>), and cat retinal populations show no sensitivity to the four-point correlations studied used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Victor, 1986</xref>) while simultaneous cortical field potentials do.

In the periphery, this is exemplified by the well-known suppression of very low spatial frequencies; in cortex, this is exemplified by insensitivity to high-order correlations that are predictable from lower-order ones. Previous work has shown that such higher-order correlations can be separated into two groups—informative and uninformative—and only the informative ones are encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>). We used this finding to select an informative subspace for the present study, and we asked how resources should be efficiently allocated amongst features within this informative subspace.</p><p>A simple model of efficient coding by neural populations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (details in ‘Materials ans methods’<italic>, Two regimes of efficient coding</italic>). Here, to enable analytical calculations, we used linear filters of variable gain and subject to Gaussian noise to model a population of neural channels encoding different features. The optimal allocation of resources to maximize information transmitted by the population depends on the amount of input noise, the amount of output noise, the input signal variability, and the total resources available to the system, here quantified as a constraint on the total output power (i.e., sum of response variances) in the neural population. The constrained output power and the output noise together determine the ‘bandwidth’ of the system—that is, the expressive capacity of its outputs. Consider a neural population with input noise, output noise, and a fixed amount of output power. We find that when input signal variability is sufficiently large compared to the input noise, the gain of neurons should <italic>decrease</italic> with the variance of the input (regions to the right of the peaks in the right-hand panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is a regime where the output bandwidth is low compared to the input range, and efficient coding predicts that signals should be ‘whitened’ by equalizing the variance in different channels. Conversely, consider input signals with a smaller range, which are thus more disrupted by input noise. In this case, the gain of neurons should <italic>increase</italic> with the variance of the input (regions to the left of the peaks in the right-hand panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is a regime where the input noise dominates, and efficient coding predicts that the system should invest more resources in more variable, and hence more easily detectable, input signals.

We impose a constraint on the total power output of all channels, that is, a constraint on its total resources. With these assumptions, the set of gains that maximizes the transmitted information can be determined (see ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Two regimes of efficient coding</italic>, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Hateren, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doi and Lewicki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doi and Lewicki, 2014</xref>)). This set of gains depends on the relative strengths of input and output noise and on the severity of the power constraint, quantified here by the dimensionless parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mtext>Λ</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula> (right-hand panel). As <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mtext>Λ</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula> decreases from 1 to 0, the system moves from a regime in which output noise is limiting to one in which input noise is limiting. (<bold>B</bold>) The efficient coding model applied to the sensory periphery. Raw luminances from natural images are corrupted with noise (e.g. shot noise resulting from photon incidence) and passed through a linear filter. The resulting signal is carried by the optic nerve, which imposes a strong constraint on output capacity. In the bandwidth limited case where output noise dominates over input noise (e.g., under high light conditions when photon noise is not limiting), the optimal gain decreases as signal variability increases. Since channel input and channel gain vary reciprocally, channel outputs are approximately equalized, resulting in a ‘whitening’, or decorrelation. (<bold>C</bold>) The efficient coding model applied to cortical processing. Informative image features resulting from early cortical processing, caricatured by our preprocessing pipeline as applied to the retinal output, are sampled from a spatial region of the image. This sampling acts as a kind of input noise, because it only provides limited count-based estimates for the true statistical properties of the image source. When this input noise is limiting, the optimal gain <italic>increases</italic> as signal variability increases. Rather than whiten, the output signals preserve the correlational structure of the input. Note that in both regimes (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>), there is a range of signals that are not encoded at all. These are the signals that are not sufficiently informative to warrant an allocation of resources.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03722.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03722.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03722-fig4-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig4s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03722.019</object-id><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of channel optimization problem.</title><p>We consider a set of channels, each of which is dedicated to processing an independent signal <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf293"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

A common strategy employed in the periphery is ‘whitening’, where relatively fewer resources are devoted (yielding lower gain) to features with more variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>). As an example, within the spatial frequency range that the retina captures well, sensitivity is greater for high spatial frequencies than for low ones, that is, sensitivity is inversely related to the degree of variation in natural scenes (the well-known <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> power spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>]). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> illustrates how this strategy can emerge from the simple efficient coding scheme discussed above as applied to peripheral sensory processing. Spatiotemporal correlations of light undergo filtering before passing through the optic nerve bottleneck (a constraint on bandwidth). Such a constraint on bandwidth is equivalently understood as a regime where output noise is relatively large compared to input noise. In this limit, where output noise dominates over input noise, the optimal strategy is whitening (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srinivasan et al., 1982</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Of course, real neural systems contend with both input and output noise; indeed recent work has shown that simply whitening to deal with output noise underestimates the optimal performance that the sensory periphery can achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doi and Lewicki, 2014</xref>).</p><p>An alternative regime arises when input noise limits performance. In this regime, relatively <italic>more</italic> resources are devoted to features with more variation. This regime was discussed in early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Hateren, (1992a)</xref> and was also recognized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doi and Lewicki, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2014</xref>), although it has received much less attention than the ‘whitening’ regime. Our results suggest that this is the regime is relevant to cortex, where it predicts the relative allocation of resources to higher-order image statistics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> illustrates the simple efficient coding scheme in this context. We use our image preprocessing pipeline to mimic early visual processing, and we consider the downstream coding of higher-order image features. Because these features must be sampled from a finite patch of an image, they are subject to <italic>input</italic> noise arising from fluctuations in statistical estimation. When such input noise is limiting, the ability to detect a signal from noise increases with the variability of that signal. In this limit, efficient coding predicts that resources should be allocated in proportion to feature variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This captures the intuition that when signal reliability is in question, more reliable signals warrant more resources. Furthermore, if two or more channels have covarying signals, resources should be devoted in relation to the direction and degree of maximum covariance (see ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Two regimes of efficient coding</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The difference between these two efficient coding regimes is a consequence of the form of noise—output vs input noise—that is limiting. Our finding that cortex operates in a different regime than the well-known peripheral whitening reflects the fact that different stages and kinds of processing can face different constraints. While information transmission by the visual periphery is limited by a bottleneck in the optic nerve, cortex faces no such transmission constraint. Furthermore, while faithful encoding may be an immediate goal of early visual processing, cortical circuits have to interpret image features from a complex and crowded visual scene and perform statistical inference. For example, to discriminate between various textures, the cortex cannot perform pixel-by-pixel comparisons, but must rely on the estimation of local correlations (image statistics) instead. Because these correlations must be sampled from a finite patch of the visual scene, any estimate will be limited by sampling fluctuations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sampling constraints vs resource constraints</title><p>Sampling fluctuations constitute a source of input noise, the magnitude of which depends on the size of the sampled region. For natural images, this gives rise to a tradeoff: small regions lead to large fluctuations in the estimated statistics, while large regions blur over local details. This blurring may obscure the boundaries between objects with different surface properties. While the brain must implement such sampling, the size, scale, and potentially dynamic nature of the sampling region is not known. Interestingly, our predictions of human sensitivities do not change substantially over a wide range of spatial scales and image patch sizes, perhaps reflecting a scaling property of natural images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stephens et al., 2013</xref>). An avenue for future research is to determine whether there is an optimal region size, and if so, whether it could be estimated from images themselves.</p><p>Sampling limitations alone do not suffice to account for the observed differential sensitivity of the brain to local image statistics. Were sampling limitations the only consideration, perceptual sensitivity would be the same along each coordinate axis, and perceptual isodiscrimination contours would be circular in each coordinate plane. This follows from an ideal observer calculation (See Appendix B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>). In contrast, we find that human observers have a severalfold variability in sensitivity along different coordinate axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and have isodiscrimination contours that are elongated in oblique directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The efficient coding principle can account for these findings by taking into consideration the fact that a real observer has finite processing resources. In this context (finite resources <italic>and</italic> substantial input noise), the efficient coding principle predicts that resources are invested in relation to the range of signal values that are typically present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Hateren, 1992a</xref>), as we find. Interestingly, resource limitations seem to play an important role in the cortex despite the vast expansion in the number of neurons compared to the optic nerve. Presumably, this reflects the large number of complex features that could be computed and the corresponding need for a large overrepresentation of the stimulus space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olshausen and Field, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Clues to neural mechanisms</title><p>While we find a close match between the variation in natural image statistics and human psychophysical performance, some aspects of the distribution of natural image statistics do not match psychophysical data.</p><p>These differences are not readily apparent when we examine the variances and covariances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) of the distribution of natural image statistics but emerge only when one considers its detailed shape (see ‘Materials and methods’<italic>, Asymmetries in distributions of natural image statistics</italic>).

In contrast, human perceptual sensitivity is symmetric, or very nearly so (within <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>20</mml:mn><mml:mtext>%</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), for positive vs negative values of <italic>α</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Victor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Victor et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that limitations imposed by ‘neural hardware’ force the system to use heuristics instead of matching the natural image distribution exactly. For example, an opponent mechanism responsible for detecting variations along, example, the <italic>α</italic> coordinate, might be a useful and easy (although imperfect) way to process the asymmetric distribution of four-point correlations found in natural scenes. Such a mechanism could be matched to the variance of the natural image distribution along the <italic>α</italic> coordinate, but not to its skew or other odd moments. An opponent mechanism would necessarily give rise to equal sensitivities to positive vs negative values of <italic>α</italic>, as observed in psychophysical results. Further study of deviations from a perfect match to the distribution of natural image statistics might provide additional insight into these or other possible neural mechanisms, and into the goals of the computations. Independently, our results also raise an interesting theoretical question about the optimal representation of non-gaussian, multidimensional signals under resource-limited conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Outlook</title><p>Looking forward, we hypothesize that the principle of efficient coding might apply to cortical processing at higher levels. For example, more complex image features, such as shapes, are represented as conjunctions of contour fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brincat and Connor, 2004</xref>), where each contour fragment is a local image object defined by particular multi-point correlations. We might speculate that the joint statistics of contour fragments in natural scenes can predict, through appropriate formulation of the same efficient coding principle used here, the properties of neurons in area IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yau et al., 2012</xref>) or the associated perceptual sensitivities of human observers.</p><p>Finally, although we have focused on perception of image statistics, we do this with the premise that this process is in the service of inferring the materials and objects that created an image and ultimately, guiding action. Thus, it is notable that we found a tight correspondence between visual perception and natural scene statistics without considering a specific task or behavioral set. Indeed, the emergence of higher-order percepts without explicit task specification was the original hope of the efficient coding framework as first put forward by Barlow and Attneave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attneave, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">1961</xref>).

Images from the UPenn Natural Image Database were selected by hand to ensure that they contained no man-made objects. We required that images contained minimal (less that one-third of the total image area) amounts of sky, as the contribution of sky to the overall power spectrum of natural images is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torralba and Oliva, 2003</xref>) and is not the focus of the present study. Images from the van Hateren Natural Image Dataset were chosen subject to the additional constraint that scenery which was clearly the result of human landscaping (e.g. trees all in a line) be excluded.

Because we are interested in the statistics computed from in-focus image patches, we use a mixture of components (MOC) method to separate blurred from in-focus image patches.</p><p>To perform this separation, we first examined the 9-dimensional distribution of natural image statistics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> for the projection of the distribution onto the (α, β<sub>−</sub>) plane). When projected onto various coordinate planes, the structure of the distribution suggested that the distribution could be well-described by a weighted sum of two components. We explored this two-component description by running a standard maximum likelihood MOC inference that described each component by a Gaussian distribution. This inference method returned the mean, covariance, and relative weighting of each putative Gaussian component. In this process, each image patch was assigned to one of the two components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; note that the two components are separated in the 9-dimensional space, although they appear overlapping in this particular projection). After inspecting the clustering of patches into each of the two components, we observed that one of the components contained image patches that are sharp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while the other contained patches that are blurry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>).</p><p>We performed several controls to show that this separation is precise and effective. We first confirmed, based on visual inspection of a large number of images, that this method reliably separates blurred from in-focus patches. For example, images that were uniformly composed of patches assigned to the ‘blurry’ component were fully blurred due, example, to camera motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Similarly, images in which a large percentage of patches were assigned to the ‘blurry’ component contained large regions that were blurred due to motion or camera focus artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the spatial boundary between blurred and in-focus regions in the original image matched the boundary between patches assigned to the ‘blurry’ vs ‘in-focus’ component.</p><p>We additionally tested this method by incrementally removing images that were significantly blurred and then re-running the MOC method. After the removal of each subsequent image, the MOC method returned a mixture of components that was incrementally more strongly weighted toward the ‘in-focus’ component.</p><p>Finally, we tested this method by applying motion and Gaussian blur filters to sharp images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). With a sufficiently strong blurring transformation, all of the patches within a sharp image changed assignment from the ‘in-focus’ to the ‘blurry’ component. Successive block averaging removes the effects of small blur, such that a larger blurring transformation is required to change the assignment of patches from the ‘in-focus’ to the ‘blurred’ component. Furthermore, the application of motion and blur filters altered the spatial distribution of natural image statistics in a manner consistent with the statistics observed in image patches assigned to the ‘blurry’ component via the MOC method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Both types of blurring increased the values of second- and fourth-order statistics, but they did so in different manners. Camera motion strongly increased both the fourth-order statistic and the second-order statistic aligned parallel to the direction of motion. In comparison, camera focus artifacts (arising, e.g., from variations in field of depth) more uniformly increased all second- and fourth-order statistics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6"><title>Scaling image analyses</title><p>To compare between natural image and psychophysical analyses, we scale the set of 9 standard deviations extracted from a given image analysis by a multiplicative factor that minimizes the squared error between the set of nine standard deviations and the set of nine psychophysical sensitivities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the value of the scale factor for different choices of the block-average factor <italic>N</italic> and patch size <italic>R</italic>.

Shuffled patch labels. This model tests the null hypothesis that the apparent covariances in image statistics are due to chance. For each coordinate, we randomly shuffle image patch labels. This shuffling creates a new set of null patches whose second-, third-, and fourth-order coordinate values are randomly drawn from a subset of the original image patches (e.g. a given null patch can be described by a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf172"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>-value measured from patch <italic>m</italic> but an <italic>α</italic> value measured from patch <italic>n</italic>). This shuffling destroys correlations between coordinate values measured within individual patches. Note that this shuffling does not alter the range of variation measured along single coordinate axes and will therefore not alter the values of precision matrix ellipses measured along coordinate axes. As a result, this test is not applicable to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf173"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which measures natural image variation and human sensitivities along individual coordinate axes. However, shuffling will destroy correlations along oblique directions in coordinate planes, thereby aligning each ellipse along a single coordinate axis. Note that the eccentricity of each ellipse (in, e.g., the A-B plane) is then trivially related to the ratio of variances <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf174"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> measured along the corresponding coordinate axes: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf175"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. We therefore expect that this shuffling will most strongly affect the tilt and eccentricity in pairwise planes in which ellipses are oriented along oblique directions (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf176"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf177"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>\</mml:mo></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf178"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> planes). Finally, in destroying correlations between pairs of coordinates, this shuffling creates a diagonal covariance matrix, such that principal components are aligned with single coordinate axes. If the correspondence between quantities derived from image analysis and psychophysics is statistically significant, we expect that the shuffled vectors <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf179"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf180"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf181"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> will show less overlap with the psychophysical vectors than do the original image analysis vectors.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Each null model is constructed by randomly selecting permuted indices that independently shuffle coordinate labels for subject-averaged psychophysical data (Null Model 1) and independently shuffle image patch labels for a given statistic (Null Model 2).

Your article has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), Timothy Behrens (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this our decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revision.</p><p>All reviewers found the data interesting, but all had concerns about whether they addressed the central hypotheses outlined in the abstract and introduction. In brief we do not find a convincing argument that the results 1) reflect a central mechanism, 2) relate to behavior, or 3) make different predictions than what one would predict for the sensory periphery given the efficient coding hypothesis. These questions are specified in detail in the reviews below. The consensus that emerged from the consultation session is that clarification and rewriting will be needed to ensure that the contribution of this work can be understood.

Both follow a characteristic pattern in which cardinal, then oblique features are the most variable over images (and the most detectable), followed by fourth order statistics, followed by third order (L shapes in a 4-pixel glider). The correspondence between lines of isosensitivity and the precision matrix for pairwise comparisons in 10 dimensions are very striking. The authors interpret their findings as showing that efficient coding - heightened sensitivity to the most informative features of the world - occurs not only at a sensory level but at a central decision level.</p><p>I liked the paper and approach very much. I was a little more doubtful about the novelty of the findings. My concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) I wasn't sure how the paper demonstrated that efficient coding operates at a 'central' level, as the authors claim in the abstract In fact, the paper doesn't really have anything to do with what most cognitive scientists think of as 'central processing'. It shows that we are most sensitive to patches defined by cardinal orientations, and that variability along this axis is an informative way to characterise natural scenes.</p><p>2) The psychophysical results seems in part to restate the well-known oblique effect. It is known that we are most sensitive to cardinal orientations, and the neural underpinnings of this effect (in visual cortex) have been much discussed. The work of Simoncelli and colleagues (cited appropriately here) has been key in pointing out that sensitivity to cardinal directions matches the prevalence of cardinal information in the world. I think the work here extends that finding by demonstrating a particularly good correspondence between the spatial correlations in image statistics and this sensitivity over a number of basic features.</p><p>In short, I think this is an interestingly, well-presented paper that I would encourage others to read, and that I would cite in my own work. However, I am not sure whether it is telling us something we didn't know, or just demonstrating something we did know in a particularly elegant fashion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>This paper describes a robust and interesting observation that links properties of natural images to psychophysical properties of the visual system. While this observation is certainly worthwhile publishing, I'm less convinced about the author's conclusion with regard to “variance is salience” as an efficient coding principle for central sensory processing.</p><p>While the authors correctly note that central processing must be concerned with behaviorally relevant aspects of the inputs, the 'variance' in their principle is completely independent of the organism's behavior and purely defined in terms of the stimulus. In fact, none of their discussion nor references to the earlier van Hateren papers that the authors invoke as a framework for interpreting their findings involves behavior. I suggest to simply drop that part of their claim and the suggestion that their principle might account for central processing and describe it as a principle governing early sensory processing where different constraints apply than in the sensory periphery. (Unless I'm missing a central part of their argument, of course. Example below.)</p><p>I think the paper would benefit greatly from a more explicit setup, ideally including a Figure, of the various potential constraints faced by early sensory processing and their respective implications for their experiments. While this aspect is not the main contribution of their paper, it would make it more explicit which alternative models/constraints are being excluded by their observation. It would also delineate better, what is inevitable conclusion within the efficient coding framework (finite resources and high input noise), and what is interpretation/speculation. Both are currently mixed in the Discussion section.</p><p>Psychophysical measurements necessarily characterize the entire system; from periphery to behavior. The author suggest their results support an optimization principle separate and different from that in the periphery and while I agree on an intuitive level, I would welcome help in thinking through the implications of combining two different principles, applied after each other, for the aggregate quantities that are being measured. E.g. why does the high input noise constraint only refer to what enters cortex, not already the retina, overriding the output-bottleneck in the visual periphery?</p><p>Finally, I'd like to commend the authors on making excellent use of the possibility of including supplementary information.</p><p>In summary, I recommend publication of this paper subject to:</p><p>1) Providing a more explicit setup for the different hypotheses to be tested and how they derive from the efficient coding principle subject to different constraints.</p><p>2) Omitting the behaviorally relevant claims not supported by their framework.</p><p>3) Responses to more minor points of critique below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>The authors demonstrate that the level of variability in various local, multi-point statistics in natural scenes quantitatively predicts the relative salience of these statistics. I find their data largely convincing, and I feel that this is an important question and that the authors are careful and creative in their approach here. However, I have several concerns, which I suspect in part reflect my own ignorance or misunderstanding about the present paper and past work by these authors.</p><p>First, I am not clear on what is qualitatively new here beyond what was shown in the nice 2010 PNAS paper by several of the same authors. I can see that some of the details of their analyses are different, and the comparisons here are more quantitative, but it seems to me that the main ideas and conclusions were already in place in the previous work.</p><p>The authors pitch their results in terms of cortical processing, but the only data presented are from human psychophysics, used here as a proxy for cortical processing. The authors give arguments for why salience strongly reflects cortical processing. But I feel that the claims about cortical processing are stated too strongly in some parts of the paper given that they do not directly measure cortical activity nor perform any manipulations to cortex, for example.</p><p>It seems to me that the dichotomy set up by the authors between predictions for peripheral and central processing is somewhat overstated. For example, in the final sentence of the Abstract, they state that the efficient coding hypothesis applies in “a different guise” and makes “different predictions” for the central nervous system than the periphery. They predict that sensitivity in the CNS should be greater for highly variable stimuli, but it is not clear to me that this is not one of the predictions one would make for peripheral sensory neurons using this principle.</p><p>What was the exact task being performed by the subjects?</p><p>What would <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> look like for IId samples from white (or colored) noise?</p><p>How do the results change for images pixelated along a grid that is 45° tilted relative to the vertical and horizontal directions?</p><p>Related to this, could the √2 differences in the degree of variation for the vertical/horizontal and diagonal beta data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> be due to the difference in the distance between the points in question given the orientation of the pixelation grid?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03722.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All reviewers found the data interesting, but all had concerns about whether they addressed the central hypotheses outlined in the abstract and introduction.

First, stimuli are all high contrast (100%) and of a readily visible size (14 arcmin), so retinal limitations of contrast sensitivity and resolution are eliminated. Second, the task requires pooling of information over wide areas. Third, extracting three- and four-point correlations requires a kind of nonlinear processing (two stages of nonlinearity) that is not generally considered to be present in the retina; physiologic recordings show that neural responses to these correlations are not present in the thalamus, but are present in visual cortex, and much more so in V2 than in V1. We acknowledge that these lines are indirect; we do not directly record cortical activity, and we now state this explicitly in the manuscript (see response to comments raised by Reviewer 3). But we believe that together, these lines of evidence justify the statement that the thresholds are determined by limitations of central processing.</p><p><italic>2) To what extent do our results relate to behavior?</italic></p><p>The goal of the visual system is to make discriminations that are useful to guide action, rather than to reconstruct the image per se. We had used the term “behaviorally relevant” to highlight this idea, once in the Abstract and once in the manuscript; we have now removed it from the Abstract, where we see how it might have been confusing, and we expand on the point in the Introduction.</p><p>With regard to the comments raised by Reviewer 2, obviously our analysis of natural image statistics was without regard to task, and the psychophysical task was not designed to mimic a real-life behavior. But we think this is a strong point, not a weakness, as it shows that the allocation of resources in early cortical visual processing can be accounted for in a general framework. We now comment on this in the text.</p><p><italic>3) To what extent do our results make different predictions than one would predict for the sensory periphery?</italic></p><p>We now clarify this at several points in the manuscript, and we add a new Figure. Briefly, the contrast is not between peripheral and central processing per se, but the difference between two efficient coding regimes: one that is limited by noise in the output (i.e., limited capacity) and one regime that is limited by noise in the input (i.e., limited sampling). The periphery is typically considered to be characterized by the first regime, at least when it comes to thinking about receptive field properties, and we hypothesize that central processing is characterized by the second. The new Figure illustrates the qualitative difference between these regimes: when output noise is limiting, efficient coding predicts a whitening (reduced sensitivity for more variable input components); when input noise is limiting, efficient coding predicts the opposite (increased sensitivity for more variable input components).</p><p>Since central processing follows the peripheral processing, one could wonder how the two stages of the same processing stream can be subject to different constraints. The reason is as follows: the “input signal” in the context of efficient coding for the retina is directly the raw light intensity, and efficient coding regime is derived from the spatiotemporal correlation structure of light intensity. In contrast, the input signals for central coding are nonlinear functions of the original image (image statistic coordinates); this means that efficient coding regime is derived from the covariance structure of image statistics. Since the formal inputs to the encoders are very different (light or contrast in the periphery, image statistic estimates centrally), a different regime of efficient coding emerges.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>[…] In short, I think this is an interestingly, well-presented paper that I would encourage others to read, and that I would cite in my own work. However, I am not sure whether it is telling us something we didn't know, or just demonstrating something we did know in a particularly elegant fashion</italic>.</p><p>We are very pleased that Reviewer 1 found our paper to be both interesting and well-presented. We do feel that the paper is telling us something new and rather exciting, as we explain below in responses to the specific comments.</p><p><italic>1) I wasn’t sure how the paper demonstrated that efficient coding operates at a ‘central’ level, as the authors claim in the abstract. In fact, the paper doesn’t really have anything to do with what most cognitive scientists think of as ‘central processing’.</italic></p><p>With regard to ‘central processing’: We use this term to distinguish our focus – cortical sensory processing – from processing in the sensory periphery. We think this is a reasonable use of the term, even though there is (of course) much additional central processing that we do not consider. But we understand the potential for confusion, and we now clarify the use of the term in the Introduction: “To test this hypothesis, we focus on early stages of central visual processing. Here, early visual cortex (V1 and V2) is charged with extracting edges, shapes, and other complex correlations of light between multiple points in space...”</p><p>We feel that there is strong evidence that the computations that determine task performance occur in primary visual cortex, both V1 and V2, and we expand on this point in the paper. Specifically, we now state:</p><p>Discussion: “Although we did not record cortical responses directly, several lines of evidence indicate that that the perceptual thresholds we measured are determined by cortical processes. […] Conversely, macaque visual cortical neurons (Purpura et al., 1994), especially those in V2, manifest responses to three- and four-point correlations (Yu et al., 2013). ”</p><p><italic>It shows that we are most sensitive to patches defined by cardinal orientations, and that variability along this axis is an informative way to characterise natural scenes</italic>.</p><p>Our results about sensitivities to pairwise statistics in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions go substantially beyond a demonstration of previously-known findings, in several ways.</p><p>First, the “on-axis” sensitivities are not obvious consequences of the orientation tuning of cortical neurons (since we consider both positive and negative correlations) or the oblique effect (our observed differences are substantially larger, likely because these configurations differ in more than orientation). For further discussion of the oblique effect, please see our response to point 2 below.</p><p>Second, only a small portion of our findings (a prediction of four relative sensitivities) relate to individual “axes.” Most of our findings (more than a dozen free parameters) relate to how the axes interact – again, not something that is a consequence of orientation-tuning or the oblique effect.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that there is a misunderstanding about the axes themselves: they are not the spatial axes within an image, but abstract axes within a space of image statistics. We can see how this might have been confusing, and we now clarify it with the following text:</p><p>Results: “When pairs of natural image statistics covary, thus sampling oblique directions not aligned with the coordinate axes in the space of image statistics, our hypothesis predicts that human perceptual sensitivity is matched to both the degree and the direction of that covariation (we are referring here to the orientation of a distribution in the coordinate plane of a pair of image statistics, and not to an orientation in physical space).”</p><p>An important way in which our results extend beyond what is already known relates to the predictions of normative theories. To date, normative theories applied to cortical processing have been focused on predicting the response properties of single cells, considered as linear or quasilinear filters. Here, we ask how resources should be distributed across a population of cells to represent a diverse set of nonlinear, higher-order features that cover a multidimensional domain. We highlight this goal within the Introduction:</p><p>Introduction: “Can we extend such theories beyond the sensory periphery to describe cortical sensitivity to complex sensory features? […] We will show that these ideas predict a specific organizing principle for aggregate sensitivities arising in cortex: the perceptual salience of complex sensory signals increases with the variability, or unpredictability, of the corresponding signals over the ensemble of natural stimuli.”</p><p>We additionally emphasize that the goal of our study is to measure how sensitivities are distributed across a set of features, and is not limited to identifying features for which sensitivity is greatest. We now highlight this within the Introduction and Discussion:</p><p>Introduction: “We compare the spatial variation of local patterns of light across natural images with human sensitivity to manipulations of the same patterns in synthetic images. This allows us to determine how sensitivity is distributed across many different features, rather than simply determining the most salient ones. To this end...”</p><p>Discussion: “How should neural mechanisms be distributed to represent a diverse set of informative sensory features? We argued that...”</p><p><italic>2) The psychophysical results seems in part to restate the well-known oblique effect. It is known that we are most sensitive to cardinal orientations, and the neural underpinnings of this effect (in visual cortex) have been much discussed. The work of Simoncelli and colleagues (cited appropriately here) has been key in pointing out that sensitivity to cardinal directions matches the prevalence of cardinal information in the world. I think the work here extends that finding by demonstrating a particularly good correspondence between the spatial correlations in image statistics and this sensitivity over a number of basic features</italic>.</p><p>While we can see how our findings might at first glance be considered to be part of an “oblique effect,” they are actually quite different. The effect size we report is much larger: sensitivities are about 50% higher for cardinal directions vs diagonal ones; in the classical oblique effect, sensitivity for oblique- vs cardinal-direction gratings differ by 10–20% in the midrange of spatial frequencies (Campbell et al., 1966). The reason that the effect size we observe is much larger is that the horizontal and vertical pairwise correlations differ from the diagonal pairwise correlations in more ways than just orientation: checks involved in horizontal and vertical pairwise correlations share an edge, while checks involved in diagonal pairwise correlations only share a corner. Furthermore, the image property relevant to explaining the oblique effect in the work of Simoncelli and colleagues are the local statistics of image gradients / oriented edges. While pairwise correlations between pixels (that we study) can influence image gradients (responsible for explaining the oblique effect) and vice versa, there is no simple one-to-one mapping between the two sets of statistics (e.g., high beta-vertical does not by itself imply a lot of vertical edge fragments). We now explain how our findings differ from the oblique effect:</p><p>Results: “Note that the difference between the sensitivities in the horizontal and vertical directions (β− and β|) vs the diagonal directions (β\ and β/) is not simply an “oblique effect”, i.e., a greater sensitivity for cardinally- vs obliquely-oriented contours (Campbell et al., 1966). Horizontal and vertical pairwise correlations differ from the diagonal pairwise configurations in more than just orientation: checks involved in horizontal and vertical pairwise correlations share an edge, while checks involved in diagonal pairwise correlations only share a corner. Correspondingly, the difference in sensitivities for horizontal and vertical correlations vs diagonal correlations is approximately 50%, which is much larger than the size of the classical oblique effect (10–20%) (Campbell et al., 1966).”</p><p>Additionally, much of our study is devoted to third and fourth-order correlations and the interactions of the texture statistics. These statistics are qualitatively different from any pairwise correlations that might be relevant for the oblique effect, and are crucial for our demonstration that efficient coding also applies beyond the pairwise order.</p><p>In sum, we agree that the main finding of the work can be framed in the context of the match between image statistics and visual sensitivities (as in the Simoncelli framework), but we think that it is important to emphasize that we are not looking at an “oblique effect.”</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p><italic>[…] In summary, I recommend publication of this paper subject to:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Providing a more explicit setup for the different hypotheses to be tested and how they derive from the efficient coding principle subject to different constraints</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) Omitting the behaviorally relevant claims not supported by their framework</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) Responses to more minor points of critique below</italic>.</p><p>We are very pleased that Reviewer 2 recommends publication of our paper subject to his/her outlined changes.

Both are currently mixed in the Discussion section</italic>.</p><p>We agree. We added substantial clarifying material and a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), as described below.</p><p><italic>2) Psychophysical measurements necessarily characterize the entire system - from periphery to behavior. The authors suggest their results support an optimization principle separate and different from that in the periphery and while I agree on an intuitive level, I would welcome help in thinking through the implications of combining two different principles, applied after each other, for the aggregate quantities that are being measured. E.g. why does the high input noise constraint only refer to what enters cortex, not already the retina, overriding the output-bottleneck in the visual periphery?</italic></p><p>If we understand the reviewer’s comment, it can be rephrased as follows: how can the cortex be operating in a regime dominated by input noise, when it follows peripheral processing, which sees the same input but is dominated by output noise?</p><p>The resolution of this apparent paradox is twofold. First, the critical issue is not the amount of input noise, but rather its size relative to the output noise. So, even though there is input noise at the level of the visual input, its severe output restriction (the transmission bottleneck) means that peripheral processing may be operating in a regime dominated by output noise. For cortex, which does not have the same output bottleneck, the same amount of input noise can dominate. The second consideration is the following. As we and others suggest, we view the “job” of early cortical processing as making inferences about surfaces and materials from visual texture (an idea that we formalize by measuring sensitivity to local image statistics). Given this goal, the fact that cortex only has access to a limited sample of a texture (i.e., the sample presented by a particular object) is also a form of input noise.</p><p>To illustrate this point, consider the following “toy visual system” whose task is to detect and estimate the local coherent motion of small, randomly moving point-like objects that are of high contrast (for example, the classic task of Newsome and Pare (1988), but with the dots placed on a 1/f background). Neurons in the periphery efficiently code the dots, making use of decorrelation. Centrally, however, the object of interest is the correlation structure of moving dots in small image patches, to extract the local coherent motion component. For this task, central processes must compare counts of how many dots move in each direction; at low density of dots, these estimates will be subject to large sampling errors due to random arrival and departure of dots from the region that is being sampled. Importantly, no matter what the SNR of the input is (even in 100% contrast vision where each dot is perfectly resolved), the local coherence estimates will be noisy due to the fact that local dot detections come as rare (and random) events; and the efficient central processing will thus be subject to large input noise. In our case, the local image statistics play the role of local dot counts, but the basic idea, that sampling is a form of noise, is identical. In both cases, because the signals relevant to periphery and cortex are different, one can end up in a different efficient coding regime at each stage of visual processing.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to help clarify these points. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the emergence of two efficient coding regimes in a system that operates under a total power (resource) constraint. The relevant regime, which depends on the relative strengths of input and output noise, reflects the constraints faced by the system in consideration. For our system (modeled as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we take inputs to be nonlinear image features that have already undergone peripheral preprocessing, as caricatured by our image analysis pipeline. We then apply the efficient coding framework to this set of nonlinear features, and we ask how sensitivities should be distributed among them.</p><p>The key point is that because these image features (counts of glider colorings) must be sampled from a spatial region of an image, any estimation of these features will be limited by sampling noise. We hypothesize that this sampling noise, which is a form of input noise, dominates. This predicts (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), that sensitivity should increase with signal variability. We test this prediction and show that it holds.</p><p>We reorganized and added to the text in order to illustrate this:</p><p>Discussion: “A simple model of efficient coding by neural populations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (details in Methods, Two regimes of efficient coding). Here, to enable analytical calculations, we used linear filters of variable gain and subject to Gaussian noise to model a population of neural channels encoding different features. […] The relative sizes of input and output noise (controlled by Λ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) determines the input ranges over which the two qualitatively different regimes of efficient coding apply.”</p><p>In addition, we clarified our language throughout the Discussion (see Discussion, Cortex faces a different class of challenges than the periphery ) to emphasize that the efficient coding regimes are a general feature of information optimization, and neither regime is a priori restricted to peripheral vs central processing. Thus, even in sensory periphery, there exist specific scenarios in which the signal is input- noise dominated. The best known example is perhaps that of night vision, when photon shot noise is no longer negligible and qualitatively reshapes peripheral information processing. Instead of decorrelation by center-surround receptive fields, receptive fields average the signal, i.e., they apply gain that enhances the correlations already present in the input in order to fight the detrimental effects of input noise.</p><p>We would like to emphasize clearly that the constraints considered here (nonlinear image features subject to sampling noise) thus differ from those considered by some of the most successful applications of efficient coding in the periphery. Because of these constraints, our finding that sensitivity increases with signal variability differs qualitatively from the findings of these studies, where whitening is optimal (or near optimal, see Doi and Lewicki (2014)) and sensitivity decreases with signal variability. Moreover, since feature extraction is thought to be one of the main tasks of central vision, the sampling noise constraint is likely to represent a general aspect of cortical processing, rather than a special case as for night vision in the periphery. And finally, the predictions made are quite different; we predict sensitivity to a wide variety of nonlinear features and their combinations, not the effective filtering behavior (i.e., shape) of a quasilinear receptive field.</p><p><italic>3) While the authors correctly note that central processing must be concerned with behaviorally relevant aspects of the inputs, the ‘variance’ in their principle is completely independent of the organism’s behavior and purely defined in terms of the stimulus. In fact, none of their discussion nor references to the earlier van Hateren papers that the authors invoke as a framework for interpreting their findings involves behavior. I suggest to simply drop that part of their claim and the suggestion that their principle might account for central processing and describe it as a principle governing early sensory processing where different constraints apply than in the sensory periphery. (Unless I’m missing a central part of their argument, of course. Example below</italic>.<italic>)</italic></p><p>We don’t intend to suggest that we are studying behavior, and we have edited the manuscript so that this is completely clear. We also added material to the Introduction and Discussion, including a new figure, that frames the work as consequences of differing constraints on peripheral and central processing.</p><p>Even though our focus is on visual processing and perception, the fact that visual processing must ultimately guide action plays a fundamental role: it motivates the idea that the visual system needs to make useful distinctions about the outside world, rather than reconstruct the image. But we can see that the term “behaviorally relevant” might have been misleading, so we have removed the term from the abstract, and we have explained the idea more carefully in the introduction:</p><p>“Can we extend such theories beyond the sensory periphery to describe cortical sensitivity to complex sensory features? Normative theories have been successful in predicting the response properties of single cells, including receptive fields in V1 (Olshausen and Field, 1996; Bell and Sejnowski, 1997; van Hateren and van der Schaaf, 1998; van Hateren and Ruderman, 1998; Hyvarinen and Hoyer, 2000; Vinje and Gallant, 2000; Karklin and Lewicki, 2009) and spectro-temporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex (Carlson and DeWeese, 2002, 2012). […] We will show that these ideas predict a specific organizing principle for aggregate sensitivities arising in cortex: the perceptual salience of complex sensory signals increases with the variability, or unpredictability, of the corresponding signals over the ensemble of natural stimuli.”</p><p>Also (as mentioned in the response to the editors), we think that the fact that the image analysis and psychophysics was without regard to task is a strong point, not a weakness. We find it quite remarkable that we see such a striking match between natural image statistics and perceptual sensitivity without including any notion of “value” as related to behavior. This finding, that higher order percepts emerge from efficient coding without explicit specification of the goal, was the original hope of the efficient coding framework as first put forward by Barlow and Attneave (Barlow, 1959, 1961; Attneave, 1954). It remains an interesting direction for future research to ask how the inclusion of value would shape the framework studied here. We now mention this explicitly in the Discussion:</p><p>“Finally, we emphasize that although we have focused on perception of image statistics, we do this with the premise that this process is in the service of inferring the materials and objects that created an image and ultimately, guiding action. Thus, it is notable that we found a tight correspondence between visual perception and natural scene statistics without considering a specific task or behavioral set, and indeed, the emergence of higher order percepts without explicit specification of a task was the original hope of the efficient coding framework as first put forward by Barlow and Attneave (Barlow, 1959, 1961; Attneave, 1954). Doubtless, these “top-down” factors influence the visual computations that underlie perception, and the nature and site of this influence are an important focus of future research.”</p><p><italic>4) In my understanding, the black/white asymmetry is the main systematic deviation from the prediction that was empirically found. I think this should be included (with Figure) and discussed in the main manuscript and not just in the SI</italic>.</p><p>We feel that the reviewer might have misunderstood our results in this regard: the main systematic deviation from prediction concerns positive and negative values of the fourth-order statistic α, not black/white asymmetry (the latter was eliminated by our preprocessing, in which we binarize image patches at the pixel intensity median such that each patch has equal numbers of black and white pixels (see Results, Analyzing local image statistics in natural scenes).</p><p>Specifically, there is an asymmetry of the distribution of α-values extracted from natural images that is not mirrored in psychophysical sensitivities. We mention this in Discussion, Clues to neural mechanisms, where we reference the relevant figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3–figure supplement 8</xref>). We now also include the discussion of this asymmetry within the main manuscript, in Methods, Asymmetries in distributions of natural image statistics.</p><p><italic>5) If your “glider” is anything more than a 2 × 2 window, then please explain in more detail.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct: the glider is a 2 × 2 window. We now clarify this in two places in the main text:</p><p>Results: “As we recently showed, some informative local correlations of natural scenes are captured by the configurations of luminances seen through a “glider”, i.e., a window defined by a 2 × 2 square arrangement of pixels (Tkačik et al., 2010).”</p><p>Results: “We characterize each patch by the histogram of 16 binary colorings (2<sup>2×2</sup>) seen through a square 2 × 2 pixel glider.”</p><p><italic>6) Block average should be explained better in the main text; wouldn’t have understood it without resorting to SI</italic>.</p><p>We now clarify the block-averaging process within the main text:</p><p>Results: “We preprocess the image patches as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. This involves first averaging pixel luminances over a square region of N × N pixels, which converts an image of size L<sub>1</sub> × L<sub>2</sub> pixels into an image of reduced size L<sub>1</sub>/N × L<sub>2</sub>/N pixels. Images are then divided into R × R square patches of these downsampled pixels and whitened (see Methods, Image preprocessing, for further details).”</p><p><italic>7) “Single scaling parameter for each image analysis”: what exactly does that mean? How many parameters per subject and comparison are needed? Can you say anything interesting about their distribution and the correlations between them?</italic></p><p>We clarify these points in the main text, including a rewording of the quoted phrase. As we explain, we carried out image analyses for several choices of two size parameters: a block-average factor N (where N × N image pixels are averaged at the first step of the processing pipeline) and a patch size R (where R × R is the size of a patch in N × N pixels in which statistics are determined). There were 2 choices of N (2 and 4) and 3 choices of R (32, 48, and 64), for a total of 6 parallel image analyses (in the SI, we show that our results hold over a wider range too). For each of these analyses, there was just one scale factor (the same for all statistics and all subjects), adjusted to minimize the least-squares error between the set of standard deviations and the set of psychophysical sensitivities:</p><p>Results: “This qualitative comparison can be converted to a quantitative one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as a single scaling parameter aligns the standard deviation of natural image statistics with the corresponding perceptual sensitivities. In this procedure, each of the six image analyses is scaled by a single multiplicative factor that minimizes the squared error between the set of standard deviations and the set of subject-averaged sensitivities (see Methods, Image preprocessing, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> for additional details regarding scaling).”</p><p>With regard to a relationship between the scale factors and the analysis parameters (the block-average factor N and patch size R), there is (as one might expect) a systematic relationship. We now show this in detail in Methods, Image preprocessing, with a new figure and new text:</p><p>Methods: “To compare between natural image and psychophysical analyses, we scale the set of 9 standard deviations extracted from a given image analysis by a multiplicative factor that minimizes the squared error between the set of 9 standard deviations and the set of 9 psychophysical sensitivities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> shows the value of the scale factor for different choices of the block-average factor N and patch size R.”</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>. Scaling of natural image analyses. We scale each image analysis by a single scale factor that minimizes the squared error between the set of 9 standard deviations and the set of 9 psychophysical sensitivities. The scale factors are shown here as a function of block-average factor N for different choices of the patch size R. We find that the variance of image statistics decreases with increasing values of N, and thus larger values of N require a larger scale factor. Similarly, for a given value of N, the variance of image statistics increases with increasing R, and thus larger values of R require a larger scale factor.</p><p><italic>8) I’d welcome it if the authors could spell out the Null-hypothesis for their significance tests, rather than saying what they did mechanistically (”coordinate labels independently shuffled”).</italic></p><p>We now do this within the main text by replacing the mechanistic description of the significance tests with a description of each null hypothesis:</p><p>Results: “This value ranges from 0.987 to 0.999 across image analyses and was consistently larger than the value measured under the null hypothesis that the apparent correspondence be- tween statistics and sensitivities is chance (p ≤ 0.0003 for each image analysis; see Methods, Permutation tests, for details regarding statistical tests).”</p><p>Results: “This value, averaged across coordinate planes, ranges from 0.953 to 0.977 across image analyses. We compared this correspondence to that obtained under the null hypotheses that either (i) the apparent correspondence between image statistic covariances and isodiscrimination contours is chance, or (ii) the apparent covariances in image statistics are due to chance. The observed correspondence is much greater than the value measured under either null hypothesis (p ≤ 0.0003 for each image analysis under both hypotheses; see Methods, Analysis of image statistics in pairwise coordinate planes, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> for comparisons of eccentricity and tilt, and Methods, Permutation tests, for statistical tests).”</p><p>We also made corresponding additions to Methods, Permutation tests, in order to supplement the mechanistic description of the significance tests with the full descriptions of the null hypotheses.</p><p><italic>9) Discussion: “Cortical mechanisms should be...”: This is in clear contradiction to the behaviorally relevant argument elsewhere in the paper. Very variable features may be behaviorally relevant demanding cortical resources, or they may not be asking for them to be factored/normalized out (e.g. overall brightness). The theoretical framework is all about maximizing information with respect to the inputs, not with respect to behaviorally relevant outputs</italic>.</p><p>We agree, this sentence did not properly explain our ideas. We rewrote this section as follows:</p><p>Discussion: “How should neural mechanisms be distributed to represent a diverse set of informative sensory features? We argued that, when performance requires inferences limited by sampling of the statistics of input features, resources should be devoted in proportion to feature variability. A basic idea here is that features that range over a wider range of possible values are less predictable, and will better distinguish between contexts in the face of input noise. We used this hypothesis to successfully predict...”</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p><italic>The authors demonstrate that the level of variability in various local, multi-point statistics in natural scenes quantitatively predicts the relative salience of these statistics. I find their data largely convincing, and I feel that this is an important question and that the authors are careful and creative in their approach here. However, I have several concerns, which I suspect in part reflect my own ignorance or misunderstanding about the present paper and past work by these authors</italic>.</p><p><italic>First, I am not clear on what is qualitatively new here beyond what was shown in the nice 2010 PNAS paper by several of the same authors. I</italic> can <italic>see that some of the details of their analyses are different, and the comparisons here are more quantitative, but it seems to me that the main ideas and conclusions were already in place in the previous work</italic>.</p><p>Briefly, the previous work (Tkačik et al., 2010) demonstrated a close relationship between which image statistics are analyzed by the visual system, and the statistics of natural images: resources are devoted to image statistics that cannot be predicted from simpler ones (Tkačik et al., 2010). Here, we build on this, and examine allocation of resources within this identified set of informative images. The previous work made no attempt to predict this allocation, and the current work is not applicable to image statistics that are uninformative (the distinction made in the previous work).</p><p>Previous work considered natural scene statistics defined based on local correlations defined over different spatial configurations of pixels. It demonstrated that these statistics can be divided into two groups, informative and uninformative. Informative features – higher-order statistics whose value cannot be deduced from lower-order statistics – are encoded, while uninformative features are not. Indeed, the visual system would be wasteful if it were to invest in mechanisms to encode uninformative statistics, and evidence from Tkačik et al. (2010) suggests that this does not happen. This advance was crucial; as one looks at high-order statistics, there is an exponential explosion of correlations that we (or the brain) could compute. Tkačik et al. (2010) showed that it only makes sense to focus on ones that are informative, and that “informativeness” can be determined from natural scenes alone.</p><p>The current manuscript takes this finding as a starting point for exploring the relative allocation of resources to encoding the set of nine informative statistics defined by the 2 × 2 square glider. Unlike Tkačik et al. (2010), which simply identified this set of statistics as informative, here we make and confirm dozens of quantitative predictions concerning how resources are allocated to encode them. The fact that an application of the efficient coding principle is successful in characterizing resource allocation is by no means a straightforward consequence of Tkačik et al. (2010), as any allocation of resources within this parameter set would have been consistent with those previous results.</p><p>To clarify this distinction, we have schematized the existence of informative vs uninformative features in a newly-added figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and in the associated text. We note that the existence of uninformative statistics was the focus of previous work, and we note that the present work focuses on the optimal allocation of resources among those statistics that are informative:</p><p>Results: “Successive stages of sensory processing share the same broad goals: invest resources in encoding stimulus features that are sufficiently informative, and suppress less-informative ones. In the periphery, this is exemplified by the well-known suppression of very low spatial frequencies; in cortex, this is exemplified by insensitivity to high-order correlations that are predictable from lower-order ones. Previous work has shown that such higher-order correlations can be separated into two groups – informative and uninformative – and only the informative ones are encoded (Tkačik et al., 2010). We used this finding to select an informative subspace for the present study, and we asked how should resources should be efficiently allocated amongst features within this informative subspace.”</p><p><italic>The authors pitch their results in terms of cortical processing, but the only data presented are from human psychophysics, used here as a proxy for cortical processing. The authors give arguments for why salience strongly reflects cortical processing. But I feel that the claims about cortical processing are stated too strongly in some parts of the paper given that they do not directly measure cortical activity nor perform any manipulations to cortex, for example</italic>.</p><p>We rewrote this section, acknowledging that the inference is indirect and explicitly stating that we did not record cortical responses. But we do feel that the evidence that psychophysical performance reflects cortical processing is compelling, as it is based on independent lines of evidence that, individually, are strong: briefly, stimuli are many times above contrast and resolution thresholds; task performance requires pooling over wide areas; the computations required for the task are more complex than what is considered to occur in the retina; and physiologic recordings show that neural responses to high-order correlations are not present in the thalamus, but are present in visual cortex, and much more so in V2 than in V1.</p><p>Specifically, we state:</p><p>Results: “Although we did not record cortical responses directly, several lines of evidence indicate that that the perceptual thresholds we measured are determined by cortical processes. […] Conversely, macaque visual cortical neurons (Purpura et al., 1994), especially those in V2, manifest responses to three- and four-point correlations (Yu et al., 2013).”</p><p>Because this evidence is admittedly indirect, we added the modifier “likely” to the subheader for this section, to read “Perceptual salience of multi-point correlations likely arises in cortex.”</p><p><italic>It seems to me that the dichotomy set up by the authors between predictions for peripheral and central processing is somewhat overstated. For example, in the final sentence of the Abstract, they state that the efficient coding hypothesis applies in “a different guise” and makes “different predictions” for the central nervous system than the periphery. They predict that sensitivity in the CNS should be greater for highly variable stimuli, but it is not clear to me that this is not one of the predictions one would make for peripheral sensory neurons using this principle</italic>.</p><p>We see how a ‘dichotomy’ is an oversimplification, and a fairer description is that of two qualitatively different regimes (“whitening” and input-noise limiting) depending on the relative strengths of input and output noise.</p><p>As mentioned in our response to Reviewer 1, we clarified our language throughout the Discussion to emphasize that the efficient coding regimes are a general feature of information optimization, and neither regime is a priori restricted to peripheral vs central processing. Thus, even in sensory periphery, there might exist special regimes when the signal is input-noise dominated. The best known example is perhaps that of night vision, when photon shot noise is no longer negligible and qualitatively reshapes peripheral information processing. Instead of decorrelation by center-surround receptive fields, receptive fields averaging the signal, i.e., they apply gain that enhances the correlations already present in the input in order to fight the detrimental effects of input noise. These special considerations, which are relevant for night vision, do not apply generally to the extensively-studied area of daylight vision.</p><p>We would like to emphasize clearly that the constraints considered here (nonlinear image features subject to sampling noise) thus differ from those considered by some of the most successful applications of efficient coding in the periphery. Because of these constraints, our finding that sensitivity increases with signal variability differs qualitatively from the findings of these studies, where whitening is optimal (or near optimal, see Doi and Lewicki (2014)) and sensitivity decreases with signal variability. Moreover, since feature extraction is thought to be one of the main tasks of central vision, the sampling noise constraint is likely to represent a general aspect of cortical processing, rather than a special case as for night vision in the periphery.</p><p>In addition to changes in the text, we have added a fourth figure that illustrates these two regimes in a simple parallel-channel model. As an illustration of the regime in which output noise dominates, we discuss the well-known suppression of low spatial frequencies (Discussion). We then hypothesize that the other regime (input noise dominating) is relevant for central processing (Discussion). We discuss the specific application of efficient coding in this context, which differs from an application in the sensory periphery. Here, we apply efficient coding to complex nonlinear features (counts of glider colorings), where sampling fluctuations in glider counts provide a source of input noise.</p><p>We removed language that dichotomizes peripheral vs central processing, such as “it applies in a different guise and makes different predictions” (formerly the final sentence of the Abstract). Instead, we call upon the previous successes of efficient coding in the periphery in order to highlight one particular regime of efficient coding (whitening), and we use these examples to contrast the qualitative findings of our study.</p><p><italic>What was the exact task being performed by the subjects?</italic></p><p>We added the following clarification about the psychophysical task, and we refer the reader to Methods, Psychophysical methods, for additional details:</p><p>Results: “To characterize perceptual sensitivity to different statistics, we isolated them in synthetic visual images and used a figure/ground segmentation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We used a four-alternative forced-choice task in which stimuli consisted of a textured target and a binary noise background (or vice-versa). Each stimulus was presented for 120ms and was followed by a noise mask. Subjects were then asked to identify the spatial location (top, bottom, left, or right) of the target. Experiments were carried out for synthetic stimuli in which the target or back- ground was defined by varying image statistic coordinates independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows examples of gamuts from which stimuli are built).”</p><p><italic>What would</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic>E</xref> <italic>look like for IId samples from white (or colored) noise?</italic></p><p>When natural images are replaced with white noise, the variation is identical across individual image statistics. (The same is true for colored noise, since our processing pipeline includes whitening.) While this is mathematically guaranteed, it may not be obvious, and we agree that showing it is helpful. We now include a sentence within the main manuscript:</p><p>Results: “Interestingly, third-order correlations are the least variable across image patches. An analogous analysis performed on white noise yields a flat distribution with considerably smaller standard deviation values (See Methods, Analysis variants for Penn Natural Image Database, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref> for comparison). These (and subsequent) findings are preserved across different choices of image analysis parameters...”</p><p>We have also included an additional Figure in Methods, Analysis variants for Penn Natural Image Database that illustrates this comparison, along with a corresponding addition to the text:</p><p>Methods “In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>, we show that the relative variation in different image statistics (first shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) is not an artifact of our image analysis pipeline, as the pattern of variation is destroyed if white-noise image patches are instead used.”</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>. Image statistics along single coordinate axes for white-noise patches. The robustly observed statistical structure of natural scenes (open circles) is completely absent from the same analysis performed on samples of white noise (shaded circles). The inset shows that this holds across analysis parameters.</p><p><italic>How do the results change for images pixelated along a grid that is 45 degrees tilted relative to the vertical and horizontal directions?</italic></p><p>Of course we predict that there would still be a close correspondence between image statistics and psychophysics. But testing this; and doing so in a way that accurately isolates what would likely be a subtle effect of the grid rotation, is unfortunately not practical. Re-photographing the images with an oblique sensor would be required to avoid the artifacts that would arise from digital rotation and resampling. Collecting a parallel set of psychophysical data would require approximately 200,000 additional psychophysical judgments (the better part of a year at a humane pace). We hope the reviewer understands.</p><p><italic>Related to this, could the√2 differences in the degree of variation for the vertical/horizontal and diagonal beta data points in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic>A</xref> <italic>be due to the difference in the distance between the points in question given the orientation of the pixelation grid?</italic></p><p>It is an interesting observation, but there is more going on than just a difference in center points: for vertical/horizontal two-point sensitivities, the checks involved share a common edge, while for the diagonal case, they only share a corner. Conversely, other experiments show that increasing the spacing between</p><p>checks (in either the cardinal or diagonal directions) has very little effect on the sensitivities, over a fivefold range including the range used here (Conte et al., 2014). So we think that the finding that the √ 2 is likely to be a coincidence. We’d therefore prefer not to mention this point, ratio is approximately as mentioning it but then describing the above evidence would likely be viewed as a distraction.</p><p>But we do now emphasize that the diagonal and cardinal directions differ by configuration and not just orientation, so that it is clear that the difference in sensitivities is not simply an “oblique effect.” We have clarified this with the following addition to the main text:</p><p>Results: “Note that the difference between the sensitivities in the horizontal and vertical directions (β− and β|) vs the diagonal directions (β\ and β/) is not simply an “oblique effect”, i.e., a greater sensitivity cardinally- vs obliquely-oriented contours (Campbell et al., 1966). Horizontal and vertical pairwise correlations differ from the diagonal pairwise correlations in more than just orientation: checks involved in horizontal and vertical pairwise correlations share an edge, while checks involved in diagonal pairwise correlations only share a corner. Correspondingly, the difference in sensitivities for horizontal and vertical correlations vs diagonal correlations is approximately 50%, which is much larger than the size of the classical oblique effect (10–20%, see Campbell et al. (1966)).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
