We developed an in vivo genetic model to study the role of enhancers in RME using high-resolution single-cell analysis of natural killer (NK) cell receptor gene expression and enhancer deletions in the mouse germline. Enhancers of the RME NK receptor genes were accessible and enriched in H3K27ac on silent and active alleles alike in cells sorted according to allelic expression status, suggesting enhancer activation and gene expression status can be decoupled. In genes with multiple enhancers, enhancer deletion reduced gene expression frequency, in one instance converting the universally expressed gene encoding NKG2D into an RME gene, recapitulating all aspects of natural RME including mitotic stability of both the active and silent states. The results support the binary model of enhancer action, and suggest that RME is a consequence of general properties of gene regulation by enhancers rather than an RME-specific epigenetic program. Therefore, many and perhaps all genes may be subject to some degree of RME. Surprisingly, this was borne out by analysis of several genes that define different major hematopoietic lineages, that were previously thought to be universally expressed within those lineages: the genes encoding NKG2D, CD45, CD8Î±, and Thy-1. We propose that intrinsically probabilistic gene allele regulation is a general property of enhancer-controlled gene expression, with previously documented RME representing an extreme on a broad continuum.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Monoallelic</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>Ly49</kwd><kwd>NKG2D</kwd><kwd>Enhancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI113041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raulet</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program of NIH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muljo</surname><given-names>Stefan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE 1752814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>Natalie K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research Coordinating Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kissiov</surname><given-names>Djem U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIAID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muljo</surname><given-names>Stefan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evidence that enhancer strength determines the extent of random monoallelic gene expression, and that even lineage defining genes thought to be expressed by all cells in a lineage display some degree of random monoallelic expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most cases, both alleles of autosomal genes are co-expressed. In recent years random monoallelic expression (RME) has emerged as an important exception that may apply to ~0.5â10% of expressed genes in a given tissue and has been characterized as the autosomal analog of X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gendrel et al., 2016</xref>). In RME, different cells of a given type express only one allele, both or neither, and this expression pattern is mitotically stable. Notably, RME genes do not share an overarching unifying feature or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eckersley-Maslin and Spector, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gendrel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reinius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), and the biological role for RME is in most cases not known. RME is distinct from X-inactivation, genomic imprinting, and allelic exclusion of antigen receptor and odorant receptor genes, in that biallelic expression occurs at an appreciable frequency, and expression is largely stochastic rather than imposed by strict feedback regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gendrel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The molecular determinants of RME are poorly understood, in part because of difficulties analyzing single primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reinius and Sandberg, 2015</xref>). Chromatin analysis of RME alleles in primary populations has not been possible due to the difficulty of isolating pure cell populations ex vivo with defined RME expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gendrel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, previous analyses have been limited to clonal cell lines derived from F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, where allelic expression is known and clonally stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gendrel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin-Klein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). These analyses revealed that enhancers of RME genes are constitutively accessible irrespective of gene or allelic expression status, whereas promoters are accessible only at active alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin-Klein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, promoter accessibility, rather than enhancer opening and activation, might be the âgatekeeperâ of RME, whereas enhancers, being constitutively open, were proposed to permit rather than impose expression of RME alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Enhancers may play more than a permissive role in RME, however, in light of evidence that enhancers primarily influence the probability of mitotically stable expression, rather than the amount of expression per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walters et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weintraub, 1988</xref>). In fact, deletions of enhancers resulted in mitotically stable gene variegation in both cell lines and normal tissuesânotably <italic>Igh</italic> in B cell hybridomas and <italic>Cd8a</italic> in primary thymocytes, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garefalaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ronai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sleckman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walters et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weintraub, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 1996</xref>). Collectively, these data support the binary or âon/offâ model of enhancer action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blackwood and Kadonaga, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiering et al., 2000</xref>), where an increase in enhancer activity at a genetic locus results in an increase in the <italic>probability</italic> of gene expression, rather than an increase in expression per cell. Conversely, weak or reduced enhancer activity results in a lower likelihood of expression, but the cells that express the gene express a similar amount of gene product.</p><p>We reasoned that the binary action of enhancersâwhen limitingâmight be a driving principle of RME, and sought to test this in examples of RME with a clear biological purpose: the <italic>Klra</italic> genes (which encode the Ly49 family receptors) and the <italic>Klrc1</italic> gene (which encodes the NKG2A receptor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chess, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eckersley-Maslin and Spector, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gendrel et al., 2016</xref>). These genes, clustered in a ~ 1 Mb stretch of the NK gene complex (NKC) on chromosome 6 in mice, encode cell surface receptors expressed by NK cells that bind MHC I molecules. They are expressed in a variegated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raulet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yokoyama et al., 1990</xref>), monoallelic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 1995</xref>), stochastic and largely mitotically stable fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raulet et al., 2001</xref>), resulting in subpopulations of NK cells that express random combinations of the receptors and consequently exhibit distinct reactivities for cells expressing different MHC I molecules. Regulation of each gene allele is independent, and expression of one <italic>Klra</italic> gene has minimal effects on expression of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanamachi et al., 2001</xref>). While a clear biological purpose for RME at many genes is lacking, RME at <italic>Klra</italic> genes underlies the basis of the âmissing selfâ mode of NK cell target recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">KÃ¤rre et al., 1986</xref>). Furthermore, the system represents a powerful in vivo genetic model of RME, where allelic expression states can be easily assessed at the population level in primary cells using allele-specific antibodies that we and others previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanamachi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vance et al., 2002</xref>), circumventing previous technical limitations to studying RME in single primary cells.</p><p>Importantly, competition between <italic>Klra</italic> genes for interaction with a shared enhancer or locus control region is not required for variegation of <italic>Klra</italic> genes, as a <italic>Klra1</italic> (encodes Ly49A) genomic transgene ectopically integrated in different genomic sites was usually expressed with a frequency similar to that of the native <italic>Klra1</italic> gene (~17% of NK cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanamachi et al., 2004</xref>). We previously identified a key DNase I hypersensitive element, <italic>Klra1<sub>Hss1</sub></italic>, ~ 5 kb upstream of the <italic>Klra1</italic> gene that is conserved in other <italic>Klra</italic> genes and required for expression of the <italic>Klra1</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanamachi et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our central hypothesis is that enhancers, rather than simply being permissive for RME, both limit and directly control the probability of expression of <italic>Klra</italic> genesâand RME alleles generallyâin a stochastic and binary fashion. Binary enhancer action, when limiting, may represent a causal mechanism of RME, explaining the pervasiveness of RME across genes and cell types. We have carried out genetic dissection and population analyses to demonstrate that enhancers control the probability of allelic expression and have provided a more general model of the role of enhancers in RME as well as in other developmentally regulated genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elements upstream of the <italic>Klra</italic>, <italic>Klrc</italic>, and <italic>Klrk</italic> family genes are transcriptional enhancers with activity in mature NK cells</title><p><italic>Klra</italic> family genes are expressed in a mitotically stable RME fashion by NK cells.

Recent analysis of <italic>Klra</italic> gene expression in cell lines suggested instead that the <italic>Klra<sub>Hss1</sub></italic> elements are transcriptional enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gays et al., 2015</xref>), and that the Hss1 transcripts represent enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Those conclusions were in turn contested in a subsequent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCullen et al., 2016</xref>). To address this issue in vivo, we analyzed chromatin features associated with the Hss1 elements in primary NK cells with published ChIP-seq data generated in mature primary splenic NK cells, using the H3K4me1:me3 ratio as an indicator of regulatory element identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>). The Hss1 and 5â²E elements are all enriched in H3K4me1 relative to H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating enhancer identity. The putative NK receptor gene enhancers all ranked in the top 32% of ATAC-seq accessible peaks with respect to the H3K4me1:me3 ratio. In contrast, known promoters of the respective genes ranked in the bottom 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In a deeper analysis, we independently defined enhancers and promoters in mature NK cells. NK cell promoters were defined as previously annotated mouse promoters from the EDPNew database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dreos et al., 2017</xref>) enriched in H3K27ac in NK cells, and enhancers were defined as ATAC-seq peaks bound by the p300 histone acetyltransferase that do not overlap with the promoter list. Enhancers defined in this manner were highly skewed to high H3K4me1:me3 ratios, and promoters to low ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). All Hss1 and 5â²E elements were classified as enhancers based on the p300-bound enhancer dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Editing efficiencies of NK cells were lower than that of T cells, resulting in only 30% or fewer cells with disruption of the control <italic>Ptprc</italic> locus encoding CD45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Targeting <italic>Klrc1<sub>5â²E</sub></italic> increased the percentage of NKG2A<sup>B6</sup>-negative cells from ~10% to ~20%â40%.

This lack of concordance raised the possibility that these enhancers were similarly active and occupied by TFs upstream of both silent and active alleles, as has been observed for RME genes genome-wide in F<sub>1</sub> clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin-Klein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>).

While the cells expressing both alleles and those expressing only the B6 allele are closely juxtaposed in the cytometry plots, post sort analysis demonstrated that they could be efficiently separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with previously published data where allelic expression was confirmed by mRNA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rogers et al., 2006</xref>). SNPsplit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krueger and Andrews, 2016</xref>) analysis of reads demonstrated that the enhancer element <italic>Klrc1<sub>5â²E</sub></italic> was accessible on both active and inactive alleles in all four populations, whereas the <italic>Klrc1</italic> promoter was accessible only at active alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Importantly, this analysis further validated the NK receptor genes as a model for RME. While initially surprising, the decoupling of enhancer and promoter accessibility seen at NK receptor genes and other RME loci is consistent with a binary model of enhancer action, where enhancer activation occurs in all cells of a given type and acts stochastically to raise the binary âon or offâ probability of gene expression, rather than regulate the per-cell amount of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blackwood and Kadonaga, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walters et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>We extended these observations by analyzing the pattern of active enhancer associated marks at silent and active alleles of <italic>Klra7</italic> (which encodes Ly49G2).

The <italic>Ptprc<sup>a</sup></italic> allele<italic>,</italic> encoding CD45.1, and the <italic>Ptprc<sup>b</sup></italic> allele, encoding CD45.2, are easily discriminated by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies in congenic mice. Heterozygous B6<italic>-Ptprc<sup>a/b</sup></italic> mice are expected to express both alleles on all B or T cells, but we were able to detect clearly defined, albeit very rare (~0.01%) subpopulations of B or T cells expressing only one allele or the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>). The monoallelic cells exhibited similar staining intensity as homozygous B6<italic>-Ptprc<sup>a/a</sup></italic> and B6<italic>-Ptprbc<sup>b/b</sup></italic> cells analyzed in parallel.

Sanger sequencing of reverse-transcribed and amplified RNA isolated from the expanded cells displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> revealed that the monoallelic populations expressed only the allele detected by cell surface staining, demonstrating that the rare observed RME of <italic>Ptprc</italic> reflected transcriptional differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). These data argued strongly against the possibility that the monoallelic cells arose due to somatic mutations in one or the other <italic>Ptprc</italic> allele, since most such mutations would not be predicted to disrupt transcription.</p><p>Expression of <italic>Cd8a</italic> defines the cytotoxic lineage of T cells. Similar analysis of <italic>Cd8a</italic> for RME employed allele-specific CD8Î± antibodies. For <italic>Cd8a</italic>, we gated on cells expressing CD8Î², the partner chain of CD8Î±. In (B6 x CBA)F<sub>1</sub> mice, approximately 0.1% of CD8Î²+ cells lacked one or the other of the CD8Î± alleles, CD8.1 or CD8.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2D, E</xref>). Sorted single positive cells that retained expression of CD8Î² after stimulation and expansion retained expression of the initially selected allele of CD8Î±, demonstrating mitotically stable RME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Finally, analysis of <italic>Thy1,</italic> a marker of T cells in mice, also employed allele-specific antibodies to discriminate the allelic Thy-1.1 and Thy-1.2 proteins, expressed by AKR and B6 strains, respectively. In (B6 x AKR)F<sub>1</sub> hybrids ~5% of CD4+ T cells expressed only one allele or the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2F, G</xref>). Again, the monoallelic populations displayed an impressive degree of mitotic stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Hence, <italic>Thy1</italic> represents an RME gene with a remarkably high allelic failure rate. Notably, the <italic>Thy1</italic> promoter contains a CpG island, indicating that the RME we identifiy in lineage-defining genes is not restricted to promoters with low CpG content. In conclusion, RME was detectable for all four genes we examined, all of which were previously considered to be expressed in all cells of the lineages analyzed.</p><p>These findings supported the notion that RME is characteristic of many genes and is a natural consequence of enhancer-promoter interactions, rather than a specialized form of gene expression. We quantified allelic failure rates of the various genes examined in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2H</xref>). We propose that in the absence of selection for biallelic expression, most genes exist along a continuum of allelic failure rates, and that RME and ânon-RMEâ genes differ quantitatively with respect to allelic failure rates rather than qualitatively with respect to dedicated, RME-specific regulatory programs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>Klra1<sub>Hss1</sub></italic> element was previously reported to be a âswitchâ element active only in immature, Ly49-negative NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saleh et al., 2004</xref>). Our extensive analysis herein demonstrated that Hss1 displays properties of enhancers in mature cells, consistent with the conclusions of others based on reporter analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gays et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the loss of Ly49G2 expression after deletion of <italic>Klra7<sub>Hss1</sub></italic> that we have documented in mature Ly49G2+ cells is inconsistent with a solely developmental role of Hss1, and further supports its enhancer identity in mature NK cells. Finally, our results showed that variegation arises and is modulated by enhancer deletion (including <italic>Klra7<sub>Hss5</sub></italic> and <italic>Klrk1<sub>5â²E</sub></italic>) rather than introduction of variegating switch elements.</p><p>The main significance of our results is to link RME with the binary model of enhancer action, placing previous observations of enhancer deletion-associated variegation in the context of the pervasive and naturally-occurring RME phenomenon. Remarkably, deletion of an enhancer upstream of the <italic>Klrk1</italic> gene imparted an RME expression pattern that fully recapitulated the stochasticity, mitotic stability and promoter accessibility features of naturally variegated NK receptor genes. In this instance, enhancer-like elements downstream of <italic>Klrk1</italic> may suffice to impart the lower frequency of expression. The striking commonalities of enhancer deletion variegation and natural variegation of NK receptor genes and other RME genes argues that RME is an extreme manifestation of the inherent probablistic nature of stable gene activation rather than a specialized mechanism to impose a variegated expression pattern.</p><p>The data also reveal the quantitative impact of enhancer strength on allelic expression frequencies. Deletion of <italic>Klra7<sub>Hss5</sub></italic>, a relatively minor and constitutively accessible enhancer, reduced the frequency of expression of <italic>Klra7</italic>, a natural RME gene, directly tying the enhancer deletion-associated variegation phenomenon to RME. This result powerfully argues that enhancers are not simply permissive for expression at RME genes, but are also instructive regarding expression probability. We hypothesize that the broad range of frequencies with which different <italic>Klra</italic> genes are naturally expressed (~5â60%) in large part reflects differences in enhancer strength. Probabilistic enhancer action has also been documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where regulation of the gap genes by multiple enhancers has been suggested to ensure a high probability of gene expression, and removal of one of multiple enhancers was shown to increase gene âfailure rateâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). We propose that the binary decision to express a gene is regulated by quantitatively varying enhancer activity, which is comprised of both the number of enhancers acting upon a gene and the strength of individual enhancers within that set. Our results are consistent with recent findings that enhancers are probabilistic regulators of transcription burst frequency rather than burst size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larsson et al., 2019</xref>). How enhancer control of the probability of stable gene expression interfaces with the control of transcription burst frequency is an exciting area for future investigation.</p><p>Our data showing RME of the lineage-defining <italic>Klrk1</italic>, <italic>Ptprc</italic>, <italic>Cd8a,</italic> and <italic>Thy1</italic> genes support the generality of probabilistic gene expression, and suggest that RME is even more prevalent than the previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gendrel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nag et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reinius et al., 2016</xref>). Although RME has been associated previously with poorly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gendrel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reinius et al., 2016</xref>), our results extend the phenomenon to relatively highly expressed genes. We propose that genes lie along a spectrum of allelic failure rates that are largely controlled by enhancer strength, with documented RME genes on the highest end of that spectrum. RME applies to genes encoding cell surface receptors (<italic>Klra</italic>, <italic>Klrc1</italic>, <italic>Klrk1</italic> etc.) and to a gene encoding a transcription factor, Bc11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ng et al., 2018</xref>). It applies as well to CpG poor promoters (the aforementioned receptor genes) and to genes that harbor promoter proximal CpG islands (<italic>Thy1</italic> and the gene encoding Bcl11b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ng et al., 2018</xref>). High-resolution genome-wide approaches will eventually provide a comprehensive picture of the full extent of RME.</p><p>We predict that the mechanism of mitotic stability of active and silent RME alleles is likely related to maintenance of gene expression states broadly, and may involve bookmarking of promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), rather than repressive chromatin at silent alleles. Indeed, we found that expressed and silent <italic>Klra7</italic> alleles are distinguished only by the presence of active marks at the promoters and gene bodies of active alleles. Enhancers are constitutively accessible and activated on expressed and silent alleles alike, consistent with the decoupling of enhancer and promoter accessibility seen at RME loci generally. The absence of a repressive chromatin state on silent NK receptor alleles suggests that the RME âoff stateâ can reflect a stably inactive, as opposed to repressed, chromatin state. Numerous lineage non-specific genes that are also silent in NK cells (e.g. <italic>Cd19</italic>, <italic>Cd3e</italic>) also lacked traditional repressive chromatin modifications, yet are generally not subject to subsequent activation after an initial failure to be activated. In the case of the NK receptor genes and RME genes broadly it appears that the inactive state is maintained in mature cells in spite of continued enhancer activation, suggesting silent promoters are no longer competent for activationâperhaps due to lack of critical promoter-activating pioneer factor activity or reduced nucleosome remodeling or âpromoter openingâ capacity that is only present at sufficient levels for developmentally regulated gene activation during differentiation. The relevant biochemical activity is likely a property of general rather than gene-specific factors, given the apparent pervasiveness of RME even among lineage-defining genes.</p><p>The results, in concert with previous studies, provide strong evidence that the principles underlying enhancer deletion-associated variegation and RME are broadly applicable to the regulation of many if not all genes. A possible mechanistic explanation of the probabilistic nature of gene expression in RME is that the initially inactive promoters present an energetic threshold that must be overcome to stably activate gene expression, and that enhancer strength determines the probability of overcoming this threshold. Once overcome, the active state is largely stable even in the absense of the initial signal or enzymatic activity, which may be restricted to a cellular differentiation window. The energy barrier may be due to the initially chromatinized state of the promoter and the energy required for nucleosome remodeling of promoters. It may be this property that is the measure of âenhancer strengthâ, that is, the capacity of the enhancer to overcome the energy threshold presented by the promoter within a limited window during differentiation. The number of enhancer elements in a gene, the availability of relevant transcription factors that bind the enhancers and the affinity with which the enhancer binds the factors are all likely relevant in determining enhancer strength. It remains possible that in some cases of RME, additional modifications of the promoter may contribute to the energy barrier as well.</p><p>Differential DNA methylation of alleles is not broadly associated with all or even most RME genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">da Rocha and Gendrel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014</xref>), nor does it appear to be responsible for maintenance of silent alleles in the majority of tested RME genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eckersley-Maslin and Spector, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marion-Poll et al., 2021</xref>).

It is doubtful that DNA methylation is sufficient to maintain the silent state, however, since inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases failed to derepress inactive <italic>Klra</italic> or <italic>Klrc1</italic> genes in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rouhi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rouhi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rouhi et al., 2009</xref>), or other silent RME genes that were hypermethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eckersley-Maslin and Spector, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marion-Poll et al., 2021</xref>). In light of the collective data on DNA methylation and silent alleles in RME we suspect it is not generally causative in maintaining RME. Furthermore, the <italic>Klra</italic>, <italic>Klrc1,</italic> and <italic>Klrk1</italic> genes are all hypermethylated on both alleles in progenitor hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that demethylation is associated with gene activation as opposed to a model where alleles are randomly silenced by de novo DNA methylation. The possibility remains that for these genes, preexisting DNA methylation contributes to the energy barrier that must be overcome by enhancer action, and that demethylation accompanies de novo gene activation. DNA methylation is not a requisite feature of RME promoters, however, as many RME genes are hypomethylated on both alleles.</p><p>The RME of the NK receptor genes resembles the monoallelic expression pattern of cytokine genes including <italic>Il2, Il4, Il5, Il10,</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bix and Locksley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gendrel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelly and Locksley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">RiviÃ¨re et al., 1998</xref>). The cytokine genes are inducible in response to TCR stimulation and therefore expression is inherently unstable, but impressive stability over several mitotic divisions was observed for <italic>Il4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bix and Locksley, 1998</xref>), and the probability of <italic>Il4</italic> allelic activation and biallelic expression correlated with the strength of the inducing signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">RiviÃ¨re et al., 1998</xref>). Intriguingly, the <italic>Il4</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> genes are closely linked and are co-regulated by an enhancer, <italic>CNS1</italic>, that was found to be constitutively acetylated at histone H3, and thus permissive for expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>). Expression of the <italic>Il4</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> gene alleles was independent, however, in a manner strikingly similar to the NK receptor genes. It is probable that the general principles uncovered by us and others apply to genes that are induced via stimulation as well as genes whose expression is acquired during differentiation. Importantly, enhancer deletions have been observed to reduce the stochastic expression probabilities of the monoallelically expressed odorant receptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 2011</xref>) and trace amine-associated receptors of the olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fei et al., 2021</xref>). It therefore seems likely that the probabilistic nature of gene activation and binary model of enhancer-promotor communication accounts for the initial stochastic step across many or even all types, even if they might differ with respect to feedback and allelic exclusion mechanisms.</p><p>Apparently, RME often occurs at such a low rate that it is both beneath ready detection and presumably irrelevant for the function of a cell lineage. In the case of NK receptors, we propose that evolution has exploited RME to generate a complex combinatorial repertoire of NK cell specificities. More speculatively, by regulating expression of fate-determining mediators, RME may underlie stochastic cell fate decisions in some instances of cellular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ng et al., 2018</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective, appreciable RME of a gene could arise by mutation of strong enhancers of a precursor gene, by providing a new gene with a weak enhancer, or by diminishing the concentration of relevant enhancer-binding transcription factors in a given lineage of cells (as has been shown for several relevant TFs for the <italic>Klra</italic> genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ioannidis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohno et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results suggest that allelic failure rates may in some cases dwarf the rates of null alleles generated by somatic mutation. As a novel mechanism of genetic haploinsufficiency at the cellular level, RME might have broad implications in genetic disease etiology and penetrance of disease phenotypes in heterozygous individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and animal procedures</title><p>All mice were maintained at the University of California, Berkeley. <italic>Klrk1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are available at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX Stock No. 022733).

In order to differentiate between alleles of a receptor in (B6 x BALB/c)F<sub>1</sub> hybrid NK cells, the B6-specfic clone was used first in order to block epitopes in competition with the clone recognizing both alleles.

NK cell ATAC-seq peaks were called in the Ly49G2<sup>B6+BALB+</sup> NK cell ATAC-seq dataset using macs2 narrowpeaks. Before ranking, ATAC-seq peaks were filtered such that only peaks that fell within the top 95% of both H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 signal computed over a 2 kb window from the peak midpoint using pandas and numpy in Python 3.7.4, resulting in 51,650 usable peaks. H3K4me1:me3 raw ratio and log2 ratio bigwigs were generated with the bamCompare utility from deepTools (v2.5.4). The log2 ratio track was visualized on IGV, and the raw ratio was used to rank ATAC-seq peaks. Heatmaps were generated with the computeMatrix and plotHeatmap utilities from deepTools (v2.5.4). Heatmaps were sorted by the mean H3K4me1:me3 ratio signal over a 2 kb window centered at the midpoint of the 51,650 ATAC-seq peaks.

In order to do so, they initially focus on a limited set of natural killer (NK) receptor genes that are subject to RME, which they investigate using several in vivo genetic models. Furthermore, they show that RME can be considerably more prevalent than previously thought, applying to other gene function than receptors and independently of promoter CpG content. Finally, they provide evidence that enhancer strength and/or number might influence the extent of RME, by affecting the probability of promoter activation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anne-Valerie Gendrel (Reviewer #1); Alvaro Rada-Iglesias (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found the manuscript to be relevant, the data clearly presented and the main conclusions well supported by the data. They appreciated the usage of an impressive battery of mouse models, and recognized novel insights brought by this study, into how RME can be regulated and how enhancers can work in a binary manner controlling the probability rather than the level of gene expression. Two slight critics may be (1) the limited mechanistic insights the manuscript provides onto how enhances contribute to RME, and (2) whether the enhancer-RME process described here applies to other types of genes and other cell types, i.e. for genes that are rather CpG-rich than CpG-poor, that are not expressed in the hematopoietic lineage and that do not encode surface markers.</p><p>Please refer to the two points further expanded below to prepare your revisions, and please consult the detailed points raised by the reviewers, for further rephrasing of the manuscript and discussion in a point-by-point rebuttal.</p><p>1 â Provide additional analyses to investigate the nature of the promoters studied here, before making the claim that RME may be more widespread than originally thought. Using published data, it should be feasible to study these peculiar promoters for their CpG content, and motifs for transcription factor binding sites. In comparison, are genes with CpG-rich promoters also subject to RME and do enhancers influence RME at CpG-rich genes? Finally, although the authors suggest in the discussion that DNA methylation is unlikely to play a major role in RME, it is definitely worth investigating, as an attempt to explain the lack of enhancer-gene communication and also to link with a potential influence on RME extent. Promoters of active and inactive genes should be compared for their DNA methylation states, either using public datasets (if they exist) or using targeted PCR-based DNA methylation analysis.</p><p>2 â Moderate the tone regarding the claims that HSSs identified by ATAC-seq are definitely enhancers and not promoters (solely based on epigenomic profiling), provided that this topics is quite controversial in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are my specific comments and questions for the authors to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. Throughout the manuscript, mature NK, immature NK, primary NK, IL-2 expanded NK cells are mentioned in different instances. It is unclear whether this matters or not? Is this important for the expression of the different genes analysed? This should be clarified, especially for non-specialists in these lineages.</p><p>What is the stimulation of NK cells with IL-2 important for; is this for proliferation, for activity? Why are cells sometimes expanded with IL-2 and sometimes not?</p><p>2. How were the % of expression frequencies on Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A calculated?</p><p>3. There is no ATAC-seq peak visible for the promoter of the Ly49a gene (Figure 1A, Figure 3A, Figure 4A), unlike for the other genes of the cluster. Could the authors please comment on this? DoesnÂ´t this argue against the claim that HSS1 is an enhancer and not a promoter?</p><p>4. On the FACS plot on Figure 2A, it is difficult to distinguish the population of cells expressing the B6 allele only from both alleles. It would help to draw a circle around each cell populations that were selected for the sorting and further analysed for ATAC-seq. Moreover, was there a control of populations after sorting?</p><p>5. On Figure 2E, for the control mouse IgG2ak (cIgG) antibody in IL-2 expanded NK cells, there is no ATAC-seq peak at the enhancer (nor CUT&amp;RUN signal). Shouldn't an ATAC-seq peak at the enhancer expected in this population too? Isn't it similar to cells expressing neither alleles?</p><p>6. On Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C and F. Isn't there a slight increase in the % of cells expressing the BALB only allele in heterozygous F1 mice for both Ly49a and Nkg2a?</p><p>7. On lines 344-345, the authors say: &quot;the corresponding region of the highly related Ly49a gene, which is expressed by only ~17% of NK cells, is much less accessible and presumably less active (Figure 4A)&quot;. How is the level of accessibility seen/observed? This is not clear to me.</p><p>8. Figure 4E â similar to comment #4, isn't the % of cells expressing the BALB allele only increased? â¦which would be indicative of a slight dosage compensation mechanism?</p><p>9. The possible role of the HSS5 enhancer in increasing the expression probability/frequency of the Ly49g gene in NK cells is appealing. Given the similarity between the Ly49a and Ly49g loci regarding the HSS1 enhancer, would it be possible to test this by introducing the HSS5 element upstream of the Ly49a gene to see whether this would increase the probability/frequency of Ly49a expression? (maybe using a transgene construct, not necessarily a knockin).</p><p>10. Line 442; there is no introduction for the knockout model of Nkg2d. What is the KO allele exactly? What is deleted: promoter, exons, whole locus?</p><p>11. Line 464; The authors mention the 3'enhancer for the Nkg2d gene. Could they speculate on its function?</p><p>12. Line 573-575; the following sentence is not clear to me: &quot;Importantly, NKG2D- cells in both Nkg2d5'ED/5'ED and Nkg2d+/- mice were as likely to express NKG2A, Ly49G2 or Ly49I as NKG2D+ cells, suggesting stochastic expression of the WT Nkg2d allele (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1, A-C).&quot; Could the authors please clarify?</p><p>13. The following two important points remain unanswered in this study and could be discussed further in the discussion part of the manuscript:</p><p>a â What define the strength of an enhancer for the Ly49 and Nkg2 genes. What is the difference between a weak and a strong enhancer? Related to the binding of specific transcription/chromatin factors? Level of enrichment of specific histone marks? 3D conformation?</p><p>b â Could this model apply to chromatin or nuclear factors, expressed in other cell lineages than the hematopoietic lineage?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found the manuscript highly relevant and the main conclusions are well supported by the presented data. However, there are some aspects that could be modified and/or expanded in order to improve the overall relevance of the work:</p><p>My main concern is that, as presented, the work strongly suggest that enhancers play an important and instructive work in RME. However, there are limited insights into the molecular mechanisms behind such an instructive role. Given that the promoter but not the enhancer chromatin state correlates with RME, I think the authors should explore more how enhancer-gene communication might be altered in expressing and non-expressing alleles. Since the investigated enhancers are quite proximal to the target gene promoters, investigating topological aspects of enhancer-gene communication can be technically quite challenging. Moreover, it is highly intriguing that in alleles subject to RME the promoters stably lose their responsiveness to proximal active enhancers. In this regard, I have a few suggestions:</p><p>â Although H3K27ac is strongly associated with active enhancers, it can be uncoupled from expression of the target genes (Pachano et al., 2021), while the production of eRNAs seems tope strongly coupled with mRNA expression (Kim et al., 2010; Hirabayashi et al., 2019). Therefore, I think it could be quite relevant to investigate eRNA levels at the investigated enhancers in the context of expressing and non-expressing alleles.</p><p>â As the authors clearly show, the promoters of the NK receptor genes do not acquire histone modifications associated with gene repression. This is not surprising given that, as the authors mention in the discussion, these promoters are CpG-poor. Inactive CpG-poor promoters do not typically show enrichment for these histone marks but display high DNA methylation levels instead, in contrast with CpG-rich promoters, which are typically hypomethylated regardless of whether they are active or not. Therefore, although the authors mention in the Discussion that DNA methylation is unlikely to play a major role in RME, I still think that it would be quite insightful to compare the DNA methylation levels of active and inactive promoters for example by traditional locus-specific bisulfite sequencing. Moreover, the authors could investigate whether their findings still apply to genes with CpG-rich promoters (are CpG-rich genes subject to RME? Do enhancers influence RME at CpG-rich genes?) and/ or, alternatively, introduce a CpG island into one of the NK receptor gene promoters.</p><p>â If the authors find clear differences in the DNA methylation status of active and inactive promoters, one possibility is that epigenetic heterogeneity at gene promoters might occur before enhancer activation and thus influence, together with enhancer strength, the extent of RME. The authors could investigate DNA methylation at promoter regions at earlier cellular states, which could represent a critical temporal window at which DNA demethylating agents could have an impact on RME.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1 â In the first section of the results, the authors test the idea that Ly49Hss and NKg25'E regulatory elements are enhancers rather than promoters in NK cells as previously suggested. A full demonstration of this is not provided since the data presented is essentially epigenetic features and ATAC-seq. The provided evidence does not for example demonstrate that Ly49Hss can not behave as promoters in immature cells as proposed before since no RNA data is shown in the article for NKR analyses.</p><p>2 â In the same section, based on epigenetic profiles and the relative amount of H3K4me1/3 and other predictive methods (ATAC, K27ac) the authors formally conclude on 'enhancer identity' (lines 186-187) and 'these findings provide definitive support for the conclusion that Ly49Hss1 and Nkg25'E elements represent enhancers' (lines 196-197). It is important to keep in mind that epigenomic features never demonstrate enhancer identity but rather suggest of putative enhancer features. Thus, the phrasing used here should be toned down.</p><p>3 â For all ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data shown, including examples the units should appear on the graphs as normalized equivalently to the read counts (for example in Figure 1B, Figure 1s2C and all the following). A table indicating all published and original data sets used with GSE numbers should be provided, including replicates used and sequencing depth. The presented novel data does not seem to have been submitted to GEO database. This should be done.</p><p>4 â If the model proposed by the authors is correct, it implies a level of stochasticity in promoter-enhancer dependent activation. Based on sequence elements (for example presence or absence of CpG islands), do the promoters of the NKR locus tend to be less constitutive? More generally how do the authors envision the critical parameters limiting promoter's action and their strong dependency to enhancer stochastic activation? These points could be discussed in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74204.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1 â Provide additional analyses to investigate the nature of the promoters studied here, before making the claim that RME may be more widespread than originally thought.

In summary, RME can be found at genes with both high and low CpG content (Eckersley-Maslin et al., <italic>Dev. Cell</italic> 2014 PMID: 24576421). As one example from our work, in Figure 7, we show random monoallelic expression of the <italic>Thy1</italic> gene, which is expressed by T cells and is widely regarded as a T cell âmarkerâ. As documented in the UCSC genome browser screenshot depicted in reviewer data, Figure 2 (embedded in the response to reviewer 2) the <italic>Thy1</italic> gene includes a CpG island at its promoter. Furthermore, the <italic>Bcl11b</italic> gene, which encodes a transcription factor that commits thymocytes to the T cell fate, contains a promoter CpG-island and was recently shown to be an RME gene and whose expression probability is further reduced by enhancer-deletion (Ng et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018 PMID: 30457103). Therefore, we do not believe there is reason to believe that our results are unique to a class of genes with respect to CpG density; rather, the RME phenomenon (as well as the enhancer deletion-associated variegation phenomenon) appears to apply across cell types and gene classes.</p><p>Concerning DNA methylation, we have extensively revised the manuscript to address this issue and will discuss this below in response to reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 â Moderate the tone regarding the claims that HSSs identified by ATAC-seq are definitely enhancers and not promoters (solely based on epigenomic profiling), provided that this topics is quite controversial in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We softened the language, but note that our data provide evidence beyond epigenomic profiling that these elements are enhancers in mature NK cells: specifically, we showed that deletion of Hss1 in mature NK cells extinguishes expression, which is known to initiate at promoters well downstream of the enhancers in mature NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Here are my specific comments and questions for the authors to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1.

Is this important for the expression of the different genes analysed? This should be clarified, especially for non-specialists in these lineages.</p></disp-quote><p>Where relevant, we have attempted to explain the characteristics of each type of NK cell. Briefly, immature NK cells are not yet terminally differentiated and importantly do not yet express Ly49 genes, expression of which is associated with mature, or fully differentiated NK cells. This is now indicated on page 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the stimulation of NK cells with IL-2 important for; is this for proliferation, for activity? Why are cells sometimes expanded with IL-2 and sometimes not?</p></disp-quote><p>Generally, we use IL-2 to expand NK cells when it is necessary obtain sufficient cells for analysis, which we now indicate in the text on page 15. To elaborate, NK cells are fairly rare among spleen cells (3%) and only 3 % of those co-express both alleles of Ly49G2 in (B6 x BALB/c)F<sub>1</sub> hybrid mice, for a frequency of 0.09% of splenocytes. Generally, CUT&amp;RUN experiments utilized IL-2 expanded cells, while ATAC-seq experiments utilized fresh cells. These data appear to cross-validate each other well (Figure 2). Furthermore, Ly49 expression states (both on and off) are stable in NK cells expanded in IL-2. For these reasons, we used IL-2 expanded NK cells when we needed larger numbers of primary cells for chromatin assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How were the % of expression frequencies on Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A calculated?</p></disp-quote><p>The percentages are based on previously published historical data generated by both our group and others. We have added citations in the Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 legend in the revised manuscript. The numbers depict approximations only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is no ATAC-seq peak visible for the promoter of the Ly49a gene (Figure 1A, Figure 3A, Figure 4A), unlike for the other genes of the cluster. Could the authors please comment on this? DoesnÂ´t this argue against the claim that HSS1 is an enhancer and not a promoter?</p></disp-quote><p>The transcription start sites (TSSs) of the <italic>Ly49</italic> genes were previously documented by 5â oligo-capping RACE (Gays et al., <italic>PLos One</italic> 2011 PMID: 21483805), and for the Ly49 genes these range from ~5-6kb <italic>downstream</italic> of HSS1, at sites called âPro2â and âPro3,â hereafter referred to as the TSSs. The citation is now included in the Figure 2 legend. mRNAs in mature, Ly49+ NK cells do NOT initiate at the HSS1 elements, and this is true across the gene family. Thus, HSS1 is not the promoter for <italic>Ly49a</italic> or any of the <italic>Ly49</italic> genes in mature NK cells, nor has any published report made the claim that it is. While the signals from the documented TSSs for <italic>Ly49a</italic> are weak, they are present (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The weakness of these ATAC sites is likely due to (1) Multiple TSSs such that the ATAC-seq accessibility is diffused to several sites, and (2) the fact that less than 20% of cells express the gene. The signal would therefore be ~5 times higher (or more) if the cells were sorted to be Ly49A+.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ATAC-seq tracks in NK cells at the <italic>Ly49a</italic> locus show weak signal at the <italic>Ly49a<sub>Hss5</sub></italic> and <italic>Ly49a<sub>Pro</sub></italic> elements.</title><p>Here we display four ATAC-seq tracks generated from (B6 x BALB/c)F<sub>1</sub> NK cells sorted according to Ly49G2 allelic expression status as shown in Figure 2D, but at the <italic>Ly49a</italic> locus.

Immunol.</italic> 2006 PMID: 16785537) and is now cited on p. 11. We added a new figure (Figure 2 figure supplement 1) that shows the gating and post sort analysis of the NKG2A-sorted cells and the Ly49G2-sorted cells used to generate ATAC-seq data and the CUT&amp;RUN data presented in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We regret the omission of a clear explanation. The cells used for the cIgG control are a mixture of NK cells that express either the B6 or BALB/c allele, in approximately equal amounts. In order to clarify this, we changed the coloring of the cIgG label to black to distinguish it from the labeling of the allele expressed. We further explain in the revised legend for Figure 2 the nature of this control experiment and specify which cells were used to generate the cIgG track. The protein A in the pA-Mnase fusion binds mIgG2ak with high affinity, which is the reason for the selection of this control. In general, CnR produces remarkably low noise, and in all cIgG CnR datasets we have produced we have not seen appreciable signal enrichment at ATAC-seq accessible sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

This is not due to an increased likelihood of expression of the BALB/c allele, but rather because the cells that would have expressed both alleles are no longer able to express the B6 allele as they lack the critical enhancer on the B6 chromosome. In other words, while the proportion of cells expressing <italic>only</italic> the BALB/c allele increases, the total proportion of cells expressing the BALB/c allele remains unchanged.</p><p>If the reviewer is instead referring to the second sub-panel in Figure 3âfigure supplement C (where there is a slight increase in the observed BALB/c-only cells over expected) this is a separate point. We <italic>expect</italic> an increase in the BALB/c only cells for reasons entirely independent of a compensatory effect, as described above. However, this slight increase in observed over expected may imply some slight compensatory mechanism. This increase is slight, and the overall result is that the total number of cells expressing the BALB/c allele is not drastically increased as we might expect if there were a trans-acting transcriptional âcountingâ mechanism to ensure a particular percentage of cells express NKG2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

The possible role of the HSS5 enhancer in increasing the expression probability/frequency of the Ly49g gene in NK cells is appealing. Given the similarity between the Ly49a and Ly49g loci regarding the HSS1 enhancer, would it be possible to test this by introducing the HSS5 element upstream of the Ly49a gene to see whether this would increase the probability/frequency of Ly49a expression? (maybe using a transgene construct, not necessarily a knockin).</p></disp-quote><p>This is potentially a revealing experiment that we would love to do and plan to do. In order to do it properly, it should be a germline knockin. Transgenes suffer from various technical problems including variable copy number insertions and position effects. We previously successfully used a genomic transgene to establish the proximal regulation of <italic>Ly49a</italic> (Tanamachi et al., <italic>J. Immunol.</italic> 2004 PMID: 14707081). The data, however, were variable for different founders, to an extent that we believe would compromise this approach for the question at hand. Knockin approaches for these genes have proven to be extremely challenging in our hands likely due to the homology between the targeting sequence and multiple related <italic>Ly49</italic> genes which appear to diminish the frequency of replacement of the desired gene. For these reasons we decided this experiment, while potentially revealing, will be subject of future efforts and, if successful, included in a future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

What is the difference between a weak and a strong enhancer? Related to the binding of specific transcription/chromatin factors? Level of enrichment of specific histone marks? 3D conformation?</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a speculative answer in our response to the public reviews and in the revised manuscript on p. 43. On p 43 of the revised manuscript, after proposing that the randomness of RME may reflect the probability of overcoming the energy barrier required for nucleosome remodeling of initially chromatinized promoters, we added the following passage:</p><p>âIt may be this property that is the measure of âenhancer strengthâ, i.e., the capacity of the enhancer to overcome the energy threshold presented by the promoter within a limited window during differentiation. The number of enhancer elements in a gene, the availability of relevant transcription factors that bind the enhancers and the affinity with which the enhancer binds the factors are all likely relevant in determining enhancer strength.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b â Could this model apply to chromatin or nuclear factors, expressed in other cell lineages than the hematopoietic lineage?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the answer is yes. As already mentioned, the gene encoding the transcription factor Bcl11b is expressed in an RME fashion during thymocyte development, and the probability of expression of this gene is further altered by enhancer deletion variegation (Ng et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018 PMID: 30457103). We add a reference to this in this discussion on page 41, indicating that this supports the generality of our model to genes not encoding cell surface receptors. With respect to non-hematopoietic lineages, deletion of enhancers regulating the odorant receptor genes (Khan et al., <italic>Cell</italic> 2011 PMID: 22078886) as well as trace amine-associated and trace-amine associated receptors (Fei et al., <italic>Nat. Commun.</italic> 2021 PMID: 34145235) in the olfactory epithelium reduced the expression probability of the target genes, demonstrating that RME rooted in binary enhancer action applies to non-hematopoietic lineage. On page 44 in the revised manuscript, we add statements and citations to these papers in order to clarify that the mechanisms we describe are likely not restricted to hematopoietic cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, I found the manuscript highly relevant and the main conclusions are well supported by the presented data. However, there are some aspects that could be modified and/or expanded in order to improve the overall relevance of the work:</p><p>My main concern is that, as presented, the work strongly suggest that enhancers play an important and instructive work in RME. However, there are limited insights into the molecular mechanisms behind such an instructive role. Given that the promoter but not the enhancer chromatin state correlates with RME, I think the authors should explore more how enhancer-gene communication might be altered in expressing and non-expressing alleles. Since the investigated enhancers are quite proximal to the target gene promoters, investigating topological aspects of enhancer-gene communication can be technically quite challenging. Moreover, it is highly intriguing that in alleles subject to RME the promoters stably lose their responsiveness to proximal active enhancers. In this regard, I have a few suggestions:</p><p>â Although H3K27ac is strongly associated with active enhancers, it can be uncoupled from expression of the target genes (Pachano et al., 2021), while the production of eRNAs seems tope strongly coupled with mRNA expression (Kim et al., 2010; Hirabayashi et al., 2019). Therefore, I think it could be quite relevant to investigate eRNA levels at the investigated enhancers in the context of expressing and non-expressing alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the close relationship between eRNA and target mRNA production. While we have not directly assayed eRNAs ourselves, they have been analyzed extensively by RT-PCR in both primary NK cells and NK cell related cell lines (Gays et al., <italic>J. Immunol.</italic> 2015 PMID: 25926675) (cited on p. 9 of revised manuscript). This study showed that bidirectional enhancer-derived transcripts are present in cells that do not express the corresponding receptor gene. Therefore, even when enhancer-derived transcripts are used to measure enhancer activity, Hss1 activity can be decoupled from target gene expression status, corroborating our results. Taken together, these results suggest that the relationship between the enhancer activity acting on a locus is fundamentally probabilistic rather than deterministic (i.e., not 1:1). This decoupling likely takes place infrequently, when overall enhancer activity is below the threshold to activate the target gene in the large majority of cells. In many and perhaps most cases, enhancer activity as measured by eRNA production will correlate very strongly with mRNA production, especially when measured in bulk populations rather than single cells. We added a sentence on p. 14 addressing the relationship between eRNA production and target <italic>Ly49</italic> gene expression status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â As the authors clearly show, the promoters of the NK receptor genes do not acquire histone modifications associated with gene repression. This is not surprising given that, as the authors mention in the discussion, these promoters are CpG-poor. Inactive CpG-poor promoters do not typically show enrichment for these histone marks but display high DNA methylation levels instead, in contrast with CpG-rich promoters, which are typically hypomethylated regardless of whether they are active or not. Therefore, although the authors mention in the Discussion that DNA methylation is unlikely to play a major role in RME, I still think that it would be quite insightful to compare the DNA methylation levels of active and inactive promoters for example by traditional locus-specific bisulfite sequencing. Moreover, the authors could investigate whether their findings still apply to genes with CpG-rich promoters (are CpG-rich genes subject to RME? Do enhancers influence RME at CpG-rich genes?) and/ or, alternatively, introduce a CpG island into one of the NK receptor gene promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we did not dedicate more space in the first version of the paper to the discussion of DNA methylation. We have added data and much discussion on the topic, including a section in the results beginning on p 28 and supplementary figure (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2) showing differential methylation of the <italic>Nkg2d</italic> promoter on active and silent alleles in <italic>Nkg2d5âE</italic> deletion mice. We further revised the discussion to address the role of DNA methylation in RME beginning on p44. Briefly, many RME genes do not display differential promoter methylation (da Rocha, Gendrel <italic>Essays Biochem.</italic> PMID: 31782494). Recent studies have further indicated that only a small minority of RME genes are subject to derepression of silent alleles through pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation (Gupta et al., <italic>G3</italic> 2021 https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab428 ; Marion-Poll et al., <italic>Nat. Commun.</italic> 2021 PMID: 34504093). Furthermore, inhibition of DNA methylation did not derepress silent <italic>Igh</italic> alleles in a B cell hybridoma model of enhancer-deletion variegation (Ronai et al., <italic>J. Immunol.</italic> 2002 PMID: 12471125). The role of DNA methylation in RME was addressed in a recent review (da Rocha, Gendrel <italic>Essays Biochem.</italic> PMID: 31782494), and it appears to be accepted in the RME field that DNA methylation is unlikely to underly all or most cases of RME (Eckersley-Maslin, Spector <italic>Trends Genet.</italic> 2014 PMID: 24780084). As we mention in the discussion (page 43), there remains the possibility that DNA methylation may play a role in determining the probability of promoter activation for some RME genes, including the ones we studied in the paper.</p><p>Regarding the issue of CpG density: <italic>Ly49</italic> promoters are indeed CpG-poor, but it is the case that CpG-rich genes are also subject to RME (Eckersley-Maslin et al., <italic>Dev. Cell</italic> 2014 PMID: 24576421). Indeed, the <italic>Thy1</italic> gene, which we show is an RME gene despite being considered a marker of all T cells, harbors a CpG island annotated on the UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

We add a statement in the discussion beginning (p. 42) to clarify that RME (and enhancer-controlled RME) apply to genes with CpG-dense and CpG poor promoter regions.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The <italic>Thy1</italic> gene harbors a promoter proximal CpG island.</title><p>We provide a screenshot of the UCSC genome browser displaying the <italic>Thy1</italic> locus with the CpG track.

The authors could investigate DNA methylation at promoter regions at earlier cellular states, which could represent a critical temporal window at which DNA demethylating agents could have an impact on RME.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect to the methylation of CpG sites in the <italic>Ly49</italic> and <italic>Nkg2a</italic> promoters themselves, several studies have been published by Dixie Magerâs group demonstrating a clear correlation between DNA methylation and silent alleles (Rouhi et al., <italic>J. Immunol.</italic> 2006 PMID: 16493057; Rouhi et al., <italic>Mol. Immunol.</italic> 2007 PMID: 16750269; Rogers et al., <italic>J. Immunol</italic>. 2006 PMID: 16785537). Inhibition of DNA methylation on its own appears insufficient to derepress silent alleles, however. In the case of <italic>Nkg2a</italic>, the promoter region is heavily methylated both in immature cells that do not yet express NKG2A, and in the case of silent alleles in mature cells, suggesting that methylation is not specifically deposited on silent alleles, but rather that active alleles are de-methylated. This is mentioned in the revised discussion (page 43). Furthermore, the <italic>Ly49a</italic> promoter region (Pro2) was shown to be methylated in non-hematopoietic cells. All of these data support the notion that DNA methylation of the NK receptor gene promoters is associated with the default off state, and that demethylation takes place specifically on activated alleles, likely concomitant with activation. These considerations make it less likely that there exists an immature developmental state in which the two alleles might be differentially methylated, preparatory of subsequent RME. Another important point is that the enhancer deletion variegation (and associated allelic âfailureâ) was observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Perry et al., <italic>PNAS</italic> 2011 PMID: 21825127), where DNA methylation is not thought to be present at detectable levels and thus does not play a major role in gene regulation. This consideration confirms that DNA methylation is not generally required for the binary enhancer-driven RME phenomenon.</p><p>As discussed in the revised Discussion section (p 42), we favor a mechanism in which enhancer action must overcome the energy barrier associated with the promoters being initially in an inactive state, and success occurs with a random probability, albeit dependent on enhancer strength. In our thinking, the inactive state that must be overcome could simply be the closed chromatin state. However, we also propose the possibility that promoter DNA methylation could contribute to the energy barrier in some cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1 â In the first section of the results, the authors test the idea that Ly49Hss and NKg25'E regulatory elements are enhancers rather than promoters in NK cells as previously suggested. A full demonstration of this is not provided since the data presented is essentially epigenetic features and ATAC-seq. The provided evidence does not for example demonstrate that Ly49Hss can not behave as promoters in immature cells as proposed before since no RNA data is shown in the article for NKR analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we toned down the statements claiming the chromatin modification data provided âdefinitiveâ support for enhancer as opposed to promoter identity (p. 10). Nevertheless, we feel that the evidence is strong. Our argument depends not only on the epigenetic marks and ATACseq results, but also on our finding that the elements are necessary for maintaining gene expression in mature NK cells, where it is known that the mRNAs are initiated well downstream of Hss1 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2). The revised text on p. 10-11 emphasizes this point (see our response to reviewer 1, comment 3 for further details). The reviewer points out that we did not examine RNA, but others have, and we do not contest their findings that transcripts initiating at Hss1 and transcribing through the gene have been identified in immature NK cells. The difficulty is that transcripts (eRNAs) are known to initiate from enhancers, so the RNA data does not resolve the issue. Another group has made a good argument that the observed transcripts initiating at Hss1 are indeed eRNAs (Gays et al., <italic>J. Immunol.</italic> 2015 PMID: 25926675). We note that the existence of eRNAs in other genes has not led to theories that such RNAs are part of a developmental switch that turns those genes on and off. An additional argument in favor of our conclusions is that deletion of the 5â enhancer of <italic>Nkg2d</italic> resulted in an expression pattern indistinguishable from that of <italic>Ly49</italic> or <italic>Nkg2a</italic> genes. Since it is unlikely that enhancer deletion would CREATE a bidirectional promoter that drives variegated expression, the simplest hypothesis is that variegation in Ly49 and enhancer deletion variegation alike is the consequence of weak enhancer activity as opposed to the action of a bidirectional upstream promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 â In the same section, based on epigenetic profiles and the relative amount of H3K4me1/3 and other predictive methods (ATAC, K27ac) the authors formally conclude on 'enhancer identity' (lines 186-187) and 'these findings provide definitive support for the conclusion that Ly49Hss1 and Nkg25'E elements represent enhancers' (lines 196-197). It is important to keep in mind that epigenomic features never demonstrate enhancer identity but rather suggest of putative enhancer features.
