These challenges drive the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between plant species. However, we are just beginning to understand how frequently new alleles arise controlling specialized metabolite diversity and how the geographic distribution of these alleles may be structured by ecological and demographic pressures. Here, we measure the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions. We show that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography and different genetic processes all combine to influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. This showed that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns suggesting potential within-species convergence. This provides a new perspective about the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Since plants cannot move, they have evolved chemical defenses to help them respond to changes in their surroundings. For example, where animals run from predators, plants may produce toxins to put predators off. This approach is why plants are such a rich source of drugs, poisons, dyes and other useful substances. The chemicals plants produce are known as specialized metabolites, and they can change a lot between, and even within, plant species. The variety of specialized metabolites is a result of genetic changes and evolution over millions of years.</p><p>Evolution is a slow process, yet plants are able to rapidly develop new specialized metabolites to protect them from new threats. Even different populations of the same species produce many distinct metabolites that help them survive in their surroundings. However, the factors that lead plants to produce new metabolites are not well understood, and it is not known how this affects genetic variation.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of this process, Katz et al. studied 797 European variants of a common weed species called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which is widely studied. The investigation found that many factors affect the range of specialized metabolites in each variant. These included local geography and environment, as well as genetics and population history (demography). Katz et al. revealed a pattern of relationships between the variants that could mirror their evolutionary history as the species spread and adapted to new locations.</p><p>These results highlight the complex network of factors that affect plant evolution. Rapid diversification is key to plant survival in new and changing environments and has resulted in a wide range of specialized metabolites. As such they are of interest both for studying plant evolution and for understanding their ecology. Expanding similar work to more populations and other species will broaden the scope of our ability to understand how plants adapt to their surroundings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>glucosinolates</kwd><kwd>specialized metabolites</kwd><kwd>convergence evolution</kwd><kwd>parallel evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1906486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006031</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FI-560-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>Ella</given-names></name><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1655810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1754201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angelovici</surname><given-names>Ruthie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Measurements of specialized metabolites across a population of 800 natural <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions revealed different pressures and evolutionary processes that shaped their variation and distribution across Europe.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Continuous and dynamic change in a plant’s habitat/environment creates a complex system to which a plant must adapt. Central to this adaptation are the production and accumulation of different metabolites ranging from signaling hormones, primary metabolites to a wide array of multi-functional specialized metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erb and Kliebenstein, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanower and Brzozowska, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kliebenstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Malcolm, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thakur and Rai, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wolters and Jürgens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2000</xref>). The complete blend, chemotype, of these metabolites helps to determine the plants’ survival and development, but the creation of any blend is complicated by the fact that individual specialized metabolites can have contrasting effects on the plant. For example, individual specialized metabolites can defend the plant against some stressors while simultaneously making the plant more sensitive to other biotic or abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agrawal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bialy et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erb and Kliebenstein, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Futuyma and Agrawal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lankau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Opitz and Müller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Uremıs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Züst and Agrawal, 2017</xref>). These opposing effects create offsetting ecological benefits and costs for individual metabolites. Integrating these offsetting effects across dynamic environments involves multiple selective pressures that might contribute to shaping the genetic and metabolic variation within a species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Malcolm, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sønderby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Szakiel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wentzell and Kliebenstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Züst et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Significant advances have been made in recent decades to identify genetic sources contributing to metabolic variation. A common finding of these studies is that the metabolic variation within and between species is the result of structural variation at the enzymes responsible for the chemical structures, or variation at the expression levels of these enzymes, which contributes to the quantitative variation in specialized metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kroymann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>). These structural and regulatory variants and the resulting chemical variation strongly influence plant fitness in response to a broad range of biotic interactions including herbivores and other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bednarek and Osbourn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerwin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lankau and Kliebenstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lankau and Strauss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lankau, 2007</xref>). The potential for these genetic variants influencing plant chemical variation is derived from the enhanced proportion of gene duplication in enzyme encoding genes for specialized metabolism, both at the local and whole genome level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>). Many mechanistic studies of natural variation in specialized metabolism have focused on biallelic phenotypic variation linked to loss-of-function variants. However, it is not clear if biallelic phenotypic variation is created by biallelic genetic causation when investigating a large collection of individuals from wide-ranging populations within a species.</p><p>If selective pressures are sufficiently non-linear, it is possible to have repeated and independent generation of structural variants creating the same metabolic variation in processes that are akin to parallel and convergent evolution are used to describe interspecific variation. Specifically, parallel and convergent evolution describe independent evolution of the same trait that differs depending on the beginning state of the organisms. In parallel evolution, the lineages begin from the same state and in parallel evolve to the same new state, while in convergent evolution the lineages start at different states and independently converge on the same new state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In this context, we are focusing the analogy on the fact that the two processes differ where they begin, same or different state. This raises the possibility for chemical variation within a species to exhibit parallel evolution, wherein independent new haplotypes with identical metabolic consequences arise multiple times from single-core haplotype. Equally it may be possible to find within-species convergent evolution, where genotypes with the same metabolic profile actually contain completely different haplotypes that themselves arose from distinct haplotypic lineages. These genetic processes and interplay between genetics and selection overlap with neutral demographic processes like gene flow. Thus, it is necessary to understand how the intersection of environmental pressure, demography and genomic complexity gives rise to the pattern of metabolic variation across a plant species.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Parallel and convergent evolution.</title><p>The schema describes our use of parallel (<bold>A</bold>) and convergent (<bold>B</bold>) evolution for within-species chemotypic variation.

GSLs are a diverse class of specialized metabolites that display extensive variation across the order Brassicales, which includes the model plant Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daxenbichler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kliebenstein et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodman et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rodman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sønderby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wright et al., 2002</xref>). GSLs consist of a common core structure with a diverse side chain that determines biological activity in defense, growth, development and abiotic stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beekwilder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hasegawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Katz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malinovsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Salehin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yamada et al., 2003</xref>). The Arabidopsis-GSL system is an optimal model to study the species-wide processes driving specialized metabolite variation because the identity of the whole biosynthetic pathway is known, including the major causal loci for natural variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kliebenstein et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kliebenstein et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kroymann and Mitchell-Olds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pfalz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sønderby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wentzell et al., 2007</xref>). These major loci have been proven to influence Arabidopsis fitness and can be linked to herbivore pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerwin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). Beyond the major causal loci, there is also evidence from genome-wide association (GWA) studies for highly polygenic variation in the genetic background that contributes to modulating GSL variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). The public availability of over 1000 widely distributed accessions with genomic sequences facilitates phenotyping GSL variation across a large spatial scale and analyses of causal haplotypes at the major GSL causal loci.</p><p>In Arabidopsis and other Brassicas, the main GSLs are methionine-derived, aliphatic, GSLs. Variation in the structure of aliphatic GSL is controlled by natural genetic variation at three loci: <italic>GS-Elong, GS-AOP</italic> and <italic>GS-OH</italic>. The specific alleles at these three loci combine to determine a predominant chemical structure and define chemically distinct aliphatic GSL chemotypes. In addition to these large-effect loci, there is a large suite of loci that can quantitatively alter the total accumulation and relative concentrations of GSLs within each chemotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>GS-Elong</italic> differentially elongates the methionine side chain by the methylthioalkylmalate synthase enzymes (MAM). The elongation of the side chain by one methylene group is the result of one cycle that includes three steps: deamination of the methionine to create a ω-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic-acid, condensation of the ω-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic-acid with acetyl-CoA, and then isomerization and oxidative decarboxylation. The one carbon longer outcome can then undergo additional cycles of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kroymann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Textor et al., 2007</xref>). In Arabidopsis, MAM2 catalyzes the addition of one carbon to the side chain, creating GSLs with three carbon side chains. MAM1 catalyzes the addition of two carbons to make GSLs with four carbon side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). MAM3 (also known as MAM-L) catalyzes the additions up to six carbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kroymann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mithen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Textor et al., 2007</xref>). The core pathway leads to the creation of methylthio GSL (MT). Then, the MT is converted to a methylsulfinyl (MSO) with a matching number of carbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giamoustaris and Mithen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>). Structural variation at the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> locus leads to differential modification of the MSO by differential expression of a family of 2-oxoacid-dependent dioxygenases (2ODD). The AOP2 enzyme removes the MSO moiety leaving an alkenyl sidechain, while AOP3 leaves a hydroxyl moiety. Previous work has suggested three alleles of <italic>GS-AOP</italic>: the <italic>OHP</italic> allele that expresses only <italic>AOP3</italic> and accumulates terminal OH containing GLS in the leaves and seeds; an alkenyl allele expressing <italic>AOP2</italic> in the leaf and <italic>AOP2</italic> and <italic>AOP3</italic> in the seed leading to solely alkenyl GLS in the leaf and both alkenyl and OH aliphatic GLS in the seed; and a final allele containing a null mutation in the <italic>AOP2</italic> gene that accumulates MSO GLS in the leaf and enhanced MSO and OH GLS in the seed. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kliebenstein et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mithen et al., 1995</xref>). The C4 alkenyl side chain can be further modified by adding a hydroxyl group at the 2C via the GS-OH 2-ODD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>). In spite of the evolutionary distance, independent variation at the same three loci influences the structural diversity in aliphatic-GSLs within Brassica, Streptanthus and Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kliebenstein and Cacho, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lankau and Kliebenstein, 2009</xref>). For example, the MAMs responsible for C3 GSLs in Arabidopsis and Brassica represent two independent lineages, same as the MAMs responsible for C4 GSLs; in fact, the <italic>MAM</italic> locus contains at least three independent lineages that recreate the same length variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahams et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates repeated evolution across species, but it is not clear how frequently these loci are changing within a single species or how ecological or demographic processes may shape within-species variation at these loci.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Aliphatic glucosinolate (GSL) biosynthesis pathway.</title><p>Short names and structures of the GSLs are in black.

The amounts of GSLs can vary across different tissues and life stages, but there is a strong correlation in the type of aliphatic GSL produced across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kliebenstein et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petersen et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, in most cases the chemotype of the seeds is the same as the leaves. The seeds have the highest level of GSLs in Arabidopsis and are stable at room temperature until germination, which makes the seeds a perfect tissue to survey variation. Further, GSLs are known to be important for seed defenses against herbivores and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raybould and Moyes, 2001</xref>). By combining GSL seed measurements with prior whole-genome sequencing in a European collection of accessions, we show that all three major causal loci controlling GSL metabolic diversity contain multiple independently derived alleles that recreate the same phenotypes using a combination of single nucleotide polimorphism (SNPs) and structural variation. Using these causal genotypes and chemotypes in combination with their geographic distribution provided evidence that the distribution of GSL metabolic diversity across Europe is influenced by a combination of demography and ecological factors. The ecological relationships to chemotype suggested a potential for variation in selective processes across the geographic regions studied. Future work will be needed to identify the specific biotic and/or abiotic factors shaping this distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GSL variation across Europe</title><p>To investigate the genetic, environmental and demographic parameters influencing the distribution of Arabidopsis GSL chemotypes, we measured GSLs from seeds of a collection of 797 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> natural accessions ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">The 1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>). These Arabidopsis accessions were collected from different geographical locations, mainly in and around Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). 23 different GSLs were detected and quantified, identifying a wide diversity in composition and amount among the natural accessions with a median heritability of 83%, ranging from 34% to 93% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To summarize the GSL variation among the accessions, we performed principal component analyses (PCA) on the accumulation of all the individual GSLs across the accessions as an unbiased first step. The first two PCs only captured 33% of the total variation with PC1 describing GSLs with four and seven carbons and PC2 mainly capturing GSLs with eight carbons in their side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous work using a collection of predominantly central European accessions had suggested a simple continental gradient chain-elongation variation from the south-west (SW) (that is enriched with alkenyl and hydroxyalkenyl GSLs) to the north-east (NE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Züst et al., 2012</xref>).

This larger collection shows that there is not a single gradient shaping GSL diversity across Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Instead, the extended sampling of accessions around the Mediterranean Basin in this collection shows that the SW to NE pattern reiterates within the Iberian Peninsula.

In spite of the large population size, both PC1- and PC2-based analyses identified the same two major peaks covering two of the known causal gene clusters controlling GSL diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> for PC1 GWA analyses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> for PC2 GWA analyses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>).

Surprisingly, none of the other known natural variants within the GSL biosynthetic pathway (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) were identified by GWA including three that were found with 96 accessions and three that were found with 595 accessions using PC1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kliebenstein, 2009</xref>).

One explanation for that is that the dense sampling in this collection is available for mainly the Iberian Peninsula, the southern coast of Sweden and the south-western coast of Italy, and is still insufficient for Central Europe. Another possibility is that allelic heterogeneity for the other loci, and more complex patterns of interaction, may hamper their detection and influenced this high false-negative error rate where ~80% of prior validated natural variants found using multiple RIL populations were missed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Complex GSL chemotypic variation</title><p>One potential complicating factor is that GSL chemotypic variation is best described as a discrete multimodal distribution involving the epistatic interaction of multiple genes which PCA’s linear decomposition cannot accurately capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To test if PCA was inaccurately describing GSL chemotypic variation, we directly called the specific GSL chemotypes in each accession. Using Arabidopsis QTL mapping populations and GWA, we have shown that the <italic>GS-AOP</italic>, <italic>Elong</italic> and <italic>OH</italic> loci determine seven discrete chemotypes, 3MSO, 4MSO, 3OHP, 4OHB, Allyl, 3-Butenyl, 2-OH-3-Butenyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), that can be readily assigned from GSLs’ phenotypic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</xref>). The presence and amounts of these seven chemotypes provide a reliable indication about the existence and activity of each of the major GSL loci. Using accessions with previously known chemotypes and genotypes, we developed a phenotypic classification scheme to assign the chemotype for each accession (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; for details, see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>; for structures, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Since the aliphatic GSLs’ composition in the seeds reliably indicates the GSL structural composition in the other plant’s life stages and tissues, assigning a chemotype for each accession based on the seeds’ composition is expected to be highly stable across tissues of the same accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kliebenstein et al., 2001b</xref>). Most accessions were classified as 2-OH-3-Butenyl (27%) or Allyl (47%) with lower frequencies for the other chemotypes. Mapping the chemotypes onto Europe showed that the PCA decomposition was missing substantial information on GSL chemotype variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Instead of a continuous distribution across Europe, the chemotype classifications revealed specific geographic patterns. Central and parts of Northern Europe (like north Germany and Poland) were characterized by a high variability involving the co-occurrence of individuals from all chemotypes. In contrast, southern Europe, which presents a dense sampling, including the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the Balkan, has two predominant chemotypes, Allyl or 2-OH-3-Butenyl, that are separated from each other by a clear and sharp geographic partitioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Uniquely, Swedish accessions displayed a striking presence of almost solely Allyl chemotypes. Deeper sampling is required to test if this is or is not mirrored on the eastern side of the Baltic Sea as the few accessions from that region are almost solely 3OHP chemotypes (Finnish, Lithuanian, Latvian or Estonian accessions). Directly assigning GSL variation by discrete chemotypes provided a more detailed image not revealed by PCA decomposition. Further, the different chemotypic to geographic patterns suggest that there may be different pressures shaping GSL variation particularly when comparing Central and Southern Europe.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Phenotypic classification based on glucosinolate (GSL) content.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Using the GSL accumulation, each accession was classified to one of seven aliphatic short-chained GSL chemotypes based on the enzyme functions as follows: <italic>MAM2, AOP</italic> null: classified as 3MSO dominant, colored in yellow. <italic>MAM1, AOP</italic> null: classified as 4MSO dominant, colored in pink.

We focus on the <italic>GS-AOP</italic>, <italic>GS-Elong</italic> and <italic>GS-OH</italic> loci, the causal genes creating Arabidopsis GSL chemotypes, and use the available genomic sequences in all these accessions to investigate the allelic variation in these genes to map the allelic distribution and test the potential for convergent and/or parallel evolution within each locus.</p><p><italic>GS-Elong</italic>: Because the variation in the <italic>GS-Elong</italic> locus is caused by complex structural variation in <italic>MAM1</italic> and <italic>MAM2</italic> that is not resolvable using the available data from short-read genomic sequence, we used the <italic>MAM3</italic> sequence within this locus to ascertain the genomic relationship of accessions at the causal <italic>GS-Elong</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kroymann et al., 2003</xref>).

We obtained long-read-based sequencing of 11 additional accessions from the 1001 Genome project for the <italic>MAM</italic> locus that included accessions in all clades including clades 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5s2sdata1">Figure 5—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref> for sequences). This showed that clade 6 are accessions that have a haplotype that contains a previously described chimeric <italic>MAM</italic> gene that combines the 5′ of <italic>MAM2</italic> with the 3′ of <italic>MAM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kroymann et al., 2003</xref>). In these accessions, the chimeric gene leads to predominantly C3 GSLs. Clade 7 has a haplotype that is highly similar to clade 2 with a single copy of <italic>MAM1</italic> leading to C4 GSLs. Comparing transposable elements in the two clades shows that they are different configurations.</p><p>The new sequenced accessions present in the clades with existing genomic haplotypes predominantly agreed with these previously published haplotypes. There were only three accessions with differences, two with a local duplication of a truncated <italic>MAM1</italic> pseudogene in clades 1 and 2 (PHW-34 and TAL 07, respectively), and a second with a local duplication of a <italic>MAM1</italic> pseudogene in clade 2 (Qar-8a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The bootstrap support and smaller trees raised the possibility that clade 2 could be considered as two distinct clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, clades 2a and 2b). The chemotypes and haplotype in the accessions do not provide a clear mechanistic basis for separating this clade into two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kroymann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Comparing the accessions across the main split in this clade suggested that one group of accessions (clade 2b) has lower total GSLs and a higher fraction of short-chain GSLs in comparison to the longer chain structures. Future work involving populations solely focused on this question would be needed to resolve the mechanistic basis of this difference and if this represents two distinct <italic>MAM</italic> loci.</p><p>One complication in interpreting the potential for parallel vs. convergent evolution in this locus is that the relationship between the major chemotype/haplotype groups is not resolvable with very low bootstraps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Functional parsimony would suggest that clade 4, by having both <italic>MAM1</italic> and <italic>MAM2</italic>, may represent a single haplotype that can give rise to the other functional haplotypes via independent mutations akin to parallel evolution. Supporting this potential is the observation that <italic>MAM1</italic> and <italic>MAM2</italic> are likely derived via a tandem duplication with ensuing divergence since the separation from <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benderoth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>). Fully resolving this would require collecting more accessions to identify additional alleles that may contain the information necessary to better resolve the relationships amongst the haplotypes.</p><p>Using this phylogeny, we investigated the presence of the different <italic>GS-Elong</italic> haplotypes across Europe to ask if each region has a specific allele/clade or if the alleles are distributed across the continent. Specifically, we were interested if the strong C3/C4 partitioning in Southern Europe was driven by the creation of local alleles or if this partitioning might contain a wide range of alleles. If the latter is true, this can argue for a selective pressure shaping this C3/C4 divide. To understand the patterning of the C3/C4 haplotypes and chemotypes in Iberia, we plotted the accessions on the map and colored them based on their <italic>GS-Elong</italic> clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). As expected given that genetic variation in Iberia results from a series of range expansions from Central Europe and Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durvasula et al., 2017</xref>), there is extensive mixing of nearly all major European <italic>GS-Elong</italic> haplotypes in Iberia, except of clade 3 that is not present. In contrast, there is a sharp partitioning between the C3/C4 chemotypes created by these haplotypes. The strong geographic separation between the two chemotypes involving nearly all causal haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) raises the possibility that the strong geographic partitioning of the C3/C4 chemotypes in Iberia may be driven by selective pressure enhancing the partitioning of the chemotypes, and not solely neutral demographic processes. The presence of a few accessions in Iberia that disagree with the sharp C3/C4 partition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>) suggests that a new configuration of this loci arose in this area and is reflected in a few accessions. However, this requires further assessment.</p><p>Shifting focus to all of Europe showed that while most clades were widely distributed across Europe there were a couple of over-arching patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). <italic>GS-Elong</italic> clades 1 and 6 provide an example of potential gene flow between Iberia and Central Europe. In contrast, the absence of clade 3 in Iberia is more parsimonious with this haplotype having a glacial refugium in the Balkans followed by a northward flow wherein it mixed with the other clades. Other clades do not present evidence of a gene flow to the north as they are exclusive to the south as shown by clades 5 and 7. While these are both C4 clades, other C4 clades like clades 2 and 8 present a case of a gene flow to the north (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that there are either differences in their GSL chemotype influencing their distribution or there are neighboring genes known to be under selection in Arabidopsis like <italic>FLC</italic> (AT5G10140) that may have influenced their distribution. In combination, this suggests that a complex demography is involved in shaping the chemotype’s identity with some regions, Iberia, showing evidence of local selection while other regions, Central Europe, possibly showing a blend requiring further work to delineate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>GS-AOP</italic>: Side chain modification of the core MSO GSL is determined by the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> locus. Most of the accessions contain a copy of <italic>AOP2</italic> and a copy of <italic>AOP3</italic>, but only one of them will be functionally expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>), while in some cases both will be non-functional. To better understand the demography and evolution of the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> locus, we separately aligned the <italic>AOP2</italic> and <italic>AOP3</italic> sequences, rooted each tree with the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> orthologue and colored the trees tips based on the accessions-dominant chemotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The phylogenetic trees shared a very similar topology, yielding a clear separation between alkenyl (<italic>AOP2</italic> expressed) and hydroxyalkyl (<italic>AOP3</italic> expressed) accessions. Alkenyl expressing accessions like Cvi-0 with an expressed copy of the AOP2 enzyme formed a single continuous cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, hydroxyalkyl (<italic>AOP3</italic> expressed) accessions clustered into two separate groups with one group of 3OHP-dominant accessions partitioning from the rest of the accessions at the most basal split in the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <italic>AOP2</italic> tree). This haplotype is marked by having an inversion swapping the <italic>AOP2</italic> and <italic>AOP3</italic> promoters as shown in bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing of the Ler-0 accession (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>AOP3</italic> tree also identified a second group of 3OHP-dominant accessions located among the alkenyl accessions. Analyzing the sequences of these accessions reveals that this small group of 3OHP accessions has a complete deletion of <italic>AOP2</italic> and contains only <italic>AOP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, there are at least two independent transitions from alkenyl to hydroxyalkyl GSLs within Arabidopsis, neither of which are related to the alkenyl to hydroxyalkyl conversion within <italic>A. lyrata</italic>. This indicates that there are multiple alkenyl to hydroxyalkyl GSL conversions both within and between Arabidopsis species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title><italic>AOP</italic> genomic structure.</title><p>The genomic structure and causality of the major <italic>AOP2/AOP3</italic> haplotypes are illustrated.

Deeper examination of the sequences of these accessions identified three convergent LOF alleles leading to the MSO chemotype. Most of the null accessions harbor a 5 bps deletion in their <italic>AOP2</italic> sequence, which causes a frameshift mutation. This mutation arose within the alkenyl haplotype and was first reported in the Col-0 reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</xref>). In addition, there are additional independent LOF events arising in both the alkenyl haplotype (e.g., Sp-0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and within the Ler-0 inversion haplotype (e.g., Fr-2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, <italic>GS-AOP</italic> has repeated LOF alleles arising within several of the major <italic>AOP</italic> haplotypes, suggesting convergent evolution of the MSO chemotype out of both the alkenyl and hydroxyalkyl chemotypes.</p><p>Using the combined chemotype/genotype assignments at <italic>GS-AOP</italic>, we investigated the distribution of the alleles across Europe. The alkenyl haplotype is spread across the entire continent. In contrast, the hydroxyalkyl haplotypes are geographically more restricted. The Ler-like 3OHP haplotype is present in only Central and North Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), while the other 3OHP haplotype, possessing only <italic>AOP3</italic>, is limited to Azerbaijan, along the Caspian Sea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast to the distinct hydroxyalkyl locations, the distribution of the independent LOF null haplotypes overlaps with all of them being located within Central and North Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C and F</xref>). The fact that these independently derived LOF alleles are all contiguous suggests that they may be beneficial or neutral in Central Europe.</p><p><italic>GS-OH</italic>: The final major determinant of natural variation in Arabidopsis GSL chemotype is the GS-OH enzyme that adds a hydroxyl group to the carbon 2 on 3-butentyl GSL to create 2-OH-3-Butenyl GSL.

Because of functional epistasis, we can only obtain functional phenotypic information from accessions that accumulate the GS-OH substrate, 3-Butenyl GLS. This identified 11 accessions with a non-functional GS-OH. Surveying these 11 accessions in the polymorph database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">The 1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>) identified multiple independent LOF events. One of these 11 accessions has the Cvi active site mutations, two accessions have a shared nonsense SNP that introduces premature stop codons and two accessions have a complete loss of this gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Thus, we searched for the accessions that do not accumulate 3-Butenyl GLS and carry <italic>GS-OH</italic> LOF events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In all cases, the LOF allele is more frequent in the non four carbon-alkenyl accessions than expected by random chance. This suggests that there is selection against 3-Butenyl GSL synthesis since LOF alleles are more frequent when the <italic>GS-OH</italic> gene is cryptic by functional epistasis. This agrees with the fact that the 3-Butenyl chemotype is the most sensitive to generalist lepidopteran herbivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, these mutations may represent ongoing pseudogenization of the <italic>GS-OH</italic> gene when it is functionally hidden by epistasis at the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> and <italic>GS-Elong</italic> loci. These LOF events would then only be displayed upon rare admixture with 2-OH-3-Butenyl accessions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the genetic, demographic and environmental factors that shape variation within a trait in a population is key to understanding trait evolution. In this work, we used a family of specialized metabolites, aliphatic GSLs, and measured their amounts in seeds of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to query how genetics, geography, environment and demography intersect to shape chemotypic variation across Europe. We found that environmental conditions, together with geography, affect the presence and distribution of chemotypes within the accessions. This was demonstrated by specific traits that were associated with specific environmental conditions, and this association was shifted across the continent. Comparing the associations of traits to specific environmental conditions in Central Europe versus the south revealed different behaviors. This demonstrated that chemotypic variation across Europe is created by a blend of all these processes that differ at the individual loci. This implies that a simultaneous analysis of both genotype and phenotype is required to fully interpret these processes and relationships. The above analysis is extensively using abiotic factors because of their availability while aliphatic GSLs have mainly been linked to biotic interactions. GSLs have been mainly linked to influencing biotic interaction with herbivores considered the primary drivers shaping GSL genetic diversity. However, because climate drives the distribution of biotic factors like herbivores, it is likely that climatic factors might appear as indirectly associated with GSLs. Interestingly, an aliphatic GSL was recently mechanistically linked to drought resistance in Arabidopsis, suggesting a potential role for abiotic factors to influence GSL diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Salehin et al., 2019</xref>). More work is needed to dissect all the potential components of an environment that influence selection on GSL chemotypes.</p><p>All three major aliphatic GSL loci display extensive allelic heterogeneity that is shaped by a blend of evolutionary events at each locus reminiscent of either parallel or convergent evolution. For this analogy, we are defining parallel evolution to be when a new chemotype arises two or more independent times by independent mutations from shared ancestral haplotype. Conversely, we are considering convergent evolution of a chemotype to occur when independent mutations in independent ancestral haplotypes derive the same chemotype. <italic>GS-OH</italic> provided clear evidence of parallel evolution where a single functional haplotype gave rise to at least four independent LOF alleles all with similar phenotypic consequence. <italic>GS-AOP</italic> suggested the potential for convergent evolution-style events leading to MSO chemotype arising from LOF events at the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> locus. The first characterized LOF event was in the Col-0 accession that has a 5 bp frameshift indel in the <italic>AOP2</italic> gene arising within the alkenyl <italic>AOP2-</italic>dominant <italic>GS-AOP</italic> haplotype. In this study, we identified additional parallel <italic>AOP2</italic> LOF events in this haplotype. More critical, we could identify multiple independent LOF events arising in the <italic>AOP3</italic> gene within the <italic>AOP3-</italic>dominant inversion <italic>GS-AOP</italic> haplotype. Thus, the same GSL chemotype, MSO, arises from independent LOF alleles in two different genes, <italic>AOP2</italic> and <italic>AOP3</italic>, that represent two different ancestral haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, it appears that parallel-style events occur at all the loci and at least at the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> locus there is potential for a convergent-style evolutionary event leading to a single chemotype.</p><p>In addition to independent evolutionary events, three-way epistasis is shaping the allelic heterogeneity at these loci and their evolutionary potential. For example, the multiple independent <italic>GS-OH</italic> LOF variants all appear to have arisen in lineages where the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> and <italic>GS-Elong</italic> loci had haplotypes that epistatically combined to block the formation of the but-3-enyl GSL precursor for <italic>GS-OH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the parallel evolution of <italic>GS-OH</italic> LOF alleles is epistatically conditioned by <italic>GS-AOP</italic> and <italic>GS-Elong</italic>. A similar epistatic contingency also exists between the two independent <italic>AOP3</italic> alleles of <italic>GS-AOP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>) and GS-Elong. Both of <italic>AOP3</italic> alleles of <italic>GS-AOP</italic> are coordinated with C3 haplotypes in GS-Elong. The <italic>AZE</italic> allele of <italic>GS-AOP</italic> is associated with a novel geographically limited <italic>GS-Elong</italic> allele in clade 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) while the Central European <italic>AOP3</italic> allele is limited to accessions containing the clade 1, 3 or 6 C3 haplotypes of <italic>GS-Elong</italic>. There is also within-locus epistasis in the <italic>GS-Elong</italic> locus wherein a functional MAM1 leads to the creation of C4 GSLs regardless of the functional state of the <italic>MAM2</italic> gene and C3 haplotypes are marked by the loss of <italic>MAM1</italic>. All of these within- and between-loci interactions create a directional arrow for most loci where the haplotypes do not have equal evolutionary potential. For example, the clade 4 haplotype of <italic>GS-Elong</italic> can equally mutate to create a C3 or C4 chemotype because it has both <italic>MAM1</italic> and <italic>MAM2</italic>. However, the remaining clades like clade 3 have lost one or the other gene limiting their ability to create alternative chemotypes. In this case, the loss of <italic>MAM1</italic> likely prevents the ability for this C3 lineage to recreate the C4 chemotype. Thus, the potential evolutionary trajectory of a haplotype/allele at one or even within one of these GSL loci may be epistatically conditioned by the allelic state all the loci within a specific lineage.</p><p>This level of allelic diversity at these loci raises a question of how do pathways with this level of diversity and structural variation pass through speciation boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Confounding this further is the observation that Brassica ssp. have genetic variation at <italic>GS-Elong</italic> and <italic>GS-AOP</italic> creating the exact same chemotypic variation found in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heidel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramos-Onsins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Windsor et al., 2005</xref>). There is similar within-species (<italic>GS-AOP</italic>) and between-species (<italic>GS-AOP</italic> and <italic>GS-Elong</italic>) variation between the closely related Arabidopsis sister species, <italic>A. lyrata, A. petraea</italic> and <italic>A. halleri</italic>. However, the underlying genetic basis is independent events at the <italic>AOP</italic> and <italic>MAM</italic> loci showing that the variation did not go through the speciation boundary. Instead, this suggests that this variation has been recreated repeatedly in these species This raises the possibility that there may be a class of loci that are being repeatedly sampled by pangenomic variation across species within a family. To test this possibility would need a deeper phylogenetic sampling within and between species, particularly for understanding the intersection of ecology and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Göktay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durvasula et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous work on other biotic interactions genes like pathogen resistance gene-for-gene loci had indicated a predominant model of having two moderate-frequency ancient alleles creating the phenotypic variation within the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corrion and Day, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">MacQueen et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to R-gene loci characterized by old/stable biallelic variation, the GSL loci are characterized by a blend of structural and SNP-based variation with numerous alleles that appear young. In other cases, alleles of genes involved in biotic defense can present more complex patterns, for example, natural variation in the immune gene <italic>ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6</italic> (<italic>ACD6</italic>) is caused by a rare allele causing an extreme lesion phenotype. It is not yet clear what selective pressures influence <italic>ACD6</italic> genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Todesco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, loci controlling resistance to diverse biotic traits under natural conditions have diverse genetic architectures and further work is needed to assess the range of allelic heterogeneity in these adaptive loci.</p><p>The allelic diversity at the GSL loci illustrates the benefit of simultaneously tracking the phenotype and genotype when working to understand the distribution of trait variation. For example, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Basin had low variability in aliphatic GSL chemotypes, which show strong geographic structure. By contrast, Central/North Europe had high aliphatic GSL diversity with chemotypes showing overlapping geographic distributions. At first glance, this contrasts with previous work showing that the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Basin are genetically diverse. However, this discrepancy was caused by one of the causal loci. Specifically, the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> locus was largely fixed as the Alkenyl allele in Iberia/Mediterranean Basin with the alternative <italic>GS-AOP</italic> alleles enriched in Central Europe. In contrast to <italic>GS-AOP</italic>, Iberia and the Mediterranean Basin were highly genetically diverse for the <italic>GS-Elong</italic> locus and appear to contain almost all the variation in <italic>GS-Elong</italic> found throughout Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">The 1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>). Thus, the chemotypic divergence from genomic variation expectations was driven by just the <italic>GS-AOP</italic> locus. This indicates that the high level of chemotypic variation in Central Europe is a blend of alleles that emerged in the south (<italic>GS-Elong</italic>) and alleles that possibly arose locally (<italic>GS-AOP</italic>, both nulls and <italic>AOP3</italic>). Further, the chemotypes found in any one region appear to be created by a combination of alleles as a result of a gene flow across the continent, local generation of new polymorphisms and local selective pressures.</p><p>Another challenge potentially caused by allelic heterogeneity and differential selective pressures, as displayed within this system, is detecting the known and validated causal natural variants within a population. Specifically, the GWA with this collection of 797 accessions was unable to find 80% of the known causal loci including one of the three major effect loci, <italic>GS-OH</italic>. Maximizing the number of genotypes and the SNP marker density was unable to overcome the complications imposed by the complex pressures shaping the distribution of these traits, potentially due to unequal dense sampling from the different areas. In this system, the optimal path to identifying the causal polymorphisms has instead been a small number of Recombinant Inbred Line populations derived from randomly chosen parents. In complex adaptive systems, the optimal solution to identifying causal variants is likely a blend of structured mapping populations and then translating the causal genes from this system to the GWA results and tracking the causal loci directly.</p><p>In this work, we combined different approaches to uncover some of the parameters shaping the aliphatic GSL content across Europe. Widening the size of the population will enable us to deepen our understanding on the evolutionary mechanisms shaping a phenotype in a population.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><p>Seeds for 1135 Arabidopsis (<italic>A. thaliana</italic>) genotypes were obtained from the 1001 genomes catalog of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> genetic variation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://1001genomes.org/">https://1001genomes.org/</ext-link>).

glucosinolate chemotype variation across Arabidopsis ecotypes is linked to the underlying genetic variation. It demonstrates the complexity of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors and gives insights into how complex traits could evolve in natural populations. This article reveals the complexities involved in conducting genome-wide association studies on geographically structured populations which cannot be eliminated even in a very well studied system.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Arthur Korte (Reviewer #1); Juergen Kroymann (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers and editors agree that both the topic and the general approach are of interest. <italic>eLife</italic> would consider a substantially revised version of the manuscript which addresses the points raised by the individual reviewers and summarized below. Because we expect that these revisions represent substantial work, we would consider a revised manuscript as a new submission.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers and editors agree that the study could provide an important new insight into patterns and processes of evolution. In the words of Reviewer 1, it is valuable &quot;to present the complexity of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors and its contribution to trait evolution in natural populations.&quot; It is perhaps especially valuable to do so in such a well-studied system as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, as this indicates fundamental complexities which cannot be remedied by large volumes of data alone, but require well-informed approaches to analyze the data and in some cases, perhaps, cannot be resolved. Thus although we are not convinced that any one aspect of this study is very novel, we do think that the study as a whole presents an unusually holistic perspective and thus could be a very valuable contribution. Nevertheless, we also agree that there are substantial gaps and pitfalls in the analyses as they are currently presented, and these must be remedied in order for the conclusions of the study to be well supported:</p><p>1. We are concerned that MAM3 is not a good proxy for the GS-Elong locus, and there is evidence of recombination within MAM3; and that resequencing of this locus in the accessions studied is required to support the conclusions that the authors wish to draw in this study.

To this end, the authors carried out a very extensive characterization of different GLSs in a large collection of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Genetic analyses of these data show that the epistasis underlying causal loci hampers the identification of new loci. More importantly, authors compare these data with environmental factors to show significant environmental associations, which support a differential adaptive role of this variation across Europe. In addition, thorough genetic analyses of the major underlying genes identified multiple independent mutations in several duplicated genes, which demonstrate a repeated evolution pattern with differential geographic histories. Overall, this study shows a complex adaptive history of Arabidopsis plant defenses mediated by GLSs at a continental scale and brings forward our current understanding of adaptation of plant defense mechanisms.</p><p>Although most sections of the manuscript are written in a comprehensive manner, several sections of results and discussion are rather confusing due to lack of information on particular analyses. The following sections should be revised:</p><p>1. The section entitled &quot;Geography and environmental parameters affect GLS variation&quot; (pages 13-14) is very confusing due to an unclear distinction between demography and environment. Given the strong geographic structure of Arabidopsis genetic diversity across Europe (The 1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016), most genetic diversity can be expected to correlate with environment due to Arabidopsis demographic history but not reflecting true adaptive association. For this reason, to distinguish true environmental associations from correlations related with demographic history, analyses must take into account the genetic structure (genetic or genomic relationships among accessions). Usually, the effect of demographic factors on the distribution of genetic diversity is inferred by the genetic structure. According to Supp. Figure 7 and Materials and Methods, authors seem to have included such genetic structure in their MANOVA analyses, which is referred to as genomic group. However, authors should describe what are those genomic groups, and if they were included also in Figure 4B. As shown by Supp. Figures 7A and 8, the genetic structure explains most of the diversity in MANOVA and Random forest models, indicating that most of the geographic patterns can be explained by the demographic history. However, both Figures also show that there is still a significant association with environmental factors, which supports that the environment contributes to maintain the genetic diversity of chemotypes. The text describing these results should be carefully rewritten to explain how the genetic structure (demography) has been taken into account and separating clearly demographic and environmental components. The genetic structure is only mentioned in line 259 where it is confusingly named as &quot;ancestral state&quot;.</p><p>2. The section describing the genetic diversity of MAM3 across Europe (lines 302-326) shows certain overinterpretation of the action of natural selection, which should be revised and rewritten in a softer tone. For instance, the sentence in line 306 stating &quot;If the latter is true, this would argue for a selective pressure shaping this C3/C4 divide&quot;. The two scenarios described in paragraph of lines 302-306 could be explained by natural selection or demography, and one should be cautious interpreting geographic patterns. In particular, the geographic pattern observed in Iberia is just showing that this region contains a large diversity for C3/C4 chemotypes and MAM3, as shown previously for most genes in this region (The 1001 Genomes Consortium). Therefore, the sentence in lines 310-313 (&quot;This suggests that the strong geographic partitioning of the C3/C4 chemotypes in Iberia may be driven by selective pressure causing the partitioning of the chemotypes rather than neutral demographic processes&quot;) or lines 324-326 (&quot;…,Iberia, showing evidence of local selection while other regions, central Europe, possibly showing a blend requiring further work to delineate&quot;) are not fully supported by data. In addition, this section on MAM3 could include the recent study on the genetic diversity of Europe, which suggests that Iberia could have also been colonized from central Europe after the last glaciation (Lee et al., 2017; Nature Communications 8:14458).</p><p>3. The section describing GS-OH gene and Table 1 (lines 377-390) is rather confuse. In line 377 is stated: &quot;We could not identify the causal LOF in the other six accessions due to sequence quality&quot;. However, Table 1 shows the structure of GS-OH gene with apparent location of six mutations. It is unclear which are those six accessions of Table1, what is represented in the structure of the genes, and the meaning of symbols on those genes (A and the vertical bars). Are those accessions of Table 1 the same described in the text? It should also made clear the type of mutations of those six accessions instead of the confusing term &quot;Independent mutation&quot;. Furthermore, this section refers to Supplementary Table 2 (line 383), but I could not find such table.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is based on an impressive data set of (seed) glucosinolate profiles across Europe and beyond, with a focus on methionine-derived glucosinolates. However, the manuscript reads in many aspects like a 'best of' of previous research, with limited net gain in insight. In addition, there are substantial weaknesses (in particular relating to GS-Elong) that prevent me from recommending this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> its current state.</p><p>1. The representation of the MAM reaction is misleading and incorrect (lines 101ff). MAMs catalyze condensation of 2-oxoacids with acetylCoA. Two further reaction steps, catalyzed by an isomerase and a dehydrogenase, are necessary to complete chain extension. This extension consists formally in the addition of a methylene group per reaction cycle. With MAM2, the net result is an extension by one (not two!) methylene group, with MAM1 it is mostly two; note that methionine has already two methylene groups in the side chain! I suggest replacing the reference Abrahams et al., 2020, with Graser et al., 2000 (Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 378, 411-419). Furthermore, Kroymann et al., 2001 (Plant Phys. 127, 1077-1088), Benderoth et al., 2006 and Textor et al., 2007 (Plant Phys. 144, 60-71) should be added as original references for the MAM1, 2 and 3 reactions.</p><p>2. The use of MAM3 as a proxy for inferring the configuration of the GS-Elong locus is highly debatable. Even though recombination appears to be suppressed at and around GS-Elong, an additional gene (or additional genes) upstream of GS-Elong should be used to construct (a) gene tree(s) and compare with the MAM3 gene tree for congruency. In any case, without sequencing of the MAM genes at the GS-Elong locus, it is not possible to conclude that 'local' configurations of MAM1/MAM2 have not arisen in Iberia (or elsewhere).</p><p>3. The <italic>A. lyrata</italic> ortholog of Arabidopsis MAM3 is MAMb (not MAMc). The MAM3 gene tree does not provide any statistical support for the branching order. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the presented tree reflects the true branching order and whether the 'most basal' clade in the tree is indeed the most basal. Note also that the Cal-0 gene at the MAM2 position is actually mostly MAM2, except for a converted stretch towards the 3' end of the gene; see: Figure 2 in Kroymann et al., 2003. Hence, the most parsimonious interpretation of available data is that the ancestral state of GS-Elong in Arabidopsis is indeed: MAM2, MAM1 and MAM3. Note also that the Arabidopsis genes in Abrahams et al., 2020, are from TAIR 10, i.e. from Col-0 (see Table 1 in Abrahams et al., 2020). Because Col-0 does not have MAM2, this gene is not included in the gene trees presented by Abrahams et al., 2020.</p><p>4. Despite the use of an impressive number of accessions, sufficiently dense sampling appears to be only available for the Iberian peninsula, the southern coast of Sweden and the south-western coast of Italy. In this regard, the authors overstate their findings (e.g., lines 219ff).</p><p>5. While the link between glucosinolates and biotic stress is well documented, evidence for a major role of abiotic factors in shaping glucosinolate profiles is less well substantiated. Now, the authors seem to find that certain chemotypes are favored by high precipitation in 'the North' but that the same chemotypes are favored by low precipitation in 'the South'. This is interesting, but what could explain this unexpected pattern? Any idea? Furthermore, with additional sampling on the eastern coast of Italy and the eastern coast of the Adriatic, would you expect to obtain similar patterns?</p><p>6. Please, make sure that the citation style is uniform. Please also make sure that the tense is uniform throughout the manuscript. Please, simplify the introduction in a way that it is accessible by non-specialists. Please improve Figure 5D – this is a mess.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genetic variation, environment and demography intersect to shape Arabidopsis defense metabolite variation across Europe&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor.

We have serious concerns regarding the environmental association analyses. Since there is a general correlation between genetic/genomic/phenotypic diversity and environmental factors due to Arabidopsis demographic history, the overall genetic structure needs to be included in the statistical models testing the associations between traits and environmental factors. You should produce tables similar to that of Supplementary Figure 8A for the chemotypes of Figure 4 and derive statistical significances from these tables, in order to provide convincing evidence of the differential climatic patterns in both European regions.</p><p>2. The conceptual framework of repeated evolution that differentiates between parallel and convergent evolution was traditionally developed for interspecific evolution, not for intraspecific evolution where it refers to parallel evolution by multiple independent mutations in the same gene. The differentiation between parallel and convergent evolution for intraspecific evolution is not so straightforward. Therefore we want you to provide a more precise definition of intraspecific convergent and parallel chemotype evolution and outline the role of different or the same genes from a tandem repeat cluster, as well as the role of epistasis between duplicated genes, therein. To this end, the LD analysis between MAM genes and flowering genes should also be removed from the argumentation, because this analysis clearly shows that LD between these genes is not larger than average LD between random pairs of genes. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from this LD analysis is not supported.</p><p>We are optimistic that regardless of the outcome of the corrected environmental analysis (point 1), this study represents a valuable contribution, especially if the revised framework for intraspecific repeated evolution – helping to conceptually unite studies of population and functional genetics in an apt system – can be articulated and illustrated more clearly in the revised analysis (point 2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this new version of the Manuscript by Katz et al., authors address numerous important questions raised in the previous version, and rewrite many of the paragraphs that were confusing or incorrect. In this version authors provide better support for some of their conclusions in a more comprehensive manuscript. However, this Reviewer still has serious concerns regarding the environmental association analyses carried out in this study to support their conclusions. In addition, for clarity and comprehension I also suggest addressing an important conceptual issue, as well as the numerous editorial points described below.</p><p>1A. As explained in previous Reviewer 2 report to Authors, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> there is a general correlation between genetic/genomic/phenotypic diversity and environmental factors due to Arabidopsis demographic history. For this reason, the overall genetic structure needs to be included in the statistical models testing the associations between traits and environmental factors. Authors now provide more detailed description of the statistical tests applied for such associations. However, as stated in Materials and methods, the statistical models used to build Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 8B do not include the genomic groups. Therefore, significant associations described in these Figures and throughout the manuscript are mainly reflecting the association of genomic groups (demographic history) with climate. These two figures are the main support for the differential environmental associations in Northern and Southern Europe, but they just show that different genomic groups are present in each geographic area. It seems that such differential association between climate and chemotypes might be true, as shown by the table of Supplementary Figure 8A, where authors include the genomic groups to test the differential association specifically for C3 and C4 status. However, in this table the variable &quot;Precipitation for the driest moth&quot; appears as non-significantly associated. In spite of this, authors choose this variable in Supplementary Figure 8B (as well as in Figure 4A) to illustrate that this climatic variable is associated when applying a simple t-test to compare both groups. This test does not support such environmental association because it is not controlling for the genomic group (demographic history). By contrast, the table of Supplementary Figure 8 shows a stronger differential association in Northern and Southern Europe for minimum temperature, which is associated only in the south but not in the north. Tables similar to that of Supplementary Figure 8A should be provided for the chemotypes of Figure 4, and statistical significances should be derived from them, in order to provide convincing evidence of their differential climatic patterns in both European regions.</p><p>1B. Related with the environmental associations, authors include random forest analyses. However, in the way these analyses are presented, they are hard to interpret because variables with the lowest mean decrease Gini (the probability of the variable of being wrong according to Authors) mostly have the lowest mean decrease accuracy (suitability of the variable as predictor).</p><p>2. A major goal of this manuscript is the distinction between convergent and parallel evolutions in GSL chemotypes, which are described as two different patterns of repeated evolution. However, these concepts have been classically developed to characterize interspecific evolution, and their translation into the intraspecific variation is not straight forward, thus requiring a precise definition of both alternatives. Authors define parallel and convergent evolution as traits derived from either the same or different &quot;genetic backgrounds&quot;. In this definition, the concept of genetic background is very vague and it is unclear what is meant. Authors apply these two concepts to the particular case of repeated evolution of GSL chemotypes evolved specifically from two tandem duplicated genes (MAM and AOP loci). Given the epistasis between these pairs of duplicated genes, the same trait can be derived from the same or different gene within. Then, it seems to this Reviewer that Authors mean by parallel and convergent evolution, the evolution occurring from the same or different gene of the cluster, respectively. In my opinion, this dissection of repeated evolution for the specific case of duplicated genes with epistasis is a major contribution of this study, but it is hard to understand. The manuscript and the audience would benefit by making these concepts clearer. I suggest that Authors add this in discussion, (e.g. paragraph of lines 550-554), explaining the role of different or the same gene from tandem repeat cluster, as well as the role of epistasis between duplicated genes for the distinction of their concepts of parallel and convergent evolution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors present a substantial revised version of their manuscript that improved in clarity.

This suggests that the haplotypes within a chemotype are more random across the landscape than the chemotype providing evidence supportive of selective delineation but not definitive.

To test for within locus recombination that may be confusing us, we compared this tree to the MAM3. The vast majority of accessions showed the same major clade memberships in both the MAM3 and MYB37 trees arguing against a high level of within locus recombination. We also reanalyzed our analysis using just the 637 accessions with perfect agreement in the two trees and these showed the same message. Thus, our overarching patterns are not confounded by recombination shuffling this locus.</p><p>We realized that we had been inaccurate when discussing a local Iberian haplotype as we’d meant to mean a single haplotype explaining all C3/C4 diversity Iberia. The reviewers comment led us to search for possible true local haplotypes by using the few accessions that have an incongruency in the MYB37/MAM3/C3/C4 data. This identified a collection of 6 accessions in a very narrow region of Iberia that appear to have developed a new local haplotype that requires further sequencing. We added a supp. Figure that describes the detection of these accessions and added this comment to the manuscript. Additionally, we have obtained new genomic sequences of the MAM locus for 11 accessions that resample the existing haplotypes and sample new haplotypes from the clades previously not sampled. These sequences support the classification of the accessions to the clades based on the MAM3 sequences, and the use of the MAM3 gene as a proxy to the MAM1/MAM2 haplotypes. In combination this suggests that while there is at least one local haplotype in Iberia, the vast majority of accessions in Iberia don’t have unique events, and the presence of these few accessions will not change the overall message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Because Col-0 does not have MAM2, this gene is not included in the gene trees presented by Abrahams et al., 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>The MAM3 tree was indeed rooted by <italic>A. lyrata</italic> MAMb, and not MAMc as was written in the manuscript. This was a typo that was corrected. As for the gene tree presented in Abrahams et al., – we teamed up with them to recreate the tree, this time including MAM2 (supp. Figure x).</p><p>For the MAM3 tree, we have worked in several ways to determine the proper support for this tree and the claims. The tree with all accessions has some sequences that are not maximal quality which influences the bootstrapping but not the clade assignment. To improve our precision, we created a tree using 637 accessions that have the highest quality accessions for MAM3 (supp. Figure 10). The accessions in the new tree classified to the same clades as in the original MAM3 tree. The only difference between the trees (original tree and the cleaner tree) was the order of the clades. We then created multiple smaller trees, each contain a different combination of 200300 accessions. In each of these trees the accessions classified to the same clades as the original MAM3 tree, with bootstrap support. This agrees with the reviewer’s assessment that the evolutionary relationships between the clades are not resolvable but that the clades are decently defined. As we don’t have a strong support to the orders of the clades, we soften our tone in the manuscript in the part talking about the clades order and the ancestral state of the locus. We have discussed the most functionally parsimonious model of the ancestral state being MAM2/1/3 but also noted that this model requires a MAM1/2 duplication and diversification following the split from <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and ensuing structural variation to create the haplotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Despite the use of an impressive number of accessions, sufficiently dense sampling appears to be only available for the Iberian peninsula, the southern coast of Sweden and the south-western coast of Italy. In this regard, the authors overstate their findings (e.g., lines 219ff).</p></disp-quote><p>We added this clarification to several locations along the text (results and discussion) and soften our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While the link between glucosinolates and biotic stress is well documented, evidence for a major role of abiotic factors in shaping glucosinolate profiles is less well substantiated. Now, the authors seem to find that certain chemotypes are favored by high precipitation in 'the North' but that the same chemotypes are favored by low precipitation in 'the South'. This is interesting, but what could explain this unexpected pattern? Any idea? Furthermore, with additional sampling on the eastern coast of Italy and the eastern coast of the Adriatic, would you expect to obtain similar patterns?</p></disp-quote><p>We think what is happening is that the abiotic factors are capturing the biotic environment but there are no universal databases describing the biotic environment. We have added the following to try and describe this “The above analysis is extensively using Abiotic factors because of their availability while Aliphatic GSLs have mainly been linked biotic interactions. Our best hypothesis is that the abiotic factors used in this model are capturing variation in the biotic environments. However, an Aliphatic GSL was recently mechanistically linked to drought resistance in Arabidopsis (Salehin et al., 2019). This suggests a need to capture the biotic as well as the abiotic components of any given environment to distinguish what may be driving these patterns.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Please, simplify the introduction in a way that it is accessible by non-specialists. Please improve Figure 5D – this is a mess.</p></disp-quote><p>We have worked to correct tense and citation style. We re-organized the whole figure to make it cleaner and clearer. We moved part D to the supplementary so part C (the map) will have more space. Hopefully it helped to make things less messy.

We have serious concerns regarding the environmental association analyses.

The conceptual framework of repeated evolution that differentiates between parallel and convergent evolution was traditionally developed for interspecific evolution, not for intraspecific evolution where it refers to parallel evolution by multiple independent mutations in the same gene. The differentiation between parallel and convergent evolution for intraspecific evolution is not so straightforward. Therefore we want you to provide a more precise definition of intraspecific convergent and parallel chemotype evolution and outline the role of different or the same genes from a tandem repeat cluster, as well as the role of epistasis between duplicated genes, therein. To this end, the LD analysis between MAM genes and flowering genes should also be removed from the argumentation, because this analysis clearly shows that LD between these genes is not larger than average LD between random pairs of genes. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from this LD analysis is not supported.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote the sections concerning parallel/convergent evolution throughout the manuscript (more details are below) and added an introductory figure that will hopefully facilitate a better conveyance of how we are attempting to incorporate these terms in this work.

In this version authors provide better support for some of their conclusions in a more comprehensive manuscript. However, this Reviewer still has serious concerns regarding the environmental association analyses carried out in this study to support their conclusions. In addition, for clarity and comprehension I also suggest addressing an important conceptual issue, as well as the numerous editorial points described below.</p><p>1A. As explained in previous Reviewer 2 report to Authors, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> there is a general correlation between genetic/genomic/phenotypic diversity and environmental factors due to Arabidopsis demographic history. For this reason, the overall genetic structure needs to be included in the statistical models testing the associations between traits and environmental factors. Authors now provide more detailed description of the statistical tests applied for such associations. However, as stated in Materials and methods, the statistical models used to build Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 8B do not include the genomic groups. Therefore, significant associations described in these Figures and throughout the manuscript are mainly reflecting the association of genomic groups (demographic history) with climate. These two figures are the main support for the differential environmental associations in Northern and Southern Europe, but they just show that different genomic groups are present in each geographic area. It seems that such differential association between climate and chemotypes might be true, as shown by the table of Supplementary Figure 8A, where authors include the genomic groups to test the differential association specifically for C3 and C4 status. However, in this table the variable &quot;Precipitation for the driest moth&quot; appears as non-significantly associated. In spite of this, authors choose this variable in Supplementary Figure 8B (as well as in Figure 4A) to illustrate that this climatic variable is associated when applying a simple t-test to compare both groups. This test does not support such environmental association because it is not controlling for the genomic group (demographic history). By contrast, the table of Supplementary Figure 8 shows a stronger differential association in Northern and Southern Europe for minimum temperature, which is associated only in the south but not in the north. Tables similar to that of Supplementary Figure 8A should be provided for the chemotypes of Figure 4, and statistical significances should be derived from them, in order to provide convincing evidence of their differential climatic patterns in both European regions.</p></disp-quote><p>We rerun the models, and now all the models include the genomic group. As suggested, for Figure 4 (now Table 1) we created a table in the same manner as the one in supp figure 8. All the p-values in the analyses are derived from models that include the genomic group. We rewrote the corresponding sections accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1B. Related with the environmental associations, authors include random forest analyses. However, in the way these analyses are presented, they are hard to interpret because variables with the lowest mean decrease Gini (the probability of the variable of being wrong according to Authors) mostly have the lowest mean decrease accuracy (suitability of the variable as predictor).</p></disp-quote><p>We had intended the random forest to convey the differential ranks of the different genetic and environmental parameters across geography. We agree that this is not well shown in the current representation and we removed this analysis from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A major goal of this manuscript is the distinction between convergent and parallel evolutions in GSL chemotypes, which are described as two different patterns of repeated evolution. However, these concepts have been classically developed to characterize interspecific evolution, and their translation into the intraspecific variation is not straight forward, thus requiring a precise definition of both alternatives. Authors define parallel and convergent evolution as traits derived from either the same or different &quot;genetic backgrounds&quot;. In this definition, the concept of genetic background is very vague and it is unclear what is meant. Authors apply these two concepts to the particular case of repeated evolution of GSL chemotypes evolved specifically from two tandem duplicated genes (MAM and AOP loci). Given the epistasis between these pairs of duplicated genes, the same trait can be derived from the same or different gene within. Then, it seems to this Reviewer that Authors mean by parallel and convergent evolution, the evolution occurring from the same or different gene of the cluster, respectively. In my opinion, this dissection of repeated evolution for the specific case of duplicated genes with epistasis is a major contribution of this study, but it is hard to understand. The manuscript and the audience would benefit by making these concepts clearer. I suggest that Authors add this in discussion, (e.g. paragraph of lines 550-554), explaining the role of different or the same gene from tandem repeat cluster, as well as the role of epistasis between duplicated genes for the distinction of their concepts of parallel and convergent evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote this section to emphasize the above points. For the discussion we split this into two paragraphs, one on epistasis and one on convergent/parallel to better convey these concepts. We have also reworked the initial paragraph within the introduction to try and translate the interspecific concept to the intraspecific analogy we are contemplating. Specifically that genetic background is a specific haplotype and that if parallel evolution would be a new chemotype arising by independent mutations in a single haplotype to give the new chemotype multiple times. Convergent evolution would be where a new chemotype arose by independent mutations in different haplotypes both giving rise to a single new chemotype. To make sure that our idea is clear we added an introductory figure (Figure 1) that presents how we are trying to incorporate these terms in this work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
