ΔNp73 is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and necessary for neuronal development. Interestingly, while TAp73α is a tumor suppressor and predominantly expressed in normal cells, TAp73 is found to be frequently altered in human cancers, suggesting a role of TAp73 C-terminal isoforms in tumorigenesis. To test this, the TCGA SpliceSeq database was searched and showed that exon 11 (E11) exclusion occurs frequently in several human cancers. We also found that p73α to p73γ isoform switch resulting from E11 skipping occurs frequently in human prostate cancers and dog lymphomas. To determine whether p73α to p73γ isoform switch plays a role in tumorigenesis, CRISPR technology was used to generate multiple cancer cell lines and a mouse model in that <italic>Trp73</italic> E11 is deleted. Surprisingly, we found that in E11-deificient cells, p73γ becomes the predominant isoform and exerts oncogenic activities by promoting cell proliferation and migration. In line with this, E11-deficient mice were more prone to obesity and B-cell lymphomas, indicating a unique role of p73γ in lipid metabolism and tumorigenesis. Additionally, we found that E11<italic>-</italic>deficient mice phenocopies <italic>Trp73</italic>-deficient mice with short lifespan, infertility, and chronic inflammation. Mechanistically, we showed that Leptin, a pleiotropic adipocytokine involved in energy metabolism and oncogenesis, was highly induced by p73γ,necessary for p73γ-mediated oncogenic activity, and associated with p73α to γ isoform switch in human prostate cancer and dog lymphoma. Finally, we showed that E11-knockout promoted, whereas knockdown of p73γ or Leptin suppressed, xenograft growth in mice. Our study indicates that the p73γ-Leptin pathway promotes tumorigenesis and alters lipid metabolism, which may be targeted for cancer management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TAp73</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>Leptin</kwd><kwd>oncogenesis</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>TAp73γ</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA081237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xinbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA224433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xinbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA093373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xinbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005188</institution-id><institution>Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T31IP1727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016512</institution-id><institution>Center for Companion Animal Health, University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-13-F</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016512</institution-id><institution>Center for Companion Animal Health, University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-7-F</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mouse model reveals that TAp73γ functions as an oncogene to promote tumorigenesis and alter lipid metabolism by modulating leptin expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>TP73</italic> gene encodes a member of the p53 family of transcription factors involved in tumor suppression and development. <italic>TP73</italic> gene is mapped to a region on human chromosome 1p36 that is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and other tumors, thus linking its role to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaghad et al., 1997</xref>). p73 shares a high similarity with p53 in the transactivation, tetramerization, and DNA-binding domains, with most considerable homology between their DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harms et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, p73 activates a number of putative p53 target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harms et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ichimiya et al., 2000</xref>). Despite these similarities, p73 is not functionally redundant to p53. <italic>TP73</italic> is rarely mutated but frequently found to be upregulated in human cancers, indicating that p73 is not a classic Knudson-type tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ozaki and Nakagawara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nomoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nimura et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, the biological functions of p73 have been linked to neurological development, tumorigenesis, ciliogenesis, fertility, and metabolism as illustrated by in vitro and in vivo models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nemajerova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tissir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilhelm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tomasini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rufini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inoue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulloo et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>The role of p73 in cancer is complicated due to the presence of multiple p73 isoforms that coordinate in a complex way to exert both oncogenic and non-oncogenic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulloo et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nemajerova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rufini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stiewe and Pützer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amelio et al., 2015</xref>). Through the usage of two promoters, <italic>TP73</italic> encodes two classes of isoforms, TAp73 and N-terminally truncated ΔNp73. TAp73 isoforms, driven by the P1 promoter located upstream of exon 1, contain a transactivation domain similar to that in p53 and thus are suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. ΔNp73 isoforms, arising from the P2 promoter located in intron 3, lack the N-terminal transactivation domain, and thus, are thought to have oncogenic potential by acting as dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 and TAp73. Mice deficient in ΔNp73 isoforms are not prone to tumors, but have defects in neurological development similar to that in total Trp73-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tissir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilhelm et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, mice deficient in TAp73 isoforms develop spontaneous and carcinogens-induced tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tomasini et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a role of TAp73 as tumor suppressor. However, several recent studies also showed that TAp73 exhibits both pro-tumorigenic activities depend on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulloo et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharif et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that the role of TAp73 in tumorigenesis is far more complex, likely being affected by the various C-terminal TAp73 isoforms.</p><p>At the C-terminus, multiple p73 isoforms are generated due to alternative splicing from exons 11–13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray-Zmijewski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vikhreva et al., 2018</xref>). At transcript levels, six splicing variants (α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ) can be detected. However, at protein levels, only three isoforms (α, β, and γ) can be detected, with α being the most abundantly expressed. Due to lack of proper model systems and reagents, most studies about p73 C-terminal isoforms have been done in cell culture and, thus, may not reflect the authentic biological role of these isoforms. When overexpressed, p73β showed very strong, whereas p73α and p73γ exhibited much weaker, activity to induce programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu and Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ueda et al., 1999</xref>). These differential activities are suggested due to the variation of C-terminal sequence among p73 C-terminal isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vikhreva et al., 2018</xref>). p73α, the longest isoform, has 636 aa and contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) and an extreme C-terminal domain, both of which are thought to inhibit its transcriptional activity through interaction with other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozaki et al., 1999</xref>). p73γ is produced from splicing out of exon 11, which creates a long alternative reading frame that leads early stop codon. As a result, TAp73γ has 475 aa and contains a unique C-terminal domain (the last 76 aa) with unknown function. By contrast, p73β does not contain an extended C-terminal domain present in both p73α and p73γ. Nevertheless, these hypotheses have never been tested in vivo. The difficulties to study the physiological roles of p73 C-terminal isoforms are mainly due to the following reasons: (1) the presence of TA/ΔN isoforms with opposing functions, which adds complications to study the C-terminal isoforms; (2) p73α is the major isoform expressed in most cells and tissues and may shield activities by other isoforms; and (3) lack of specific antibodies to detect β or γ isoforms. These limitations may have led to two opposing functions for TAp73 as a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sabapathy, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Leptin is a 167-amino-acid peptide hormone encoded by the <italic>Ob</italic> gene and produced by a multitude of tissues, especially adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>). Leptin communicates with its receptor (LepR) in the hypothalamus and controls energy expenditure and appetite through a negative feedback loop, thereby maintaining the relative constancy of adipose tissue mass from being too thin or too obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedman, 2019</xref>). The anti-obesity effect of Leptin was demonstrated in individuals bearing congenital leptin deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farooqi et al., 1999</xref>). It was later found out that leptin therapy is ineffective as most obese individuals have a high level of endogenous plasma leptin (hyperleptinemia) and do not respond to leptin therapy, a condition called leptin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frederich et al., 1995</xref>). As a pleiotropic cytokine, leptin plays a critical role in lipid/glucose homeostasis, immune responses, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, reproduction, and mental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chehab et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ducy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sierra-Honigmann et al., 1998</xref>). Leptin signaling is also found to promote cancer progression, including cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ray and Cleary, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, both leptin and LepR are frequently altered in many obesity-associated cancers, including lung, breast, ovarian, pancreas, liver, and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hosney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin and Hsiao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karabulut et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, targeting Leptin-LepR signaling may represent a novel strategy for cancer therapeutics.</p><p>To understand the role of various p73 C-terminal isoforms in cancer development, we searched the TCGA SpliceSeq database and found that <italic>Trp73</italic> E11 skipping, which led to isoform switch from p73α to p73γ, frequently occurs in a subset of human cancers and dog lymphomas. Thus, to explore the biological function of p73γ isoform, we employed CRISPR technology to manipulate p73 splicing by deleting E11 in the <italic>TP73</italic> gene in multiple cancer cell lines and mice. We showed that E11 deficiency resulted in p73γ becoming the predominant isoform in both human and mouse cells. Unexpectedly, we found that p73γ, when expressed at a physiologically relevant level, did not behave as a tumor suppressor, but promoted cell migration and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we showed that Leptin, a pleiotropic adipocytokine, was induced by p73γ and contributes to p73γ-mediated tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found that p73α to γ isoform switch was detected in a subset of dog lymphomas and human prostate carcinomas along with elevated expression of Leptin. Finally, we showed that targeting p73γ or Leptin led to growth suppression of E11-KO xenografts in a mouse xenograft model, suggesting that the p73γ-Leptin pathway may be explored for cancer management.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p73α-γ switch is detected in a subset of human prostate carcinomas and dog lymphomas</title><p>Early studies have shown that p73 C-terminal isoforms are dysregulated in breast cancer and leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rufini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zaika et al., 1999</xref>). However, it is not clear how p73 C-terminal isoforms are altered and whether these alterations play a role in tumorigenesis. In this regard, we examined the splicing pattern of <italic>TP73</italic> in normal and tumor tissues by using the TCGA SpliceSeq database. Interestingly, we found that the percentage of exon 11 exclusion was much higher in lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSCs) and head-neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCs) when compared to their respective normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We would like to note that exon 11 skipping would lead to production of two p73 isoforms: p73γ, which is switched from p73α, and p73ε, which is switched from p73β. Thus, to determine which p73 isoform is altered in cancer tissues, expression of <italic>p73α</italic>, <italic>p73γ</italic>, and <italic>p73ε</italic> transcripts was measured in 5 normal human prostates and 16 prostate carcinomas. We found that <italic>p73α</italic> was detectable in 5 normal prostates, undetectable in 12 prostate carcinomas, and unaltered or slightly elevated in 4 prostate carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). By contrast, <italic>p73γ</italic> was highly expressed in prostate carcinomas compared to that in normal prostates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, compare lanes 1–5 with 6–13). Additionally, <italic>p73ε</italic> was almost undetectable at both normal and prostate cancer tissues (data not shown). Similarly, we found that <italic>p73α</italic> was expressed in 3 normal dog lymph nodes but undetectable in 16 dog lymphomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>p73</italic>α panel, compare lanes 1–3 with 4–16). By contrast, p73γ expression was very low in 3 normal dog lymph nodes but elevated in all 16 dog lymphomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>p73</italic>γ panel, compare lanes 1–3 with 4–16).

Thus, a peptide (PRDAQQPWPRSASQRRDE) derived from the unique C-terminal region in p73γ/ε was used to generate an antibody, called anti-p73γ/ε antibody, which was found to recognize p73γ/ε but not p73α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We showed that in isogenic control cells TAp73α was the mostly abundant protein expressed as detected by an anti-TAp73 antibody, whereas in E11-KO cells, TAp73γ became the predominantly expressed isoform and was detected by anti-p73γ/ε antibody under normal and DNA-damage induced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Nevertheless, other p73 isoforms, including p73β and p73ε, remained undetectable likely due to their low abundance. These data confirmed that deletion of the acceptor site for E11 in <italic>TP73</italic> led to E11 skipping and subsequently resulted in isoform switch from p73α in isogenic control cells to p73γ in E11-KO cells.</p><p>By using two different promoters, p73 C-terminal isoforms are expressed as TA/ΔNp73 proteins, which are known to have opposing functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rufini et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, when studying the p73 C-terminal isoforms, it is also important to consider the N-terminal variations. To this end, stable TAp73- or ΔNp73-KO H1299 and Mia-PaCa2 cell were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and used as controls to study the function of E11 deficiency. We found that knockout of TAp73 enhanced, whereas knockout of ΔNp73 reduced, colony formation compared to isogenic control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the number of colonies formed by E11-KO cells was higher than that by TAp73-KO cells, becoming the highest among all four cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To verify this, tumor sphere formation assay was performed and showed that loss of TAp73 or E11 promoted, whereas loss of ΔNp73 inhibited, cell proliferation in H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Moreover, to examine whether E11 deficiency affects cell migration, scratch assay was performed. We found that knockout of TAp73 promoted, whereas knockout of ΔNp73 slightly inhibited, cell migration in H1299 and Mia-PaCa2 cells in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, E11-KO cells migrated even faster than isogenic control or TAp73-KO H1299 and Mia-PaCa2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Consistently, transwell migration assay showed that E11-KO H1299 cells exhibited a markedly enhanced ability to transmigrate through a membrane compared to isogenic control, TAp73-KO, and ΔNp73-KO H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Furthermore, to determine whether E11 deficiency has an effect on epithelial morphogenesis, E11-KO, TAp73-KO, and ΔNp73-KO MCF10A cells were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>) and then subjected to three-dimensional (3-D) culture. We found that parental and isogenic control MCF10A cells underwent normal cell morphogenesis (acini with hollow lumen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, left two panels), whereas ΔNp73-KO showed delayed acinus formation (small acini) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, ΔNp73 panel). Interestingly, E11-KO and TAp73-KO showed aberrant cell morphogenesis (irregular acini with filled lumen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, TAp73-KO and E11-KO panels).

Thus, to characterize the role of TAp73γ in oncogenesis, stable H1299 cell lines in that TAp73γ can be inducibly expressed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Next, to determine the role of endogenous p73γ in cell proliferation and migration, two p73α/γ siRNAs (si-p73α/γ#1 or #2), which were designed to target the junction region of E12-E13 or E13-E14 in <italic>p73α/γ</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), were synthesized and found to efficiently knock down p73α and p73γ in isogenic control and E11-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Next, cell migration was measured by scratch and transwell assays. We showed that knockdown of p73α/γ enhanced cell migration in isogenic control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Thus, E11-KO mice were not suitable for long-term tumor study. However, young E11-HET mice appeared to be normal. In this regard, a cohort of E11-HET mice was generated and monitored for potential abnormalities along with WT and <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. We would like to mention that to minimize the number of animals used, all WT and 26 out of 30 <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice, which were generated previously but had same genetic background and maintained in the same facility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), were used as controls. We found that the lifespan for E11-HET mice (96 wk) and <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (88 wk) was much shorter than that for WT mice (117 wk) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, there was no difference in lifespan between <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and E11-HET mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Pathological analysis indicated that 11 out of 51 WT mice, 13 out of 27 <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, and 17 out of 28 E11-HET mice developed spontaneous tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a–c</xref>). Statistical analysis indicated that the tumor incidence was significantly higher for both <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and E11-HET mice compared to that for WT mice (p=0.0211 for WT vs. <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic>; p=0.0011 for WT vs. E11-HET by Fisher’s exact test). Interestingly, although there was no difference in tumor incidence between E11-HET and <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, the percentage of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was significantly higher in E11-HET mice (50%) than that in <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (14.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>; p=0.009 by Fisher’s exact test).

Specifically, 17 out of 27 <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and 8 out of 28 E11-HET mice, whereas 0 out of 51 WT mice, showed chronic inflammation in three or more organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a–c</xref>).

Moreover, compared to WT mice, <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and E11-HET mice were prone to EMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Together, these data indicated that E11-deficient mice phenocopies <italic>Trp73</italic>-deficient mice in short lifespan, infertility, chronic inflammation, and tumor incidence, indicating that p73γ cannot compensate p73α for tumor suppression and fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>E11</italic>-deficient mice are prone to obesity</title><p>We noticed that E11-HET mice were bigger and fattier compared to WT mice. We also found that the size of adipocytes was larger in both male and female E11-HET mice than that in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Likewise, a significant increase in visceral fat (VAT) mass was observed in both male and female E11-HET mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B annd C</xref>). Moreover, compared to WT mice, E11-HET but not <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice showed increased incidence in liver steatosis as characterized by lipid deposition in the hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Consistently, the levels of transcripts for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and γ-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neuman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sookoian et al., 2016</xref>), all of which are associated with liver steatosis, were increased in E11-HET livers compared to WT liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These observations let us speculate that E11 deficiency promotes obesity in mice. To test this, the level of serum cholesterol and triglycerides was measured and found to be much higher in E11-HET mice than that in WT and <italic>Trp73<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice at ~65 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>), suggesting that E11 deficiency enhances lipid storage. Consistent with this, younger E11-HET mice at 20 or 32 wk also showed increased body weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>) and elevated levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>) compared to WT mice. Furthermore, to examine whether p73γ is responsible for decreased lipid catabolism observed in E11-HET mice, the level of cholesterol and triglycerides was measured in isogenic control and E11-KO cells with or without knockdown of p73γ. We found that E11 deficiency led to marked increase in the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in both H1299 and Mia-PaCa2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).

As a positive control, TAp73γ bound to the p21 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), a bona fide target of the p53 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El-Deiry et al., 1993</xref>). Consistent with this, endogenous p73γ were able to bind to the Leptin promoter in E11-KO H1299 cells compared to isogenic control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>). Furthermore, to determine whether the p73-RE (nt –346 to –321) is required for TAp73 to transactivate the Leptin promoter, luciferase reporters that contain WT or mutant p73-RE were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). We found that TAp73α/β/γ were able to activate the Leptin-WT reporter, with the strongest activation by TAp73γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). By contrast, all TAp73 isoforms were unable to transactivate the luciferase reporter containing mutant p73-RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). Together, these data indicate that Leptin is a novel target of TAp73γ and may play a role in TAp73γ-induced oncogenic activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Leptin is a critical mediator of TAp73γ in oncogenesis and altered lipid metabolism</title><p>Leptin is known to play a critical role in oncogenesis through altered lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sánchez-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sabol et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park and Scherer, 2011</xref>). Thus, we examined whether knockdown of <italic>Leptin</italic> has any effect on the level of cholesterol and triglycerides by using two different <italic>Leptin</italic> siRNAs in both H1299 and Mia-PaCa2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

By contrast, the enhanced cell migration by E11-KO was abolished by knockdown of <italic>Leptin</italic> in both H1299 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and Mia-PaCa2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), consistent with the observation that knockdown of <italic>p73γ</italic> also abolished the enhanced cell migration by E11-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further analyze the role of Leptin in p73γ-mediated cell migration, we asked whether supplementation of Leptin would have an effect on cell migration. To make sure that the effect of Leptin is transmitted through its receptor, we measure the expression of Leptin receptor (LepR). We found that <italic>LepR</italic> was expressed at a similar level across isogenic control, TAp73-KO and E11-KO H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>), suggesting that these cells have an intact Leptin signaling pathway and that <italic>LepR</italic> expression is not regulated by p73.

Furthermore, to determine whether the p73γ-Leptin axis plays a role in cancer progression, we examined whether the expression pattern of Leptin is correlated with that of p73γ in human prostate carcinomas and dog lymphomas. We found that Leptin expression was low in normal human prostates but highly elevated in prostate carcinomas, which correlates well with the expression of <italic>p73γ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, Leptin and p73γ panels, compare lanes 1–5 with 6–13).

While TA and ΔNp73 isoforms are shown to exert opposing activities in tumorigenesis by multiple in vitro and in vivo model systems, the biological significance of C-terminal p73 splicing variants (α, β, and γ) remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we aimed to manipulate alternative splicing of <italic>TP73</italic> using CRISPR-Cas9. We showed that deletion of E11 in <italic>TP73</italic> leads to isoform switch from p73α to p73γ in both human cancer cells and mice. Importantly, we found that owing to p73γ expression, E11 deficiency leads to enhanced tumorigenesis and obesity in vitro and in vitro. Moreover, we identified Leptin, a key hormone in energy homeostasis, as a novel target of p73 and a critical mediator of TAp73γ in oncogenesis and aberrant lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we showed that p73α-γ switch is detected in a subset of dog lymphomas, along with elevated expression of Leptin. Finally, to explore the therapeutic potential of the p73γ-Leptin pathway, we showed that E11-KO promotes, whereas knockdown of p73γ or Leptin suppresses, H1299 xenograft growth in mice. These results have provided compelling evidence and prompted us to hypothesize that p73 C-terminal isoforms, that is, TAp73α and TAp73γ, can exert two opposing functions in tumorigenesis in a manner similar to that by TA and ΔN p73 isoforms. These results may have also explained the discrepancies in several early studies that TAp73 have both pro- and anti-tumorigenic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulloo et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amelio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharif et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sabapathy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stantic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dulloo et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernandez-Alonso et al., 2015</xref>), which are exerted by TAp73α and TAp73γ, respectively.

Here, we showed that when expressed at a physiological relevant level in vivo, TAp73γ possesses an oncogenic activity whereas TAp73α has a tumor-suppressive function. Specifically, we showed that knockout or knockdown of TAp73α, the major isoform in H1299 and Mia-PaCa2 cells, leads to enhanced cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E–G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). By contrast, E11 deficiency, which switches TAp73α to TAp73γ, leads to enhanced cell proliferation and migration as well as xenograft tumor growth, which can be attenuated by knockdown of p73γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E–G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C, F</xref>). Moreover, mice deficient in <italic>Trp73</italic>, presumably p73α, were prone to spontaneous tumors, such as lymphoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with previous observations that loss of <italic>Trp73</italic> promotes Myc-induced B-cell lymphomas or mutant p53-mediated T-cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nemajerova et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, E11-deficient mice were prone to spontaneous tumors, such as DLBCLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), presumably due to elevated p73γ expression in these mice. Furthermore, we showed that while p73α was detectable in normal tissues, p73γ was elevated in a subset of dog lymphomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggest that p73α and p73γ have opposing functions in tumorigenesis and that isoform switch from p73α to p73γ is a critical event for cancer progression. Indeed, we found that percentage of exon 11 exclusion, which would produce p73γ isoform, was much higher in tumor samples compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In line with this, TAp73γ transcript was found to be aberrantly expressed in human hematological malignancies, such as leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tschan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandrova and Moll, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pluta et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, one study showed that in breast cancer p73α and p73β are the main isoforms expressed in normal breast tissues, whereas other C-terminal splice variants, including p73γ, are mainly detected in breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zaika et al., 1999</xref>). However, the factor that contributes to the alternative splicing of p73 isoforms has not been identified, which worth further investigation. Indeed, several RNA-binding proteins, such as RBM38 and PCBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yan et al., 2012</xref>), are found to post-transcriptionally regulate p73 expression. Thus, it would be interesting to determine whether these RNA-binding proteins play a role in modulating alternative splicing of <italic>TP73</italic>. In addition, we noticed that surrounding sequence of <italic>TP73</italic> exon 11 acceptor site is different from that of exon 12. Thus, studies are needed to determine whether the acceptor site of exon 11 is a weak splicing site and thus, spliced out. Additionally, it is also important to identify a splicing factor that mediates exon 11 splicing out. We believe that addressing these questions will help better understand the role of p73γ in cancer, which would lay a foundation to develop a strategy to target p73γ for cancer management.</p><p>In addition to tumorigenesis, we noticed that p73α and p73γ have distinct and overlapped roles in multiple pathological processes based on the phenotypes from <italic>Trp73</italic>- and E11-deficient mice. We reasoned that if p73γ can compensate for loss of p73α, no abnormalities would be observed in E11-deficient mice. Instead, we found that both <italic>Trp73</italic>- and E11-deficient mice were runty, infertile, and prone to hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2000</xref>). We also found that <italic>Trp73</italic>-deficient mice and to a lesser degree, E11-deficient mice, were susceptible to chronic inflammation and splenic hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref>). These data indicate that p73α has distinct roles in hydrocephalus, fertility, chronic inflammation, and splenic hyperplasia, which cannot be fully substituted by p73γ. On the other hand, p73γ appeared to have a prominent role in lipid metabolism. Specifically, we found that E11-deficient mice were prone to spontaneous liver steatosis, increased body weight and VAT mass, and elevated serum triglycerides and cholesterol, all of which were not observed in <italic>Trp73</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). To verify the role of p73γ in lipogenesis, we showed that the elevated level of cholesterol and triglycerides by E11-KO was abrogated by knockdown of p73γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that p73α and p73γ may have opposing roles in lipid metabolism in that p73γ promotes, whereas p73α inhibits, lipogenesis.</p><p>In this study, we found that Leptin expression is induced by p73γ, leading to elevated level of Leptin in serum, VAT, and possibly many other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We also found that accumulation of cholesterol/triglycerides and enhanced cell migration by E11 deficiency is abrogated by knockdown of Leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C, and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>), which phenocopies the effect of p73γ-knockdown in E11-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In line with this, we found that Leptin treatment was able to promote cell transmigration in isogenic control, TAp73-KO and E11-KO H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>), indicating that Leptin functions as a mediator of p73 in promoting cell migration. To uncover the mechanism, we showed that Leptin is a target of p73γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–L</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed that while capable, p73α is much weaker than p73γ to induce Leptin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). One possibility is that the unique C-terminal domains in p73α and p73γ can recruit distinct sets of transcription coactivators and, thus, differentially regulate gene expression, including Leptin, which warrants further investigation.</p><p>To explore the physiological significance of the p73γ-Leptin pathway, we found that Leptin expression correlates well with isoform switch from p73α to p73γ in a set of dog lymphomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Leptin was initially found to control energy homeostasis through the hypothalamus and was given a high hope for treating obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman, 2010</xref>). However, it was found later that both too little and too much Leptin can lead to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Considine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Considine and Caro, 1996</xref>), referred to as ‘leptin resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El-Haschimi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pelleymounter et al., 1995</xref>). At this moment, it is uncertain whether Leptin directly contributes to obesity mediated by p73γ, partially due to the abovementioned paradoxical roles of Leptin in obesity. However, since obesity is now considered a risk factor for many cancers, the p73γ-Leptin pathway may provide a physiological link between cancer and obesity. Indeed, it should be noted that many studies, including data from this study, indicate that Leptin and its receptor are expressed in both normal and tumor tissues and that Leptin is found to promote inflammation, tumor growth, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sánchez-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that the p73γ is highly expressed in tumors such as dog lymphoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), it is possible that p73γ plays a critical role in activating the Leptin signaling pathway in tumors, which subsequently promotes tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found that knockdown of p73γ or Leptin was able to inhibit growth of E11-KO xenograft tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which would open a new revenue for cancer management by targeting the p73γ-Leptin pathway. Together, these data indicate that as a target of p73, Leptin mediates p73γ in tumor promotion and altered lipid metabolism and that the p73γ-Leptin pathway can be targeted for cancer management.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Anti-Actin (sc-47778, 1:3000), anti-p130 (sc-374521, 1:3000), anti-p21 (sc-53870, 1:3000), anti- p130 (sc-374521, 1:3000), and anti-PML (sc-377390, 1:3000) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>TP73 is a member of the p53 family of tumor suppressors and is expressed as TAp73 and DNp73 and multiple C-terminal isoforms as a result of alternative splicing. In this study, the authors used isoform-specific disruption of the TP73 gene to investigate the physiological functions of p53 C-terminal isoforms, focussing on p73a and p73g. They identify an oncogenic role of TAp73-γ in tumorigenesis via regulating the expression of a novel target Leptin. Furthermore, they generated and characterized a mouse mode that expresses the TAp73 isoform γ but not α and shows how this splicing switch has oncogenic effects and causes metabolic defects. Overall, this is an important and well-done study uncovering a key role of TAp63-g in tumorigenesis via regulating Leptin expression.</p><p>1. It appears unclear why the authors focus their analysis on a relatively small number of non-tumoral and tumoral prostate tissues. Did they analyze matched non-tumoral vs tumoral tissues? A table resuming the clinical features of the analyzed patients' needs to be included. Do the anyalzed samples present loss of exon 11?</p><p>2. Interestingly, the authors reported that &quot;E11+/- mice were bigger and fattier as compared to WT mice&quot; with evident signs of liver steatosis. These findings might be, at least in part, mechanistically supported by TAp73γ-induced Leptin expression. A number of experiments in vitro and in vivo have been elegantly performed to show altered expression of the axis TAp73γ/Leptin in H1299 and MiaPaCa2 engineered cell lines. While these findings can be mechanistically provocative there is no any link with NSCL and prostate cancers in humans. Is Leptin expression altered in NSCL and prostate cancer databases? This is critical to translate the reported findings into a realistic cancer context. An experimental effort on this direction should be included.</p><p>3. Statistical analysis is lacking throughout the manuscript. Figures 6L, 7B, 7C and supplemental Figure 5C and D do not have any statistics. The rest of the figures have asterisks but what do they mean? The asterisks are not explained and there is no footnote for p-values. Also, it is not clear sometimes how many replicates each experiment was conducted especially for migration and scratch would assays.</p><p>4. It is not very clear why the authors chose to do semi quantitative PCR and not RT-qPCR throughput the manuscript. Given that many of the changes are quite modest (example Figure 3A), RT-qPCR should be performed for the siRNA experiments. Likewise, for the ChIP experiments in Figure 6J, ChIP-qPCR should also be performed to get a sense of the magnitude of the enrichment.</p><p>5. What are the global transcriptional differences between TAp73 α and γ isoforms: What are the differences in binding targets and their expression? ChIP and RNA-seq assays should be performed. Are there any common targets such as p21? These are important unbiased approaches. Also, what about metabolomics or RNA-seq of the bigger and fattier tumors compared to those derived from wt mice?

We would like to note that due to limited access to tissues, the number of samples is relatively small and the clinical features for these samples are not available. However, our data indicated that due to loss of exon 11, p73γ is highly expressed in prostate tumor tissues when compare to normal tissues. These data are still advisable for future studies with a larger sample size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Several reports have shown that the leptin signaling pathway is elevated in several types of cancers, including lung cancer and prostate cancers (Prostate. 2001 Jan 1;46(1):62-7; Oncotarget. 2017; 8:19699-19711; Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics 13(2):p 204-207, 2017). However, when we tried to determine an association between p73γ and Leptin by analyzing the prostate cancer and lung cancer database from TCGA, we found that p73γ transcript was not properly annotated by GENCODE, which provide reference sequence for data analysis. Ongoing study in the lab is trying to manually match p73γ transcript in various cancer types and will be published in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Nevertheless, ChIP-qPCR was performed to verify the binding of endogenous p73γ to the p21 and Leptin promoter and showed that p73γ was able to bind to both promoters (please see Figure 6L in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

These are important questions to elucidate the biological functions of TAp73 α and TAp73γ isoforms. However, these questions have beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Indeed, ongoing studies in the lab are trying to analyze the common and distinct functions of TAp73 α and TAp73γ by using various systems.

As a result, the last 76 aa in p73γ is unique. A description regarding p73α and p73γ has been added to the revised manuscript. Additionally, several studies have shown that p73α is the most commonly expressed isoforms in normal human and mouse tissues (Cell Death and Disease volume 12, Article number: 745 (2021); Cell Cycle 11:23, 4474–4483).</p></body></sub-article></article>
