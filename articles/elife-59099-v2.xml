and mitophagy are initiated when the adaptor NDP52 recruits the ULK1 complex to autophagic cargo. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was used to map the membrane and NDP52 binding sites of the ULK1 complex to unique regions of the coiled coil of the FIP200 subunit. Electron microscopy of the full-length ULK1 complex shows that the FIP200 coiled coil projects away from the crescent-shaped FIP200 N-terminal domain dimer. NDP52 allosterically stimulates membrane-binding by FIP200 and the ULK1 complex by promoting a more dynamic conformation of the membrane-binding portion of the FIP200 coiled coil. Giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) reconstitution confirmed that membrane recruitment by the ULK1 complex is triggered by NDP52 engagement. These data reveal how the allosteric linkage between NDP52 and the ULK1 complex could drive the first membrane recruitment event of phagophore biogenesis in xenophagy and mitophagy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>mitophagy</kwd><kwd>xenophagy</kwd><kwd>HDX-MS</kwd><kwd>coiled-coil</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM111730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurley</surname><given-names>James H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0026/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurley</surname><given-names>James H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokom</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tang Distinguished Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Chunmei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange, electron microscopy, and vesicle reconstitution show how binding of the autophagy adaptor NDP52 to the FIP200 subunit of the ULK1 complex triggers membrane binding in autophagy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy is a cellular process that maintains homeostasis via clearance of cellular components, degradation of damaged organelles and protection against viral and bacterial invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boya et al., 2013</xref>). Autophagy entails the de novo formation of a double membrane structure (termed the isolation membrane), maturation into a sealed autophagosome, and delivery of substrates to the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Melia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mercer et al., 2018</xref>). Macroautophagy and selective autophagy are two distinct modes of autophagy that differ in their initiation mechanisms and cargo specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). During cellular starvation conditions, macroautophagy functions by the initial formation of an isolation membrane at ER exit sites and expands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Graef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>), engulfing cytoplasmic debris in a nonspecific manner. Selective autophagy functions via a set of autophagy adaptor proteins, which bind cargos directly or via polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). The isolation membrane forms on the labeled cargo and tightly engulfs the cargo during maturation. A complex cascade of autophagy (ATG) related proteins, including the ULK1 complex, Class III PI3K complex, WIPIs, ATG12-5-16, LC3, ATG9, cargo adaptors, and others are required for mammalian autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bento et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>). Through numerous studies, selective autophagy pathways for mitochondria (mitophagy), aggregates (aggrephagy), lysosomes (lysophagy), endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy), bacteria (xenophagy) and other cargos have been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). Correspondingly, a set of adaptors have been identified which function to decorate cargos for degradation. Nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52), optineurin, CCPG1, TAX1BP1 and p62 represent a subset of such adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kirkin and Rogov, 2019</xref>).</p><p>NDP52, also known as Calcium Binding And Coiled-Coil Domain 2 (CALCOCO2), is a multifunctional autophagy adaptor that is crucial for both xenophagy and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von Muhlinen et al., 2010</xref>). Knock out studies of NDP52 show a severe impairment of autophagic protection against <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Verlhac et al., 2015</xref>) and diminished recruitment of the ULK1 complex during mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>). The N-terminal SKICH domain of NDP52 forms a network of interactions in xenophagy and mitophagy pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Till et al., 2013</xref>). Recent work has shown the direct interaction of NDP52 with FIP200, a protein in the autophagy initiation ULK1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>). This interaction is crucial for recruitment of ULK1 to initial phagophore sites, ultimately leading to the engulfment and degradation of selected cargo. NDP52 contains a LIR motif which is required for its interaction with LC3, a hallmark of the autophagosome membrane. Lastly, NDP52 has two domains that recognize cargo; a GALB1 domain, which interacts with galectin-8, and a UBZ domain that recognizes polyubiquitin conjugated to the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The ULK1 complex is comprised of the ULK1 kinase, focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200), autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13), and ATG101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ganley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hosokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin and Hurley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mercer et al., 2009</xref>). ULK1 and 2 are interchangeable threonine/serine kinases which function as the catalytic subunit of the ULK1 complex. The N-terminal kinase domain is followed by a ~ 550 residue intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a C-terminal early autophagy tethering (EAT) domain which recruits ULK1 to the rest of the complex via ATG13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alers et al., 2014</xref>). This network of interactions is conserved in the yeast homolog Atg1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujioka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stjepanovic et al., 2014</xref>). FIP200 is a 1594 residue protein which contains a dimeric N-terminal scaffolding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi et al., 2020</xref>), an IDR, a coiled-coil (CC) region and a C-terminal ‘Claw’ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Turco et al., 2019</xref>). The C-shaped N-terminal domain dimer of FIP200 scaffolds assembly of the ULK1 complex while the C-terminal Claw domain interacts with cargo adaptors, including NDP52, p62 and CCPG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Turco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>). ATG13/101 form a HORMA dimer which interacts with PI3K and is required for ULK1 complex function and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Qi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>). Little is known about the structure and function of the massive CC domain of FIP200, beyond the crystal structure of its very C-terminal 100 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Turco et al., 2019</xref>) and the identification of an NDP52 binding site between residues 1351–1441 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The ULK1 complex is rapidly recruited to invading bacteria and damaged mitochondria following their ubiquitination via its interaction with NDP52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Turco et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>). As the most upstream of the autophagy core complexes, ULK1 complex recruitment is pivotal to subsequent events in autophagosome biogenesis. The nature of the structural changes in the ULK1 complex following NDP52 engagement and how those changes influence recruitment of membranes and downstream autophagy components is, however, almost entirely unknown.</p><p>Despite progress in crystallizing substructures of the ULK1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin and Hurley, 2016</xref>) and an intermediate resolution cryo-EM structure of the FIP200 NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi et al., 2020</xref>), progress on the intact ULK1 complex containing full-length FIP200 has been very challenging. FIP200 is 1594 amino acid residues in length, and apart from the NTD and C-terminal Claw, consists of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a massive 710-residue CC. These features have made full-length FIP200 and the intact ULK1 complex exceptionally difficult for biochemical and structural studies. Here we demonstrate that purified full length FIP200 forms an extended and dynamic structure, which scaffolds the ULK1 complex at its dimeric C-shaped N-terminal domain. Binding of NDP52 to full length FIP200 and the ULK1 complex does not change the conformation of the N-terminal domain, but alters that of a large portion of the FIP200 CC domain. This interaction increases the membrane affinity of FIP200. NDP52 induces robust recruitment of the ULK1 complex to giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) by exposing a membrane binding site within the CC domain of FIP200.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Full length FIP200 forms an elongated scaffold for ULK1 and adaptor binding</title><p>We sought to investigate the structure of purified full-length FIP200. To express and purify full-length FIP200, a dual tag construct was developed. Wild-type FIP200 was expressed with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag fused to the N-terminus and a maltose binding protein (MBP) tag on the C terminus. After affinity purification, full-length GST-FIP200-MBP was characterized using negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Full length FIP200 single particles showed an extended density with a C-shaped density at one end, corresponding to the dimeric FIP200NTD previously resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). Density for the GST tags can be seen in the center of the FIP200 NTD dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This N-terminal density is followed by a long meandering density which we assigned as the CC domain (residues 790–1500). The IDR region (640-790) was not visualized. The CC domain of FIP200 has segments of predicted dimeric coiled-coils and linker regions. Features visualized at the C-terminus of FIP200 correspond to density for two MBP tags (40 kDa each) and the Claw dimer (22 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EM and HDX-MS of full-length FIP200.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Negative stain EM single particles of full length FIP200 alone.

FIP200-CC domain comprises 710 residues which, if uninterrupted, would span about 105 nm. The contour lengths of the CC region in particles analyzed by NSEM ranged from 37 nm to 107 nm, with a mean length of 79 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The presence of some particles with contour lengths far below the predicted maximum suggests that the CC is capable of folding back onto itself. The variability of the total length corresponds to a range of end-to-end distances distributed from 32 nm to 94 nm with a mean of 69 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It is clear that the FIP200 N-terminus is separated from the C-terminus Claw domain. This spatially separates the site of ULK1 assembly at the NTD and the binding site of the cargo adaptors NDP52 near the C-terminal end of the CC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>) and p62 at the Claw domain C-terminal to the CC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Turco et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how the ULK1 complex assembles on full-length FIP200, we employed hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analysis (HDX-MS) on FIP200 alone and the full-length ULK1 complex. Purified ULK1 complex was active with respect to the synthetic substrate, ULKtide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Difference maps for H/D exchange showed a clear protection pattern in the FIP200NTD, similar to our previous results on the FIP200 NTD alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, peptides spanning residues 75–80, 157–165, 313–324, 350–356, 435–469 and 532–541 showed increases in protection of &gt;10% after exchanging for 60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). No large changes (&gt;10%) were observed in FIP200 CC or Claw. This implies that assembly of the ULK1 complex with full length FIP200 does not affect the dynamics of the cargo-recognizing CC and Claw. Thus, FIP200 is a modular protein whose NTD engages with the rest of the ULK1 complex and whose CC and Claw engage independently with cargo adaptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ULK1 complex engages NDP52 only via FIP200</title><p>Next, we used HDX-MS to systematically analyze how the H/D exchange rate of the ULK1 complex changed in the presence of NDP52. To validate the ULK1 complex sample, the complex was expressed with fluorescent GFP tags on ATG13 and ATG101 and purified. Labeled ULK1 complex was mixed with GST-NDP52, GST-4xUb and glutathione beads. The fluorescence signal was quantified for each reaction condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). The ULK1 complex was specifically pulled down by GST-NDP52, but not by GST-4xUb or GSH beads alone. This confirmed that the ULK1 complex recognizes cargo adaptors but not poly-ubiquitin chains directly in our in vitro system.</p><p>In the presence of NDP52, no large changes (&lt;-10% or &gt;10%) were identified in peptides from ATG13, ATG101, ULK1 or the FIP200NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, all proteins at 2 μM, except FIP200 at 4 μM and NDP52 at 16 μM). A lack of HDX difference suggests that NDP52 does not directly or allosterically modulate these regions upon binding to the FIP200 CTD. However, our analysis showed three regions of the CC domain of FIP200 with significant protection in the presence of NDP52. Peptides of residues 1290–1320, 1339–1392 and 1462–1470 showed a decrease of deuterium exchange of &gt;10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Residues in the 1339–1392 region (L1371, L1378, L1385, and L1392) corresponds to the previously proposed as a binding site of NDP52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>). Residues 1290–1320 and 1339–1392 display a higher level of protection than 1462–1470. Unexpectedly, an extensive region of the CC N-terminal to the NDP52 binding site, spanning FIP200 residues 800–1250, especially 935–1073, had increased H/D exchange rate after NDP52 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- Table S1).

The binding sites of p62 and NDP52 were mapped to the Claw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Turco et al., 2019</xref>) and CC C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>) respectively, and the structure of the Claw and a small part of the CC were determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Turco et al., 2019</xref>). All of the many downstream events remained unclear, however, as did the structure of the great majority of FIP200. Here we obtained the first structural view of full-length FIP200 and the intact ULK1 complex. In the context of the structure, we formulated a model for the allosteric activation by NDP52 of the next step following ULK1 complex recruitment to cargo, namely membrane recruitment.</p><p>In a related study, we recently showed that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of FIP200, consisting of the first 640 amino acids, comprised a C-shaped dimeric hub for assembly of the rest of the ULK1 complex. A single molecule of ATG13 was shown to bind to the NTD dimer. ATG13 in turn contacts ATG101 and ULK1 itself. The ULK1 complex is unusually loosely organized, lacking extensive direct contacts between FIP200, ULK1, and ATG101. Biochemical and structural studies of the 1594-residue FIP200 have been exceptionally challenging, and it has only now been possible to visualize the intact molecule. The C-termini of the two FIP200 NTDs in the C-shaped dimer is located near the center. We have now confirmed that the CC projects away from the center of the NTD. Thus, the symmetry of the NTD matches the symmetry of the FIP200 CC, which is parallel and a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Turco et al., 2019</xref>). FIP200 CC has a modal end-to-end distance of ~75 nm and is partially flexible, making it ideally suited to its function of connecting cargo to other components of the ULK1 complex and to membranes over substantial distances, much as seen with other coiled-coil based tethers such as the endosomal tether EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2016</xref>) and the Golgi tether GCC185 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheung et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The data presented here suggest that the membrane binding region (MR) in the N-terminal portion of FIP200 CC is the principal, although not sole, membrane binding site responsible for the first ULK1 complex membrane recruitment event in autophagy. NDP52 and, most probably, the FIP200 NTD also contribute to membrane interactions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> depicts the series of events that these data lead us to believe underlie membrane recruitment downstream of NDP52-ubiquitin engagement. In solution, FIP200 exists as isolated dimers with the MR region in a helical conformation that sequesters the hydrophobic residues. When ubiquitin is conjugated to and presented on the surface of damaged mitochondria, invading bacteria, or other substrates, NDP52 is recruited to these sites by directly binding to the clustered ubiquitin on their surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thurston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xie et al., 2015</xref>). FIP200 is then recruited to clustered NDP52 via its NDP52 binding site in the C-terminal part of its CC. We found that engagement to NDP52 destabilizes the conformation of the N-terminal part of the FIP200 CC and increases membrane affinity, presumably by melting the coiled coil and increasing the exposure of hydrophobic side chains in this region. These changes occur simultaneously with clustering of multiple FIP200 dimers. In our study, the role of clustering in driving membrane affinity was evidenced by the increase in binding when GST-fusions were used, because GST is dimeric. Taken together, the MR conformational change and higher-order clustering drives strong membrane recruitment.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for ULK1 complex membrane recruitment.</title><p>Before engagement with NDP52, the FIP200 middle region (790–1050) forms a stable coiled-coil in a low membrane affinity state and the CTD and ‘Claw’ domains are unbound. Initially, NDP52 is recruited by interaction with ubiquitin to autophagic cargo in both xenophagy and mitophagy. FIP200 CTD binds directly to NDP52, driving clustering of FIP200 along with an allosteric conformational change in the MR region. These clusters form a hub for ULK1 auto-transphosphorylation and a site for initial recruitment of phagophore membranes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59099-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>FIP200 is thought to initially localize to phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS)-enriched ER subdomains prior to PI(3)P generation by the autophagic PI 3-kinase complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>). In the presence of an ER-like synthetic lipid mixture, only the MR showed significant changes in HDX. A basic patch on the ATG13 HORMA domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Qi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>) was been reported to interact with PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karanasios et al., 2013</xref>) and so sustain ULK1 complex localization at the omegasome subsequent to PI 3-kinase activation. Our synthetic lipid mixture intentionally omitted PI(3)P to reflect the earliest step in activation. The conserved EAT domain of the yeast ULK1 ortholog Atg1 binds to highly curved ER-like vesicles, but only in the absence of Atg13, and its lipid-binding role is probably important only in later steps of autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). The MR is not electropositive in character, unlike most membrane binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hurley and Misra, 2000</xref>), but this is in keeping with the neutral character of ER lipids. Our data suggest a model wherein NDP52 binding to the C-terminus of FIP200 CC promotes lipid binding at the MR, so allowing a tether to be formed between cargo and the ER subdomain destined to become the omegasome. These data are consistent with the critical role of the NDP52-binding residues of FIP200 as demonstrated in both mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>) and xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we focused on NDP52 rather than p62 because NDP52 binds much more tightly to FIP200, which facilitated the HDX-MS and biochemical experiments. It remains to be seen if the principles of membrane recruitment revealed here are general to p62 and other adaptors. The stimulation of the effect seen by using dimeric GST fusions of 4xUb and NDP52 show that multimerization is important for promoting membrane binding. While the binding site of NDP52 on FIP200 CC appears to be unique, clustering of cargo adaptors on ubiquitinated cargo is a general aspect of selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kirkin and Rogov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>).

The buffer used was 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP. To prepare the ULK1c/NDP52 sample or ULK1c/SUV sample, 2 μL of ULK1c stock solution was mixed with 8 μL of NDP52 or SUV stock solution and then incubated at 23°C for 30 min. To prepare the FIP200 or ULK1c sample, 2 μL of protein stock was mixed with 8 μL of control buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP), and then incubated at 23°C for 30 min. Exchange was initiated by adding 90 μL of D<sub>2</sub>O buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP into 10 μL of protein mixture at 30°C. Exchange was carried out for 6 s, 60 s, 600 s, or 60000 s, and quenched at 0°C by the addition 100 μL of ice-cold quench buffer (400 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 2.2). The 60000 s sample served as the maximally labeled control. All HDX reactions were repeated three times. Quenched samples were injected into a chilled HPLC (Agilent) setup with in-line peptic digestion and desalting steps. The analytical column used was a Biobasic 8.5 μm KAPPA column (Fisher Scientific). The peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient and electrosprayed into an Orbitrap Discovery mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) for analysis. To generate the gradient, solvent A was 0.05% TFA, while solvent B was 0.05% TFA in 90% acetonitrile. The elution method was as follows: 0–6 min: 10% B; 6–42 min: from 10% B to 55% B; 42–43 min: from 55% B to 90% B; 43–53 min: 90% B; 53–54 min: from 90% B to 10% B; 54–60 min: 10% B. The spray voltage was set at 3.4 kV, capillary temperature was set at 275°C, capillary voltage was set at 37 V and tube-lens was set at 120 V. As a control, unexchanged samples went through the same process, except that D<sub>2</sub>O was replaced by H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>To identify peptides, unexchanged samples were analyzed by tandem MS/MS analysis with the same HPLC method. Tandem MS/MS was performed using data dependent analysis, in which a cycle of one full-scan MS spectrum (m/z 200–2000) was acquired followed by MS/MS events (CID fragmentation). MS/MS was sequentially generated on the ten most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum at a 35% normalized collision energy. The ion trap analyzer was used for MS2, activation time was 30 ms, and the dynamic exclusion was set at 30 s. For HDX mass analysis, only a full-scan MS spectrum was acquired, and the resolution was 30000. Database searches were performed with Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Sequest HT search engine to identify peptides. Raw data were searched against the small database containing all four components of ULK1 complex. The following search parameters were used: unspecific cleavage was used; precursor mass tolerance was set to ±10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was set to ±0.6 Da. Target FDR was set to 1% as the filter cut-off for the identified peptides. For HDX analysis, mass analysis of the peptide centroids was performed using HDExaminer (Sierra Analytics), followed by manual verification for every peptide.

approaches to examine membrane binding of NDP52, a protein involved in selective autophagy.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wade Harper as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes biophysical and structural studies on purified, full length FIP200 in complex with its other binding partners, including NDP52 (a well-known ubiquitin binding autophagy receptor). The results presented in this manuscript corroborate prior results from the Hurley lab demonstrating a &quot;C-Shaped&quot; N-terminal dimer that acts as a scaffold of ULK1-ATG13-ATG101, while the C-terminal claw region engages receptor molecules such as NDP52 and p62. Furthermore, Shi et al. conclude that a coiled-coil region within FIP200 undergoes a dynamic conformational change upon binding with the receptor molecule NDP52, increasing its affinity for FIP200 towards membranes. They propose that NDP52 binding to the surface to cargo elicits a conformational change in the FIP200, increasing its propensity to bind to membranes and drives the local clustering of the ULK1 kinase leading to its autoactivation and the induction of autophagy.</p><p>While the reviewers feel that the work is of high quality and is potentially appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the consensus after extensive discussion among the reviewers and the senior editor is that core elements of the proposed model are not fully supported by the data presented thus far. This has to do primarily with the relative roles/contributions of coiled-coli domains in FIP200 and NDP52 for association with membranes, and whether there is a key role for allostery in the mechanism of membrane binding. Another weakness in the paper is that the work primarily employs liposomes, rather than intact membranes, and there isn't data supporting the role for these structural elements in autophagy within cells. Given this, we are offering the possibility of a significant revision, but without the normal time constraints, due to COVID-19 related limitations on lab access.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers would like to see:</p><p>1) A better understanding of the structural features within the coiled-coils that facilitate membrane binding.</p><p>2) An analysis of the interactions with biological membranes rather than liposomes would be important in further validating the model.</p><p>3) A better understanding of the allostery mechanism is needed. It is often assumed that regions predicted to be &quot;coiled-coil&quot; form a typical helical dimeric assembly of α-helices. In such case, the &quot;hydrophobic residues&quot;, which are assumed to be buried in the dimeric interface, twists along the long axis of the coiled-coil. The MR reported in this study is fairly long (over 150 residues). Although association of short coiled-coil domains are known to associate with membranes, it is harder to see how an extended helix might do this, and so the question is whether this coiled-coil undergoes an alteration in structure (e.g. melting) that is in some way coupled with the allostery (or not). If so, that could cause liposome binding, as shown in Figure 3D. Again, Figure 3D's data are without NDP52. As such, the data does not directly demonstrate the suggested binding mode (hydrophobic residues are exposed upon allosteric conformational change, and those residues bind to membranes).</p><p>After discussion, we concluded that perhaps analysis of mutants in cells is beyond the scope of this heavily biophysical analysis. However, one aspect that is unclear concerns the conclusion that NDP52 is effectively recruited to membranes on its own or together with FIP200. For example, in the context of mitophagy, mutations in the ubiquitin binding domain of NDP52 abolish recruitment to the mitochondrial outermembrane downstream of parkin activation in cells. It is difficult to see how the intrinsic membrane binding of NDP52 could be operative in this context as the core mechanism of recruitment, given the ubiquitin binding dependence. Although OPTN is the main adaptor in this form of selective autophagy, NDP52 plays a partially redundant role and cells only expressing NDP52 as the ubiquitin binding autophagy adaptor can support mitophagy. So this aspect of the model for direct and biologically relevant membrane as the primary mechanism for membrane recruitment doesn't precisely fit with prior data and it may be necessary to discuss how membrane binding may be relevant in the context of other mechanisms that place NDP52 adjacent to the membrane. Might the primary recruitment mechanism be through ubiquitin, but then the membrane interactions serve to orient the molecules on the membrane surface for optimal downstream functions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Autophagy is driven by the action of the central and highly conserved ULK1 complex which comprises of the Serine/Threonine kinase ULK1, the large scaffolding protein FIP200, and the accessory proteins ATG13 and ATG101. Additionally, cargo sequestration in autophagy is bought about by the binding of autophagy &quot;receptor&quot; molecules to the surface of cargo and helps recruit the ULK1 complex via direct interactions to promote their degradation.</p><p>Structural studies on this complex (specifically FIP200) have been limited, largely in part due the size and the prevalence of an Intrinsically disordered region in the center of the protein. Recently, the Hurley lab have made strides in the understanding of three-dimensional architecture of this complex by ascertaining the structure of the N-terminal(NTD) and extreme C-terminal regions(Claw) of FIP200. In this paper, Shi and colleagues describe another advancement in the study of this complex by biophysical and structural studies on purified, full length FIP200 in complex with its other binding partners. The results presented in this manuscript corroborate prior results from the Hurley lab demonstrating a &quot;C-Shaped&quot; N-terminal dimer that acts as a scaffold of ULK1-ATG13-ATG101, while the C-terminal claw region engages receptor molecules such as NDP52 and p62. Furthermore, Shi et al. demonstrate that a coiled-coil region within FIP200 undergoes a dynamic conformational change upon binding with the receptor molecule NDP52, increasing its affinity for FIP200 towards membranes. Therefore, autophagy receptor binding to the surface to cargo elicits a conformational change in the FIP200, increasing its propensity to bind to membranes and drives the local clustering of the ULK1 kinase leading to its autoactivation and the induction of autophagy.</p><p>Overall this is a well-executed and presented study and would be suitable for publication once the following points are addressed.</p><p>1) While the biophysical assays are relatively convincing, one obvious drawback is the absence of any functional autophagy assays to monitor if this receptor-mediated conformational change is actually physiologically important. The most obvious experiment in this regard would be to add back the FIP200 (deleted membrane region) and monitor any form of autophagy. However, given the state of affairs due to the ongoing COVID19 pandemic I would say that this experiment is not critical, but if performed would significantly bolster the conclusions of this paper.</p><p>2) The HDX graphs were not always clear to this reader. For example, in Figure 1C the blue and grey colors need to be assigned to the relevant sample. Additionally, the number of repeats performed here and in every experiment presented should be stated.</p><p>3) The increase in the FIP200 residues 800-1250 (2D) after NDP52 doesn't seem significant by the authors own cut-offs (&gt; or &lt;10%), nevertheless this region appears to the important for membrane binding.</p><p>4) Figure 2F is lacking input controls to show that the levels of MBP-NDP52 and GST FIP200 in cells are equal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript from Hurley and colleagues, the authors describe for the first time the structure of the full-length FIP200 protein including its ~75 nm long coiled-coil domain, and then explore how this region of the protein contributes to the membrane targeting of FIP200 and of its cognate kinase, ULK1. Their principle discoveries are that the coiled coil includes a region that can interact with acidic lipids PI and/or PS, that this motif can adopt a range of structures (fully elongated or bent back on itself) and that there is no allosteric communication between the opposite termini of the coiled-coil, thus for example cargo-binding does not directly alter ULK1 interactions.

This point, previously published, is finally addressed at the end of the Results, but it fundamentally changes the way the results should be considered. In the Discussion they say &quot; The data presented here suggest that the membrane binding region (MR) in the N terminal portion of FIP200 CC is the major membrane binding site responsible for the first ULK1 complex membrane recruitment event in autophagy &quot; and &quot;Our data suggest a model wherein NDP52 binding to the Cterminus of FIP200 CC promotes lipid binding at the MR, so allowing a tether to be formed between cargo and the ER subdomain destined to become the omegasome.&quot; However, their GUV recruitment assay (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1) strongly implies that although the membrane-binding motif they have described on FIP200 can augment membrane binding, NDP52 is still largely sufficient and a/the principle driver of membrane targeting. This element of the model should be more fully described and the existing literature on the role of NDP52 in targeting these complexes specifically to membranes should be introduced early.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors dissect protein-protein interactions within the NDP52-ULK1 complex and its membrane interaction using HDX and identify a membrane-interacting region in the coiled-coil domain of its component FIP200. They show the ULK1 complex is recruited to GUV membranes through the identified membrane-binding region, and this membrane recruitment is activated by NDP52. Because NDP52 binds to another region in the coiled-coil domain of FIP200, they conclude that NDP52 allosterically activates the membrane-binding region of the FIP200. This in vitro study is performed carefully, and the presented data appear to be of high quality. Identification of the membrane-interacting region of FIP200 is valuable for the autophagy field and would help future work toward the elucidation of the role of FIP200 in autophagy. However, it seems that the allosteric activation is not fully supported by the data and the work struggles to establish the biological significance of this membrane-binding activity by FIP200.</p><p>1) It is not clear how the FIP200-mediated membrane association fits in the biological event (selective autophagy). There seem to be several candidate membranes that FIP200 might associate with: the membrane of the targets (bacteria/mitochondria), the ER, the omegasome, the autophagosome/phagophore. However, which of these is the bona fide membrane target of FIP200 is not clear, making it difficult to relate the findings of this work to the mechanism of selective autophagy. NDP52 is also shown to be capable of associating with membranes, which complicates the interpretation. How are the roles of these membrane associations by FIP200 and NDP52 related?</p><p>2) The coiled-coil domain is suggested to associate with membranes through hydrophobic residues exposed upon NDP52 binding. This is a very interesting and thoughtful model deduced from a careful interpretation of the HDX data. However, as hydrophobic residues could bind to many things, this explanation alone is probably not sufficient to convince that the observed membrane-binding is biological. More detailed mechanism of the membrane association could help clarify this. Is the MR predicted to form a typical parallel coiled-coil dimer? If so, would a structural model provide insights into the mechanism of membrane binding?</p><p>3) The authors suggest that NDP52 allosterically activates the membrane binding by FIP200. However, FIP200 is suggested to have weak and intrinsic membrane-binding activity (in the absence of NDP52) (Figure 3D). The overall membrane binding could be enhanced through multivalent FIP200-membrane interactions created by GST-4xUb-mediated clustering. Thus, it seems that the membrane-binding data of the NDP52-ULK1 complex can be explained without invoking such allosteric activation. The NDP52-membrane interactions would also become multivalent in the presence of GST-4xUb so that they would also contribute to the membrane recruitment of the overall complex. Thus, with two membrane-binding domains and clustering, it seems to be not straightforward to determine the magnitude of allosteric activation in the presented data.</p><p>4) NDP52 alone does not seem to recruit FIP200 to membranes. However, NDP52 alone is shown to be capable of destabilizing the MR. GST-NDP52 enhances the FIP200 membrane association but only modestly. Thus, these data seem to suggest that the membrane-binding affinity of &quot;activated MR&quot; is very low. If hydrophobic residues in such a long region of the coiled-coil were exposed to interact with membranes, as suggested, shouldn't the affinity be higher?</p><p>5) Direct evidence for the allosteric activation is lacking. While structural information is limited to at a low-resolution, the membrane-binding region and NDP52 binding site are both in the coiled-coil. Thus, it may be possible to design and create a mutant FIP200 that can bind to NDB52 but not to membranes without touching MR and NDP52 binding sites directly. Such a mutant protein will be strong support for the suggested allostery.</p><p>6) Is the mechanism by which NDP52 associates with membranes known? The authors should create an NDP52 construct that can bind to FIP200 but not to membranes and use it in their ULK1/FIP200 membrane recruitment assays to remove the contribution of NDP52-membrane association.</p><p>7) Full-length FIP200 should be included in the sedimentation assay in Figure 3D as it would clarify whether the full-length and the truncated proteins are different in membrane binding.</p><p>8) An MR-only construct should be tested for membrane binding using sedimentation assays and GUV assays to clarify whether the activity of the MR is intrinsically suppressed or not. The MR is said to be not electropositive, but in Figure 3, the C-terminal FIP200 construct shows a better binding with negatively charged liposomes. An MR-only construct might reveal the differences between the MR and the entire CTD. Is the CTD overall electropositive?</p><p>9) The oligomeric state of NDP52 should be examined as it has a coiled-coil domain that may oligomerize.</p><p>10) The KD between NDP52 and FIP200 coiled-coil would be helpful for understanding the contribution of FIP200 in membrane association if available.</p><p>11) It may be helpful to present the raw HDX protection profiles (not differences between two samples) as supplements to show protection levels of each samples. Are the coiled-coil regions well protected in the absence of NDP52/liposomes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59099.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers would like to see:</p><p>1) A better understanding of the structural features within the coiled-coils that facilitate membrane binding.</p></disp-quote><p>The HDX data are consistent with melting of the coiled coil. Our model is that when bound to the membrane, these regions are not coiled coils at all, but rather are unfolded. We are not sure how the reviewers would propose that we should determine the structural feature of unfolded regions protruding into the membrane, beyond the HDX we already provided. These are too disordered for crystallography and too small and dynamic for cryo-EM. HDX is ideally suited to exploring this type of system, and indeed we consider it to be the gold standard for this type of question. This is the reason we focused the paper on these data. We have added a new Figure 6 to be more clear about what we think is happening to the coiled coils.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An analysis of the interactions with biological membranes rather than liposomes would be important in further validating the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and concur with the comment below that &quot;analysis of mutants in cells is beyond the scope&quot; of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A better understanding of the allostery mechanism is needed. It is often assumed that regions predicted to be &quot;coiled-coil&quot; form a typical helical dimeric assembly of α-helices. In such case, the &quot;hydrophobic residues&quot;, which are assumed to be buried in the dimeric interface, twists along the long axis of the coiled-coil. The MR reported in this study is fairly long (over 150 residues). Although association of short coiled-coil domains are known to associate with membranes, it is harder to see how an extended helix might do this, and so the question is whether this coiled-coil undergoes an alteration in structure (e.g. melting) that is in some way coupled with the allostery (or not).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the HDX data are most consistent with melting. We have made this more explicit in the new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If so, that could cause liposome binding, as shown in Figure 3D. Again, Figure 3D's data are without NDP52. As such, the data does not directly demonstrate the suggested binding mode (hydrophobic residues are exposed upon allosteric conformational change, and those residues bind to membranes).</p></disp-quote><p>The liposome sedimentation in Figure 3D was intended as a gross mapping of the membrane binding to the C-terminal as opposed to N-terminal data. Our conclusions about allostery build on this and rely principally on the HDX data and GUV reconstitutions. Certainly these conclusions could not have been drawn solely based on the data in Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After discussion, we concluded that perhaps analysis of mutants in cells is beyond the scope of this heavily biophysical analysis. However, one aspect that is unclear concerns the conclusion that NDP52 is effectively recruited to membranes on its own or together with FIP200. For example, in the context of mitophagy, mutations in the ubiquitin binding domain of NDP52 abolish recruitment to the mitochondrial outermembrane downstream of parkin activation in cells. It is difficult to see how the intrinsic membrane binding of NDP52 could be operative in this context as the core mechanism of recruitment, given the ubiquitin binding dependence. Although OPTN is the main adaptor in this form of selective autophagy, NDP52 plays a partially redundant role and cells only expressing NDP52 as the ubiquitin binding autophagy adaptor can support mitophagy. So this aspect of the model for direct and biologically relevant membrane as the primary mechanism for membrane recruitment doesn't precisely fit with prior data and it may be necessary to discuss how membrane binding may be relevant in the context of other mechanisms that place NDP52 adjacent to the membrane. Might the primary recruitment mechanism be through ubiquitin, but then the membrane interactions serve to orient the molecules on the membrane surface for optimal downstream functions?</p></disp-quote><p>Hopefully the new Figure 6 and associated discussion explains how we think our results fit into the context of the known linkage between Ub, NDP52, and FIP200. See further discussion below in the responses to individual reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Autophagy is driven by the action of the central and highly conserved ULK1 complex which comprises of the Serine/Threonine kinase ULK1, the large scaffolding protein FIP200, and the accessory proteins ATG13 and ATG101. Additionally, cargo sequestration in autophagy is bought about by the binding of autophagy &quot;receptor&quot; molecules to the surface of cargo and helps recruit the ULK1 complex via direct interactions to promote their degradation.</p><p>Structural studies on this complex (specifically FIP200) have been limited, largely in part due the size and the prevalence of an Intrinsically disordered region in the center of the protein. Recently, the Hurley lab have made strides in the understanding of three-dimensional architecture of this complex by ascertaining the structure of the N-terminal(NTD) and extreme C-terminal regions(Claw) of FIP200. In this paper, Shi and colleagues describe another advancement in the study of this complex by biophysical and structural studies on purified, full length FIP200 in complex with its other binding partners. The results presented in this manuscript corroborate prior results from the Hurley lab demonstrating a &quot;C-Shaped&quot; N-terminal dimer that acts as a scaffold of ULK1-ATG13-ATG101, while the C-terminal claw region engages receptor molecules such as NDP52 and p62. Furthermore, Shi et al. demonstrate that a coiled-coil region within FIP200 undergoes a dynamic conformational change upon binding with the receptor molecule NDP52, increasing its affinity for FIP200 towards membranes. Therefore, autophagy receptor binding to the surface to cargo elicits a conformational change in the FIP200, increasing its propensity to bind to membranes and drives the local clustering of the ULK1 kinase leading to its autoactivation and the induction of autophagy.</p><p>Overall this is a well-executed and presented study and would be suitable for publication once the following points are addressed.</p><p>1) While the biophysical assays are relatively convincing, one obvious drawback is the absence of any functional autophagy assays to monitor if this receptor-mediated conformational change is actually physiologically important. The most obvious experiment in this regard would be to add back the FIP200 (deleted membrane region) and monitor any form of autophagy. However, given the state of affairs due to the ongoing COVID19 pandemic I would say that this experiment is not critical, but if performed would significantly bolster the conclusions of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The HDX graphs were not always clear to this reader.

Put in perspective, the MR accounts for more than half of the bound proportion. Given that collectively FIP200 and NDP52 comprise an assembly of over 2000 amino acids, it is not surprising that there are some additional contributions. We believe the residual membrane binding is due to a combination of smaller contributions from membrane binding sites on other parts of FIP200 and on NDP52. There is only one paper that we are aware of that previously proposed NDP52 bound to membranes, that of H. Yu et al. (2019). This paper concerned microtubule regulation in mitosis, not autophagy. It was found that NDP52 only bound to synthetic liposomes containing phosphatidic acid (PA) in that study. A putative PA sequence was reported in this study. We have not been able to reproduce these results in the GUV system. Using PA-containing GUVs, we observed a limited degree of binding by wild-type NDP52 or the putative PA-binding mutant (Author response 1). Given the uncertain relationship of the putative PA binding to autophagy and our inability to reproduce the effect in the GUV system, it is not clear how the Yu et al. data relate to ours or to autophagy, and we thought it best to remove the discussion of the Yu paper.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>NDP52 binds weakly to PA-containing GUVs.</title><p>Binding is unaffected by mutation of the putative PA binding sequence of Yu et al.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59099-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors dissect protein-protein interactions within the NDP52-ULK1 complex and its membrane interaction using HDX and identify a membrane-interacting region in the coiled-coil domain of its component FIP200.

In the GUV assays, the ULK1 complex is at 100 nM concentration, to avoid saturating the imaging and lipid binding in the absence of activation. The destabilization of the MR by NDP52 in the absence of lipids is thus observed at a 20-fold higher concentration as compared to the GUV imaging experiment.
