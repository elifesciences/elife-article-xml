How the 14-subunit SWR1C engages the nucleosomal substrate remains largely unknown. Studies on the ISWI, CHD1, and SWI/SNF families of chromatin remodeling enzymes have demonstrated key roles for the nucleosomal acidic patch for remodeling activity, however a role for this nucleosomal epitope in nucleosome editing by SWR1C has not been tested. Here, we employ a variety of biochemical assays to demonstrate an essential role for the acidic patch in the H2A.Z exchange reaction. Utilizing asymmetrically assembled nucleosomes, we demonstrate that the acidic patches on each face of the nucleosome are required for SWR1C-mediated dimer exchange, suggesting SWR1C engages the nucleosome in a ‘pincer-like’ conformation, engaging both patches simultaneously. Loss of a single acidic patch results in loss of high affinity nucleosome binding and nucleosomal stimulation of ATPase activity. We identify a conserved arginine-rich motif within the Swc5 subunit that binds the acidic patch and is key for dimer exchange activity. In addition, our cryoEM structure of a Swc5–nucleosome complex suggests that promoter proximal, histone H2B ubiquitylation may regulate H2A.Z deposition. Together these findings provide new insights into how SWR1C engages its nucleosomal substrate to promote efficient H2A.Z deposition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>H2A.Z</kwd><kwd>SWR1C</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM122519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Craig L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM127034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>Song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Estonian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PUTJD906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eek</surname><given-names>Priit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nucleosome recognition by the SWR1C chromatin remodeling enzyme requires both nucleosomal acidic patches.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes regulate access to information stored in their genetic code through the dynamic nucleoprotein structure known as chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, sequesters ~147 base pairs (bp) of DNA around a histone octamer consisting of a H3–H4 tetramer flanked by two H2A–H2B (AB) heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Rather than a static structure, chromatin is highly dynamic, due to the coordinated impact of histone post-translational modifications, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, and the incorporation of histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>). Disruption of these processes can have deleterious consequences for all nuclear events, including transcription, DNA replication, and genome stability pathways.</p><p>H2A.Z, a variant of the core histone H2A, is enriched within nucleosomes adjacent to genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, replication origins, centromeres, and at sites of DNA double strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyarchuk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). In yeast, H2A.Z enrichment correlates with higher rates of nucleosome turnover that facilitates transcription, as well as antagonizing the spread of heterochromatic regions from telomeres and the silent mating type loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meneghini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guillemette et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dion et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, we found that H2A.Z plays a global, positive transcriptional role in yeast strains lacking the nuclear RNA exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryll and Peterson, 2022</xref>). While yeast H2A.Z is not essential for viability, H2A.Z is essential in metazoans where it is associated with both transcriptional activation and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raisner et al., 2005</xref>). For instance, in embryonic stem cells, deposition and function of H2A.Z are interdependent with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and loss of either H2A.Z or PRC2 leads to transcriptional de-repression of a host genes and a subsequent failure in lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Creyghton et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The site-specific deposition of H2A.Z is catalyzed by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes related to the 14-subunit, yeast SWR1C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>). Mammals contain two enzymes related to SWR1C, the SRCAP and Tip60/p400 complexes, and subunits of the mammalian enzymes are highly conserved with those of SWR1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs et al., 2001</xref>). Each of these enzymes are members of the larger INO80 subfamily of chromatin remodeling enzymes, distinguished by a large insertion domain between the two ATPase lobes of the catalytic ATPase (Swr1 in SWR1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruhl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). This insertion domain serves as a docking site for several key subunits of SWR1C-like complexes, including the Rvb1/Rvb2 heterohexameric ring (RUVB1/RUVB2 in humans) which acts as a further scaffold for organizing additional subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to Rvb1/Rvb2, previous studies have demonstrated that the deposition of H2A.Z by SWR1C requires several key subunits, including Swc2, Swc4, Yaf9, and Swc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watanabe et al., 2015</xref>). The Swc2 subunit and its mammalian ortholog, Yl-1, promote nucleosome binding and assist SWR1C in the recognition of nucleosome-free regions adjacent to gene promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2016</xref>). Swc4 (DMAP1 in mammals) is also part of the yeast NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, and it appears to promote DNA and histone binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gómez-Zambrano et al., 2018</xref>). Swc5 (Cfdp1 in mammals) is essential for the ATPase activity of SWR1C, but how Swc5 promotes SWR1C activity is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun and Luk, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The subunit complexity of chromatin remodelers varies from the single subunit, yeast CHD1, to multi-subunit ~1 MDa enzymes such as RSC, SWI/SNF, INO80C, and SWR1C. Despite differences in function and complexity, recent studies have shown that the activity of many remodelers require that they engage a solvent exposed, acidic surface on the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gamarra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levendosky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eustermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lehmann et al., 2020</xref>). This ‘acidic patch’ is composed of eight residues from histones H2B and H2A that are known to provide a docking interface for many proteins. For instance, PRC1, RCC1, and Orc1 bind to the nucleosome acidic patch through a common binding motif consisting of a loop region with an arginine residue that inserts directly into the acidic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McGinty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Ioannes et al., 2019</xref>). Though these regions are primarily unstructured and basic, nucleosomal docking requires the specific side chain structure of an arginine, which cannot be substituted by lysine, resulting in these regions being referred to as ‘arginine anchors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinty and Tan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGinty and Tan, 2021</xref>). In the context of remodelers, ISWI uses an arginine anchor within its catalytic ATPase subunit to relieve an autoinhibitory mechanism following nucleosome binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gamarra et al., 2018</xref>). Members of the SWI/SNF family of enzymes also use arginine-rich motifs within both the conserved Snf5- and Snf2-like subunits to sandwich the complex to the octamer during remodeling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). A recent cryoEM structure of INO80C also shows key interactions with the nucleosomal acidic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eustermann et al., 2018</xref>), and this remodeler is unable to remodel nucleosomes that lack this nucleosomal epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gamarra et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the role of the nucleosome acidic patch in dimer exchange by SWR1C. Through Förster-resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescence intensity (FI), and fluorescence polarization (FP) assays, we interrogate how SWR1C is influenced by H2A/H2B acidic patch alterations, and we specifically probe how each acidic patch on the two faces of the nucleosome contribute to SWR1C activity. Surprisingly, we find that loss of even a single acidic patch results in the loss of dimer exchange activity, suggesting SWR1C must engage both acidic patches simultaneously in a ‘pincer-like’ fashion to carry out dimer exchange. In addition, we found that both linker DNA and the contralateral incorporation of an H2A.Z/H2B dimer-stimulated H2A.Z deposition. Efforts to identify potential SWR1C subunits responsible for acidic patch interactions led us to identify an arginine-rich motif within the Swc5 subunit of SWR1C, and we show that this domain is essential for dimer exchange in vitro, the function of SWR1C in vivo, and Swc5 binding to the nucleosome. A low-resolution cryoEM structure of the Swc5–nucleosome complex confirms an acidic patch interaction, as well as contacts with the histone H4 N-terminal tail and the H2B C-terminal helix. These results indicate that SWR1C activity relies on communication between the Swc5 arginine motif and the nucleosome acidic patch to functionally engage nucleosomes for dimer exchange activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dimer exchange by SWR1C requires the nucleosomal acidic patch</title><p>To investigate the role of the nucleosomal acidic patch on dimer exchange by SWR1C, a fluorescence-based assay was initially employed.

In this assay, an unlabeled, 77N0 nucleosome was incubated with SWR1C, ATP, and free H2A.Z/H2B dimers in which H2A.Z contains a 3xFLAG tag at its C-terminus. Reaction products are separated on native-PAGE, and formation of the heterotypic (AB/ZB) and homotypic (ZB/ZB) nucleosomal products are detected by their reduced gel migration due to the 3xFLAG tag on H2A.Z. Similar to the FRET-based assay, the SWR1C-catalyzed deposition of H2A.Z was largely complete by 30–60 min for the AB/AB nucleosomal substrate, but addition of SWR1C to the AB-apm/AB-apm nucleosome led to 10-fold reduction in H2A.Z deposition after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B, D</xref>). Together, these assays indicate that SWR1C requires an intact nucleosomal acidic patch for H2A.Z deposition.</p><p>To further interrogate the role for each of the two nucleosomal acidic patches in dimer exchange by SWR1C, we performed dimer exchange reactions with asymmetrically assembled nucleosomal substrates. Such asymmetric nucleosomes allow the fluorescent labeling of only a single H2A/H2B dimer, such that we could monitor which dimer was targeted for replacement. We generated these substrates by leveraging the asymmetric features of the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence and the spontaneous incorporation of dimers into purified hexasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levendosky and Bowman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Hexasomes were generated by varying the ratio of <italic>X. laevis</italic> H3/H4 tetramers to yeast H2A/H2B heterodimers on 77N0 or 0N0 DNA that was labeled with Cy3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). After hexasome purification, nucleosomes of different compositions were reconstituted by titration of the appropriate yeast heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). For nucleosomes with linker DNA, we list the asymmetric dimers in linker proximal, linker distal order throughout (e.g. AB/AB-apm for a nucleosome with a linker distal H2A/H2B dimer harboring the acidic patch alteration).</p><p>First, we monitored H2A.Z deposition with nucleosomes harboring an unlabeled H2A/H2B heterodimer with a disrupted acidic patch (AB-apm) assembled on the nucleosomal face opposite to the Cy5-labeled heterodimer that will be monitored for H2A.Z deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G and H</xref>). Strikingly, H2A.Z deposition was crippled, irrespective of whether the linker distal or linker proximal H2A/H2B heterodimer was the target for exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, AB-apm/AB-Cy5 and AB-Cy5/AB-apm substrates). We then tested if the Cy5-labeled heterodimer that is targeted for replacement also requires an intact acidic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3I</xref>). In this case as well, H2A.Z deposition was not greater than the no enzyme control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, AB/AB-apm-Cy5 substrate). Thus, SWR1C requires that both faces of the nucleosome contain an intact acidic patch, irrespective of which H2A/H2B heterodimer is undergoing replacement.</p><p>Previously, we and others reported that SWR1C preferentially exchanges the linker distal H2A/H2B dimer, as monitored by either ensemble or single molecule FRET analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poyton et al., 2022</xref>). The asymmetric nucleosome substrates, harboring only a single, labeled H2A/H2B dimer were leveraged to further investigate this preferential exchange. Consistent with previous results, a substrate with a labeled, linker distal heterodimer is exchanged at a ~threefold faster rate by SWR1C compared to the linker proximal dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare AB/AB-Cy5 to AB-Cy5/AB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). To rule out the possibility that this preferential exchange was influenced by the unlabeled H2A/H2B dimer on the opposing nucleosomal face, nucleosomes harboring an unlabeled ZB dimer were also reconstituted. In these cases as well, the linker distal H2A/H2B dimer was exchanged at a more rapid rate, compared to the linker proximal heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare ZB/AB-Cy5 to AB-Cy5/ZB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, E</xref>). Surprisingly, incorporation of the ZB heterodimer on the contralateral (opposite to the dimer being evicted) nucleosome face stimulated H2A.Z deposition, irrespective of linker orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; purple bars). The stimulatory effect of contralateral ZB heterodimer placement remained even after elimination of the linker DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, F</xref>). Interestingly, these assays also confirmed that linker DNA has a stimulatory impact on the H2A.Z deposition reaction, with both linker distal and linker proximal eviction occurring at a faster rate than eviction from a nucleosome core particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>). To test whether the stimulation by linker DNA was due to differences in nucleosome-binding affinity, we ensured the experiment was done under saturating enzyme levels by repeating it at a fourfold increase in the concentration of SWR1C. At this higher concentration of SWR1C, the rates were unchanged, and the stimulatory impact of linker DNA remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, both linker DNA and nucleosomal ZB dimers appear to stimulate H2A.Z deposition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intact nucleosomal acidic patches are required for SWR1C ATPase activity</title><p>The ATPase activity of SWR1C is stimulated by both its nucleosomal substrate and free ZB dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luk et al., 2010</xref>).  Notably, the ATPase activity of SWR1C is not stimulated by a ZB/ZB nucleosome, implying that SWR1C can distinguish product from substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luk et al., 2010</xref>).  To investigate the role of the nucleosomal acidic patch in the stimulation of SWR1C ATPase activity, SWR1C ATPase activity was measured in the presence or absence of different 77N0-Cy3 nucleosomes.  Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luk et al., 2010</xref>), SWR1C ATPase activity was stimulated by AB/AB nucleosomes as compared to the basal level.

Using a Cy3-labeled 77N0 nucleosome, we determined a Kd of 13.6 nM for an AB/AB nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), similar to prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2022</xref>).

Given the range of SWR1C concentrations that could be used in this assay, we estimate that alteration of one or both nucleosomal acidic patches decreases binding affinity by at least 10-fold.

Addition of wildtype Swc5 to nucleosomes led to formation of discrete complexes with an apparent Kd of 125.7 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Likewise, binding of Swc5<sup>LDW-3A</sup>, which has a disrupted BCNT domain, bound to nucleosomes with nearly identical affinity, compared to wildtype Swc5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, high affinity binding of Swc5 to nucleosomes required an intact acidic patch, with binding reduced ~threefold when an APM nucleosome was used as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Here, leveraging asymmetrically constructed nucleosomes, we have found that both acidic patches are essential for the ATP-dependent deposition of H2A.Z by SWR1C. Each acidic patch is key for high affinity nucleosome binding, and this defect in binding appears to result in an inability of APM nucleosomes to stimulate SWR1C ATPase activity. The requirement for both acidic patches suggests that SWR1C adopts a pincer conformation, contacting both acidic patches and leading to a conformation that stimulates the ATPase activity of SWR1C from basal levels. Like others have noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier, 2021</xref>), the thermodynamic landscape of the nucleosome provides a much higher barrier to dimer exchange than sliding, and we suspect this is likely responsible for the greater effect of an asymmetric acidic patch mutant nucleosome on SWR1C as compared to other remodelers. Additionally, while the acidic patch plays a key role in the activity of SWR1C and other chromatin remodeling enzymes, it also serves as a docking point for other non-chromatin remodeling nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGinty and Tan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalashnikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skrajna et al., 2020</xref>). From our data, we can conclude that other acidic patch interacting proteins may consequently inhibit the activity of SWR1C even if only one acidic patch is sterically occluded.</p><p>Recently, the nucleosomal acidic patch has been shown to differentially impact the behavior of chromatin remodeling enzymes in an asymmetric manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levendosky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lehmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levendosky and Bowman, 2019</xref>). Studies on the sliding activity of the ISWI chromatin remodeling enzyme from both humans and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> show that the linker proximal acidic patch (the DNA entry side) is more important than the linker distal acidic patch for maintaining appropriate sliding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levendosky and Bowman, 2019</xref>). In contrast, budding yeast Chd1 shows a small reduction in sliding rate when either acidic patch is disrupted. The nucleosomal acidic patch is also essential for remodeling by SWI/SNF family members, and in this case the two acidic patches on the nucleosome are contacted by two different subunits –Snf5 (human SMARCAD1) and the Snf2 (human BRG1) ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ye et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mashtalir et al., 2020</xref>). Cramer and colleagues suggested that the RSC complex may use both acidic patches to sandwich the histone octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>), however, loss of the Snf5 (SMARCAD1) arginine anchor has only a small impact on remodeling, whereas the key domain within the Snf2 subunit (the SnAC domain) is essential for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ye et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulvihill et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, unlike SWR1C, both acidic patch surfaces are not essential for the activity of other remodeling enzymes.</p><p>The cryoEM structure of a SWR1C–nucleosome complex suggests that the enzyme has two major nucleosomal contacts – the Swr1 ATPase lobes interact with nucleosomal DNA ~2 helical turns from the nucleosomal dyad (SHL2.0), and the Swc6/Arp6 module interacts with DNA at the nucleosomal edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>). These contacts encompass the DNA gyre that wraps the AB dimer that is destined to be exchanged in the first round of catalysis (the linker distal dimer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). The structure also indicated that each of the two nucleosomal acidic patches may make contacts with SWR1C subunits, although in both cases the unambiguous identification of the amino acid sequence was restricted by the resolution of cryoEM maps. It seems likely that the Swc2 subunit may contact the acidic patch of the H2A/H2B dimer that is not targeted for replacement. Unfortunately, the Swc5 subunit was not visualized in a previous cryoEM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>), but here we find that Swc5 can make an arginine anchor-like interaction with the nucleosomal acidic patch. SWR1C that lacks Swc5 shows the same spectrum of defects as disruption of the nucleosome acidic patch, consistent with Swc5 playing a key role in anchoring SWR1C to the nucleosome. Based on the existing cryoEM map of the SWR1C–nucleosome complex, we propose that Swc5 contacts the H2A/H2B dimer that is targeted for eviction, positioned between the Arp6/Swc6 complex and the Swr1 ATPase. While some observed density at that nucleosome acidic patch was tentatively identified as Swc6 in the cryoEM map, the authors noted that the resolution in this region was insufficient to make a putative sequence determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, this location places Swc5 close to its interaction surfaces on Swr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2009</xref>), as well as positioning its acidic N-terminal domain in an ideal location to capture the evicted AB dimer, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One advantage of the hexosome strategy for reconstitution of asymmetric nucleosomal substrates is that we were able to reconstitute homogeneous, heterotypic Z/A nucleosomes. This nucleosome mimics the product of the first round of H2A.Z deposition, a potential intermediate toward the formation of a homotypic Z/Z nucleosome. Surprisingly, we found that incorporation of one H2A.Z/H2B dimer stimulated the second round of dimer exchange. This stimulation was observed for both linker proximal and linker distal positions, as well as for a nucleosome core particle. The heterotypic Z/A nucleosome (with linker) reproducibly stimulated deposition rate by ~20%, values which are unlikely to be detected in prior studies that used a standard A/A nucleosomal substrate and reaction conditions where nucleosomes were in large excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). How incorporation of one H2A.Z/H2B dimer stimulates the second cycle of dimer exchange in not clear, but one possibility is that re-orientation or re-binding of SWR1C may be facilitated if the enzyme encounters an H2A.Z surface on the initial binding event.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the impact of Swc5 on the nucleosome-binding activity of SWR1C, concluding that this subunit does not play a role in nucleosome recognition. For instance, initial work from Wu and colleagues employed a nucleosomal array pulldown assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>), while subsequent studies from Wigley and colleagues used a native gel, electrophoresis shift assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). In both cases, loss of Swc5 from SWR1C had no detectable impact on nucleosome binding. Furthermore, recent live cell imaging from the Wu group showed that Swc5 is not required for general chromatin association by SWR1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>). Together with our results, these data suggest that SWR1C may make strong nonspecific interactions with chromatin, most likely through the Swc2 subunit which is known to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, deletion of Swc2 results in a substantial reduction in the localization of SWR1C to chromatin in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, stabilization of a SWR1C–nucleosome complex in a gel matrix may mask the defects in binding that we observe here in a solution-based assay. Notably, our FP assay is unable to detect nucleosome binding by SWR1C if the affinity is reduced by more than 10-fold, and consequently our work indicates that Swc5 is essential for high affinity interactions that are required for subsequent H2A.Z deposition. Whether Swc5 plays roles subsequent to nucleosome recognition is currently unclear.</p><p>In addition to contacting the nucleosomal acidic patch, our Swc5–nucleosome structure indicates that Swc5 makes contacts with the H4 N-terminal tail and the H2B C-terminal helix. Previous work has shown that acetylation of the H4 tail can influence both SWR1C recruitment and activity, raising the possibility that the Swc5–H4 interaction may be functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altaf et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we find that Swc5 interacts with the H2B C-terminal helix via contact with H2B-K123 which is subject to transcription-associated modification with ubiquitin by the Bre1-Rad6 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, H2B-K123ub is enriched at the +1 nucleosome, the same nucleosome targeted by SWR1C for H2A.Z deposition. Strikingly, a ChIP-exo study found that H2B-K123ub is enriched at the NFR proximal face of the +1, while H2A.Z is enriched at the NFR distal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>). The anti-correlation between H2B-K123ub and H2A.Z is consistent with the idea that H2B ubiquitinylation disrupts the Swc5–nucleosome interaction and regulates H2A.Z deposition. Interestingly, H2B-K123ub is also known to regulate the Chd1 remodeler, but in this case H2B-K123ub does not appear to contact Chd1, but rather it interacts with unwrapped nucleosomal DNA, stimulating sliding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The human homolog of Swc5 is Craniofacial development protein 1 (Cfdp1), although there is currently a lack of information on the role of Cfdp1 in development. Mutations in a human homolog of SWR1C, SRCAP is implicated in Floating Harbor syndrome, which results in skeletal and facial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Messina et al., 2016</xref>). Complementary to this observation, additional evidence suggests Cfdp1 has an essential role in bone development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celauro et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, a survey of Cfdp1 mutations identified in the TCGA transCancer atlas reveals many missense substitutions within the C-terminal BCNT domain, as well as a cluster of substitutions directly adjacent to the arginine-rich domain. The majority of these Cfdp1 alterations are associated with uterine endometrial carcinomas, suggesting that Cfdp1, and likely the SRCAP remodeler, are key for suppressing cancer initiation or progression in this cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

This ratio was found to reliably produce a mixture of hexasomes and nucleosomes, and in the case of hexasomes the dimer is known to be deposited on the ‘strong’ side of the Widom position sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levendosky et al., 2016</xref>). For asymmetric nucleosomes containing a single dimer labeled with Cy5, the template DNA was varied such that the labeled dimer is deposited on the strong side of the 601 positioning sequence.

Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 holey carbon, 300 mesh, copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were glow discharged for 45 s at 15 mA with an easiGlow device (PELCO). After glow discharge, 3 µl of sample was pipetted onto the grid and Grade 595 filter paper (Ted Pella) was used to blot the grid for 3 s, at 4°C and 100% humidity. The grid was plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen with a Vitrobot Mark IV instrument (Thermo Scientific). A Krios G3i microscope (Thermo Scientific) operating at 300 kV was used in conjunction with a K3 direct electron detector camera (Gatan) to collect data in super-resolution mode at the Pacific Northwest Cryo-EM Center. 13,855 movies were collected at a nominal magnification of 29,000× with a physical pixel size of 0.788 Å (super-resolution, 0.394 Å). The total dose per exposure was 50 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> at a dose rate of ~18.5 e<sup>−</sup>/pix/s and each exposure was fractioned into 50 subframes. Data were recorded in the defocus range of −0.8 to −2.8 µm.</p><p>Data were processed with the cryoSPARC v4 suite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). Super-resolution movies were motion-corrected with ‘Patch Motion Correction’ and binned using 2× Fourier cropping. CTF(contrast transfer function) values were estimated with ‘Patch CTF Estimation’. Initial particles were picked with ‘Blob Picker’ from a subset of micrographs, then used for ab initio 3D reconstruction, and the best obtained model was used to generate templates for particle picking with ‘Template Picker’. Template-picked particles were refined into three classes using ‘Heterogenous Refinement’ with the previously generated ab initio reconstructions as initial volumes to remove junk particles. 1,846,495 nucleosomal particles were further filtered to remove low-quality particles using the ‘random-phase 3D classification’ strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gong et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, particles were sequentially subjected to multiple rounds of Heterogeneous Refinement against a low-pass filtered reconstruction (40, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and 8 Å low-pass) of the output volume from the previous round. This strategy yielded two classes of high-quality particles with the nucleosomal DNA either (1) completely wrapped around the core (585,573 particles, Non-uniform Refinement to 3.0 Å resolution), or (2) partially peeling off (392,348 particles, 3.1 Å). The Swc5 moiety is extremely noisy in these reconstructions due to apparent structural heterogeneity. We tried employing various methods including ‘3D Variability Analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Punjani and Fleet, 2021</xref>) to either further classify the particles into more homogenous subsets or to describe the intrinsic conformational dynamics, but with limited success (data not shown). We obtained the most informative results with cryoSPARC’s algorithm of ‘3D Classification’ without alignment. The 585 k particles of fully wrapped nucleosome were classified into 10 classes using a mask focused on the sides of the histone core in the regions with Swc5 moiety apparent. The obtained particle classes were refined to ~3.1 Å using ‘Non-uniform Refinement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Punjani et al., 2020</xref>).

Their data convincingly demonstrate that the nucleosome's acidic patch plays a crucial role in the substrate recognition by SWR1C. The authors presented clear evidence showing that Swc5 is a pivotal subunit involved in the interaction between SWR1C and the acidic patch. They pared down the specific region within Swc5 responsible for this interaction. However, two central assertions of the paper are less convincing. First, the data supporting the claim that the insertion of one Z-B dimer into the canonical nucleosome can stimulate SWR1C to insert the second Z-B dimer is somewhat questionable (see below). Given that this claim contradicts previous observations made by other groups, this hypothesis needs further testing to eliminate potential artifacts. Secondly, the claim that SWR1C simultaneously recognizes the acidic patch on both sides of the nucleosome also needs further investigation, as the assay used to establish this claim lacks the sensitivity necessary to distinguish any difference between nucleosomal substrates containing one or two intact acidic patches.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>As mentioned in the summary, the authors presented clear evidence demonstrating the role of Swc5 in recognition of the nucleosome acidic patch. The identification of the specific region in Swc5 responsible for this interaction is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful critique of our work. Below we address each major concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:(1) Figure 1B: It is unclear how much of the decrease in FRET is caused by the bleaching of fluorophores. The authors should include a negative control in which Z-B dimers are omitted from the reaction. In the absence of ZB dimers, SWR1C will not exchange histones. Therefore, any decrease in FRET should represent the bleaching of fluorophores on the nucleosomal substrate, allowing normalization of the FRET signal related to A-B eviction.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript, as well as in our two previous publications (Singh et al., 2019; Fan et al.,2022), we have presented the results of no enzyme controls, +/- ZB dimers, no ATP controls, or AMP-PNP controls for our FRET-based, H2A.Z deposition assay (see also Figure S3). We do not observe significant levels of photobleaching in this assay, either during ensemble measurements or in an smFRET experiment. To aid the reader, we have added the AMP-PNP data for the experiment shown in Figure 1B. The results show there is less than a 10% decrease in FRET over 30’, and the signal from the double acidic patch disrupted nucleosome is identical to this negative control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure S3: The authors use the decrease in FRET signal as a metric of histone eviction. However, Figure S3 suggests that the FRET signal decrease could be due to DNA unwrapping. Histone exchange should not occur when SWR1C is incubated with AMP-PNP, as histone exchange requires ATP hydrolysis (10.7554/eLife.77352). And since the insertion of Z-B dimer and the eviction of A-B dimer are coupled, the decrease of FRET in the presence of AMP-PNP is unlikely due to histone eviction or exchange. Instead, the FRET decrease is likely due to DNA unwrapping (10.7554/eLife.77352). The authors should explicitly state what the loss of FRET means.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, that loss of FRET can be due to DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome. We have previously demonstrated this activity by SWR1C in our smFRET study (Fan et al., 2022). However, DNA unwrapping is highly reversible and has a time duration of only 1-3 seconds. We and others have not observed stable unwrapping of nucleosomes by SWR1C, but rather the stable loss of FRET reports on dimer eviction. We assume the reviewer is concerned about the rather large decrease in FRET signal shown in the AMP-PNP controls for Figure S3, panels A and D. For the other 7 panels, the decrease in FRET with AMP-PNP are minimal. In fact, if we average all of the AMP-PNP data points, the rate of FRET loss is not statistically different from no enzyme control reactions (nucleosome plus ZB dimers).</p><p>Data for panels A and D used a 77NO nucleosomal substrate, with Cy3 labeling the linker distal dimer. This is our standard DNA fragment, and it was used in Figure 1B. The only difference between data sets is that the data shown in Fig 1B used nucleosome reconstituted with a Cy5-labelled histone octamer, rather than the hexasome assembly method used for Fig S3. Three points are important. First, for all of these substrates, we assembled 3 independent nucleosomes, and the results are highly reproducible. Two, we performed a total of 6 experiments for the 77NO-Cy5 substrates to ensure that the rates were accurate (+/-ATP). Third, and most important, we do not see this decrease in FRET signal in the absence of SWR1C (no enzyme control). This data was included in the data source file. Thus, it appears that there is significant SWR1C-induced nucleosome instability for these two hexasome-assembled substrates. We now note this in the legend to Figure S3. Key for this work, however, is that there is a large increase in the rate of FRET loss in the presence of ATP, and this rate is faster when a ZB dimer was present at the linker proximal location. In response to the last point, we state in the first paragraph of the results: “The dimer exchange activity of SWR1C is monitored by following the decrease in the 670 nm FRET signal due to eviction of the Cy5-labeled AB-Cy5 dimer (Figure 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Related to point 2. One way to distinguish nucleosomal DNA unwrapping from histone dimer eviction is that unwrapping is reversible, whereas A-B eviction is not. Therefore, if the authors remove AMP-PNP from the reaction chamber and a FRET signal reappears, then the initial loss of FRET was due to reversible DNA unwrapping. However, if the removal of AMP-PNP did not regain FRET, it means that the loss of FRET was likely due to A-B eviction. The authors should perform an AMP-PNP and/or ATP removal experiment to make sure the interpretation of the data is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to item 2 above</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The nature of the error bars in Figure 1C is undefined; therefore, the statistical significance of the data is not interpretable.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making this more explicit for each figure. The error bars report on 95% confidence intervals from at least 3 sets of experiments. This statement has been added to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors claim that the SWR1C requires intact acidic patches on both sides of the nucleosomes to exchange histone. This claim was based on the experiment in Figure 1C where they showed mutation of one of two acidic patches in the nucleosomal substrate is sufficient to inhibit SWR1C-mediated histone exchange activity. However, one could argue that the sensitivity of this assay is too low to distinguish any difference between nucleosomes with one (i.e., AB/AB-apm) versus two mutated acidic patches (i.e., AB-apm/AB-apm). The lack of sensitivity of the eviction assay can be seen when Figure 1B is taken into consideration. In the gel-shift assay, the AB-apm/AB-apm nucleosome exhibited a 10% SWR1C-mediated histone exchange activity compared to WT. However, in the eviction assay, the single AB/AB-apm mutant has no detectable activity. Therefore, to test their hypothesis, the authors should use the more sensitive in-gel histone exchange assay to see if the single AB/AB-apm mutant is more or equally active compared to the double AB-apm/AB-apm mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>Our pincher model is based on three, independent sets of data, not just Figure 1C. First, as noted by the reviewer, we find that disruption of either acidic patch cripples the dimer exchange activity of SWR1C in the FRET-based assay. Whether the defect is identical to that of the double APM mutant nucleosome does not seem pertinent to the model. In a second set of assays, we used fluorescence polarization to quantify the binding affinity of SWR1C for wildtype nucleosomes, a double APM nucleosome, or each single APM nucleosome. Consistent with the pincher model, each single APM disruption decreases binding affinity at least 10-fold (below the sensitivity of the assay). Finally, we monitored the ability of different nucleosomes to stimulate the ATPase activity of SWR1C. Consistent with the pincher model, a single APM disruption was sufficient to eliminate nucleosome stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors claim that the AZ nucleosome is a better substrate than the AA nucleosome. This is a surprising result as previous studies showed that the two insertion steps of the two Z-B dimers are not cooperative (10.7554/eLife.77352 and 10.1016/J.CELREP.2019.12.006). The authors' claim was based on the eviction assay shown in Fig 1C. However, I am not sure how much variation in the eviction assay is contributed by different preparations of nucleosomes. The authors should use the in-gel assay to independently test this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>For all data shown in our manuscript, at least three different nucleosome preparations were used. The impact of a ZB dimer on the rates of dimer exchange was highly reproducible among different nucleosome preparations and experiments. We also see reproducible ZB stimulation for three different substrates – with ZB on the linker proximal side, the linker distal side, and on one side of a core particle. We do not believe that our data are inconsistent with previous studies. First, the previous work referenced by the reviewer performed dimer exchange reactions with a large excess of nucleosomes to SWR1C (catalytic conditions), whereas we used single turnover reactions. Secondly, our study is the first to use a homogenous, ZA heterotypic nucleosome as a substrate for SWR1C. All previous studies used a standard AA nucleosome, following the first and second rounds of dimer exchange that occur sequentially. And finally, we observe only a 20-30% increase in rate by a ZB dimer (e.g. 77N0 substrates), and such an increase was unlikely to have been detected by previous gel-based assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Abstract line 4: To say 'Numerous' studies have shown acidic patch impact chromatin remodeling enzymes activity may be too strong.</p></disp-quote><p>Removed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 15, line 15: The authors claim that swc5∆ was inviable on formamide media.

Therefore, the pincher model proposed by the authors would suggest that there is a missing subunit that recognizes the second acidic patch. The authors should point out this fact in the discussion. However, as mentioned in Major comment 6, I am not sure if the pincer model is substantiated.</p></disp-quote><p>In our discussion, we had noted that the published cryoEM structure had suggested that the Swc2 subunit likely interacts with the acidic patch on the dimer that is not targeted for replacement, and we proposed that Swc5 interacts with the acidic patch on the exchanging H2A/H2B dimer. We have now made this more clear in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
