development. In contrast, amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. How is their polarity determined? In the chick embryo, the earliest known factor is cVg1 (homologous to mammalian growth differentiation factor 1, GDF1), a transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen to find upstream regulators of cVg1 in normal embryos and in embryos manipulated to form twins now uncovers the transcription factor Pitx2 as a candidate. We show that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation, and that it acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighbouring genes. Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1 and Nodal are also key actors in left–right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03743.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03743.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03743.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In warm-blooded animals, including chickens and humans, a single embryo can give rise to several separate individuals (identical twins). Some species of armadillos routinely give birth to quadruplets in this way—and in experiments, up to eight identical chick embryos can be produced by cutting one embryo into smaller pieces (a type of ‘experimental twinning’). This ability of a developing embryo to subdivide into separate individuals ends when the embryo starts to form its first midline structure, called the ‘primitive streak’. This is the first line of symmetry and defines where the head–tail axis will later develop.</p><p>The steps that establish the axes of the embryo in birds and mammals, and the factors that prevent further splitting of the embryo to form twins after this point, are only just beginning to be understood. In chick embryos, the production of a protein called cVg1 is the first known step and precedes the development of a line of symmetry. A similar protein is produced in mammalian embryos and both proteins are members of an important family of signalling proteins.</p><p>Now, Torlopp, Khan et al. have used a combination of techniques to search for other proteins that that control the production of the cVg1 protein. Genes that are active in the region of the embryo that will express cVg1 later in development were identified, both in normal embryos and during the process of experimental twinning. This search revealed Pitx2 as a protein that acts to switch on the expression of the gene that encodes cVg1. When the Pitx2 protein is removed, the embryonic axis forms from the opposite side.</p><p>Next, Torlopp, Khan et al. searched the chicken genome to identify stretches of DNA around the cVg1 gene where proteins that regulate gene expression might bind. Six potential sites were found, including four to which Pitx2 can bind. Further experiments confirmed that two of these regulatory sequences encourage the expression of the cVg1 gene at its correct position in the embryo.</p><p>Pitx2 and related proteins were known to be involved with the development of left–right symmetry later in development; the findings of Torlopp, Khan et al. reveal, unexpectedly, that these proteins are also involved in first establishing the position at which the midline of the embryo will arise. It remains unclear what prevents most embryos from forming twins. But Torlopp, Khan et al.'s findings could help to explain some strange observations, made long ago, about left–right asymmetry in identical twins. For example, they could help explain why one of the twins in an identical twin pair is more likely to be left-handed than an individual in the general population, and why the direction of whorls of hair on the back of the head is often mirrored between identical twins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03743.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03743.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>primitive streak</kwd><kwd>embryonic axis</kwd><kwd>embryo polarity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GEMELLI 249892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torlopp</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>Mohsin A F</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Nidia M M</given-names></name><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Claudio D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT083345MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lekk</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Claudio D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In higher vertebrates, the position of the embryonic axis (the location at which gastrulation starts) is determined by the transcription factor Pitx2, which suggests that the mechanisms of this process, and hence those that regulate twinning, are related to those that set up the left–right axis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates (fishes and amphibians), embryonic polarity is first established by localisation of maternal determinants in the cytoplasm and/or cortex of the fertilised egg. This generates differences between the blastomeres that will form by cell division from the egg, and which will culminate in specifying the orientation of the embryonic axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson, 1898</xref>). Separation of the first two blastomeres can lead to twinning: the formation of genetically identical, complete individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driesch, 1892</xref>). Separation of blastomeres after the four-cell stage, however, does not generate twins; in most cases it interferes with development of even a single embryo owing to the removal of important determinants that have by then segregated to different cells. This is known as the <italic>mosaic</italic> mode of development. Among the vertebrates, amniotes (birds and many mammals, and possibly also reptiles) have a remarkably extended capacity to give rise to twins. Some species of the armadillo genus Dasypus generate quadruplets or octuplets from a single fertilisation event, as a result of two or more sequential ‘splitting’ events of the embryo at a stage when it is already highly multicellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newman and Patterson, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loughry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enders, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eakin and Behringer, 2004</xref>). Conjoined (‘Siamese’) twins occur in mammals including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chai and Crary, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanderzon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaufman, 2004</xref>) and are also seen in reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cunningham, 1937</xref>) and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ulshafer and Clavert, 1979</xref>); most of these are thought to arise from splitting of the embryo relatively late in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaufman, 2004</xref>). Perhaps the most dramatic example is seen in the chick, where cutting an embryo into fragments at the blastoderm stage (when the embryo contains as many as 20,000–50,000 cells) can lead to each fragment generating a complete embryo; up to eight embryos have been generated from a single blastoderm by experimental splitting, right up to the time of appearance of the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lutz, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spratt and Haas, 1960</xref>). The ability of higher vertebrate embryos to retain a <italic>regulative</italic> model of development until such a late stage strongly suggests that localisation of maternally inherited determinants is not an essential component of the mechanisms specifying embryo polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stern and Downs, 2012</xref>). Moreover, since a single blastoderm can generate multiple embryos, mechanisms must exist that suppress this ability in regions of the embryo that do not normally initiate axis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In chick embryos, the earliest symmetry breaking event known is the localised expression of <italic>cVg1</italic>, the chick orthologue of mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 (<italic>GDF1</italic>)—a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily of secreted proteins—encoding a Nodal/Activin-type molecule that signals through Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weeks and Melton, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomsen and Melton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kessler and Melton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seleiro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kessler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birsoy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>). Before primitive streak stages, <italic>cVg1</italic> is expressed in the posterior marginal zone (PMZ), an extraembryonic region adjacent to where the primitive streak will form; misexpression of <italic>cVg1</italic> in other (anterior or lateral) parts of the marginal zone is sufficient to induce a complete axis from adjacent embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seleiro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skromne and Stern, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2002</xref>). The mechanisms that position <italic>cVg1</italic> in the PMZ are unknown. Moreover, when a blastoderm is cut in half at right angles to the future primitive streak axis, <italic>cVg1</italic> expression spontaneously initiates in the marginal zone adjacent to the cut edge, in either the right or left side at equal frequency, foreshadowing the appearance of the primitive streak a few hours later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini et al., 2004</xref>). This observation shows that the mechanisms that position <italic>cVg1</italic> are active in the blastoderm stage embryo. Here we take advantage of these observations to design a molecular screen for new genes involved in the earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity; together with bioinformatic analysis and embryological experiments we identify the transcription factor <italic>Pitx2</italic> as a direct and essential regulator of <italic>cVg1</italic> expression both during normal development and in embryonic regulation (induced twinning).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A molecular screen to identify upstream regulators of cVg1 uncovers Pitx2</title><p>To search for putative upstream regulators of <italic>cVg1</italic>, we took advantage of two of its properties: that it is expressed in the PMZ at early stages of development and that when a blastoderm is cut in half at right angles to the axis of the future primitive streak, <italic>cVg1</italic> expression is initiated stochastically on either the left or the right corner (adjacent to the cut edge) of the isolated anterior half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore performed two screens. First, we dissected the PMZ and an equivalent anterior explant (anterior marginal zone, AMZ) from 40 embryos (in triplicate) and analysed their transcriptomes using Affymetrix microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At this stage of development, it is not possible to predict the polarity of the embryo with complete certainty. To prevent contamination of the samples, we designed a verification strategy by which the predicted posterior and anterior explants were collected, the rest of the embryo immediately fixed and then processed for in situ hybridisation for <italic>cVg1</italic>, developing the colour reaction for long enough to detect residual <italic>cVg1</italic> expression around the posterior explant site. From each set of 40 embryos, approximately 36 had been dissected correctly; the explants from the remainder (3 × 4) were discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each set of verified PMZs and AMZs (3 × 36 of each) was then pooled and run on Affymetrix 30K chicken microarrays.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03743.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microarray screens for upstream regulators of cVg1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the first screen: the posterior marginal zone (PMZ) and anterior marginal zone (AMZ) were dissected from embryos at stage XI–XII; the remaining embryo was then fixed and stained for <italic>cVg1</italic> by in situ hybridisation (ISH) to confirm that the explants had been obtained from the correct regions. This was done from 40 embryos for each of three biological replicates, which were then run on microarrays. The diagram is accompanied by an example of an embryo after ISH.

This allowed identification of the ‘<italic>cVg1</italic>-like’ and ‘<italic>cVg1</italic>-unlike’ explants, which were then pooled appropriately.

It was previously reported that <italic>cVg1</italic> starts to be expressed in either the left or right corner of the cut anterior half around 6 hr after bisection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini et al., 2004</xref>). We chose to collect the left and right corners of the marginal zone adjacent to the cut edge 7 hr following bisection to ensure that surrounding <italic>cVg1</italic> expression could be detected after excision of the fragment. To confirm that all embryos had been cut at exactly right angles to the future axis, the posterior half of each embryo was fixed immediately after cutting and subjected to in situ hybridisation for <italic>cVg1</italic>. The anterior half was cultured for 7 hr, the left and right corners of the margin were dissected, and the remainder was fixed and processed for <italic>cVg1</italic> expression (with extended reaction time to detect weak expression). We estimated that 70 explants would be needed for microarray analysis of each sample; this was done in triplicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Samples were designated ‘<italic>cVg1</italic>-like’ or ‘<italic>cVg1</italic>-unlike’ based on this and pooled accordingly. This strategy randomised any left–right asymmetric genes unrelated to axial polarity and regulation, and enriched those for the cells in which <italic>cVg1</italic> was just starting to be expressed de novo in one sample, and their contralateral equivalents (not expressing <italic>cVg1</italic>) in the other. RNA from the pooled explants (approximately 3 × 63 of each type) was analysed using Affymetrix chicken microarrays.</p><p>The intersection between the two datasets from the above screens was used to identify genes co-regulated with <italic>cVg1</italic>, as well as those that are enriched in equivalent regions <italic>not</italic> expressing <italic>cVg1</italic>, both in normal embryos and during regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Using a threshold of just 1.2-fold change and p &lt; 0.05, this strategy identified 122 sequences (corresponding to 85 genes) with putative ‘cVg1-like’ expression (a c<italic>Vg1</italic>-synexpression group) and 78 sequences (52 genes) expressed more highly in the ‘Vg1-unlike’ explants (cVg1 negative) . A list of the top common genes ranked by fold change is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Comparison of the top ‘Vg1-like’ candidates from whole embryos (PMZ vs AMZ) with their counterparts from half-embryos shows highly significant correlation (Spearman's rank Rho = 0.73; p = 0.00036). Confirming that the screen was performed appropriately, <italic>cVg1</italic> (incorrectly annotated as <italic>GDF3</italic> instead of <italic>GDF1</italic> in the current version of the chicken genome, Galgal4) itself appears among the top genes: it is upregulated 4.3 fold, with a p value of 0.00006 (rank 11) in whole embryos, and 1.71, p = 0.0062 in the isolated anterior half (rank 21). Among all genes, <italic>Pitx2</italic> immediately stands out as the best candidate, being very strongly co-regulated with <italic>cVg1</italic> and the top transcription factor on the list. In the PMZ of whole embryos <italic>Pitx2</italic> is upregulated almost 10-fold compared to the AMZ explants (three different probes, ranking two, three and eight on the list; p = 0.0001, 0.00019 and 0.003 respectively), whereas in the cut halves it is upregulated by about 2.4 fold (three probes ranking four, six and eight on the list; p between 0.002–0.008).<table-wrap id="tbl1"

Control-MO targeted to the PMZ did not alter <italic>cVg1</italic> expression after 5 hr or streak formation after 12–16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data1C,D</xref>). With <italic>Pitx2</italic>-MO, <italic>cVg1</italic> expression was affected after 5 hr (0/6 embryos expressing; p &lt; 0.001). Embryos started to recover, however, at later time points: at 12 hr, 3/12 had a normal streak, 3/12 had a displaced streak, 3/12 had two streaks, and the remaining 3/12 had no streaks (p = 0.1—not significantly different). By 16 hr, the majority of the embryos were normal (7/8; the remaining embryo had a displaced streak) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1D</xref>). These results suggest that while knockdown of <italic>Pitx2</italic> affects <italic>cVg1</italic> expression, embryos tend to recover by 12–16 hr. We reasoned that functional redundancy with another <italic>Pitx</italic> gene, or compensatory upregulation of such a gene in response to <italic>Pitx2</italic> knockdown, could account for this recovery. To test this, we examined <italic>Pitx1</italic> expression in normal embryos at stages X–XII and in embryos electroporated with <italic>Pitx2</italic>-MO. <italic>Pitx1</italic> is barely detectable in the PMZ at stage X–XII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). After <italic>Pitx2</italic>-MO electroporation, expression increased considerably (6/6 embryos; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We therefore repeated the targeting experiments in whole embryos using a mixture of two MOs targeting the translation start site of <italic>Pitx2</italic> and an internal splice junction of <italic>Pitx1</italic>, respectively. <italic>Pitx1</italic>+<italic>2</italic>-MOs caused loss of <italic>cVg1</italic> at 5 hr in 6/6 cases (p = 0.005). By 12 hr 1/9 embryos had a normal streak, 3/9 had a displaced streak, 3/9 had two streaks and 2/9 had none (p = 0.043). By 16 hr no recovery was observed: 4/4 embryos had double streaks, neither arising from the targeted site (p = 0.029; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1E,F</xref>). This effect could be rescued by supplying <italic>Pitx2</italic> alone: co-electroporation of <italic>Pitx1</italic>+<italic>2</italic>-MO together with a <italic>Pitx2</italic> expression construct lacking the MO target sequence led to normal axis formation: in 5/6 cases <italic>cVg1</italic> expression was restored after 5 hr incubation and by 16 hr 12/16 embryos displayed a normal streak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1G–H</xref>). Likewise in isolated anterior halves, the effects of <italic>Pitx1+2</italic>-MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1I,J</xref>) could be rescued by <italic>Pitx2</italic>.

When ectopically applied to another region of the marginal zone, <italic>cVg1</italic> is sufficient to initiate formation of a complete embryonic axis from adjacent embryonic (area pellucida) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seleiro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shah et al., 1997</xref>).

The anterior end of the embryo also has an early identity, defined by the expression of GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sheng and Stern, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertocchini and Stern, 2012</xref>). However, unlike cVg1, GATA2 is not a sufficient determinant of polarity and at best only acts as a bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertocchini and Stern, 2012</xref>).</p><p>While amphibian and teleost embryos lose their ability to generate complete, independent embryos if fragmented after the first few cell divisions, amniotes have huge regulative capacity. Dividing a chick blastoderm even just before primitive streak formation (when the embryo may have as many as 50,000 cells) into up to eight fragments can lead to formation of as many complete embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lutz, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spratt and Haas, 1960</xref>). In an isolated anterior half, a visible primitive streak (and expression of <italic>Brachyury</italic> and <italic>Snail2</italic>) can be detected about 12 hr after cutting. This appears randomly from either the left or right area pellucida adjacent to the cut edge of the marginal zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spratt and Haas, 1960</xref>), preceded at least 6 hr earlier by expression of <italic>cVg1</italic> in the right or left marginal zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini et al., 2004</xref>). Blocking cVg1 on one side of the marginal zone of an isolated anterior half will cause the axis to arise from the opposite side. A similar manipulation in the PMZ will cause a streak to arise from outside the MO-electroporated domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertocchini and Stern, 2012</xref>). Thus, <italic>cVg1</italic> expression in the marginal zone is both necessary and sufficient to initiate formation of a primitive streak.</p><p>There was no information, however, about what positions <italic>cVg1</italic> expression in the PMZ of normal embryos or in isolated fragments. This led us to undertake a screen for upstream regulators. We took two complementary approaches: a molecular screen, designed to identify genes co-expressed with <italic>cVg1</italic> both in the normal PMZ and in the <italic>cVg1</italic>-expressing edge of the marginal zone in isolated anterior halves at the time when <italic>cVg1</italic> first becomes detectable, and a bioinformatics-based approach, predicting and analysing putative enhancers of <italic>cVg1</italic> situated on chromosome 28. A particular difficulty of the molecular screen was that it is impossible to know, in a single embryo, which of the two edges of the isolated anterior half will express <italic>cVg1</italic>. This required analysis of each individual fragment just after excising left and right edge explants, then pooling them appropriately according to whether they derived from the <italic>cVg1</italic>-expressing side or the opposite edge. This has the additional advantage of removing any intrinsic left–right differences that may exist in the embryo at this stage. Selecting genes that are co-expressed with <italic>cVg1</italic> when this is first upregulated at one edge of an isolated fragment, and also co-expressed with <italic>cVg1</italic> in the normal PMZ, turned out to be a powerful strategy to reduce the number of relevant genes, thereby avoiding the ‘cherry-picking’ approaches often associated with molecular screens. This combination of molecular screens and bioinformatic analysis converged towards a single strong candidate: the transcription factor <italic>Pitx2</italic>. The regulatory role of Pitx2 on <italic>cVg1</italic> expression was then confirmed by loss-of-function experiments showing that Pitx2 is required for <italic>cVg1</italic> activation and axis formation both in normal development and during embryonic regulation, and that it binds directly to four non-coding regions around the <italic>cVg1</italic> locus (E1, E3, E5, and E6), two of which (E3 and E5) are sufficient to direct expression specifically to the PMZ and <italic>cVg1</italic>-expressing edge of an isolated anterior fragment. Moreover, mutation of any of the Pitx-binding sites in enhancers E3 and E5 abolishes the activity of these enhancers in the PMZ. These findings strongly implicate Pitx2 as a direct and essential regulator of <italic>cVg1</italic> expression.</p><p>Pitx transcription factors are characterised by possessing a Lysine residue at position 50 of the homeodomain, an unusual property shared with the vertebrate genes <italic>Goosecoid</italic> and <italic>OTX-1/2</italic> and with the founder gene of the family, Drosophila <italic>Bicoid</italic>. In Drosophila, Bicoid is a critical specifier of ‘anterior’ identity and essential for setting up head–tail polarity of the early embryo. Although it is tempting to speculate that a <italic>Bicoid</italic>/<italic>Pitx</italic> system may have an ancient function in the specification of head–tail polarity, the <italic>Bicoid</italic> gene does not appear to have direct orthologues in species other than schizophoran flies (closely related to Drosophila), so this may be either a coincidence or convergent evolution.</p><p>The four key components that form part of this gene regulatory network initiating axis formation, <italic>Pitx2</italic>, <italic>cVg1/GDF1</italic>, <italic>Tbx6,</italic> and <italic>Nodal</italic>, are also involved a little later in development (from the late primitive streak stage) in specifying left–right asymmetry in different vertebrate classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hyatt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hyatt and Yost, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Logan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meno et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piedra et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">St Amand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshioka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rankin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raya and Izpisua Belmonte, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hadjantonakis et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, these are the main conserved components of the left–right pathway among different vertebrates. These observations raise the possibility that the left–right pathway may have evolved by co-opting a more ancient mechanism for initiating formation of the gastrular axis. This is supported by the finding that a <italic>Nodal</italic>/<italic>Pitx2</italic> loop is involved in specifying both left–right asymmetry and mesendoderm formation (oral-aboral polarity) in the sea urchin, a non-vertebrate deuterostome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hibino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Warner et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Pitx2</italic>, <italic>Vg1</italic>, <italic>Nodal,</italic> and <italic>Tbx6</italic> are also involved in early mesendoderm development in anamniotes, although <italic>Vg1</italic> is maternal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomsen and Melton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kessler and Melton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faucourt et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse, double mutants for Pitx1 and Pitx2 lead to early lethality (at pre- or peri-implantation stages) of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marcil et al., 2003</xref>). Only a single embryo was ever recovered that had survived to E10–E12 (Drouin, personal communication). Expression of these transcription factors has to date only been studied in detail at later stages of mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">L'Honore et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lanctot et al., 1997</xref>) and it will therefore be interesting to see if they are indeed expressed as in the chick at pre-primitive streak stages. Certainly, the strong conservation of the active enhancers (E3 and E5, including the Pitx-binding sites contained therein) near mouse and human GDF1 suggests that this is likely to be a conserved feature of birds and mammals, and despite the fact that the peculiar geometry of rodent embryos at these early stages has led to some differences in the processes leading to axis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stern and Downs, 2012</xref>). Monozygotic twins do not seem to occur commonly in the mouse and it is possible that these very small, cup-shaped embryos do not survive to term if more than one primitive streak appears within a single blastocyst. Together, these findings suggest that the retention of a regulative mode of development at late stages by amniote embryos (that allows the formation of the types of monozygotic twins that arise relatively late in development, including Siamese twins) evolved through novel uses of an ancient pathway, involved in both mesendoderm development and left–right asymmetry, but in slightly different ways.</p><p>Our study also brings forward the time at which the earliest responses to cutting an embryo can be detected. First, we can now detect <italic>cVg1</italic> expression at one edge of a cut anterior fragment 4–5 hr after cutting, about 2 hr earlier than the 6 hr reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertocchini et al., 2004</xref>); <italic>Pitx2</italic> appears even earlier, 3 hr after cutting. But this also begs the question of what lies upstream of <italic>Pitx2</italic>. At some early point in the cascade, the regulators will no longer be controlled at the transcriptional level and it will be considerably more difficult to identify them. The present finding that <italic>Pitx2</italic> is upregulated locally just 3 hr after cutting an embryo suggests that its regulators may not be differentially expressed mRNAs, but other asymmetries.
