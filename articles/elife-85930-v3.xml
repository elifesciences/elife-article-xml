is a fundamental process in organ formation. During heart development, bilateral myocardial precursors collectively move toward the midline (cardiac fusion) to form the primitive heart tube. Extrinsic influences such as the adjacent anterior endoderm are known to be required for cardiac fusion. We previously showed however, that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) is also required for cardiac fusion (Bloomekatz et al., 2017). Nevertheless, an intrinsic mechanism that regulates myocardial movement has not been elucidated. Here, we show that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) intracellular signaling pathway has an essential intrinsic role in the myocardium directing movement toward the midline. In vivo imaging further reveals midline-oriented dynamic myocardial membrane protrusions that become unpolarized in PI3K-inhibited zebrafish embryos where myocardial movements are misdirected and slower. Moreover, we find that PI3K activity is dependent on and interacts with Pdgfra to regulate myocardial movement. Together our findings reveal an intrinsic myocardial steering mechanism that responds to extrinsic cues during the initiation of cardiac development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart development</kwd><kwd>collective migration</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18CDA34080195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloomekatz</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15HD108782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloomekatz</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloomekatz</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Research on heart tube assembly using zebrafish reveals a pivotal role for intrinsic Pdgfra–PI3K signaling in steering the movement of the myocardium and polarizing myocardial cell protrusions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During organogenesis, cell progenitor populations often need to move from their origin of specification to a new location in order to form a functional organ. Deficient or inappropriate movement can underlie congenital defects and disease. Directing these movements can involve extrinsic factors such as chemical and mechanical cues from neighboring tissues and the local environment as well as intrinsic mechanisms such as intracellular signaling and polarized protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schumacher, 2019</xref>). Progenitor cell movement occurs during cardiac development, where myocardial cells are specified bilaterally on either side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stainier et al., 1993</xref>). To form a single heart that is centrally located, these bilateral populations must move to the midline and merge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilens, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rawles, 1936</xref>). As they move, myocardial cells undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) transition forming intercellular junctions and subsequently moving together as an epithelial collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Trinh and Stainier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dominguez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Linask, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holtzman et al., 2007</xref>). This process is known as cardiac fusion and occurs in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evans et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>External influence from the adjacent endoderm is essential for the collective movement of myocardial cells toward the midline. Mutations in zebrafish and mice which inhibit endoderm specification or disrupt endoderm morphogenesis result in cardia bifida – a phenotype in which the bilateral myocardial populations fail to merge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holtzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kupperman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Osborne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kikuchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mendelson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Molkentin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ye and Lin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yelon et al., 1999</xref>). Similar phenotypes also occur in chicks and rats when the endoderm is mechanically disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goss, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rosenquist, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Varner and Taber, 2012</xref>). Studies simultaneously observing endoderm and myocardial movement have found a correlation between the movements of these two tissues, suggesting a model in which the endoderm provides the mechanical force that pulls myocardial cells toward the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Varner and Taber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrova et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, these correlations do not occur at all stages of cardiac fusion, indicating that myocardial cells may also use intrinsic mechanisms to actively move toward the midline. Indeed, recent studies revealing a role for the receptor tyrosine kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) in the movement of myocardial cells have suggested a paracrine chemotaxis model, in which the myocardium senses chemokine signals from the endoderm and responds to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloomekatz et al., 2017</xref>). However, the existence and identity of these intrinsic myocardial mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>We have sought to identify the intracellular pathways downstream of Pdgfra that regulate the collective movement of the myocardium. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is known as an intracellular signaling mediator of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; e.g. Pdgfra). During PI3K signaling, PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to create phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which recruits pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain containing proteins and regulates many cellular processes including proliferation and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fruman et al., 2017</xref>). Both individualistic cell migration such as in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iijima and Devreotes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yoo et al., 2010</xref>) and collective cell migration such as in the movement of border cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the movement of the anterior visceral endoderm during mouse gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghiglione et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>) have been shown to be regulated by PI3K signaling.</p><p>Using the advantages of external development and ease of live imaging in the zebrafish model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shrestha et al., 2020</xref>), our studies reveal that myocardial PI3K signaling is required for proper directional movement toward the midline during cardiac fusion. In particular, we find that inhibition of the PI3K pathway, throughout the embryo or only in the myocardium, results in bilateral cardiomyocyte populations that fail to reach the midline (cardia bifida) or have only partially merged by the time wild-type myocardial cells are fully merged. High-resolution live imaging in combination with mosaic labeling further reveals that the orientation of myocardial membrane protrusions during cardiac fusion is dependent on PI3K signaling. Furthermore, we find that PI3K and Pdgfra interact to facilitate cardiac fusion. Altogether our work supports a model by which intrinsic Pdgfra–PI3K signaling regulates the formation of membrane protrusions, facilitating the collective movement of the myocardium toward the midline. Insight into the balance of extrinsic and intrinsic influences for directing collective movement of myocardial cells has implications for understanding a wide set of congenital and environmental cardiac defects as well as the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases broadly associated with collective movement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The PI3K pathway is required for proper cardiac fusion</title><p>In a search for intracellular signaling pathways that are important for cardiac fusion, we examined the PI3K signaling pathway by pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity with LY294002 (LY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vlahos et al., 1994</xref>).

However, at higher concentrations than required for inhibiting class I PI3K complexes, LY has also been shown to inhibit non-PI3K complexes (off-targets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gharbi et al., 2007</xref>). To exclude the possibility that LY-induced cardiac fusion phenotypes result from off-target artifacts, we exposed bud stage embryos to two other PI3K inhibitors, Dactolisib (Dac) or Pictilisib (Pic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Raynaud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Folkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maira et al., 2008</xref>). Exposure to these PI3K inhibitors (20–50 μM) causes cardiac fusion defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D, A'–D', F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–I, N, O</xref>) and corresponding reductions in PI3K activity, as measured by the ratio of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) to AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Q–R</xref>). AKT is phosphorylated as a direct consequence of PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alessi et al., 1996</xref>). Despite the increased specificity of Dac and Pic, all three inhibitors (Dac, Pic, and LY) have been shown to also inhibit mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Folkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunn et al., 1996</xref>), as well as class I PI3K complexes. Thus, we directly examined a role for mTOR in cardiac fusion. Incubating embryos from bud stage to 22s with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heitman et al., 1991</xref>), at multiple concentrations did not affect cardiac fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>), even though mTOR activity as measured by S6 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holz and Blenis, 2005</xref>) was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Furthermore, using a non-pharmacological approach we found that mRNA injection of a truncated form of p85, which acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of PI3K (dnPI3K) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carballada et al., 2001</xref>) also caused cardiac fusion defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, E', F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J–L, P, S</xref>). Thus, inhibition of PI3K activity with LY, Dac, Pic, and dominant-negative p85 mRNA, but not mTOR causes cardiac fusion defects.</p><p>We next characterized the morphology of the cardiac ring in PI3K-inhibited embryos and the cellular processes known to be regulated by PI3K signaling. During the later stages of cardiac fusion, myocardial cells develop epithelial polarity in which proteins such as ZO1 form intercellular junctions between myocardial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Trinh and Stainier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>). During this time, the myocardium also moves deeper into the tissue eventually residing ventral to the endoderm in a process known as subduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye et al., 2015</xref>) and it forms a contiguous second dorsal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>, arrows). In PI3K-inhibited embryos, we found that myocardial cells form this second dorsal layer however, the localization of polarity markers and the tissue organization can appear mildly disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D–F</xref>). The PI3K signaling pathway is known to promote cell proliferation and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fruman et al., 2017</xref>) however, we did not find a difference in the number of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4G–I</xref>) nor in the number of cardiomyocytes in S-phase as measured by EdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4J–L</xref>) in PI3K-inhibited embryos at 20s compared to DMSO-treated embryos. Similarly, no apoptotic cardiomyocytes were observed in DMSO- nor in 20 μM LY-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4M–P</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 17, 19 embryos, respectively, from three biological replicates), despite apoptosis being observed in DNAse-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4O, P</xref>).</p><p>We further investigated whether increasing PI3K signaling affects cardiac fusion, by examining <italic>ptena, ptenb</italic> mutants. Pten, a lipid phosphatase, opposes PI3K function by converting PIP3 to PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fruman et al., 2017</xref>).

Indeed, cardiac fusion defects have been observed in <italic>pten</italic> mutant mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>) and we found that inhibiting Pten in zebrafish embryos from bud stage to 22s with the small molecule Pten inhibitor VO-OHpic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rosivatz et al., 2006</xref>) does result in cardiac fusion defects, along with increased PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Furthermore, adding a sub-phenotypic dose of VO-OHpic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D–F</xref>) to double homozygous <italic>ptena<sup>−/−</sup>, ptenb<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant embryos to address the role of the remaining maternal contribution also results in cardiac fusion defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5G–J</xref>, Fisher’s test p-value 8.21E−06). These findings reveal that loss-of-Pten which causes increased PIP3 levels results in cardiac fusion defects and together with our PI3K inhibition experiments indicate that appropriate levels of PI3K signaling are required for proper cardiac fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The extent and duration of PI3K inhibition determine the penetrance and severity of cardiac fusion defects</title><p>PI3K-inhibited embryos display cardiac phenotypes at 22s that range from severe, in which the myocardial populations remain entirely separate (cardia bifida) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> – red; examples – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, F, I, L</xref>), to more mildly affected hearts in which the myocardial populations form a U-shaped structure, having merged at the posterior but not anterior end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> – orange; examples <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, E, H, K</xref>). A subset of the PI3K-inhibited embryos also appear phenotypically normal (~25% for 20 μM LY, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>) indicating incomplete penetrance. However, increasing the concentration of PI3K inhibitor or dnPI3K mRNA increases the severity and penetrance of these phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, we confirmed that LY inhibits PI3K activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, the severity and penetrance of cardiac fusion defects depend on the efficacy of PI3K inhibition.</p><p>Since differing modes of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holtzman et al., 2007</xref>) and cellular processes such as MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Trinh and Stainier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>) and subduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye et al., 2015</xref>) occur at distinct developmental stages during cardiac fusion, we evaluated the developmental stages over which PI3K signaling is required. Short exposures (&lt;3 hr) just prior to 22s or starting at bud stage had no effect on cardiac fusion. However, progressively longer times of exposure ending at 22s or starting at bud stage result in correspondingly more severe phenotypes and higher penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). These addition and wash-out experiments indicate that both the severity and penetrance of cardiac fusion phenotypes correlate with the duration of LY incubation and not a specific developmental stage inside the 3–20s window.

Together these results suggest that PDGF signaling activates PI3K activity to promote myocardial movement toward the midline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our studies reveal an intrinsic PI3K-dependent mechanism by which the myocardium moves toward the midline during the formation of the primitive heart tube. Together with our previous studies revealing a role for the PDGF pathway in facilitating communication between the endoderm and myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloomekatz et al., 2017</xref>), our current work suggests a model in which Pdgfra in the myocardium senses signals (PDGF ligands) from the endoderm and via the PI3K pathway directs myocardial movement toward the midline through the production of medially oriented membrane protrusions. While genetic and imaging studies in zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Trinh and Stainier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kupperman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Molkentin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ye and Lin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garavito-Aguilar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arrington and Yost, 2009</xref>) along with embryological studies in chicks and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goss, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rosenquist, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Varner and Taber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moreno-Rodriguez et al., 2006</xref>) have identified the importance of extrinsic influences – such as the endoderm and extracellular matrix, on myocardial movement to the midline, our studies using tissue-specific techniques identifies an active role for myocardial cells, providing insight into the balance of intrinsic and extrinsic influences that regulate the collective movement of the myocardial tissue during heart tube formation.</p><p>Specifically, we found a requirement for PI3K signaling in cardiac fusion. By examining both loss-of-PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and gain-of-PI3K activity through loss-of-<italic>pten</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>) our studies indicate that appropriate PIP3 levels are required for the proper movement of cardiomyocytes to the midline. This analysis is complemented by previous studies in mice examining <italic>Pten</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>). Our spatial and temporal experiments further reveal a requirement for PI3K activity specifically in the myocardium and throughout the duration of cardiac fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, the lack of phenotype caused by inhibition of mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggests that mTOR and its downstream signals are unlikely to be important PI3K effectors in regulating cardiomyocyte movement.</p><p>When we examined the cellular behaviors affected by loss of PI3K signaling we observed a mild disorganization of myocardial intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–F</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous studies linking epithelial polarity to PI3K signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krahn, 2020</xref>). However, myocardial cells defective in apical–basal polarity still form a cardiac ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Horne-Badovinac et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rohr et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that an apical–basal defect is unlikely to be the primary reason for myocardial movement defects. Instead, our studies showing that PI3K-inhibited myocardial cells move slower and are misdirected during the early stages of cardiac fusion indicate a role for PI3K signaling in the steering of myocardial movements medially toward the midline. Specifically, we found that DMSO-treated myocardial cells in our study display an average direction of 31.1 ± 1.65° compared to PI3K-inhibited embryos which display an average of 60.6 ± 1.73°. Our wild-type tracks results are grossly similar to previous published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holtzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloomekatz et al., 2017</xref>). Differences in the extent of the medial orientation between these studies are likely due to experimental variations in normalization used to account for drift as well as small differences in the developmental stages over which cells were tracked. Our finding that steering in PI3K-inhibited embryos is perturbed in the early stages of cardiac fusion is consistent with the previous identification of different types of myocardial movement during different stages of cardiac fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holtzman et al., 2007</xref>) and suggests that PI3K signaling could be part of a distinct molecular mechanism that drives these early medial phases of myocardial movement. Loss-of-function <italic>pdgfra</italic> mutants, like PI3K-inhibited embryos, also display defects in the directional movement of myocardial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloomekatz et al., 2017</xref>), although the phenotype in <italic>pdgfra</italic> mutants can be more severe. These differences in severity could be a result of differences in the extent of loss-of-function and/or differences in the ability of other genes to compensate. Indeed, our interaction studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggest that Pdgfra and PI3K signaling work together to regulate cardiac fusion.</p><p>Myocardial membrane protrusions during cardiac fusion were postulated by De Haan et al. in 1967 as a mechanism by which myocardial cells move toward the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeHaan, 1967</xref>). Using mosaic membrane labeling of myocardial cells to visualize membrane protrusions, we have observed myocardial membrane protrusions that are oriented in the medial direction in a PI3K-dependent manner, confirming De Haan’s hypothesis. These studies are complemented by previous studies in zebrafish which observed myocardial protrusions prior to and after cardiac fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rohr et al., 2008</xref>) as well as recent studies in the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dominguez et al., 2023</xref>) indicating that these cellular processes are likely conserved. Myocardial membrane protrusions have been discovered during trabeculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Staudt et al., 2014</xref>), cardiac regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morikawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharonov et al., 2020</xref>) and during the muscularization of the outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van den Hoff et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, similar observations of PI3K signaling orienting and stimulating protrusion formation in migrating <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and neutrophil cells as well as in the collective movement of endothelial tip cells, the prechordal plate, and the dorsal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iijima and Devreotes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yoo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garlena et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dumortier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Graupera et al., 2008</xref>) support a conserved role for PI3K signaling in regulating protrusion formation.</p><p>However, the question of how active membrane protrusions facilitate the collective medial movement of the myocardium to the midline remains to be addressed. Our studies indicate that directionality and to a lesser extent velocity and efficiency are compromised, when membrane protrusions are improperly oriented in PI3K-inhibited embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These observations could suggest that the observed membrane protrusions are force generating, similar to protrusions from leader cells in the lateral line or in endothelial and tracheal tip cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caussinus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dalle Nogare et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, these protrusions could act more like filopodia sensing extrinsic signals and the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heckman and Plummer, 2013</xref>). Future studies examining myocardial protrusions and their role in the biomechanical dynamics of the myocardium will help to elucidate the role of membrane protrusions in the collective movement of the myocardium during cardiac fusion.</p><p>Our studies utilize small pharmacological molecules to investigate the role of PI3K signaling in cardiac fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These inhibitors have been widely used and have several advantages including the ability to target multiple class I PI3K complexes which are known to compensate for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Juss et al., 2012</xref>), and the ability to avoid earlier pleiotropic effects by temporally restricting their usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leslie et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, small molecule inhibitors can also affect non-targeted proteins resulting in off-target phenotypic artifacts. We have tried to mitigate these limitations by utilizing multiple different PI3K inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), ensuring a dose–response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–I, N, O</xref>), directly testing the role of known off-targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and utilizing a dominant-negative construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J–L, P</xref>). However, these complementary experiments have their own limitations and thus we are unable to completely rule-out the role of a combinatorial inhibitory effect on cardiac fusion. We look forward to the creation of a genetic model that will help verify our findings.</p><p>Overall, our studies delineate a role for the PDGF–PI3K pathway in the mechanisms by which myocardial precursors sense and respond to extracellular signals to move into a position to form the heart. These mechanisms are likely relevant to other organ progenitors including endothelial precursors, endodermal progenitors, and neuromasts; all of which must move from their location of specification to a different location for organ formation. Although varying in their morphogenesis, many of these movements are collective in nature. Indeed, a similar Pdgfra–PI3K signaling cassette is important in the collective directional migration of several organ progenitors including the migration of mesoderm and neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCarthy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Symes and Mercola, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He and Soriano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nagel and Winklbauer, 2018</xref>). RTK–PI3K pathways are also important across several cardiac developmental processes, including epicardial development, cardiac neural crest addition, cardiomyocyte growth, cardiac fibroblast movement, and cardiomyocyte contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crackower et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ivey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McMullen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shioi et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, PDGF–PI3K and more generally RTK–PI3K signaling cassettes are activated in several diseases including glioblastomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lennartsson et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the role of this RTK–PI3K cassette in sensing and responding to extracellular signals is likely to be broadly relevant to the etiology of a wide array of developmental processes as well as congenital diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

3-kinase (PI3K) signaling downstream of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α in latero-medial migration of cardiomyocytes during the formation of the early heart tube during zebrafish development. The authors provide convincing evidence for the role of PI3K in cardiomyocyte migration using multiple PI3K inhibitory drugs, expression of a dominant negative PI3K subunit, and rescue of the Pdgfaa ligand over-expression phenotype using mild PI3K inhibition, approaches which show strong alignment and which are quantified using live imaging. The demonstration of cardiomyocyte protrusions biased in the direction of migration, and randomised after PI3K inhibition, is a promising area for future exploration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85930.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>Richard P</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03trvqr13</institution-id><institution>Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Contreras</surname><given-names>Osvaldo</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03trvqr13</institution-id><institution>Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.03.522612">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.03.522612v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Osvaldo Contreras (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found this to be a valuable contribution as a Research Advance – however, significant weaknesses and discrepancies were identified. The authors therefore should respond to all of the reviewers' comments.

The work is submitted as a Research Advance, which builds on a previous Research Article in <italic>eLife</italic> (Bloomekatz et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017;6:e21172). In the previous paper, Bloomekatz and colleagues reported the isolation and analyses of the ref mutation, showing that it interrupts the function of the Pdgfra gene. They go on to characterise defects in the medial migration of cardiac progenitors in the genetic mutant and also in pdgfra morpholino knockdown experiments. Pdgfra is expressed in the anterior lateral mesoderm during migration and fusion, whereas its ligand Pdgfaa is expressed in the anterior endoderm, known to be important for cardiomyocyte fusion, potentially for physically propelling (via extracellular matrix) the cardiac mesoderm along. Live imaging and quantification showed that the Pdgfra expression in cardiac mesoderm is required for directional movement (steering) of cardiomyocytes to the midline during heart tube formation, presumably via a chemotactic mechanism involving graded signals from endoderm. Effects on velocity and efficiency of movement of cardiomyocytes were not evident.</p><p>In the present manuscript, Bloomekatz and colleagues explore the role of PI3K in latero-medial cardiomyocyte migration in zebrafish, potentially working downstream of Pdgfra. A similar overall approach is taken as in the first paper, albeit that the PI3K is inhibited using the drug LY294002 (confirmed using other classes of inhibitor), or cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic expression of a truncated dominant negative form of PI3K. In terms of prior knowledge, and therefore the novelty of this paper, the PI3K pathway is known to function downstream of Pdgfr signaling and indeed in migration and proliferation of Pdgf-dependent cells and other cell types in the development, including in collective cell migrations. PI3K is also involved in the formation of cell protrusions in some settings, and cardiomyocyte protrusions have been observed in developing mouse hearts. The manuscript is transparent on background studies; however, involvement of PI3K is therefore somewhat expected. Nonetheless, the authors show convincingly that PI3K inhibition affects cardiomyocyte latero-medial migration in a dose-dependent manner. They define a broad window for the involvement of PI3K during the migration process and show that cardiomyocyte-specific expression of dominant negative PI3K causes migration defects in 100% of embryos, demonstrating that this is a cell-autonomous process. Similar to the original study, live imaging with a myl7-eGFP transgene enabled the authors to quantify defects in individual cardiomyocyte trajectories and determine average scores for velocity, efficiency, and direction of movement, which were all compromised after PI3K inhibition. Elements of cell behaviour at different time points along the migration process were considered. As a potential mechanism, they demonstrate cellular protrusions in migrating cardiomyocytes and quantify their number, duration, and direction relative to the axis of migration. An important finding is that these protrusions are oriented towards the direction of migration in control embryos, but this is lost after PI3K inhibition. Finally, an interaction between Pdgfra heterozygosity and PI3K inhibition is demonstrated, suggesting that PI3K does function downstream of Pdgfra signaling.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. Inhibition of PI3K might lead to phenotypes that are weaker (partial inhibition) or stronger (inhibition of PI3K in tissues beyond cardiomyocytes); however, one would expect given the results of the cardiomyocyte-specific dnPI3K transgene, that the phenotypes of Pdgfra ref mutants and PI3K inhibition would closely align. One significant concern, therefore, is that the quantifications of cell trajectories look very different comparing Bloomekatz et al. 2017 to the current study. In the original study, control cardiomyocytes have much broader angles of trajectory compared to the very limited angles in the current study. Similarly, ref mutant cardiomyocytes often migrate in alternate directions along the latero-medial axis and sometimes in a net backward direction, not seen in the current study with PI3K inhibition. Comparing the trajectories in the current paper, it appears that they are mostly latero-medial in orientation anteriorly, whereas those occurring posteriorly have a distinct anterior-medial direction. These could be driven by different processes. Visual inspection of the trajectories in the inhibited embryos seems to show that the posterior type is preserved, whereas the anterior type is diminished. The authors have perhaps lost the opportunity to segment classes of behavior to refine the model of cardiomyocyte chemotactic morphogenesis. The authors do present segmentation of anterior versus posterior behaviors; however, it seems that the posterior ones differ between the control and mutant, not the anterior ones, which might go against the visual inspection of panels in both Figure 3B, D, and Suppl. Figure 5D. At a minimum, the authors should address the differences between the two studies – are these differences a product of methodology or normalisation (e.g. of notochord contraction) or to features of the gene model, if so which? and how does this relate to the model of migration? It would help to better relate trajectory findings to literature models.</p><p>2. It would strengthen the paper to show spatially PI3K activity across the migration period. Phospho-ATK has been used previously to show receptor tyrosine kinase activity in vivo in different settings (as shown in this study by western blotting).</p><p>3. The characterization of cardiomyocyte epithelial morphology is cursory, and I think other markers of epithelial morphology, apical-basal polarity or integrity could be shown, perhaps N-CAM. The authors should be more specific in their description of the processes leading to the second dorsal layer (which is currently vague and seems not visible in the control sample so panels are not comparable).</p><p>4. Are the protrusions at the leading edge of the cardiomyocyte population or throughout? Does this instruct on how migration occurs – as individual cells in a partial mesenchymal state, or as a sheet?</p><p>5. The tools used to explore endodermal integrity (gross expression of axial and Sox17-gfp) seem inadequate. The question as to whether endoderm is compromised is paramount, as endoderm has been proposed to instruct cardiomyocyte migration, likely by the provision of chemotactic ligands (e.g. Pdgf-aa), however, potentially also by physical means. Is its own migration relative to that of cardiomyocytes compromised? Knowing this could advance the model.</p><p>6. Page 6.

The authors should refer to their concentrations used in the results field (Page 6). I also think that the concentrations used are higher than expected (especially for Dactolisib and Pictilisib). Thus, the authors should be extremely cautious about their results and their interpretations since off-target effects could potentially target myocardial fusion. I had a quick look and the IC50 of Pictilisib is in nM range and the authors used 50µM, which is 1000-fold higher.</p><p>2. I suggest the authors extend their evaluation of PI3K downstream targets including GSK3B and mTOR. This aims to better understand the mechanisms associated with PI3K pharmacological inhibition.</p><p>3. The authors mention &quot;Furthermore, the PI3K signaling pathway is known to promote cell proliferation and cell survival (29) however, we did not find a difference in the number of cardiomyocytes in DMSO- or LY- treated embryos at 20s (Suppl. Figure 3G-I). I suggest the authors evaluate not only the total cardiomyocyte number but cardiomyocyte cell cycle and/or proliferation, using techniques such as BrdU/EdU uptake, Ki67 labelling, and phosphorylated Histone H3 in Serine 10. Equal cardiomyocyte numbers do not necessarily point to no defects in the cardiomyocyte cell cycle and proliferation potentially induced by PI3K inhibitors (known to affect the cell cycle in many different cell types and contexts).</p><p>4. The authors refer to cardiomyocyte apoptosis on Page 7 but no figure reference exists. Please, check and add the missing results.</p><p>5. Line 19, page 8. The authors refer to myocardial movement, but they have not directly addressed that point yet. I suggest the authors amend the sentence. The same applies to line 10, page 10.</p><p>6. Line 1, page 10. I would change &quot;indicating&quot; to &quot;suggesting&quot;.</p><p>7. Would the increased PDGFRa activity obtained using mutant zebrafish over-expressing Pdgf-aa rescue PI3K-inhibited embryos? I think this is an important point to be addressed.</p><p>8. Page 16, line 14. The authors refer to &quot;protrusion formation&quot; but if I understand well, they never evaluated that later cellular effect.</p><p>Recommendations related to Figures and related conclusions:</p><p>1. Immunofluorescence against phosphorylated AKT during cardiac fusion (using Tg(myl7:egfp zebrafish)) could strengthen the authors' results.</p><p>2. The authors should evaluate PI3K activity (AKT phosphorylation) in the case of Dactolisib and Pictilisib inhibitors. dnPI3K would also be highly appreciated.</p><p>3. In order to explain the PI3K-mediated defects during cardiac fusion, I would change the order of Figure 4 by Figure 3. Thus, PI3K-induced defects on myocardial membrane protrusions may better explain the resultant medial movement and myocardium speed during cardiac fusion. It reads better from my point of view in that way.</p><p>4. The authors should quantify the number of protrusions per cell and not only the direction. If the number of protrusions is reduced that should open new avenues related to the coordinated migratory mechanisms during cardiac fusion, but if the numbers do not change that may reinforce the authors conclusions.</p><p>5. Figure 5F. The results of 10µM LY inhibitor in Pdgfra +/+ embryos do not match well with Supplementary Figure 1M. Please check and discuss if necessary.</p><p>6. Do the authors observe a genetic interaction between dnPI3K and Pdgfras16 mutants (het or homo)?</p><p>7. Figure 5. Western blots for p-AKT are based on total embryo lysates. Thus, it is expected to find what the authors found related to Pdgfra mutants and hs:pdgfaa. The manuscript would be strengthened if the authors could provide direct evidence of phosphorylated AKT in the myocardial region during cardiac fusion. The authors could use immunofluorescence and confocal imaging.</p><p>8. I am a bit conflicted with Supplementary Figure 5C. What each dot represents? A single cell? I suggest the authors read the latest thread about some important statistical considerations:</p><p>https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202001064</p><p>https://rupress.org/jcb/article/219/6/e202001064/151717/SuperPlots-Communicating-reproducibility-and</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and experiments are well controlled providing sufficient evidence to substantiate most of their conclusions. There are a number of questions that need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1. What is interesting is that the CPCs have some intrinsic migration that is independent of the endoderm. The finding that Pi3K is required for the cardiac fusion process is not too surprising as the authors showed in their previous work that PDGF signaling is driving this process and PI3K is a well-known transducer of PDGF signaling. An important question remaining is what type of cell migration the CPCs undergo to fuse at the midline. Are the CPCs migrating as individual cells that all respond to the PDGF from the midline or do the CPCs migrate collectively and only a few respond to the PDGF signal? The authors seem to prefer the collective migration of CPCs but it seems that this has not been tested experimentally. Testing this directly would significantly increase the impact of this study. With the myl7:dnPI3K construct the authors seem to have a good tool to test this now. This could be addressed by analysing embryos in which the cardiac field contains a mixture of wt CPCs and CPCs expressing the dnPIK3 for example by cell transplantation experiments in which cells from embryos derived from the myl7:dnPI3K F1 fish are transplanted to wt embryos or by DNA injections resulting in mosaic expression. It would be very interesting to see how CPCs expressing the dnPI3K behave when surrounded by wt cells. If collective migration is indeed driving cardiac fusion one would expect that these dnPI3K cells behave like wt cells.</p><p>2. In Figure 3 the authors show that migration of CPCs treated with LY is affected. They plotted the CPC velocities in 3E and here it looks as if fast-migrating CPCs are less affected compared to slower-migrating CPCs. Fast migration is mostly seen in the posterior part of the bilateral heart fields, so the question arises whether CPCs along the anterior-posterior axis is affected differently by the LY treatment.</p><p>3. In fig3E the authors show the total velocity of the CPCs in all directions. As they conclude at the end that PDGF-PI3K signaling mostly affects the medial cell migration, it would be important to analyse the velocities of the CPCs only in the medial-lateral direction.</p><p>4. In Figure 3G the authors show the angles at which the CPCs migrate based on the time lapses. In Figure 3B the tracks show that some cells (mostly located anteriorly) move in a medial-posterior direction while other cells (mostly located in the posterior part) move in an anterior-medial direction. The rose plot however displays only positive angles (medial-anterior direction) and no angles in the medial-posterior direction. Please explain why this was done. In addition, the angles shown here for wt embryos (average 30 degrees) seem very different from the angles reported for wt embryos in their previous work (Fig6L, average around 60 degrees), which look more like the angles reported here for the LY treated embryos (average around 60 degrees). Please explain this.</p><p>5. In Figure 4 the authors analyse the direction and persistence of cellular protrusion in CPCs. Especially the direction of these protrusions seems affected by LY suggesting that PDGF from the midline may be responsible for this phenomenon. It would therefore be very interesting to test this in their hs:pdgf line by analysing protrusion direction when pdgf is produced by all cells. If PDGF from the midline is responsible for their direction, overexpressing pdgf in all cells should give a similar effect as inhibiting PI3K.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85930.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found this to be a valuable contribution as a Research Advance – however, significant weaknesses and discrepancies were identified.

We agree that this is an important issue. We’ve addressed the issue of tissue-specificity of PI3K activity in a couple different ways. For example, by expressing a dominant negative construct specifically in the myocardium using the <italic>myl7</italic> promoter (Figure 2C-H), we showed that PI3K signaling is specifically required within myocardial cells to regulate cardiac fusion.</p><p>We have further addressed this question in our revisions by employing a pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain PIP3 reporter, <italic>Tg(myl7:PH-mkate2)</italic>. PH domains from several proteins including from BTK have been shown to translocate to the membrane in response to PI3K-induced PIP3 production (Hall, TE et al. 2020, PMID: 32709891; Yoo, SK et al. 2010, PMID: 20159593). In DMSO-treated embryos, we observed PH-mkate2 localize to the plasma membrane of myocardial cells, indicating PI3K activity. Conversely, we found that the PH-mkate2 in the cytoplasm or in sub-cellular compartments in PI3K-inhibited embryos. A detailed analysis of these new results is contained within Figure 2 —figure supplement 2 as well as to changes in the text (pages 11-12, lines 19-22, 1-6, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Address the discrepancies between single cardiomyocyte trajectory data in the original and current work, and repeat more rigorously if necessary.

In our study, myocardial cell trajectories in DMSO-treated embryos are initially dominated by medial-lateral directionality and then by more angular movement (anterior-posterior directionality) (Figure 3A-B). These observations are overall consistent with findings from both the original work (Bloomekatz et al. 2017) and from other previously published studies (Holtzman et al. 2007). As suggested by the reviewers, we have increased our analysis of myocardial movements in this manuscript separating them by developmental stage (early, posterior, anterior) and by anterior, medial and posterior zones (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2C-F). These analyses reaffirm our qualitative observations of increasing angular movements during later developmental stages and of relative increases in angular velocity in anterior and posterior cells.</p><p>In this study a greater percentage of tracks are medially directed (Figure 3G) when compared to Bloomekatz et al. 2017 – Figure 6L. These minor differences are likely a result of technical differences in experimentation, including normalization using the notochord and differences in the developmental stages captured by the timelapse data. Variation between could also contribute these differences. We have incorporated these considerations into our revised discussion (page 18, lines 16-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Strengthen experimentally the observations around cardiomyocyte protrusions, including experiments that would extend the model by distinguishing between individual cell versus collective cell migration.

In our studies we identified myocardial protrusions during cardiac fusion which are oriented in the medial-lateral direction in DMSO-treated embryos but are mis-oriented in PI3K-inhibited embryos. In our revisions we have strengthened our observations of these myocardial protrusions, as suggested by the reviewer. Through these enhanced observations we identified different protrusion types: thin protrusions similar to filopodia and wide protrusions similar to pseudopodia. And we analyzed how the ratio and orientation of these different protrusions changes in LY-treated (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We do agree with the reviewers regarding the value of further experiments regarding the overall role for protrusions in cardiomyocyte movement and their role in the collective movement of the myocardium. However, these experiments are distinct from our current study focusing on PI3K signaling and its connection to Pdgfra. We thus plan to include them in a more comprehensive study of the role of cardiomyocyte protrusions in cardiac fusion in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be a strong addition to the study if the authors could show rescue of PI3K inhibition (with drugs and/or dominant negative transgene) with the Pdgf-aa transgene used in the previous study and in the current study to support PI3K/pAKT being downstream of PDGFRA.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to valuable reviewer feedback regarding strengthening our finding of an interaction between Pdgfra and PI3K signaling during cardiac fusion, we investigated if the cardiac fusion defects found in embryos overexpressing <italic>pdgfaa</italic> could be rescued by using a sub-phenotypic dose of LY.

As we outlined in our response to essential revisions #2, we have increased our analysis of cardiomyocyte trajectories in wild-type/DMSO-treated embryos (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2C-F). Overall, our data is consistent both with our previous work and with the work of others (Holtzman et al. 2007, PMID: 17537802). The main difference between these studies resides in the rose plots of wild-type myocardial trajectories in Bloomekatz et al. 2017 and the DMSO-trajectories in this manuscript. This difference is likely due to experimental variation in the developmental stages over which the timelapse data were collected, differences in normalization to the notochord, and/or differences reflective of variance between embryos. We now include a discussion of these differences in manuscript (page 18, lines 16-20).</p><p>In regards to comparisons of cell trajectory between ref/pdgfra mutant and PI3K mutants; there are strong similarities between these trajectories including defects in medial-lateral directionality, speed and movement defects being visible at the start of the timelapse movies. However, as the reviewer notes there are also differences between these trajectories, with the <italic>ref/pdgfra</italic> mutant myocardial cells in a few embryos displaying lateral movement that is not present in PI3K-inhibited embryos. These differences could be due to extent of <italic>pdgfra</italic> inhibition compared to PI3K inhibition. Furthermore, other intracellular signaling pathways parallel to PI3K signaling and downstream of Pdgfra, such as MAPK and PLCg could play minor compensatory roles in steering myocardial movement, thus explaining the less severe result in PI3Kinhibited embryos.

In our revisions we have now included experiments involving a PI3K activity PH-domain reporter (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2) in which we confirm PI3K activity in the myocardium during the later stages of cardiac fusion.

I think the statistics for the cell behavioural studies should be shown on the graphs in a more conventional way.</p></disp-quote><p>We had previously represented variation in our graphs by showing all individual cells, and displaying a box-whisker plot, which shows the median, the location of the quartiles and the min and max. As suggested by the reviewers we have now switched the graphs in the cell behavioral studies to superplots (Lord, S. et al. 2020 PMID: 32346721) in which all cells are shown along with the averages from individual embryos, and the mean and standard error are shown along with data from the appropriate statistical test, see Figures 3E-H, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2C-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. It would be helpful to cite other examples where cardiomyocyte protrusions have been described; for example, dedifferentiated neonatal cardiomyocytes in vitro (Eldad Tzahor lab), regenerating scar after myocardial infarction (James Martin lab) and myocardialization of outflow track cushions (Antoon Moorman lab).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for alerting us to this oversight, these citations as well as those for myocardial protrusions occurring during cardiac trabeculation are now included in the manuscript (page 19, lines 17-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. The authors should refer to their concentrations used in the results field (Page 6). I also think that the concentrations used are higher than expected (especially for Dactolisib and Pictilisib). Thus, the authors should be extremely cautious about their results and their interpretations since off-target effects could potentially target myocardial fusion. I had a quick look and the IC50 of Pictilisib is in nM range and the authors used 50µM, which is 1000-fold higher.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewers concern regarding using high concentrations of inhibitor. However, the reported nanomolar IC50 values are determined using cell-free assays, and may not account for issues of stability, metabolism, penetrance, among others that are encountered in live animal studies. Indeed, our concentrations fall within the range of concentrations used in other live animal studies (Montero, JA et al. 2003, PMID: 12906787; Sasore, T. et al. 2014, PMID: 25144531; Junttila, T. et al. 2009, PMID: 19411071).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I suggest the authors extend their evaluation of PI3K downstream targets including GSK3B and mTOR. This aims to better understand the mechanisms associated with PI3K pharmacological inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for this valuable feedback. In response, we investigated if mTOR is required for cardiac fusion by exposing embryos to increasing concentrations of Rapamycin. We did not observe any cardiac fusion defects in embryos when mTOR was inhibited, even at very high concentrations, as shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mention &quot;Furthermore, the PI3K signaling pathway is known to promote cell proliferation and cell survival (29) however, we did not find a difference in the number of cardiomyocytes in DMSO- or LY- treated embryos at 20s (Suppl. Figure 3G-I). I suggest the authors evaluate not only the total cardiomyocyte number but cardiomyocyte cell cycle and/or proliferation, using techniques such as BrdU/EdU uptake, Ki67 labelling, and phosphorylated Histone H3 in Serine 10. Equal cardiomyocyte numbers do not necessarily point to no defects in the cardiomyocyte cell cycle and proliferation potentially induced by PI3K inhibitors (known to affect the cell cycle in many different cell types and contexts).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate Reviewer 2’s suggestions and we have now included an experiment investigating the number of cardiomyocytes in S phase by analyzing EdU uptake. We did not find a statistical difference between in DMSO and PI3K inhibited embryos. These findings are reported in Figure 1 —figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors refer to cardiomyocyte apoptosis on Page 7 but no figure reference exists. Please, check and add the missing results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added images (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4M-P) and quantitative data (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4 source data), showing no TUNEL+ cardiomyocytes in DMSO- nor in LY-treated embryos, even though TUNEL+ cells are evident when embryos are treated with DNAase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 19, page 8. The authors refer to myocardial movement, but they have not directly addressed that point yet. I suggest the authors amend the sentence. The same applies to line 10, page 10.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed movement to translocation (page 10, line 12; page 12, line 17) as requested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 1, page 10. I would change &quot;indicating&quot; to &quot;suggesting&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the suggested change (page 12, line 7), thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Would the increased PDGFRa activity obtained using mutant zebrafish over-expressing Pdgf-aa rescue PI3K-inhibited embryos? I think this is an important point to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for their suggestion. During our revisions, we performed this experiment and found that a sub-phenotypic reduction in PI3K activity could rescue the cardiac fusion defects caused by overexpressing Pdgf-aa. This result is reported in Figure 5G – J and in the manuscript (page 16, lines 3-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Page 16, line 14. The authors refer to &quot;protrusion formation&quot; but if I understand well, they never evaluated that later cellular effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this oversight. We have now modified the text (page 17, line 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations related to Figures and related conclusions:</p><p>1. Immunofluorescence against phosphorylated AKT during cardiac fusion (using Tg(myl7:egfp zebrafish)) could strengthen the authors' results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. However, despite our diligent efforts we have been unable to reliably achieve a successful immunofluorescence staining in zebrafish for phosphorylated Akt (pAkt). As an alternative approach, we employed a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain reporter – PH-mkate2, to assess PI3K activation during cardiac fusion. PH-domains that bind to PIP3 are localized to the membrane when PIP3 is present. Our observations revealed PH-mkate2 at the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes in DMSO-treated embryos, but not in LY-treated embryos. This information is now included in our revised manuscript (see Figure 2 —figure supplement 2 and pages 11-12, lines 19-22, lines 1-6, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should evaluate PI3K activity (AKT phosphorylation) in the case of Dactolisib and Pictilisib inhibitors. dnPI3K would also be highly appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and apologize for this oversight. We have now evaluated pAKT in comparison to Akt levels in embryos treated with Dactolisib, Pictilisib and dnPI3K. We observed a dose-dependent decrease in PI3K activity as reported by pAKT-to-AKT levels. This data is now included in our revised manuscript (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1Q-S, and on page 7, lines 1-5, 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In order to explain the PI3K-mediated defects during cardiac fusion, I would change the order of Figure 4 by Figure 3. Thus, PI3K-induced defects on myocardial membrane protrusions may better explain the resultant medial movement and myocardium speed during cardiac fusion. It reads better from my point of view in that way.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion – having revised the manuscript in this order; the logical flow felt off and so we have changed it back. We hope our other revisions have increased the logical flow for the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should quantify the number of protrusions per cell and not only the direction. If the number of protrusions is reduced that should open new avenues related to the coordinated migratory mechanisms during cardiac fusion, but if the numbers do not change that may reinforce the authors conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. In response to this query, we quantified the frequency of protrusions per cell per hour and found that cardiomyocytes in DMSOtreated embryos display an average of 20.3 -/+ 6.7 protrusions per hour, while cardiomyocytes in LY-treated embryos display an average of 17.00 -/+ 7.4 protrusions per hour (p-value: 0.3562, Two-tailed t-test), indicating no significant difference between the frequency of protrusions. (This data is now included in our manuscript, page 14 lines 11-16 and in Figure 4-source data.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 5F. The results of 10µM LY inhibitor in Pdgfra +/+ embryos do not match well with Supplementary Figure 1M. Please check and discuss if necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful reading of our manuscript. In Figure 5F and Figure 1 —figure supplement 1M, separate experiments were conducted involving 10 µM inhibitor treatments. Although, there are slight differences in percent of embryos displaying cardiac phenotypes (None in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1M, compared to an average of 10.9% in Figure 5C), these differences are not statistically significant (pvalue: 0.2784, Two-tailed t-test). The minor variation from these distinct experiments could have arisen from the different genetic backgrounds of the fish used in this experiment or from differences in the batches of inhibitor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Do the authors observe a genetic interaction between dnPI3K and Pdgfras16 mutants (het or homo)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion, unfortunately this is currently a technically difficult experiment for us to perform. We have however found that we can rescue the cardiac fusion phenotype caused by increased Pdgfra signaling by a sub-phenotypic dose of PI3K inhibitor (Figure 5G-J), further supporting our finding that Pdgfra and PI3K signaling interact to regulate the process of cardiac fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 5. Western blots for p-AKT are based on total embryo lysates. Thus, it is expected to find what the authors found related to Pdgfra mutants and hs:pdgfaa. The manuscript would be strengthened if the authors could provide direct evidence of phosphorylated AKT in the myocardial region during cardiac fusion. The authors could use immunofluorescence and confocal imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. As we have indicated in our response to</p><p>recommendations related to Figures and related conclusions: Query 1, we have</p><p>now added results of PH-domain reporter of PI3K activity, which complements our other tissue-specific studies indicating PI3K activity in the myocardium during cardiac fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. I am a bit conflicted with Supplementary Figure 5C. What each dot represents? A single cell? I suggest the authors read the latest thread about some important statistical considerations:</p><p>https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202001064</p><p>https://rupress.org/jcb/article/219/6/e202001064/151717/SuperPlots-Communicating-reproducibility-and</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have changed our graphs analyzing cardiomyocyte behavior to super plots – which show variation between individual cells as well as variation between embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and experiments are well controlled providing sufficient evidence to substantiate most of their conclusions. There are a number of questions that need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1. What is interesting is that the CPCs have some intrinsic migration that is independent of the endoderm. The finding that Pi3K is required for the cardiac fusion process is not too surprising as the authors showed in their previous work that PDGF signaling is driving this process and PI3K is a well-known transducer of PDGF signaling. An important question remaining is what type of cell migration the CPCs undergo to fuse at the midline. Are the CPCs migrating as individual cells that all respond to the PDGF from the midline or do the CPCs migrate collectively and only a few respond to the PDGF signal? The authors seem to prefer the collective migration of CPCs but it seems that this has not been tested experimentally. Testing this directly would significantly increase the impact of this study. With the myl7:dnPI3K construct the authors seem to have a good tool to test this now. This could be addressed by analysing embryos in which the cardiac field contains a mixture of wt CPCs and CPCs expressing the dnPIK3 for example by cell transplantation experiments in which cells from embryos derived from the myl7:dnPI3K F1 fish are transplanted to wt embryos or by DNA injections resulting in mosaic expression. It would be very interesting to see how CPCs expressing the dnPI3K behave when surrounded by wt cells. If collective migration is indeed driving cardiac fusion one would expect that these dnPI3K cells behave like wt cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. Cardiomyocytes are interconnected to one another via intercellular junctions starting at around 12s (Ye D, et al. 2015, PMID: 26329600), which would support a collective mode of migration. However, the reviewer is correct that this is still an open question, which we hope to address in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 3 the authors show that migration of CPCs treated with LY is affected. They plotted the CPC velocities in 3E and here it looks as if fast-migrating CPCs are less affected compared to slower-migrating CPCs. Fast migration is mostly seen in the posterior part of the bilateral heart fields, so the question arises whether CPCs along the anterior-posterior axis is affected differently by the LY treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we analyzed cardiomyocyte velocity after dividing the bilateral cardiac populations into thirds: Top (anterior), Middle, and bottom (posterior). However, we did not find a significant difference in the cardiomyocyte velocity between DMSO and PI3K-inhibited embryos. This new information is contained (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2F) and on page 13, lines 8-9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In fig3E the authors show the total velocity of the CPCs in all directions. As they conclude at the end that PDGF-PI3K signaling mostly affects the medial cell migration, it would be important to analyse the velocities of the CPCs only in the medial-lateral direction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed cardiomyocyte velocity in the medial-lateral direction, where we found a significant difference between DMSO (0.3548 -/+ 0.027 microns/min) and PI3Kinhibited embryos (0.1716 -/+ 0.018 microns/min) (Two-tailed T-test: 0.0008). This information is now found in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2E and on page 13, lines 5-9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3G the authors show the angles at which the CPCs migrate based on the time lapses. In Figure 3B the tracks show that some cells (mostly located anteriorly) move in a medial-posterior direction while other cells (mostly located in the posterior part) move in an anterior-medial direction. The rose plot however displays only positive angles (medial-anterior direction) and no angles in the medial-posterior direction. Please explain why this was done.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal when calculating the angle of movement was to determine whether cells were directed along the medial-lateral or were directed angularly (along the anterior-posterior axis, as determined by Holtzman et al. 2007). In this analysis we do not distinguish movement in the anterior direction from movement in the posterior direction, which would be problematic for calculating an average. This is in line with how we calculated directionality in the original <italic>eLife</italic> paper 2017. Unfortunately, this was not clear in our first version, and we thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have modified the methods to clearly indicate how directionality is calculated (page 31, line 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the angles shown here for wt embryos (average 30 degrees) seem very different from the angles reported for wt embryos in their previous work (Fig6L, average around 60 degrees), which look more like the angles reported here for the LY treated embryos (average around 60 degrees). Please explain this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful consideration of our data. As we indicate in our response to Essential revisions #2 – Overall, our data is consistent with both our previous work and with the work of others (Holtzman et al. 2007). The difference between the two studies may be a result of normalization differences or in slight variations in the developmental stages captured. We now include a discussion of these differences in manuscript (page 18, lines 16-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 4 the authors analyse the direction and persistence of cellular protrusion in CPCs. Especially the direction of these protrusions seems affected by LY suggesting that PDGF from the midline may be responsible for this phenomenon. It would therefore be very interesting to test this in their hs:pdgf line by analysing protrusion direction when pdgf is produced by all cells. If PDGF from the midline is responsible for their direction, overexpressing pdgf in all cells should give a similar effect as inhibiting PI3K.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a valuable experiment. Our current manuscript revolves around the role of PI3K signaling in cardiac fusion. As we turn our attention directly to the role of protrusions in cardiac fusion, we think this will be an important experiment to complete.</p></body></sub-article></article>
