with the treatment of central nervous system disorders owing to the complexity of its structure and restrictive function. Thus, it is challenging to develop central nervous system drug delivery strategies. Specific mode electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation can effectively open the BBB in rats. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively map the cell population in the Sprague-Dawley rat cerebral cortex. We identified 23 cell subsets and eight types of cells in the brain by cell annotation. scRNA-seq revealed transcriptional changes in the cerebral cortex under EA. Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular and cellular modifications in the brain resulting from EA intervention and serve as a resource for drug delivery across healthy and diseased states. Innovative approaches to enhance BBB opening will lead to more effective therapeutic plans and enhanced drug delivery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>central nervous system</kwd><kwd>drug delivery</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics analysis</kwd><kwd>transcriptional change</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82174502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xianming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82474626</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xianming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04aqat463</institution-id><institution>Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LQN25H270008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Congcong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Special Project of Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022ZX009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xianming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scientific Research Project of the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022FSYYZZ10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xianming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scientific Research Project of the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023FSYYZQ11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Congcong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell transcriptome sequencing results of rats intervened with specific mode electroacupuncture (an emerging method for opening the blood-brain barrier).</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is crucial for drug delivery to the brain, mainly comprises specialized brain endothelial cells with tight junctions, a basement membrane, neurons, pericytes, and astrocytes. Its chemical composition and physical properties create an adaptable interface. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can systematically identify cell types and post-intervention molecular changes by analyzing the gene expression profiles of individual cells. This enables researchers to infer cell-type-specific interactions and predict the molecular basis and functional significance of these ligand-receptor interactions.</p><p>Our previous studies have shown that specific mode electroacupuncture (EA) at head stimulation points (Baihui and Shuigou acupoints), using parameters of ‘2/100 Hz, 3 mA, 6 s-6 s, 40 min,’ can produce a significant and effective BBB opening effect, promoting the entry of Evans blue and FITC-Dextran of different molecular weights into the brain, with the permeability effect being more prominent in the frontal lobe region. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai et al., 2025</xref>). In addition, we found that EA-induced BBB opening exhibits stimulus dependency and a time window effect. However, the mechanisms underlying EA-induced BBB opening remain largely unknown. Therefore, based on the clear effects established in our previous research, this study investigates transcriptomic changes in the Sprague-Dawley rat frontal cortex following EA intervention, in order to preliminarily characterize possible underlying mechanisms.</p><p>We addressed this challenge by presenting a comprehensive single-cell molecular map of the rat frontal cortex, which covers approximately 98,338 cells from 10 samples, including freshly excised cortical brain tissue after EA intervention and responsive tissue from the control group. We characterized 23 clusters in the rat frontal cortex, including eight annotated cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animal model</title><p>Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Specific Pathogen Free), 8–10 weeks old and weighing 180–220 g, were obtained from Shanghai Sipul-Bike Experimental Animal Company. All rats were housed in the Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Laboratory Animal Research Center under a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water given ad libitum. Rats were group-housed and were randomly assigned to experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Grouping and interventions</title><p>Rats were randomly assigned to the EA and CON groups (n=5 per group). The EA group received EA; the CON group received the same non-stimulated binding treatment. Sterile disposable needles from Beijing Zhongyan Taihe Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) were used for EA. The GV20 (Baihui) and GV26 (Shuigou) acupuncture points were selected, with needle dimensions of 25 mm × 0.13 mm for GV20 and 16 mm × 0.07 mm for GV26. A custom relay, connected to an acupuncture point stimulator (HANS-200A, Nanjing Jisheng Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China), activated the needles in a 6 s on/off cycle. The current was set at 3 mA at a frequency of 2/100 Hz, and the stimulation lasted for 40 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Cerebral cortex issue preparation</title><p>At the conclusion of the experiments, rats were anesthetized using intraperitoneally administered pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Subsequently, normal saline solution was circulated through the left side of the heart. The brain was removed via decapitation, and the frontal cortex tissue was immediately separated and placed in an ice-cold sterile RNase-free culture dish with an appropriate amount of calcium-free and magnesium-free 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The tissue was then sliced into 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces and washed with 1×PBS. Non-target tissues, such as the blood cells and brain white matter, were carefully removed.</p><p>Single cells were isolated using a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chi et al., 2024</xref>). Standard cDNA amplification and library construction were performed. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system (paired-end, 150 bp) by LC-BioTechnology Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China) with a minimum depth of 20,000 reads per cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Sequencing results were demultiplexed and converted to the FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq (version 2.20). The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger">Cell Ranger</ext-link> pipeline (version 6.1.1) handles sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3' gene counting. From five EA and five CON samples, 98,338 single cells were captured using the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' solution. The output was analyzed using Seurat (version 3.1.1) for dimensional reduction, clustering, and scRNA-seq data analysis. Quality control filtered cells with fewer than 500 expressed genes, UMI counts below 500, and &gt;25% mitochondrial DNA-derived gene expression; as a result, 80,713 cells were included in the analysis.</p><p>To enhance data visualization, we used Seurat for the dimensionality reduction of all cells, followed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for two-dimensional projection. The process included (1) applying the LogNormalize method from Seurat’s ‘Normalization’ function to determine the gene expression values; (2) conducting principal component analysis (PCA) of normalized expression values, selecting the top 10 principal components (PCs) for clustering and t-SNE analysis; (3) using the weighted shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph-based clustering method to identify clusters; and (4) selecting marker genes for each cluster using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (default parameters ‘bimod’ and the likelihood ratio test) via Seurat’s FindAllMarkers function. Marker genes were chosen based on their expression in more than 10% of cells within a cluster, with an average log value (fold change) greater than 0.25 (default parameter: 0.26).</p><p>Bioinformatics analysis was performed using the OmicStudio tools, which are accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool">https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Doublet removal</title><p>Occasionally, two or more cells are encapsulated in the same gem during single-cell sequencing, resulting in abnormal barcodes that could affect the analysis (called doublets or multilets). Therefore, we used Doublet Finder software to identify and remove double and multiple cells to ensure the quality of the results, with the 7.5% doublet formation rate guideline recommended by 10X Genomics for single-cell analysis, aiming to identify the most likely doublets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Classification of single-cell clusters</title><p>The single-cell subset classification analysis involved several steps. First, low-quality cells were removed, and expression values were normalized using the Log Normalize method in Seurat’s ‘Normalization’ function. Next, PCA was performed on the normalized expression values to reduce the dimensionality and variables. The top 10 PCs were selected for clustering and subpopulation analyses. Finally, the Seurat software used a graph-theory-based clustering algorithm to divide the cells. This process included constructing a k-nearest neighbor clustering graph based on the Euclidean distance from significant PCs, optimizing intercellular distance weights using the Jaccard similarity and identifying cell clusters using an SNN module-optimized clustering algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Analysis of marker genes</title><p>Seurat used a bimodal likelihood ratio statistical test to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various cell populations to identify genes that were upregulated in different clusters. The screening criteria for upregulated genes were as follows: (1) genes expressed in more than 10% of cells in the target or control subpopulations; (2) p-value≤0.01; and (3) gene expression fold change (logFC) ≥0.26, meaning that the fold increase in gene expression was ≥2<sup>0.26</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cell-type annotation</title><p>Cell annotation results were defined using SingleR by employing a reference dataset derived from Mouse RNAseq Data. The correlation between the gene expression profiles of each cell and the dataset was calculated by assigning each cell a corresponding identification category. We also tallied the cell types identified within each cluster and their respective percentages, selecting the cell type with the highest correspondence for each cluster as the cell-type identification result.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p>For differential analysis, the bimod algorithm was chosen, and the following parameters for screening DEGs were used: (1) p&lt;0.01, (2) logFC ≥0.26, and (3) the threshold for gene expression in at least one type of cell was 0.1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Functional enrichment analysis</title><p>For the Ḍ significance enrichment analysis, we initially mapped all DEGs that were differentially expressed by various terms. We then calculated the number of genes belonging to each term and used hypergeometric tests to identify Gene Ontology entries significantly enriched in DEGs compared to the entire genome background. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis followed the same strategy. Enrichment scatter plots and bar charts were generated using OmicStudio tools at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool">https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Cell-cell communication analysis</title><p>CellPhoneDB was used to analyze cellular communication by predicting ligand-receptor interactions based on receptor expression in one cell type and ligand expression in another. For each gene, we calculated the percentage of cells expressing and the average expression of the genes. Ligand-receptor pairs were included only if the proportion of cells expressing both genes exceeded 10%. For the polymers, the subunit with the lowest average expression represented the receptor in the statistical analysis. We compared all cell types in pairs within the filtered dataset by randomly arranging the cells into a new population with a default of 1000 arrangements. We determined the mean expression of ligands in a randomly arranged cell population and the average expression of receptors in interacting cell types and then calculated their mean. This process was repeated several times to obtain a normal mean distribution. Next, we calculated the actual average number of ligand-receptor pairs in the original cell population. The significance of the receptor-ligand pair was determined by the proportion of the calculated average values equal to or exceeding the actual average. We then sorted the interactions between cell types based on the number of significant ligand-receptor pairs for manual screening of biologically relevant interactions. As CellPhoneDB only recognizes human genes or proteins, we used the Ensemble tool to convert genes into their homologous counterparts before conducting further analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>ScRNA-seq and clustering analysis</title><p>We used 10X Genomics technology to analyze the mRNA levels of individual cells isolated from the frontal cortex of rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

In the GO enrichment of MG_Cluster2, nine important genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15g and l</xref>). In the unique GO of MG_Cluster3, we focused on the regulation of T cell and B cell migration. KEGG analysis yielded three pathways, including inositol phosphate metabolism, the C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15e and l</xref>). Finally, the MG_Cluster5 downregulated genes enriched GO terms and pathways were mainly related to immune function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15f and l</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Coordination of cell communication in the BBB following EA intervention</title><p>Because the BBB is orchestrated by the coordinated actions and interactions of several different cell types, cell communication analysis is necessary. First, we compared cell communication between the EA and CON groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16a–f</xref>) and further investigated the communication network between the two groups of cells and other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16g and h</xref>). The number of protein interactions between the different cell types (p&lt;0.05) was calculated to generate a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16a and d</xref>), and the heat map values were log (natural logarithm) log-transformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16e and f</xref>). Since endothelial cells are the most direct cell type constituting the physical characteristics of the BBB, we focused on the degree of communication between various types of cells and endothelial cells. Upon comparing the EA and CON groups, we found that BAMs, microglia (MG), T cells, granulocytes, and endothelial cells demonstrated obvious differences in their interactions with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16a and d</xref>). The results suggested that the cells with the most active relationship with endothelial cells were astrocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, whereas the largest changes between the two groups were granulocytes (GC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16b, e, g and h</xref>).</p><fig id="fig16" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><title>The interactions between cells, related to the section ‘Coordination of cell communication in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following EA intervention’.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) Heatmap of the density of ligand-receptor pairs in the EA and CON groups.

Among the top 20 ligand-receptor pairs in the mean value, there were four pairs of interactions with endothelial cells that were different between the groups, namely CD74_APP, PLXNB2_PTN, LAMP1_FAM3C, and CD74_COPA. TNFRSF21_APP was present only in the CON group, whereas CSF1R_CSF1 was specifically present in the EA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17a</xref>). In the CON group, the ligand-receptor pair CD74_APP was not observed, suggesting that the EA intervention activated the ligand-receptor interaction of CD74_APP. In the communication between the AC and the EC, the ligand-receptor pair activated by the EA also contained TNFSF12_TNFRSF25, while GDF11_TGFR_AVR2B was blocked. Additionally, the mean interactions of TYRO3_GAS6, TNFSF13_TNFRSF1A, NOTCH1_JAG2, FGFR2_EPHA4, and FGFR2_PTPRR were consistently decreased in the EA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17b</xref>). The FB-EC communication attracted our attention because there were more ligand-receptor pairs than others. In the EA group, the communication between TGFB3 in the FB and its corresponding receptors in the endothelial cells was activated. Furthermore, apart from the higher mean PLXNB2_PTN in the EA group than that in the CON group, we observed that all other ligand-receptor pairs with mean changes were higher in the CON group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig17" position="float"><label>Figure 17.</label><caption><title>Cell communication with endothelial cells, related to the section ‘Coordination of cell communication in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following electroacupuncture (EA) intervention’.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The top 20 ligand receptor pairs with mean value in the EA and CON groups, respectively.

Moreover, functional analysis in our study identified numerous terms and pathways associated with the BBB. Unexpectedly, the large clustering differences in microglia with and without EA intervention caught our attention. Indeed, microglia may serve as crucial priming cells for EA-induced opening of the BBB. Consequently, future research could focus on this aspect, and our laboratory is currently investigating this phenomenon, even though current research on microglia and BBB is mostly focused on the pathology and neuroinflammation of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Higher basal Hmox1 expression in microglia is accompanied by increased oxidative stress, which directly affects the permeability of the BBB.

Notably, the basic neural basis synapses of memory and cognitive function are highly susceptible to synaptic phagocytosis by activated microglia and may improve cognitive function by reducing excessive activation of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reverte et al., 2024</xref>). We also observed enrichment of the pathway associated with cocaine addiction, which has been associated with microglia for synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens synapses during cocaine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Victor et al., 2022</xref>). Another pathway, thyroid hormone synthesis, is important for the microglial phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figures 12d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13b and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp23">Supplementary file 23</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp24">Supplementary file 24</xref>). The trigger receptor expressed in myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is a cell surface receptor found in macrophages and microglia that responds to disease-related signals to regulate the phenotype of these innate immune cells. TREM2 is regulated by thyroid hormones, and its expression in macrophages and microglia is stimulated by thyroid hormones and synthetic thyroid hormone agonists (thyroid inhibitors).</p><p>In addition to considering the overall clustering of endothelial cells and microglia, which are cells with large differences in clustering, subsequent experiments should also focus on changes in the characteristics of the clustering of these cell subpopulations to explore whether there are certain unknown potential key subpopulations that play a critical role in BBB permeability. Similarly, cell communication analysis should not be confined to astrocytes and pericytes, which are typically regarded as cell types that are functionally associated with the BBB or comprised in the BBB. Differences in clustering and gene expression were also present in fibroblasts, BAMs, and T cells, although not so pronounced as to be focused on in this article, but it is possible that they are also involved in the regulation of BBB permeability.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, as this investigation represents the initial analysis of single-cell transcriptome sequencing in the frontal cortex following EA intervention, there exists a limited understanding of the signaling pathways involved in EA-mediated BBB function. Second, a rat model was selected for this study due to considerations of EA operational precision. Third, additional protein analyses and functional validation are necessary to confirm the putative roles of each cellular phenotype. Finally, the possibility cannot be excluded that certain cells or cell types may be lost during tissue dissociation and cell enrichment; indeed, pericytes and neurons, which also play significant roles in the brain, were not enriched in this study. Nevertheless, this single-cell transcriptome sequencing in a rat model to investigate the target of action of EA-opening BBB could facilitate the study of BBB-opening-related mechanisms, which is crucial to numerous current investigations of exogenous drugs crossing the BBB into the brain.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the function of the BBB is complex and requires a thorough understanding of the classification and molecular characteristics of cells, as well as detailed characterization of the spatial organization and interaction of molecularly defined cell types. This is because the spatial relationship between cells is the primary determinant of intercellular interactions and communication, which are mediated by juxtacrine and paracrine signaling. Our study revealed a unique frontal cortex-specific transcriptome signature and elucidated the cell types and clusters that mediate EA-induced transcriptional changes, including cellular communication. Our study highlights the characteristic changes in brain endothelial cells under EA intervention, as well as the cell types that synergistically participate in the structural and functional changes of the BBB, such as microglia and astrocytes, providing a framework for the mechanism of EA opening the BBB. The development of high-resolution, spatially resolved whole-brain cell atlases will provide invaluable resources for investigating BBB function during EA interventions. Future research in this area is necessary to elucidate the intricate details of intercellular communication and gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying BBB function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The Animal Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University approved the experimental procedures (Approval No.: IACUC-20220507-01).

The authors seek to characterize changes in gene expression and pathway activities across diverse neural cells in response to electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation using high-resolution transcriptomics. This approach has the potential to elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying EA stimulation and their implications for therapeutic intervention. The work engages with a timely and biologically significant question regarding noninvasive stimulation methods to manipulate BBB permeability. However, no in vivo/in vitro functional assays are provided to validate the changes in BBB permeability or cytokine release in the tested models. The experimental rationale remains inadequately explained, and key details regarding the magnitude, duration, and spatial distribution of BBB opening in this system are still lacking.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107938.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Congcong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Zhaoxing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Tianxiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jinding</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qian</surname><given-names>Kecheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Zixin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Qinyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>Mengyuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Key Laboratory of Acupuncture and Neurology of Zhejiang Province</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xianming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhejiang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work from this paper successfully mapped transcriptional landscape and identified EA-responsive cell types (endothelial, microglia).

In fact, our team conducted a series of preliminary studies that verified this aspect, and we hace provided a more detailed introduction in the introduction section, in lines 60-71 of the manuscript.</p><p>We are very grateful to the reviewers for pointing out the important and meaningful issue of &quot;gender-specific BBB differences.&quot; We will make this a focal point in our future research.</p><p>As for pericytes and neurons, we acknowledge their importance in the function of the blood-brain barrier. We acknowledge the importance of pericytes and neurons in the blood-brain barrier. However, neurons are absent because our sample processing method involves dissociation. During the dissociation procedure, neuronal axons, which are relatively long, are filtered out during the frequent cell suspension steps and cannot enter the downstream microfluidic system for analysis, so they are not present in our data. Since this experiment is primarily focused on non-neuronal cells, we did not choose to use nucleus extraction for sample processing. As for pericytes, we believe they are not captured because their proportion in our samples is extremely low, which is why they are not present in the data. Further research may require single-nucleus transcriptomics or the separate isolation of these two cell types for study. Of course, in our current mechanistic studies, we are also fully considering the important roles these two cell types play in BBB function.</p><p>In addition, to validate the results at the protein level, we have recently conducted some experiments. However, as several proteins are currently at a critical stage of further experimental validation, it is not appropriate to present them in the manuscript at this time. Instead, we have uploaded the relevant data as an appendix for your review. This includes a figure of several protein markers we examined, as well as a table of the antibodies used.</p><p>This section is also further elaborated in the introduction and its references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to explore how electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation alters the brain's cellular and molecular landscape after blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. The authors aim to identify changes in gene expression and signaling pathways across brain cell types in response to EA stimulation using single-cell RNA sequencing. This direction holds promise for understanding the consequences of noninvasive methods of BBB opening for therapeutic drug delivery across the BBB.</p><p>(1) The work falls short in its current form. The experimental design lacks a clear justification, and readers are not provided with sufficient background information on the extent, timing, or regional specificity of BBB opening in this EA model. These details, established in prior work, are critical to understanding the rationale behind the current transcriptomic analyses.</p><p>(2) Further, the results are often presented with minimal context or interpretation. There is no model of intercellular or molecular coordination to explain the BBB-opening process, despite the stated goal of identifying such mechanisms. The statement that EA induces a &quot;unique frontal cortex-specific transcriptome signature&quot; is not supported, as no data from other brain regions are presented. Biological interpretation is at times unclear or inaccurate - for instance, attributing astrocyte migration effects to endothelial cell clusters or suggesting microglial tight junction changes without connecting them meaningfully to endothelial function.</p><p>(3) The study does include analyses of receptor-ligand signaling and cell-cell communication, which could be among its most biologically rich outputs. However, these are relegated to supplementary material and not shown in the leading figures. This choice limits the utility of the manuscript as a hypothesis-generating resource.</p><p>(4) Overall, while the dataset may be of interest to BBB researchers and those developing technologies for drug delivery across the BBB, the manuscript in its current form does not yet fulfill its interpretive goals. A more integrated and biologically grounded analysis would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>This section is also further elaborated in the introduction and its references.</p><p>Our current study is actually based on previous findings that electroacupuncture can open the BBB, with a more pronounced effect observed in the frontal lobe (this aspect should be further described in the research background). Building on this foundation, our aim is to delineate the potential biological mechanisms involved. Therefore, we selected frontal lobe tissue as our primary choice for sequencing and have not yet investigated differences across other brain regions, although this may become a focus of future research. Additionally, we recognize that the mechanism underlying BBB opening is complex, and at present, we cannot determine whether it is driven by a single direct factor or by coordinated actions between cells or molecules. As such, our results are presented only briefly for now, and we will carefully consider whether to supplement our findings by incorporating insights from other studies.</p><p>Considering the overall data layout and the length of the article, we ultimately decided not to make any changes to the presentation of the article's data. The images included in the supplementary materials are also thoroughly described and referenced in the manuscript, allowing readers to selectively view any data they are interested in.</p><p>Indeed, our current dataset and analysis tend to present objective data results. We are also conducting a series of validations that may be related to the biology of the blood-brain barrier, and we look forward to sharing and discussing any future research findings with you and everyone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figures 3-7: Label treatment groups (CON vs. EA) consistently in legends.</p><p>(2) Methods: Specify rat strain (Sprague-Dawley) in the abstract.</p><p>(3) Clarify Limitations: Explicitly state that BBB opening is inferred, not proven.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been revised at lines 743-733, 748, 949, 754-755, and 759-760 of the manuscript.</p><p>Revised at line 31 of the manuscript.</p><p>Thank you for your feedback.

Second, since BBB opening via EA is a unique strategy, our previous studies have examined the opening time window and the recovery of the BBB after EA intervention (as mentioned in the introduction). We believe its characteristics differ from those of ultrasound-induced BBB opening and BBB disruption, so we did not conduct comparative discussions, but objectively presented our research findings. In further functional validation experiments, we may consider integrating other opening strategies in our studies. Additionally, the choice of electroacupuncture was based on our previous series of studies, which have already been outlined in the research background. Finally, we did indeed determine the experimental design of this study based on prior research, as described in the background section of the introduction.</p><p>We decided not to make changes to this section in the manuscript after careful consideration. The setup of electroacupuncture intervention and controls has been thoroughly discussed in our previous studies (as referenced in the introduction), so we have not repeated it in this manuscript. Overall, building on all our previous findings, this study focuses primarily on the potential mechanisms of EA intervention. The anatomical sites of acupuncture stimulation and their physiological relevance are another key area of our research, and we are currently conducting a series of related studies. We look forward to sharing these findings with you in the future.</p><p>We have already changed the human brain diagram in Figure 1 to a rat brain diagram, and have replaced Figure 1 in the files with the revised version. However, considering the overall data layout and the length of the article, we ultimately decided not to make changes to the data presentation in the manuscript. The images in the supplementary materials are also thoroughly described and referenced in the manuscript, allowing readers to selectively view the data they are interested in.</p><p>This section has provided us with excellent suggestions for further exploration, although no changes have been made to the manuscript at this time. In the future, we may conduct more detailed transcriptomic studies focusing on sex differences and different brain regions, which will allow for a more comprehensive analysis of the biological mechanisms involved in BBB regulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
