phagocyte NADPH oxidase. EROS deficiency in humans is a novel cause of the severe immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, but its mechanism of action was unknown until now. We elucidate the role of EROS, showing it acts at the earliest stages of gp91<italic>phox</italic> maturation. It binds the immature 58 kDa gp91<italic>phox</italic> directly, preventing gp91<italic>phox</italic> degradation and allowing glycosylation via the oligosaccharyltransferase machinery and the incorporation of the heme prosthetic groups essential for catalysis. EROS also regulates the purine receptors P2X7 and P2X1 through direct interactions, and P2X7 is almost absent in EROS-deficient mouse and human primary cells. Accordingly, lack of murine EROS results in markedly abnormal P2X7 signalling, inflammasome activation, and T cell responses. The loss of both ROS and P2X7 signalling leads to resistance to influenza infection in mice. Our work identifies EROS as a highly selective chaperone for key proteins in innate and adaptive immunity and a rheostat for immunity to infection. It has profound implications for our understanding of immune physiology, ROS dysregulation, and possibly gene therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NADPH oxidase;</kwd><kwd>chaperone;</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>P2X receptor</kwd><kwd>OST complex</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206617/A/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name><name><surname>Dufficy</surname><given-names>Elizabeth R</given-names></name><name><surname>Garside</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>Esme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

This multi-subunit protein complex consists of (i) a membrane-bound heterodimer, gp91<italic>phox</italic>-p22<italic>phox,</italic> and (ii) the cytosolic components p67<italic>phox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Volpp et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nunoi et al., 1988</xref>), p47<italic>phox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Volpp et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Segal et al., 1985</xref>), p40<italic>phox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wientjes et al., 1993</xref>), and either Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abo et al., 1991</xref>) or Rac2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knaus et al., 1991</xref>).

To address this, we utilised the Nanoluc Binary Technology (NanoBiT) complementation reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>). We fused EROS and gp91<italic>phox</italic> to large BiT (LgBiT) and small BiT (SmBiT) subunits of the luciferase at either the N- or C-terminus.

The LgBiT-EROS and gp91<italic>phox</italic>-LgBiT constructs paired with the negative control HaloTag-SmBiT (HT-SmBiT) gave signal within the background. Two separate construct pairs, LgBiT-EROS with gp91<italic>phox</italic>-SmBiT and SmBiT-EROS with gp91<italic>phox</italic>-LgBiT, generated high-intensity luminescence within the first 30 min of monitoring live HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The combination LgBiT-EROS and gp91<italic>phox</italic>-SmBiT encoded in a single vector (BiBiT vector, see ‘Methods’) where expression of both gp91<italic>phox</italic> and EROS is driven by the same promotor also generated high-intensity luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), thereby demonstrating that gp91<italic>phox</italic> and EROS interact directly.

For NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4, this process was not impaired by succinyl acetone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).

We used the widely adopted statistical algorithm Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINTexpress; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teo et al., 2014</xref>) to discriminate specific EROS interactors from non-specific or background binders. SAINTexpress uses quantitative information from the mass spectrometry data, more specifically the abundance of each identified protein in the bait experiments compared to the control purifications, to score the probability of a true interaction. The SAINT probability (SP) score represents the confidence level of potential protein interactions, with 1 being the highest possible value. We applied a stringent threshold of SP &gt; 0.9 (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 1%) to derive a list of 59 high-confidence EROS interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

HEK293 cells expressing STT3A-GFP and EROS-mRFP constructs exhibited an ER localisation of the two proteins with a specific rim around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). Quantitation of the pixel intensity of STT3A-GFP and EROS-mRFP across the nuclear membrane gave an identical profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel).

STT3A interacts directly with SEC61 and mediates co-translational N-glycosylation. STT3B is not associated with SEC61, and glycosylates sites skipped by STT3A. In the absence of STT3A, we observed a shift in the glycosylation pattern of gp91<italic>phox</italic> compared to control conditions, resulting in an increase of the immature 58 kDa form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Co-expression of gp91<italic>phox</italic> with EROS in <italic>STT3A</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells resulted in the same effect with the appearance of further bands around 65 kDa, probably glycosylation intermediates. <italic>STT3B</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, instead, exhibited an overall increase of gp91<italic>phox</italic> abundance compared to control cells both in the absence or presence of EROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

This suggests that blockade of the OST machinery in the ER prevents subsequent proper glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus. Lack of STT3A as well as treatment with NGI-1 led to an increase in the expression of the ER stress marker BiP in HEK293 and in PLB985 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).

The structure of the full-length EROS protein predicted by AlphaFold 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) is available through the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021</xref>). The predicted structure shows a tripartite organisation of (i) a PH domain, (ii) an integral membrane segment, and (iii) a flexible C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The EROS protein contains a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain composed of residues 1–20 (containing beta strands 1 and 2) and residues 62–166 (containing beta strands 3–8 and alpha helices H3 and H4). Inserted between beta strands 2 and 3 of the PH domain are two integral membrane alpha helices (helices H1 and H2) that are packed in an antiparallel orientation. The C-terminal tail of EROS composed of residues 167–187 has a structure with very low confidence &lt;50 plDDT (predicted local Distance Difference Test) which is usually indicative of disordered regions of proteins. Multiple independent models built with AlphaFold (data not shown) show a wide variety of conformations for this tail confirming its lack of regular structure. If confirmed experimentally, the insertion of transmembrane helices within a PH domain appears to be a hitherto unobserved feature within known structures. A similar PH domain organisation is predicted to be found in the structure of the Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis class H (PIGH) protein (UniProtKB-Q5M9N4). This ER-associated transmembrane protein is part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex that catalyses the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and participates in the first step of GPI biosynthesis. GPI is an anchor for many membrane proteins, including key immune proteins such as the receptors CD16 and CD14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wegner et al., 2021</xref>), as well as the complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tremblay-Laganière et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether EROS might regulate the abundance of other proteins in different immune cell types.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins modulated by EROS in immune cells identified the P2X7 purinergic receptor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the AlphaFold structure prediction of the top ranked model.

Additionally, we observed a lower expression of the tumour suppressor protein Phactr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Solimini et al., 2013</xref>) in EROS-deficient cells.

RAW264.7 macrophages express P2X7 endogenously and lentiviral overexpression of EROS increased P2X7 expression relative to that observed with a control vector that expressed only GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Therefore, not only does EROS deficiency led to a lack of P2X7 expression, but EROS upregulation increased P2X7 abundance.

Furthermore, NanoBiT analysis using a LgBiT-EROS and P2X7-SmBiT pair constructs in HEK293 resulted in luminescence production, showing that the interaction between P2X7 and EROS was direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages express other P2X family members including P2X4 and P2X1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sim et al., 2007</xref>).

This study offers unique insight into the early stages of the protein’s biosynthesis, on which all subsequent events depend. These early stages involve the OST-complex, which is required for the initial glycosylation events, folding and insertion into the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gemmer and Förster, 2020</xref>). The OST complex adds a preformed oligosaccharide to an asparagine residue on a newly synthesised protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cherepanova et al., 2016</xref>). Murine gp91<italic>phox</italic> has one asparagine residue while human gp91<italic>phox</italic> has three asparagine residues that are glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harper et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wallach and Segal, 1997</xref>). Using PNGaseF and EndoH-treated lysates as a reference, we demonstrated that EROS immunoprecipitated with partially glycosylated gp91<italic>phox</italic>. Blockade of OST-mediated N-glycosylation, through chemical inhibition or use of cells lacking the catalytic subunit STT3A, impacts on the gp91<italic>phox</italic> glycosylation pattern upon co-transfection with EROS in HEK293 cells but does not reduce the abundance of gp91<italic>phox</italic> per se as does EROS deficiency. Hence, we propose that EROS works post-translationally, stabilising gp91<italic>phox</italic> so that the high-mannose precursor can be synthesised and undergo further maturation.</p><p>We find that EROS can increase the abundance of NOX1, gp91<italic>phox</italic> (NOX2), and NOX4 in co-transfection assays and that it can directly bind NOX2, NOX3, and NOX4 in Yeast 2 Hybrid assays. This contrasts with its inability to augment the expression of NOX5 or p22<italic>phox</italic> and suggests that EROS likely binds a conserved motif in those NOX proteins that depend on p22<italic>phox</italic> for stability. We also present an EROS-deficient iPS-derived human macrophage line. This recapitulates the effects seen in cell lines and patients for gp91<italic>phox</italic>-p22<italic>phox</italic> but demonstrates for the first time in a primary human cell that EROS deficiency leads to P2X7 deficiency and that this is likely an important part of the human syndrome.</p><p>We place the role of EROS in context by using a granular mass spectrometry detecting up to 8000 proteins in different cell types to clearly define the range of proteins that EROS can regulate in context of the entire proteome. We used both whole-cell and plasma membrane to show just how specific EROS is in its physiological effects. In addition to our work on human iPS-derived macrophages, we make new insights into the biology of the control of P2X7 expression by EROS. The effects of EROS deficiency on P2X7 expression were noted in our original mass spectrometry analysis and in a recent screen of factors that influence ATP driven phosphatidylserine excursion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryoden et al., 2020</xref>). In this work, we show that EROS knockout mice have P2X7 deficiency in eight primary cell types of the murine immune system. Several splice variants exist in different tissues, and it is important to clarify whether EROS has cell type-specific effects on P2X7 expression. Notably in our T cell experiments, EROS-driven P2X7 deficiency affects shedding of CD27 and CD62L and ATP-driven cell death. Moreover, we show that the effects on P2X7 are a class effect with similar, but more modest, effects on P2X1 expression. We demonstrate that the mechanism by which this occurs is a direct effect on P2X7 and, by extension, is likely to be a direct effect on P2X1. Significantly, EROS overexpression drives increased abundance of P2X7 and P2X1, suggesting that EROS might act as a physiological regulator of purinergic signalling.</p><p>A particular strength of our study is that we show marked in vivo sequelae of the lack of P2X7. EROS deficiency leads to profound susceptibility to bacterial infection but protects mice from infection with influenza A. This is likely to reflect the fact that mice that are (i) deficient in gp91<italic>phox,</italic> (ii) deficient in P2X7, and (iii) treated with P2X7 inhibitors have improved outcomes following infection with influenza A and raises intriguing questions about the physiological role of EROS. Snelgrove et al. showed that gp91<italic>phox</italic> deficiency improved outcomes in influenza A. gp91<italic>phox</italic> knockout mice exhibited a reduced influenza titre in the lung parenchyma. Inflammatory infiltrate into the lung parenchyma was markedly reduced and lung function significantly improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snelgrove et al., 2006</xref>). To et al. then demonstrated that the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is activated by single-stranded RNA and DNA viruses in endocytic compartments. This causes endosomal hydrogen peroxide generation, which suppresses antiviral and humoral signalling networks via modification of a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys98) on Toll-like receptor-7. In this study, targeted inhibition of endosomal ROS production using cholestanol-conjugated gp91dsTAT (Cgp91ds-TAT) abrogates IAV pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">To et al., 2017</xref>). This group went on to explore infection with a more pathogenic influenza A strain, PR8, using the same specific inhibitor. Cgp91ds-TAT reduced airway inflammation, including neutrophil influx and alveolitis and enhanced the clearance of lung viral mRNA following PR8 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">To et al., 2019</xref>). This group has also shown that NOX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Selemidis et al., 2013</xref>) and NOX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hendricks et al., 2022</xref>) can drive pathogenic inflammation in influenza A, emphasising the importance of clarifying the roles of EROS in the control of the expression of these proteins.</p><p>In studies on P2X7, Rosli et al. found that mice infected with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of influenza A HKx31 had improved outcomes if they were treated with a P2X7 inhibitor at day 3 post infection and every 2 days thereafter. Survival was also improved even if the inhibitor is given on day 7 post infection following a lethal dose of the mouse-adapted PR8. This was associated with reduced cellular infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but viral titres were not measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosli et al., 2019</xref>). Leyva-Grado et al. examined influenza A infection in P2X7 knockout mice. They infected mice with both influenza A/Puerto Rico/08/1934 virus and influenza A/Netherlands/604/2009 H1N1pdm virus. They showed that P2X7 receptor deficiency led to improved survival after infection with both viruses with less weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leyva-Grado et al., 2017</xref>). Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was impaired, and there were fewer cellular hallmarks of severe infection such as infiltration of neutrophils and depletion of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages. It is worth noting that the P2X7 knockout strain used in this study was the Pfizer strain in which some splice variants of P2X7 are still expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartlett et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the dual loss of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and P2X7 in EROS knockout mice likely confers protection from IAV infection. By reducing the expression of both NOX2 and P2X7, EROS regulates two pathways that may be detrimental in influenza A and we speculate that EROS may physiologically act as a rheostat controlling certain types of immune response.</p><p>P2X7 is crucial for ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and has an emerging role in T cell biology, especially in resident immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stark, 2018</xref>). Of note, P2X7 ligation by ATP is also a potent driver of ROS formation, the other major process that is profoundly affected by EROS deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pfeiffer et al., 2007</xref>). One role of EROS might be to modulate ATP-driven danger signalling including ROS and NLRP3 activation through controlling the biosynthesis of NOX2 and P2X7. Both ROS and NLRP3 activation are clearly essential, but the extent and duration of responses must be controlled to limit tissue damage. Therefore, one might consider EROS as a rheostat for these key linked immune processes.</p><p>In conclusion, we have elucidated the mechanism by which EROS controls the abundance of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and purinergic receptors and defined EROS as a highly selective molecular chaperone that can shape immune responses through targeting specific proteins. As well as advancing our understanding of the physiology of highly conserved and non-redundant proteins, this work has implications for translational medicine, including gene therapy and possible therapeutic blockade of EROS to limit viral immunopathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal use</title><p>EROS/<italic>Cybc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (KOMP) and gp91<italic>phox</italic>/<italic>Cybb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 2017b</xref>).

SAINTexpress was used to score interaction specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teo et al., 2014</xref>). Proteins with SAINT probability score &gt;0.9 were deemed high-confidence-specific interactors (FDR &lt;1%). Proteins with SP score &gt;0.74 represent medium-confidence interactors (FDR &lt;5%).</p><p>For visualisation, the protein interaction network was generated with STRING (minimum required interaction score 0.4) using interactions derived from text mining, experiments, and databases. GO term enrichment analysis was performed with STRING.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Full proteome quantitative analysis by TMT-mass spectrometry</title><p>Cell pellets were lysed in 1% sodium deoxylate/10% isopropanol/50 mM NaCl/100 mM tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB, Sigma) with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (1×, Thermo Scientific). Lysates were sonicated and heated at 90°C for 5 min. Then, 100 µg of proteins per sample were reduced with TCEP, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with 3 µg of trypsin (Pierce MS grade, Thermo) prior to labelling with TMT10plex according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were pooled, acidified, and then centrifuged to remove precipitated deoxycholic acid. The supernatant was dried, resuspended in 0.1% NH<sub>4</sub>OH, and fractionated on an XBridge BEH C18 column (2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm, Waters) with an initial 5 min loading then linear gradient from 5% CH<sub>3</sub>CN/0.1% NH<sub>4</sub>OH (pH 10)–35% CH<sub>3</sub>CN /0.1% NH<sub>4</sub>OH for 30 min, then to 80% CH<sub>3</sub>CN/0.1% NH<sub>4</sub>OH for 5 min and stayed for another 5 min. The flow rate was at 200 µL/min. Fractions were collected every 42 s from 7.8 min to 50 min and then concatenated to 28 fractions and dried.</p><p>Peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid and a 25% aliquot injected for online LC-MS/MS analysis on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos hybrid mass spectrometer coupled to an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano UPLC system (Thermo Fisher). Samples were desalted on a PepMap C18 nano trap (100 µm i.d. × 20 mm, 100 Å, 5µ), then separated on a PepMap C18 column (75 µm i.d. × 500 mm, 2 µm) over a linear gradient of 5.6–30.4% CH<sub>3</sub>CN/0.1% formic acid in 90 min at a flow rate at 300 nL/min. The MS acquisition used MS3 level quantification with Synchronous Precursor Selection (SPS5) with the Top Speed 3 s cycle time. Briefly, the Orbitrap full MS survey scan was m/z 375–1500 with the resolution 120,000 at m/z 200, with AGC set at 4e5 and 50 ms maximum injection time. Multiply charged ions (z = 2–5) with intensity threshold at 5000 were fragmented in ion trap at 35% collision energy, with AGC at 1e4 and 50 ms maximum injection time, and isolation width at 0.7 Da in quadrupole. The top 5 MS2 fragment ions were SPS selected with the isolation width at 0.7 Da, fragmented in HCD at 65% NCE, and detected in the Orbitrap. The resolution was set at 50,000, and the AGC at 1e5 with maximum injection time at 86 ms. The dynamic exclusion was set 40 s with ±10 ppm exclusion window.</p><p>Raw files were processed with Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher) using Sequest HT. Spectra were searched against UniProt mouse database (April 2020) and cRAP contaminant database. Search parameters were trypsin with two maximum miss-cleavage sites, mass tolerances at 20 ppm for precursors and 0.5 Da for fragment ions, dynamic modifications of deamidated (N, Q), oxidation (M), and acetyl (protein N-terminus), static modifications of carbamidomethyl (C) and TMT6plex (peptide N-terminus and K). Peptides were validated by Percolator with q-value set at 0.01 (strict) and 0.05 (relaxed). The TMT10plex reporter ion quantifier included 20 ppm integration tolerance on the most confident centroid peak at the MS3 level. The co-isolation threshold was set at 100%. Only unique peptides, with average reported signal-to-noise ratio &gt;3, were used for protein quantification, and the SPS mass matches threshold was set at 55%. Only master proteins were reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Plasma membrane profiling analysis by tandem mass tagging-mass spectrometry</title><p>Cell surface proteins were labelled essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weekes et al., 2012</xref>). Samples were then resuspended in 21 µL 100 mM TEAB pH 8.5 prior to labelling with tandem mass tagging (TMT) reagent (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s protocol. After checking whether each sample was at least 98% TMT labelled, total reporter ion intensities were used to normalise the pooling of the remaining samples to a 1:1 ratio of total peptide content between samples. This final pool was brought up to a volume of 1 mL with 0.1% TFA. FA was added until the pH was &lt;2. Samples were then cleaned up by SPE using a 50 mg tC18 SepPak cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was wetted with 1 mL 100% methanol followed by 1 mL ACN, equilibrated with 1 mL 0.1% TFA, and sample loaded slowly. Samples were passed twice over the cartridge. The cartridge was washed 3× with 1 mL 0.1% TFA before eluting sequentially with 250 µL 40% ACN, 70% ACN, and 80% ACN and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.</p><p>TMT-labelled samples were resuspended in 40 µL 200 mM ammonium formate pH 10 and transferred to a glass HPLC vial for basic pH reversed-phase fractionation (BpH-RP). BpH-RP fractionation was conducted on an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a 2.1 mm × 15 cm, 1.7 µm Kinetex EVO column (Phenomenex). Solvent A was 3% ACN, solvent B was 100% ACN, and solvent C was 200 mM ammonium formate (pH 10). Throughout the analysis, solvent C was kept at a constant 10%. The flow rate was 500 µL/min and UV was monitored at 280 nm. Samples were loaded in 90% A for 10 min before a gradient elution of 0–10% B over 10 min (curve 3), 10–34% B over 21 min (curve 5), 34–50% B over 5 min (curve 5), followed by a 10 min wash with 90% B. Then, 15 s (100 µL) fractions were collected throughout the run. Fractions containing peptide (as determined by A280) were recombined across the gradient to preserve orthogonality with online low pH RP separation. For example, fractions 1, 25, 49, 73, and 97 were combined and dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at –20°C until LC-MS analysis. Twelve fractions were generated in this manner.</p><p>For mass spectrometry, analysis was conducted on an Orbitrap Fusion instrument online with an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher). Samples were resuspended in 10 µL 5% DMSO/1% TFA, and all samples were injected. Trapping solvent was 0.1% TFA, analytical solvent A was 0.1% FA, and solvent B was ACN with 0.1% FA. Samples were loaded onto a trapping column (300 µm × 5 mm PepMap cartridge trap (Thermo Fisher)) at 10 µL/min for 5 min at 60°C. Samples were then separated on a 75 cm × 75 µm i.d. 2 µm particle size PepMap C18 column (Thermo Fisher) at 55°C. The gradient was 3–10% B over 10 min, 10–35% B over 155 min, 35–45% B over 9 min, followed by a wash at 95% B for 5 min and re-equilibration at 3% B. Eluted peptides were introduced by electrospray to the MS by applying 2.1 kV to a stainless steel emitter 5 cm × 30 µm (PepSep). Mass spectra were acquired using MS3 level quantification with SPS10 with the Top Speed 3 s cycle time. The Orbitrap full MS survey scan was m/z 400–1500 with the resolution at 120,000, AGC set at 125 and 50 ms maximum injection time. Multiple charged ions (z = 2–7) with intensity threshold at 5000 were fragmented in ion trap at 35% collision energy, with AGC at 80 and isolation width at 0.7 Da in quadrupole. The top MS3 fragment ions were SPS selected with the isolation width at 2 and were fragmented in HCD at 65% and detected in Orbitrap at 50,000 resolution. The AGC was set at 40 with maximum injection time at 120 ms, and the dynamic exclusion was set at 40 s with ±10 ppm exclusion window.</p><p>Data were processed with MASCOT (Matrix Science) and Proteome Discoverer, v2.2 (Thermo Fisher). Raw files were searched against the UniProt Mouse database, including common contaminants at a MS1 Tol of 10 ppm, MS2 Tol of 0.5 Da. Fixed modifications were TMT-labelled lysines and Peptide N-Termini and carbamidomethylated cysteines. Methionine oxidation was allowed as a variable modification. Mascot Percolator was used to control the PSM FDR, and an automated decoy database search was used to determine protein FDR. Proteins with either ‘high’ (FDR &lt;0.01) or ‘medium’ (FDR &lt;0.05) confidence were taken forward to further analysis. Proteins and their abundances were output to .csv, imported to R, and submitted to statistical analysis using LIMMA, a moderated <italic>t</italic>-test available through the Bioconductor package. LIMMA p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method to generate an FDR (q-value).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Data availability</title><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perez-Riverol et al., 2019</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier ‘PXD024659.’ The plasma membrane profiling mass spectrometry data has the identifier ‘PXD025149’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con26"><p>Conceptualization, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con27"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con28"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con29"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con30"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con31"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con32"><p>Data curation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con33"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con34"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con35"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The care and use of all mice were in accordance with UK Home Office regulations (UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Primers used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) knockout for EROS by CRISPR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequences of the CRISPR guide RNA and the gene-specific genotyping primers (GF1-GR1).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christine Winterbourn (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address the concerns of the reviewers comments below.</p><p>Please make it clear what are the novel findings of the present study and their importance.</p><p>Please clarify the roles of EROS in Nox1 and Nox4.</p><p>1. In Figure 1 The lower EROS expression when gp91phox is expressed warrants a comment. Figure 1 G. Please explain what fold change represents. From F, zero time expression appears much more than the 1.5 fold higher shown in G for the EROS-expressing cells. This needs explaining. With the very high error bars (presumably for the EROS sample although this is not clear) overlapping zero I find it hard to conclude anything from this figure.</p><p>2. P 9 line 9 states that Figure 1H shows that cycloheximide increases expression. Yet it appears from the legend that cycloheximide is present in all samples and it is EROS that increases expression. Please clarify this anomaly.</p><p>3. Figure 3A&amp;B and p12 1st para. The identification of OST as a binding partner is interesting and a significant novel finding. However, the presentation of this information appears to me to be unduly complex and more information is required. Not all the readers will be familiar with the details of SAINTexpress methodology and more explanation of what is being shown would be helpful. At the least, a supplementary Table of the 59 identified proteins would be helpful, plus information on controls to establish selective pull down by EROS and on how the blue spots in A relate to the proteins. Also please make it clearer which of the proteins in B were identified and the relevance of showing all the steps in the pathway.</p><p>4. Figure 6. This contains a large amount of information. Although interesting, I am concerned that the authors may be trying to include too much at the expense of the necessary detail for some of the experiments. For example, the EROS -/- +ATP scattergram on the left of Figure 6E does not seem to agree with the right hand graph. I would also like to see the mean values for the 5 experiments in Figure 6G shown. Most importantly, insufficient information is given for Figure 6H. I don't think I missed it but I could find no details about the experiment in the Methods section. We need to know more about exactly how many animals in were in each group (death of 1 animal appears to equate to 5% of total – how does this relate to &gt;10 in total), how signs of illness were monitored and related to death, and generally more about the conditions of the experiment. Alternatively this may be better left to a more detailed study.</p><p>5. Details on the influenza A virus infection experiments in mice (figure 6h) are missing. Information on the used dose and virus strain for infection are important, as the outcome could be different upon high or low dose infection. It remains unclear if reduced mortality is observed due to reduced adverse inflammatory signalling or if lack of Nox2 and inflammasome activity affects the virus burden. In addition, how does the EROS knockout mouse compare to gp91phox knockout or P2X7 inhibition alone? This could be discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>6.

We have now also re-written the discussion around this structure in addition to making reference to the relevant literature. This should make it easier for readers of the journal to discern the new advances.</p><p>(i) We use a granular mass spectrometry detecting up to 8000 proteins in different cell types to clearly define the range of proteins that EROS can regulate in context of the entire proteome. We used both whole cell and plasma membrane profiling to show just how specific EROS is in its physiological effects. This is a significant advance on our previous mass spectrometry work. It sets the platform for advances in our understanding of the way EROS controls both NAPDH oxidase and P2X receptor biology, which we elaborate on below.</p><p>(ii) We present an EROS-deficient iPS derived human macrophage line for the first time. This recapitulates the effects seen in cell lines and patients for gp91<italic>phox</italic>-p22<italic>phox</italic> and will be a useful platform in which to interrogate the effects of EROS in the human immune system. It also demonstrates for the first time in a primary human cell that EROS deficiency leads to P2X7 deficiency. This is likely to be an important part of the human syndrome.</p><p>(iii) We show, by two different techniques that EROS binds gp91<italic>phox</italic> directly and that it is needed very early in gp91<italic>phox</italic> biogenesis, in contrast to p22<italic>phox</italic>. It preferentially stabilises the gp91<italic>phox</italic> 58kDa precursor before heme incorporation takes place. We conclusively demonstrate that the primary effect in this context is on gp91<italic>phox</italic> and the effect on p22<italic>phox</italic> is secondary. We show that it can associate with the gp91<italic>phox</italic>-p22<italic>phox</italic> heterodimer up until export from the ER. Much work has been done to characterise the latter stages of gp91<italic>phox</italic> maturation (Porter et al., 1996, Yu et al., 1997, Yu et al., 1999, DeLeo et al., 2000, Beaumel et al., 2014). This study thus offers unique insight into the early stages of the protein’s biosynthesis, on which all subsequent events depend. Our BiBiT split luciferase assay also describes a useful platform to model the direct interaction between EROS and gp91<italic>phox</italic> in future i.e. in dissecting whether point mutations in the protein might disrupt the interaction. We also pull down endogenous gp91<italic>phox</italic> and western blot endogenous EROS.</p><p>(iv) These early stages involve the OST-complex, which is required for the initial glycosylation events, folding and insertion into the ER membrane (Gemmer and Forster, 2020). The OST complex adds a preformed oligosaccharide to an asparagine residue on a newly synthetized protein (Cherepanova et al., 2016). Murine gp91<italic>phox</italic> has one asparagine residue while human gp91<italic>phox</italic> has three asparagine residues that are glycosylated (Harper et al., 1985, Wallach and Segal, 1997). Using PNGaseF and EndoH-treated lysates as a reference, we demonstrated that EROS immunoprecipitated with partially glycosylated gp91<italic>phox</italic>. Blockade of OST-mediated N-glycosylation, through chemical inhibition or use of cells lacking the catalytic subunit STT3A, impacts on the gp91<italic>phox</italic> glycosylation pattern upon co-transfection with EROS in HEK293 cells but does not reduce the abundance of gp91<italic>phox</italic> per se as does EROS deficiency. Hence, we propose that EROS works immediately post-translationally, stabilizing gp91<italic>phox</italic> so that the high mannose precursor can be synthetized and undergo further maturation, including heme incorporation.</p><p>(v) We show that EROS can increase the abundance of NOX1, gp91<italic>phox</italic> and NOX4 in co-transfection assays and that it can directly bind NOX2, NOX3 and NOX4 in yeast-2-hybrid assays. For NOX2, we utilise two different yeast two hybrid platforms. This contrasts with its inability to augment the expression of NOX5 or p22<italic>phox</italic> or bind them in yeast-2-hybrid. It suggests that EROS likely binds a conserved motif in NOX proteins that depend on p22<italic>phox</italic> for stability.</p><p>(vi) Despite the ability to bind NOX4 and increase its abundance, EROS does not control NOX4 expression. We extended our previous work to show no effect on the abundance of NOX4 in either heart or kidney in EROS knockout mice. Given our findings above, this does not rule out the possibility of EROS regulating NOX4 in <bold>some</bold> contexts. However, NOX4 expression is unaffected by EROS deficiency in those organs in which NOX4 is most highly expressed. The same is true of NOX1. While we cannot rule out scenarios in which EROS might regulate its expression, but it does not do so in the colon.</p><p>We also make new insights into the biology of the control of P2X7 expression by EROS, in addition to our work on human iPS-derived macrophages.</p><p>(vii) We have demonstrated immunoprecipitation of native P2X7 by EROS in both mass spectrometry and by western blot in a physiologically relevant cell type, the RAW264.7 macrophage. In addition, by performing an immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry interactome, we have shown that this is a strong, high-confidence interaction when taking an unbiased approach and compared with all other proteins in the proteome.</p><p>(viii) We have extended the findings to show a modest effect on P2X1 but no effect on P2X4, again contextualising the interaction with P2X7.</p><p>(ix) We have shown that EROS physiologically regulates P2X7 expression. Increased EROS expression leads to increased P2X7 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages.</p><p>(x) We have shown clear effects in eight primary cell types of the mouse. Several splice variants exist in different tissues and it is important to clarify whether EROS has cell type specific effects on P2X7 expression.</p><p>(xi) A particular strength of our study is that we show marked in vivo sequelae of the lack of P2X7. EROS deficiency leads to profound susceptibility to bacterial infection but protects mice from infection with influenza A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify the roles of EROS in Nox1 and Nox4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included yeast-2-hybrid analysis of the association of EROS with NOX4, relative to NOX5 and p22<italic>phox</italic> and further western blot experiments of NOX1 expression in the colon and NOX4 expression in kidney and heart from EROS knockout mice in Figure 2 figure supplement 1H-I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 1 The lower EROS expression when gp91phox is expressed warrants a comment. Figure 1 G. Please explain what fold change represents. From F, zero time expression appears much more than the 1.5 fold higher shown in G for the EROS-expressing cells. This needs explaining. With the very high error bars (presumably for the EROS sample although this is not clear) overlapping zero I find it hard to conclude anything from this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We used transient transfection of gp91<italic>phox</italic> and EROS constructs for the experiments in HEK293, and NIH3T3. As such, the expression level of each construct is variable depending on the transfection efficiency. However, while the 58kDa form of gp91<italic>phox</italic> is reproducibly increased by EROS, EROS expression is not consistently lowered by gp91<italic>phox</italic> in all our experiments (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D for example). Moreover, absence of gp91<italic>phox</italic> does not impact on EROS expression in primary bone marrow derived macrophage deficient in gp91<italic>phox</italic> (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1F). Hence, the lower EROS expression when gp91<italic>phox</italic> is expressed, in some experiments, is likely due to the transient transfection than anything else.</p><p>Figure 1: The information on fold change has now been added to the figure legend. Presumably the reviewer meant Figure G left panel (not F, which is the p22<italic>phox</italic> western blot). The image in G (left panel) is a representative image of 4 different transfection experiments and the 1.5-fold change in EROS-expressing cells observed in G (right panel) is the mean fold change obtained from these 4 experiments. The errors bars reflect the variability of the transient transfection efficiency when expressing gp91<italic>phox</italic> and EROS vectors. However, the presence of EROS reproducibly reduces the rate of gp91<italic>phox</italic> degradation across these various experiments. We agree, the error bars are high but unfortunately it is the limitation of the approach which is why we also used the PLB985 model and lentivirus transduction system to corroborate our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. P 9 line 9 states that Figure 1H shows that cycloheximide increases expression. Yet it appears from the legend that cycloheximide is present in all samples and it is EROS that increases expression. Please clarify this anomaly.</p></disp-quote><p>The text in Page 9 has been amended to state the role of EROS in increasing gp91<italic>phox</italic> expression as seen in Figure 1H. We apologise if this was unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 3A&amp;B and p12 1st para. The identification of OST as a binding partner is interesting and a significant novel finding.

Also please make it clearer which of the proteins in B were identified and the relevance of showing all the steps in the pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clearly stated in the Results section that we performed 4 independent biological replicate FLAG purifications from EROS-FLAG cells and 4 replicates from untagged cells as negative controls in order to control the selectivity of the EROS-FLAG pulldown. We have also included details on how the SAINTexpress algorithm (Teo et al., J Proteomics 2014, PMID: 24513533) was used to assign probabilities of EROS-specificity to the proteins identified in EROS-FLAG affinity purification-mass spectrometry experiments. SAINTexpress is a widely used algorithm in the AP-MS field that calculates a statistical model based on the abundance of proteins in bait versus control purifications to derive a confidence measure (SAINT Probability score) of a protein being specifically enriched in bait purifications. The algorithm developers suggest applying a score cut-off between 0.7-0.9. In this study we chose to be very stringent and applied a threshold of 0.9, which resulted in a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of less than 1%.</p><p>We apologise that what we displayed in Figure 3A and 3B was unclear. In Figure 3A, each blue or red spot is one of the 856 proteins identified in any one of the FLAG affinity purifications, represented by its average abundance across EROS-FLAG purifications (by proxy number of peptide spectrum matches) and its SAINT probability score (i.e., measure of EROS-specificity – the higher, the better). We chose to mark in red some of the proteins that were of particular relevance to the study, so that the reader could quickly judge visually their abundance and specificity in relation to all other identified proteins. We would like to point out that Figure 3B is not showing a pathway, although the shape of the network might induce one to believe so. In Figure 3B we have displayed all 59 proteins that passed the SP&gt;=0.9 threshold, and the physical interactions between them that have been reported in the literature (from STRING database). We have now modified the Figure 3 legend to clarify these points. The table of the 59 identified proteins have been provided as a Source Data as per the journal request but not as a proper figure or table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The figure shows that there is no significant induction of ER-stress, measured by BiP, when these constructs are transfected. Indeed, the level of BiP in HEK293 cells transfected with mouse GFP-tagged gp91<italic>phox</italic>, pEGFP-N2-STT3A, pmRFP-N2-EROS, human mRFP-tagged gp91<italic>phox</italic>, mouse GFP-tagged P2X7 was comparable to the level seen in untransfected cells and <italic>STT3B</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Given that both are involved in the pathology of influenza A in such models, one would predict that EROS is an important regulator of both pathways in vivo<italic>,</italic> then EROS knockout mice should be protected and indeed, they are. This demonstrates an important aspect of EROS physiology and also highlights that EROS inhibition may be a potential therapeutic avenue in several viral pneumonia. The exact cellular mechanisms underlaying the protection of EROS knockout mice are likely a composite of inhibition of the two pathways. Given that this involves effects on several cell types in both innate and adaptive immune systems, dissecting the exact mechanisms would represent an entire separate study and is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We have however discussed the contributions of the two pathways in our revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The Y2H experiment from Figure 2G does not appear very strong. If the authors could provide a better example or clarify the relevance of this experimental result, this would strengthen the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated the experiment through our work with Hybrigenics. These data were generated using the same protocol as that which showed the original interaction. In fact, the repeat experiment demonstrated the interaction even more clearly, thus providing a better example for Figure 2G. We also used a different yeast 2 hybrid protocol as described in Luck et al., (Nature 2020; PMID: 32296183) through a collaboration with Kerstin Spirohn and Michael Calderwood (Dana Faber Cancer Institute). This approach also demonstrated an interaction between EROS and gp91<italic>phox</italic> and also showed that EROS could bind NOX3 and NOX4 though not NOX5 or p22<italic>phox</italic>. We have therefore confirmed the direct interaction between EROS and gp91<italic>phox</italic> by yeast two hybrid, added important negative findings (no interaction with p22<italic>phox</italic> or NOX5) and new positive data (interactions with NOX4 and NOX3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

It remains unclear if reduced mortality is observed due to reduced adverse inflammatory signalling or if lack of Nox2 and inflammasome activity affects the virus burden.</p><p>Also, how does the EROS knockout mouse compare to gp91phox knockout or P2X7 inhibition alone? This could be discussed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the Essential revision section above, we have addressed the missing details on the influenza experiments and added a new discussion paragraph:</p><p>“A particular strength of our study is that we show marked in vivo sequelae of the lack of P2X7. EROS deficiency leads to profound susceptibility to bacterial infection but protects mice from infection with influenza A. This is likely to reflect the fact that mice that are (i) deficient in gp91<italic>phox</italic> (ii) deficient in P2X7 (iii) treated with P2X7 inhibitors have improved outcomes following infection with influenza A and raises intriguing questions about the physiological role of EROS. Snelgrove <italic>et al.</italic> showed that gp91<italic>phox</italic> deficiency improved outcomes in influenza A. gp91<italic>phox</italic> knockout mice exhibited a reduced influenza titre in the lung parenchyma. Inflammatory infiltrate into the lung parenchyma was markedly reduced and lung function significantly improved (Snelgrove et al., 2006). To <italic>et al.</italic> then showed that the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is activated by single stranded RNA and DNA viruses in endocytic compartments. This causes endosomal hydrogen peroxide generation, which suppresses antiviral and humoral signalling networks via modification of a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys98) on Toll-like receptor-7. In this study, targeted inhibition of endosomal reactive oxygen species production using cholestanol-conjugated gp91dsTAT (Cgp91ds-TAT) abrogates influenza A virus pathogenicity (To et al., 2017). This group went on to explore infection with a more pathogenic influenza A strain, PR8. Using the same specific inhibitor. Cgp91ds-TAT reduced airway inflammation, including neutrophil influx and alveolitis and enhanced the clearance of lung viral mRNA following PR8 infection (To et al., 2019). This group has also shown that NOX1 (Selemidis et al., 2013) and NOX4 (Hendricks et al., 2022) can drive pathogenic inflammation in influenza A, emphasising the importance of clarifying the roles of EROS in control of expression of these proteins.</p><p>In studies on P2X7, Rosli <italic>et al.</italic> showed that mice infected with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of influenza A HKx31 had improved outcomes if they were treated with a P2X7 inhibitor at day 3 post infection and every two days thereafter. Survival was also improved even if the inhibitor is given on day 7 post infection following a lethal dose of the mouse adapted PR8. This was associated with reduced cellular infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but viral titres were not measured (Rosli et al., 2019). Leyva-Grado <italic>et al.</italic> examined influenza A infection in P2X7 knockout mice. They infected mice with both influenza A/Puerto Rico/08/1934 virus and influenza A/Netherlands/604/2009 H1N1pdm virus. They showed that P2X7 receptor deficiency led to improved survival after infection with both viruses with less weight loss (Leyva-Grado et al., 2017). Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was impaired and there were fewer cellular hallmarks of severe infection such as infiltration of neutrophils and depletion of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages. It is worth noting that the P2X7 knockout strain used in this study was the Pfizer strain in which some splice variants of P2X7 are still expressed (Bartlett et al., 2014). Hence, the dual loss of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and P2X7 in EROS knockout mice likely confers protection from IAV infection. By reducing the expression of both NOX2 and P2X7, EROS regulates two pathways that may be detrimental in influenza A and we speculate that EROS may physiologically act as a rheostat controlling certain types of immune response.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2D should state that succinyl acetone was added.</p></disp-quote><p>This detail has now been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
