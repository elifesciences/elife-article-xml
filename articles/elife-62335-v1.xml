In particular, lowering the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio can improve lifespan. This has been interpreted as a direct effect of these macronutrients on physiology. Using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we show that the role of protein and carbohydrate on lifespan is indirect, acting by altering the partitioning of limiting amounts of dietary sterols between reproduction and lifespan. Shorter lifespans in flies fed on high protein: carbohydrate diets can be rescued by supplementing their food with cholesterol. Not only does this fundamentally alter the way we interpret the mechanisms of lifespan extension by dietary restriction, these data highlight the important principle that life histories can be affected by nutrient-dependent trade-offs that are indirect and independent of the nutrients (often macronutrients) that are the focus of study. This brings us closer to understanding the mechanistic basis of dietary restriction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>For the past fifteen years, animal studies have consistently shown that a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (‘carbs’) diet can extend the lifespan of many organisms, but at the cost of the number of offspring an individual can produce. Yet, it is still unclear what the best dietary balance is, and how these effects arise. One potential explanation could be that reproduction damages the body: low levels of proteins would therefore prolong life by lowering the reproductive output.</p><p>Here, Zanco et al. examined the possibility that protein intake in fruit flies could instead be acting indirectly by changing the levels of a fat-like molecule called cholesterol, which is used to maintain the body and to support reproduction.</p><p>To test this idea, groups of fruit flies were fed high levels of proteins. This led to increased reproduction rates, in turn depleting the mothers’ reserves of cholesterol. Without enough of the molecule in their diet, the insects were less able to maintain their bodies, which reduced their lifespan. When Zanco et al. added cholesterol to a high-protein diet, the flies lived for the normal length of time. Longer lifespan therefore did not require restriction of the diet or any of its components. In fact, the flies that lived the longest ate protein rich diets, and reproduced the most.</p><p>This study helps to better understand why changes in diet can influence how long an organism lives for, highlighting that the abundance of certain key molecules may be more important than restricting the levels of proteins, carbs or calories actually consumed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>sterols</kwd><kwd>dietary restriction</kwd><kwd>micronutrients</kwd><kwd>macronutrients</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT150100237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piper</surname><given-names>Matthew DW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1182330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piper</surname><given-names>Matthew DW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sgrò</surname><given-names>Carla M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001779</institution-id><institution>Monash University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sgrò</surname><given-names>Carla M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT170100259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mirth</surname><given-names>Christen K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Micronutrients, not macronutrients, regulate lifespan.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dietary restriction, also called calorie restriction, is a moderate reduction in food intake that extends healthy lifespan across a broad range of taxa, ﻿from yeast to primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman and Partridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCay et al., 1935</xref>). The generality of this observation has inspired confidence that the health benefits of dietary restriction might also be employed to improve human ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campisi et al., 2019</xref>). In an attempt to harness its benefits, a great deal of current research is focused on discovering the nutritional components and the molecular mechanisms that underpin the lifespan benefits of dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our current understanding of how diet modifies lifespan has grown out of evolutionary theory and experiments using model organisms. The most prominent theoretical explanation has been the disposable soma theory, which employs resource-based trade-offs to explain how dietary restriction can benefit lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkwood, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shanley and Kirkwood, 2000</xref>). This theory postulates that organisms will maximise fitness by strategically partitioning limiting dietary energy either to reproduction or somatic maintenance, the latter determining lifespan. This means that longer lifespan is inevitably coupled with reduced reproduction because both traits compete for the same limiting resource.</p><p>Recent experimental work across a broad range of taxa has challenged the disposable soma theory by demonstrating that reproduction and lifespan respond predominantly to the balance of dietary macronutrients, not the overall energy content of the diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grandison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solon-Biet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Regan et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, high protein, low carbohydrate diets are consistently associated with high reproduction and short lifespan, while low-protein, high-carbohydrate diets are associated with longer lifespan and lower levels of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson et al., 2017</xref>). These data indicate that lifespan and reproduction are not in competition for limiting energy derived from the diet, but instead are optimised at different dietary protein: carbohydrate ratios. In response to these findings, an enormous effort is now focused on uncovering how macronutrient rebalancing, in particular protein dilution, acts to improve lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blagosklonny, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blagosklonny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moatt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Regan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Speakman, 2020</xref>). Accumulating evidence indicates that the effect is mediated by reducing signalling through the amino acid sensitive Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway to enhance cellular proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raubenheimer and Simpson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sabatini, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although detrimental for lifespan, relatively high protein, low carbohydrate diets are beneficial for female reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solon-Biet et al., 2015</xref>). We have studied this closely in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where the principle driver of egg production is dietary protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Min and Tatar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grandison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piper et al., 2017</xref>). Although protein is key, females must transfer dozens of nutrients into eggs for future embryo formation and not all of these components contribute to the flies’ decision to produce eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mirth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). This means that high protein diets might drive mothers to produce eggs at a faster rate than they can support if the diet contains insufficient levels of the other components that are required to make eggs. In this scenario, the macronutrients would have an indirect effect on lifespan by changing the availability of another limiting nutrient that is required for somatic maintenance. If true, this would move the focus of mechanistic studies away from the direct effects of protein, TOR, and proteostasis, towards some other component of nutritional physiology. Distinguishing between these possible causes of death is important since it would fundamentally change our understanding of the way diet alters lifespan. It also has the important knock-on effect that we could change the way we design diets for longer life. For instance, supplementing high protein diets with key limiting nutrients would be as beneficial as restricting dietary protein or treating with pharmacological suppressors of TOR.</p><p>Of the many studies that have examined the effects of dietary protein and carbohydrate on lifespan and reproduction in Drosophila, most have done so by varying dietary yeast and sugar proportions, where yeast is the flies’ natural source of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>). However, yeast also contains all of the flies’ other essential macro and micronutrients whose relative proportions can change, and thus possibly interact with protein and carbohydrates to dictate life-history outcomes. We have previously found that depriving adult female flies of a source of sterols, an essential micronutrient for insects, imposes a minor cost on reproduction, but a substantial (&gt;50%) cost to lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). These data indicate that yeast sterol levels may contribute to the effects on lifespan of protein and carbohydrate. To investigate the interactions between dietary protein, carbohydrate, and sterols systematically, we have used the design principles of the geometric framework for nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 1993</xref>) and a completely defined (holidic) diet that allows us to control the levels of each nutrient independently of all others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piper et al., 2017</xref>). These data point to an important role for sterols in determining Drosophila lifespan, which we verified to be relevant in two yeast-based media that are often used in Drosophila lifespan studies. This work is critical to identifying how diet modifies lifespan at the molecular level, and highlights a new way to think about diet design to improve healthy ageing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein: carbohydrate ratio influences lifespan and reproduction</title><p>To examine the interactive effects of dietary protein, carbohydrate, and cholesterol on Drosophila lifespan and fecundity, we used our completely defined (holidic) diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piper et al., 2014</xref>) to manipulate each nutrient independently of all others.

Specifically, egg production showed a linear, positive correlation with dietary protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), while lifespan showed a peak at intermediate protein (66 d median at 10.7 g/l), and fell away at both higher (49 d median at 33.1 g/l) and lower (43 d median at 5.2 g/l) concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Thus, as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piper et al., 2017</xref>), balancing the dietary protein and carbohydrate concentrations can reveal a single dietary optimum for both traits, showing that lifespan shortening is not necessarily caused by high egg laying alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cholesterol interacts with protein and carbohydrate to modify lifespan and reproduction</title><p>Most dietary restriction studies on Drosophila vary dietary protein by modifying the yeast levels in food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman and Partridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>).

At 0 g/l cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) increasing protein concentration in the diet decreased lifespan. However, at 0.15 g/l cholesterol, the shape of the response changed such that only the highest protein concentration decreased lifespan (35 d median; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) when compared with intermediate (9.7 g/l; 55 d median) and low-protein (4.7 g/l; 52 d median) diets. At 0.3 g/l of cholesterol, lifespan was highest on the diet with intermediate protein concentration (66d median) and flies on the high protein diet were longer lived (49 d median) than the flies on the lowest protein diet (43 d median). Finally, increasing cholesterol from 0.3 g/l to 0.6 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>) did not change the way that lifespan responded to protein. Thus, lowering dietary cholesterol was detrimental for lifespan and it intensified the negative effects of increasing dietary protein concentrations.</p><p>Across the same set of diets, we observed a generally beneficial effect on egg laying of increasing dietary protein and cholesterol, and both had diminishing benefits as their concentrations increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Cholesterol also modified the way egg laying was affected by dietary protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Increasing cholesterol from 0 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) to 0.15 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) amplified the positive effect on egg laying of increasing dietary protein. Further increasing cholesterol to 0.3 g/l had an additional benefit for egg laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), but only for flies on the highest protein diet (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), while increasing cholesterol even further, to 0.6 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), did not change egg laying from that seen on 0.3 g/l. Thus, the response of egg laying to increasing protein was only compromised when cholesterol was completely removed from the diet, or when cholesterol was low (0.15 g/l) and protein was high (30 g/l) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data show that reducing cholesterol had negative effects on both lifespan and egg laying, and that these negative effects became more pronounced with increasing dietary protein. Furthermore, the negative interaction between lowering cholesterol and increasing protein was more severe and occurred at a lower protein concentration for lifespan than it did for egg laying.</p><p>Next, we looked to see if changing dietary cholesterol modified the responses of lifespan and egg laying to variation in carbohydrate concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d,f,h</xref> - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c and f</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary files 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">6</xref>). At 0 g/l cholesterol, lifespan was generally short (31d median) but positively affected by increasing dietary carbohydrate (up to 40 d median) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). As dietary cholesterol was increased to 0.15 g/l, lifespan on all diets was higher and the positive effect of increasing carbohydrate was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). However, when cholesterol reached 0.3 g/l, the flies were constantly long-lived, and lifespan was unaffected by dietary carbohydrate level (66 d median) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). This pattern was not changed by increasing cholesterol further to 0.6 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Thus, each of our dietary carbohydrate levels could support maximal fly lifespan, but the lower carbohydrate diets were more susceptible to the detrimental effects of dietary cholesterol dilution.</p><p>Increasing dietary carbohydrate had a generally negative impact on egg laying, and this effect was modified by the benefits of increasing dietary cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Without any cholesterol in the food, egg laying was consistently low and was negatively affected by increasing dietary carbohydrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This negative effect of carbohydrate on egg laying became stronger as cholesterol was increased to 0.15 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and 0.3 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), with no further change as cholesterol increased from 0.3 g/l to 0.6 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). This increasingly negative relationship between carbohydrate and egg laying was caused because increasing cholesterol benefited egg laying more at lower dietary carbohydrate levels – the opposite of what we observed for lifespan.</p><p>Thus, once again fly lifespan and egg laying worsened as cholesterol was diluted, but unlike its negative interaction with <italic>increasing</italic> dietary protein, the detrimental effects of lowering cholesterol became stronger as carbohydrate levels <italic>decreased</italic>. This indicates that the negative impact of lowering cholesterol is not a specific interaction with either high protein or low carbohydrate levels in the diet. We also found that the benefits of cholesterol addition were not related to the caloric content of the diet because cholesterol improved fecundity and extended lifespan of flies on almost all diets, including those with the lowest, intermediate, and highest caloric densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Instead, lowering cholesterol produces worse outcomes as the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio increases. This is the same change in macronutrient balance that promotes increasing egg laying.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increasing the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio drives increasing reproduction and makes fly lifespan susceptible to dietary cholesterol dilution</title><p>We saw that flies produce more eggs in response to increasing dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio and that these positive effects persist even as dietary cholesterol falls to a level that cannot fully support lifespan (less than 0.3 g/l cholesterol). Thus, the protein: carbohydrate ratio appears to take precedence over dietary sterol levels in the decision to commit to reproduction. If this is the case, we expect to see a positive relationship between the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio and egg laying across all levels of dietary cholesterol. This is indeed what we found, although the positive relationship was modified by cholesterol level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,c,e,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), starting with a weak positive effect on 0 g/l cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and becoming increasingly positive as cholesterol was increased to 0.15 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and 0.3 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

Since increasing protein: carbohydrate levels drove increasing egg laying, even when the adults were completely deprived of sterols, it is possible that females are committing sterols to egg production at a rate faster than they can replenish it from the diet. If true, mothers on low cholesterol diets would become shorter lived as egg laying increases, but when cholesterol is sufficient, the relationship between egg production and lifespan should become less negative. To test this, we plotted egg laying against lifespan for all replicates across all diets. This showed that egg laying was a significant predictor of lifespan, and that this relationship was modified by dietary cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,d,f,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). When the data are grouped by dietary cholesterol level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we see that when cholesterol was at 0 g/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), there was a negative relationship between egg laying and lifespan, but as the cholesterol level increased, the correlation flattened, such that the slope was no longer negative for each level of cholesterol supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,f,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).</p><p>Thus, when dietary cholesterol was insufficient, increasing dietary protein: carbohydrate drove higher egg laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and this predicted lifespan shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) – a scenario that exemplifies the negative relationship between reproduction and lifespan in response to increasing protein: carbohydrate levels that is regularly reported in the dietary restriction literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solon-Biet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simpson et al., 2017</xref>). However, when cholesterol was increased, the negative relationship was reduced such that egg laying was either completely independent of lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) or became slightly positively correlated, indicating that the dietary conditions, which promote egg laying, are the same as those that promote longer lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f,h</xref>).

Because TOR activity increases with dietary protein levels, it has been implicated as mediating the detrimental effects on lifespan of high protein diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). This is supported by the fact that rapamycin, a pharmacological suppressor of TOR, has been shown to extend lifespan across numerous species, including Drosophila where it also suppresses egg production across different caloric densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schinaman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scialò et al., 2015</xref>). If sterol limitation is the reason why high egg production on high protein: carbohydrate diets causes reduced lifespan, rapamycin might extend lifespan because it reduces egg production and therefore rescues females from sterol depletion.

However, most laboratories maintain fly populations on a diet that consists of yeast and sugar as well as variable numbers of other ingredients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piper, 2017</xref>). Although the relative concentration of each nutrient in yeast is more constrained than on our synthetic diet, systematic studies have shown that the type and commercial source of yeast can have significant effects on overall dietary composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lesperance and Broderick, 2020</xref>) and the relationship between lifespan and egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass et al., 2007</xref>).

Thus, similar to what we demonstrated on the synthetic diet, the shortening of fly lifespan when increasing the yeast content (protein: carbohydrate ratio) in lab foods may be caused by an insufficiency of dietary sterols.</p><p>We tested the effects of supplementing cholesterol into two sugar/yeast recipes that have been commonly used to study the effects of dietary restriction on lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katewa et al., 2016</xref>).

Adding 0.3 g/l cholesterol to both the low yeast (dietary restriction) and high yeast foods of both yeast types had a significant positive effect on lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>) and egg laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,d</xref>) when compared to diets without cholesterol supplementation. The magnitude of this benefit to lifespan was greater for flies on the high yeast foods than on the low yeast foods, meaning that cholesterol supplementation narrowed the difference between the dietary restriction vs high yeast diet from 9 to 4% for flies on the autolysed yeast diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and from 81 to 25% lifespan extension for flies on the yeast extract diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). We note that even with cholesterol supplementation, the flies on the high yeast diet were still significantly shorter lived than those on the cholesterol supplemented low yeast food.

However, our data implicate a fundamentally different mechanism in which the macronutrients act indirectly, by manipulating sterol availability, which then modifies lifespan. Specifically, diets with high protein: carbohydrate ratios decrease lifespan by causing mothers to overinvest limiting sterols into egg production. Thus, although the macronutrients set egg laying rates, it is actually the sterols that determine lifespan due to a trade-off with reproduction. The corollary of this finding is that the lifespan of flies on high protein: carbohydrate diets can be extended by increasing the supply of cholesterol. This approach is the opposite of, but complementary to, the already recognised strategies to extend lifespan by dietary restriction, which reduce maternal investment into reproduction by decreasing the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>) or by treating the animals with rapamycin that suppresses TOR and reduces reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). It is also consistent with our recent work that showed non-reproducing adult males and genetically sterile females suffer little to no lifespan cost when sterol deprived, which is presumably because they conserve sterols which would otherwise be depleted by reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>High protein diets promote egg production, driving a lethal micronutrient deficiency</title><p>﻿In the lab, flies can be successfully reared and maintained on a mixture of just sugar and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pearl and Parker, 1921</xref>). This diet is thought to reflect their natural diet of rotting fruit and the microbial community – principally the yeasts – that cause the fruit to decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piper, 2017</xref>). Yeast contains all of the nutrients that flies require, including protein (~45%), carbohydrate (~40%), a small amount of fat (~7%), nucleic acids (~7%), and micronutrients, such as sterols, metal ions and vitamins, which are essential for flies. Drosophila rely heavily on protein from yeast, as well as carbohydrate from both yeast and plant sources, to guide their feeding behaviour. They select amongst foods containing the appropriate protein and carbohydrate concentrations to enhance their fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Many of the other nutrients from their diet, including sterols, do not affect feeding behaviour, presumably because they are normally acquired in adequate quantities as part of a diet that is sufficient in macronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Walker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Münch et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While the proportion of protein and carbohydrate in yeast remains relatively constant across growth conditions, the abundance of sterols can vary over a 10-fold range in response to changes in oxygen availability, which is essential for sterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Starr and Parks, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilson and McLeod, 1976</xref>). Thus, because fly feeding behaviour and egg production are almost entirely shaped by the macronutrients, fly lifespan is susceptible to reductions in the sterol: protein content of dietary yeast. Our data indicate that this is because protein drives sterols to be preferentially partitioned towards reproduction at the expense of maintaining the adult soma. While we have found this to be the case for flies feeding on lab based foods, it is also reasonable to expect it for flies feeding on rotting fruit, where microbial growth is largely fermentative (driven by high sugar levels and limiting oxygen), producing ethanol and short chain acids to which Drosophila has evolved a healthy tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geer et al., 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Extending fly lifespan by dietary restriction involves an indirect trade-off</title><p>There have been several theoretical attempts to describe the mechanistic basis for the lifespan benefits of dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blagosklonny, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blagosklonny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirkwood and Rose, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moatt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Regan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Speakman, 2020</xref>). In particular, the disposable soma theory proposes that organisms will strategically reallocate nutrients towards somatic maintenance at the cost of reproduction when nutrients are scarce and that this enhances lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirkwood and Rose, 1991</xref>). Our data indicate that this trade-off can exist for flies feeding on yeast, but only when dietary sterols are limiting. However, when dietary sterols are not limiting, this trade-off does not need to exist and a single nutritional optimum for both lifespan and reproduction can be found. Thus, the macronutrient balance that drives higher egg laying does not necessarily inflict a direct cost on lifespan.</p><p>In mechanistic work, the increased lifespan under dietary restriction has been attributed to the benefits of reduced dietary protein, which enhances proteome maintenance via reduced TOR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Partridge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kapahi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). Interestingly, lysosomal cholesterol levels have recently been found to be a potent modifier of mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castellano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), which raises the possibility that both protein depletion and cholesterol addition modify ageing by reducing TOR signalling. However, the published data shows that cholesterol is an activator of TOR and cholesterol depletion inhibits its activity. Thus, we expect adding cholesterol to the diet would not reduce TOR signalling, but instead optimise conditions for maximal TOR signalling – especially on the high protein: carbohydrate diets in which we find cholesterol addition to be most effective for prolonging lifespan. These data indicate, therefore, that long life is possible when TOR signalling is high as long as the flies have sufficient sterols in their diets. Alternatively, longevity can still be assured under sterol-limiting conditions by reducing the cost of reproduction, either by reducing dietary protein, by adding rapamycin which suppresses reproduction or by making flies infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). These data indicate that longevity assurance in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is not the result of enhanced proteostasis triggered by lowered TOR, but is instead, a side effect of avoiding sterol depletion caused by an over-investment in egg production.</p><p>Rapamycin is known to extend the lifespan of various organisms including <italic>C. elegans</italic>, yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kapahi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Powers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>). Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot synthesise its own sterols, rapamycin might increase lifespan by preventing sterol depletion in a manner similar to what we have observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, sterols may not be lifespan limiting in other organisms such as yeast and mammals that have the ability to synthesise their own sterols. One explanation is that the administration of rapamycin prevents other micronutrient deficiencies caused by over-investment in growth and/or reproduction in response to high levels of dietary protein. For instance, rodents will export calcium from their own bones and teeth to meet the demands of pregnancy and lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller and Bowman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozbek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Speakman, 2008</xref>). For this reason, it would be interesting to see if providing additional micronutrients to the diets of ad libitum-fed mice can mimic the benefits of dietary restriction, similar to what we see for sterol supplementation in flies.</p><p>Another possibility is that rapamycin rescues animals from the effects of protein toxicity, which can occur at concentrations of protein higher than what we used in this study. In our experiments, we limit the upper range of dietary protein concentrations so as not to exceed those that are beneficial to reproduction. This practice is informed by the desire to study how dietary restriction enhances somatic maintenance to extend life in already healthy individuals, rather than studying the reduced risk of dying that occurs when flies are prevented from over-consuming. To test this, it would be interesting to study the effects of rapamycin addition over a broader range of protein concentrations than what we have used. If true, this has the important implication that rapamycin, and indeed different diet compositions, may prolong animal lifespan by more than one molecular mechanism. These are important implications to explore since the majority of work studying ageing in lab organisms is based on the assumption that the mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved, in the hope that they will benefit humans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data show that the detrimental effects of a high protein: carbohydrate diet on lifespan in female <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are, to a significant extent, driven by an indirect nutrient trade-off, in which the macronutrients drive maternal sterol depletion by enhancing egg laying. This is a fundamentally different mechanism from the predominant view that ﻿reducing protein: carbohydrate balance in diets improves lifespan by a direct action to reduce TOR signalling and enhance proteostasis. Because of our discovery, we show that the shortened lifespan of flies on a high protein: carbohydrate diet can be improved by supplementing their diet with cholesterol, as well as by reducing egg production by lowering the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio or by administering rapamycin. Further work is now needed to discover the mechanisms through which cholesterol works to modify lifespan in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and the role of other important micronutrients in healthy ageing across taxa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Rapamycin (Sirolimus)</td><td>Jomar Life Research</td><td>S1039</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>All experiments were conducted using a wild type <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> strain called Dahomey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mair et al., 2005</xref>).These flies have been maintained in large numbers with overlapping generations to maintain genetic diversity. Upon removal from their population cages, flies were reared for two generations at a controlled density before use in experiments, to control for possible parental effects. Eggs for age-synchronised flies were collected over 18 hr, and the resulting adult flies emerged during a 12 hr window. They were then allowed to mate for 48 hr before being anaesthetised with CO<sub>2</sub>, at which point females were separated and allocated into experimental vials.

These diets also made up a three-diet series of protein only dilution, and a three-diet series of carbohydrate only dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

Omitting this point did not modify the significance of any of the statistical analyses or change any conclusions. For each experimental vial the median lifespan and mean number of eggs laid were obtained prior to analysis. Linear mixed effect models were used to analyse all data obtained using the holidic media. For the analysis of data obtained using the holidic media, a model reduction was performed by stepwise removal of the most complex non-significant term until any further removal significantly reduced the model fit. Log rank tests were used to compare the survival curves in the rapamycin experiment and yeast based dietary experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Dario Riccardo Valenzano as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Zanco et al. study how dietary sterols affect the fly responses to varying carbohydrate:protein (c:p) ratios. They show that c:p ratios affect female fly lifespan and fecundity depending on limiting dietary sterols. While the findings are mostly relevant to studies on dietary restriction in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the findings do identify a caveat in our understanding of TOR-mediated longevity effects.</p><p>All three reviewers acknowledge the novelty and relevance of this work. I congratulate the authors for a nicely conceived and written work, which convincingly shows the key role of dietary sterols as limiting tradeoff/coupling units between reproduction and somatic maintenance when p:c ratios increase. This work also sheds light on how rapamycin impacts female fly lifespan on low sterol diet and high p:c ratios by indirectly preventing somatic sterol depletion via suppression of reproduction.</p><p>Title: The authors may consider changing the title to specify that dietary sterols are important for female flies responses to dietary restrictions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should address or at least extensively discuss how TOR signaling actually changes with diet and cholesterol, and whether that correlates with lifespan; for instance, do dTOR or dS6K mutant flies respond the same way to high protein/cholesterol diets?</p><p>2) The authors should discuss the following: a) Does lifespan and fecundity vary by calorie intake/energy density and not just P:C ratio? b) Could the lesson here be that cholesterol promotes survival on low calorie diets but not high calorie diets?</p><p>c) Maybe rapamycin can only promote longevity if the energy density/calorie consumption is below some threshold?</p><p>3) A discussion of how the documented effects of Rapamycin and Tor signaling in yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals relates to what is observed here is critical. The data imply that if egg production is shut down, Rapamycin won't have a longevity effect at all. It is unclear how to interpret that in relation to the effects in other organisms, where egg production is a much less energy / nutrient consuming proposition or where no eggs are produced (as in yeast).</p><p>4) To make the paper more accessible to readers not working with flies and highlight the more broadly relevant findings, Figures 2/3 and 4/5 could be combined into one or two figures altogether.</p><p>5) In the graphs of Figures 1-3, the authors need to clarify which data points are related to the lifespan axes and which ones to the egg production axes.

For cholesterol to be working through TOR to extend lifespan, we would expect that cholesterol addition should suppress TOR in a high protein environment. Current research indicates that this is not the case, and in fact, cholesterol has been recently identified as an up regulator of TOR. This has been discussed in –the subsection “Extending fly lifespan by dietary restriction involves an indirect trade-off”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should discuss the following: a) Does lifespan and fecundity vary by calorie intake/energy density and not just P:C ratio? b) Could the lesson here be that cholesterol promotes survival on low calorie diets but not high calorie diets? c) Maybe rapamycin can only promote longevity if the energy density/calorie consumption is below some threshold?</p></disp-quote><p>a) We have performed additional analyses which show that dietary calorie content does not have a significant effect on lifespan or egg production, but instead, these are explained by the P:C ratio and cholesterol contents. This has now been addressed in the Results section and two tables with details of the relevant statistics as well as a new supplementary figure have been added (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary files 3 and 4).</p><p>b) We have also included data to show that the benefits of cholesterol addition to egg laying and lifespan were not restricted to any pattern when considered across levels of dietary caloric density. This has now been addressed in the Results section and one supplementary figure has been added (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>c) Rapamycin has already been shown to extend <italic>Drosophila</italic> lifespan across calorie densities – we now reference these data (subsection “Extending fly lifespan by dietary restriction involves an indirect trade-off”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A discussion of how the documented effects of Rapamycin and Tor signaling in yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals relates to what is observed here is critical.

We have now clarified that the role of cholesterol and/or other micronutrients, and their role in mediating lifespan outcomes will be context specific. In particular, we have discussed how rapamycin may extend the lifespan of other organisms by suppressing growth/reproduction in yeast and mammals. We have also highlighted that rapamycin may rescue animals from the effects of protein toxicity, not just micronutrient deficiencies (subsection “Extending fly lifespan by dietary restriction involves an indirect trade-off”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To make the paper more accessible to readers not working with flies and highlight the more broadly relevant findings, Figures 2/3 and 4/5 could be combined into one or two figures altogether.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed and these four figures have now been condensed into two (Figures 2 and 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the graphs of Figures 1-3, the authors need to clarify which data points are related to the lifespan axes and which ones to the egg production axes.

Here we have specified that mammals, unlike insects can synthesise their own cholesterol and then followed on to explain how the broader principle of micronutrient depletion might be relevant to higher organisms.</p></body></sub-article></article>
