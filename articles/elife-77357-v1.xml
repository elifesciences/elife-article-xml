critical functions of uncharacterized genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, robust CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens are lacking for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are key regulators of many cellular processes, leaving many essential lncRNAs unidentified and uninvestigated. Integrating copy number, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data of &gt;800 cancer cell lines with CRISPR-derived co-essential pathways, our method recapitulates known essential lncRNAs and predicts proliferation/growth dependency of 289 poorly characterized lncRNAs. Analyzing lncRNA dependencies across 10 cancer types and their expression alteration by diverse growth inhibitors across cell types, we prioritize 30 high-confidence pan-cancer proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs.

These lncRNAs modulate G2 cell cycle-regulating genes within the FOXM1 transcriptional network, inducing a G2 arrest and inhibiting proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our results serve as a powerful resource for exploring lncRNA-mediated regulation of cellular fitness in cancer, circumventing current limitations in lncRNA research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer dependency</kwd><kwd>co-essential networks</kwd><kwd>long non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA177786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eischen</surname><given-names>Christine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA056036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eischen</surname><given-names>Christine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The discovery of uncharacterized lncRNAs that regulate cell proliferation/growth across cancer types, including two p53 regulated tumor suppressive lncRNAs, were identified through systematic analyses of multi-omics data and provides a computational framework resource to cancer researchers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sequencing data estimate the existence of &gt;1,00,000 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). lncRNAs are RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins, but have emerged as critical modulators of gene expression networks through diverse regulatory mechanisms, including regulation of RNA transcription, chromatin remodeling, and nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Statello et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the expression of a large fraction of the lncRNAs being altered in diseases, including cancer, the functions of only a very small fraction have been verified, and even fewer are known for their roles in regulating fundamental cancer Hallmark processes, such as cell proliferation/growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ning et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitt and Chang, 2016</xref>). Dysregulated cell proliferation/growth is at the heart of cancer, and, thus, identifying the genes and RNAs that regulate it is critical.</p><p>A key advance towards identifying essential proliferation/growth regulators was the development of RNA interference and genome-scale clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McFarland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>). These approaches were used for &gt;700 cancer cell lines and identified &gt;1800 pan-cancer proliferation/growth and/or survival-regulating essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>). Such loss-of-function screens for lncRNA have lagged significantly behind protein-coding genes and lack sufficient robustness. Only seven cell lines were screened for growth and/or survival modulating lncRNA loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2017a</xref>). In another study, CRISPR screening of keratinocytes determined nine lncRNAs that regulate its proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2020</xref>). Although lncRNAs are emerging as critical cell proliferation/growth regulators, a very limited number of screens that covered only a few cell lines has left many potentially essential lncRNAs unidentified and uninvestigated in cancer.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that lncRNAs are part of gene regulatory units/modules, where one or more lncRNAs regulate complex physiological processes, including those required in cancer, by modulating the expression of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitt and Chang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Statello et al., 2021</xref>). Over 5000 co-essential gene complexes/modules have been identified from genome-wide CRISPR screens of 485 cell lines of multiple different cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wainberg et al., 2021</xref>). The identified modules recapitulate diverse known pathways and protein complexes that have critical oncogenic functions during tumorigenesis. Since functionally related genes are highly enriched in co-essential modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wainberg et al., 2021</xref>), here we hypothesize that a statistically robust mapping of lncRNAs to genome-wide co-essential modules should enable unbiased predictions of proliferation/growth dependencies of uncharacterized lncRNAs and circumvent the limitations of lncRNAome-wide knockout/activation screens.</p><p>With the goal of mapping lncRNAs to co-essential modules systematically, we developed a large-scale data analysis framework. Our integrative computational framework consistently prioritizes known proliferation/growth inducers and suppressors as the top hits in both the evaluation and validation datasets. Additionally, we predict proliferation/growth dependencies of 289 previously uncharacterized lncRNAs. We experimentally validated transcriptional regulation and functions of top predicted proliferation/growth suppressor lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), whose increased expression correlates with favorable overall survival across cancer types. Our study significantly advances the ability to decode high-confidence critical lncRNAs upon which cancer cells are dependent for their growth and survival, accelerating further biological discovery of lncRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping lncRNAs to genome-wide co-essential modules reveals critical uncharacterized lncRNAs in cancer</title><p>We devised an approach based on a multivariate regression model, a classic statistical technique, to map the lncRNAome in genome-wide cancer cell proliferation/growth-regulating co-essential gene networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The positive or negative associations with a stringent significance cutoff indicate high confidence that these lncRNAs induce or suppress survival/growth, respectively.</p><p>We systematically mapped these 1049 lncRNAs to predefined genome-wide co-essential pathways/modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wainberg et al., 2021</xref>). To retain high-quality co-essential modules, we rejected syntenic ones (i.e., all genes within the module on the same chromosome) and selected only those that have higher (≥0.5) module density scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wainberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). As there is no report of the impact of these modules on cancer Hallmark processes, we reannotated their functions using Hallmark genesets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>) annotated pathways (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c and d</xref>). As expected, the co-essential modules were preferentially (p=2.06 × 10<sup>–4</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) enriched with proliferation/growth-regulating genesets (MYC targets V1 and V2, E2F targets, G2/M checkpoint, cell cycle, and mitotic spindle) compared to other genesets/pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Using two independent statistical tests (hypergeometric-based enrichment analysis and a thousand randomization test), we estimated whether an lncRNA regulates a module with higher confidence (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Both tests showed that the essential genes-linked lncRNAs have a greater association with proliferation/growth-regulating genesets/pathways compared to the other genesets/pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Among the 1049 lncRNAs, 1027 potentially regulate 78 proliferation/growth-linked co-essential modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). The modules in the network were positively or negatively impacted preferentially by the essential genes inducing or suppressing lncRNAs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Adding direction into the regulation provides power to distinguish proliferation/growth-suppressing lncRNAs from those that induce this cancer hallmark process.</p><p>The regulating lncRNAs were ranked for each co-essential module based on their average regression coefficients with the module members. These rankings summarize lncRNA-module association strength. With a meta-analysis using RobustRankAggreg (v1.1) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolde et al., 2012</xref>), we determined the lncRNAs that consistently rank higher as positive or negative regulators across the proliferation/growth-linked co-essential modules with statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; BH adjusted RobustRankAggreg p&lt;0.05; ‘Materials and methods’). The meta-analysis identified 123 and 252 lncRNAs that may induce or suppress cancer cell proliferation/growth by inducing or suppressing co-essential modules, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g and h</xref>). Using a comprehensive PubMed search with the keywords ‘lncRNA’ and ‘cancer,’ we determined that over 66% of the identified lncRNAs have not been studied in cancer. Another 10% of the lncRNAs are poorly characterized as they have only been mentioned in a single study, including those with exclusively prediction results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>). Collectively, our results reveal many unknown significant associations between lncRNA and cancer cell proliferation/growth-regulatory networks.</p><p>To validate our predictions, we evaluated lncRNAs from the small nucleolar RNA host gene (SNHG) family, previously recognized as biomarkers for cancer development and aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimta et al., 2020</xref>). Multiple members of the SNHG family of lncRNAs (e.g., <italic>SNHG1</italic>, <italic>SNHG3</italic>, <italic>SNHG5</italic>, <italic>SNHG7</italic>, <italic>SNHG13</italic>/<italic>DANCR</italic>, <italic>SNHG15</italic>, <italic>SNHG16,</italic> and <italic>SNHG17</italic>) have previously been shown to induce cancer cell proliferation/growth across different cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimta et al., 2020</xref>). Our meta-analysis predicted that these lncRNAs consistently positively associated with the co-essential modules, indicating elevated levels of these lncRNAs may induce cancer cell proliferation/growth. Furthermore, among our top predicted proliferation/growth inducers were the lncRNAs <italic>DLEU2, TMPO-AS1</italic>, and <italic>MIR17HG</italic>. <italic>DLEU2</italic> has been verified as a proliferation-inducing lncRNA in the vast majority of cancer types (13 out of 16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghafouri-Fard et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>TMPO-AS1</italic> has a role in tumorigenesis and progression and is overexpressed in 15 different cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). The lncRNA <italic>MIR17HG</italic> is the host gene of the miR-17–92 cluster, which consists of a group of onco-microRNAs that induce pan-cancer cell proliferation/growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mogilyansky and Rigoutsos, 2013</xref>). In contrast, the tumor-suppressor p53 negatively impacts the essential genes and co-essential network modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wainberg et al., 2021</xref>).

Like other noncoding RNAs, lncRNAs participate in complex interaction networks of genes and proteins that often have wide-spectrum effects in cell biology, including cancer cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiadou et al., 2018</xref>). Historically, network and systems biology approaches from our group and other researchers have aided in the discovery of critical protein-coding and noncoding genes in cancer and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiadou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacobsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Goede et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Here, our systematic and statistically robust mapping of lncRNAs to CRISPR-derived genome-wide essential gene networks prioritizes known proliferation regulators as the top hits. Additionally, experimental validations of our prediction results demonstrated that our approach accurately assigned growth-regulating functions of previously uncharacterized lncRNAs and revealed key lncRNAs that mediate G2 cell cycle arrest. Collectively, our integrated computational and experimental framework provides a new resource for further investigations of cancer dependency on a comprehensive set of functionally uncharacterized lncRNAs.</p><p>Our network analysis includes directions in the statistically significant associations between lncRNAs and co-essential modules, further elucidating a deeper understanding of which lncRNAs are potential proliferation/growth inducers and which are suppressors. Notably, identified proliferation/growth-inducing and -suppressing lncRNAs have a strong trend to be reduced and elevated, respectively, in cells treated with anti-neoplastic drugs compared to control cells or in patient samples with lower proliferation activity compared with a higher proliferation activity. These data indicate that the observed lncRNA alterations in cancer cells may be selected for to induce or allow cell cycle progression. Our multilevel verifications from literature searches, analysis of completely independent pan-cancer validation datasets, and follow-up biological experiments indicate that the proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs were identified with high confidence. We obtained such high-confidence results likely due to employing our multivariate computational model that minimizes the impact of copy number changes and DNA methylation in constructing lncRNA-mRNA association networks. Secondly, we devised a statistically robust systems-level analysis aiming to capture specific co-essential modules whose alterations are associated with significant modulation of Hallmark proliferation signatures, which could directly impact cellular fitness in cancer.</p><p>In the co-essential network modules, the p53 tumor suppressor is negatively associated with many genes essential in cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feeley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wainberg et al., 2021</xref>). CRISPR screens show p53 wild-type cell lines gain a growth advantage upon p53 suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>).

Efforts over decades identified core protein-coding genes that p53 regulates across cell types and stresses and, more recently, tissue types, but these have not fully explained the effects of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fischer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levine, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moyer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, p53 was shown also to regulate the transcription of lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhary and Lal, 2017</xref>). Here, we gained critical insights into which proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs are p53-regulated. Several of the proliferation/growth-suppressive lncRNAs we identified are known p53 targets (<italic>PICART1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2017</xref>], <italic>LINC00475</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Melo et al., 2016</xref>], <italic>NEAT1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mello et al., 2017</xref>], <italic>LNCTAM34A/GUARDIN</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2018</xref>], and <italic>ST7-AS1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sheng et al., 2021</xref>]). However, none of the known p53-effector lncRNAs were predicted as proliferation/growth inducers, as would be expected, and indicate our statistically robust network and systems biology approach selects true positives and rejects false-positive regulations. Two top proliferation/growth-suppressor lncRNAs (<italic>PSLR-1</italic> and <italic>PSLR-2</italic>) uncovered by our analyses are two previously unstudied lncRNA whose promoters are bound by p53, as determined by multiple ChIP-seq datasets. We show that downregulation of either of these two core lncRNAs whose promoters are bound by p53 in multiple cancer types results in worse overall patient survival. Following a variety of agents that activate p53 and that are used as cancer treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levine, 2020</xref>), we observed the induction of <italic>PSLR-1</italic> and <italic>PSLR-2</italic> in large-scale data using a robust meta-analysis. Although different sample sizes have the potential to bias meta-analysis results, there is no outlier (Tukey’s fences test) in the distribution of sample sizes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>) across the 14 RNA-seq data that we used for the meta-analysis. Furthermore, our validation experiments on <italic>PSLR-1</italic> and <italic>PSLR-2</italic> indicate that the meta-analysis accurately predicted transcriptional changes in the cells treated by different p53-activating agents. Therefore, our combined bioinformatics and experimental results revealed two poorly characterized lncRNAs whose p53-mediated transcriptional regulation and roles in the regulation of cancer cell fitness have not been previously studied.</p><p>Our accumulated results show that p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of PSLRs correlates with modulation of multiple key genes in the p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). We determined a strong enrichment of E2F4 and FOXM1 transcription factors and the <italic>CHR</italic> promoter motif in the PSLR-suppressed genes. These genes regulate the G2 cell cycle, and our data showed that increased levels of either of the <italic>PSLR</italic> lncRNAs resulted in modulation of multiple key G2-regulating genes at the RNA level and this translated to changes at the protein level and a G2 cell cycle arrest <italic>in LUAD cells.</italic> Moreover, there were significantly altered proliferation pathways, oncogenic and tumor-suppressor genes, and prognostic genes with alteration of PSLRs, confirming their proliferation/growth-regulatory roles. Combined, the results indicate that the ability of cells to induce these lncRNAs following stress-inducing stimuli, including DNA damaging cancer treatments, reduces their survival/growth, prolonging the survival of the patient.</p><p>Overall, the 30 pan-cancer high-confidence proliferation/growth-regulating poorly characterized lncRNAs we identified constitute an immediately useful resource for cancer biologists and other researchers. Many important future investigations will stem from this resource, including determination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the identified lncRNAs, exploration of these lncRNAs as competitive endogenous RNA in co-essential pathways, and discovering their epigenetic roles in regulating cancer cell proliferation/growth. Altogether, our study provides a significant leap forward in understanding co-essential pathways and their constituent lncRNAs that critically modulate cellular fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

profiles of 807 cancer cell lines from CCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghandi et al., 2019</xref>) and 3017 patient samples of 10 TCGA cancer types from the UCSC Xena database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldman et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, gene-level copy number variation was measured using the GISTIC2 or ABSOLUTE method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mermel et al., 2011</xref>). For DNA methylation, data from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (for CCLE) or Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 platform (for TCGA) were used, except for TCGA ovarian cancer, for which we used Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation, as a larger set of DNA methylation profiles was available. In TCGA, relative DNA methylation levels, described as β-values, ranged from 0 to 1. The values represent the ratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined locus intensity. If more than one methylation probe mapped to a gene promoter region, a representative probe was selected that showed the strongest negative Spearman’s rank correlation between methylation β-value and mRNA expression of that gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacobsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>). In the mRNA-seq expression profiles, mRNAs were selected for downstream analysis if their normalized expression values were ≥1 in at least 75% of the samples. Additionally, we downloaded processed lncRNA expression profiles for the same 10 TCGA cancer types from the Tanric database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2015</xref>). For CCLE, we extracted the annotated lncRNA expression profiles from the mRNA-seq data. To select lncRNAs for downstream analysis, we employed two filtering criteria as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2015</xref>).

The modules were generated using three different module density cutoffs 0.2, 0.5, and 0.9. The module density score determines how strong the internal connections are within a module. We retained 2223 non-syntenic modules (i.e., all genes in the module are not on the same chromosome) with a density score of 0.5 or 0.9. The Gene Ontology database was used by Wainberg et al. to assign functions of individual modules, which may not reflect comprehensive and diverse oncogenic functions that the module members may coordinately regulate. We, therefore, reannotated module functions using cancer Hallmark genesets and the KEGG pathways, available in Molecular Signature Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). The module functions were annotated with top five Hallmark signatures and top five KEGG pathways among the significantly (BH adjusted hypergeometric test p&lt;0.05) enriched signature/pathway list. The enrichment analysis was performed using the R package WebGestaltR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). We finally selected 123 modules that show significant enrichment of proliferation/growth-regulating genesets/pathways.</p><p>We merged multivariate regression model-derived lncRNA-mRNA associations with proliferation/growth-regulating essential modules based on the genes commonly present in the two networks. We assigned an lncRNA to a module if the module members were significantly (BH adjusted hypergeometric test p&lt;0.05) enriched with the lncRNA-associated protein-coding genes and the lncRNA-module association strength was significantly stronger (BH adjusted 1000 randomization test p&lt;0.05). The average regression coefficient scores, measured from the lncRNA and module members, were used to predict the lncRNA-mediated co-essential module regulation direction. We predicted lncRNA-mediated positive (induction) or negative (suppression) regulation of co-essential modules based on the calculated positive and negative average regression scores. The final network was constructed from 1027 lncRNA, 78 proliferation/growth-linked co-essential modules, and 34,226 edges that connect one lncRNA to a module.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Meta-analysis of lncRNA and co-essential module associations</title><p>For each proliferation/growth-linked co-essential module, we grouped the lncRNAs based on their positive and negative associations with the module, respectively. We ranked each group of lncRNAs based on their average regression scores with the module members, which indicates lncRNA-module association strength. For 78 proliferation/growth-linked modules, we obtained rankings of 78 sets of positively and 78 sets of negatively associated lncRNAs. Obtained rankings were subjected to a probabilistic, nonparametric, and rank-based method RobustRankAggreg V1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolde et al., 2012</xref>) to identify the lncRNAs with consistently positive or negative associations with the modules. The method assigns p-values as a significance score to indicate whether one achieves consistently better ranking under the null hypothesis that the ranked lncRNA lists are uncorrelated.

in cancer formation and progression. Besides developing and applying a robust analysis framework of large-scale pan-cancer omics datasets to discover the roles of 30 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer proliferation and growth, the authors performed direct function-testing experiments to validate the predicted biological mechanisms of two lncRNAs. The analysis framework developed here can serve as a resource to study the functions of lncRNA in cancer, and the computational framework can also be further extended to study cancer-relevant transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77357.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Golemis</surname><given-names>Erica A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0567t7073</institution-id><institution>Fox Chase Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xi Steven</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02dgjyy92</institution-id><institution>University of Miami</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Xingyi</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.03.478941">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.03.478941v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Xi Steven Chen (Reviewer #1); Xingyi Guo (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The modeling work described on Page 5 lines 108-114, and Page 6 is a bit confusing. Were those two analyses the same or independent? On page 5, 540 positives and 500 negative lncRNAs were discovered, but 1027 lncRNAs were identified on Page 6. It's important to clarify the analysis workflow here.

We started with 15777 lncRNAs, annotated in GENCODE (V27) database. Of them, 1049 (549 and 500 lncRNAs with positive and negative associations, respectively) have significantly enriched associations with the pancancer cell survival/growth-regulating essential genes that we identified from the analysis on page 5. Among the 1049 lncRNAs, 1027 lncRNAs showed significant associations with proliferation/growthregulating co-essential modules that we identified from the analysis on page 6. To increase clarity on the number of lncRNA at each of these steps, we revised the manuscript on pages 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. On page 8, the top 200 negatively and 200 positively associated genes for each lncRNA were used for downstream analysis, which was an arbitrary cutoff. Instead, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test implemented in GSEA could be considered to use the whole gene list to test enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, considering the whole gene list, we implemented GSEA to evaluate lncRNA and Hallmark gene signature associations across the ten TCGA cancer types. We compared the new results with the results shown in Figure 2A in the manuscript, where we considered the top 200 negatively and top 200 positively associated genes. Both the results indicate that our predicted proliferation/growth-linked lncRNAs preferentially regulate the Hallmark category proliferation across TCGA cancer types compared to the other Hallmark categories. Furthermore, the distribution of the lncRNAs across eight</p><p>broad categories of Hallmark processes also consistently shows significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;8.69x10<sup>-14</sup>; ANOVA) variability in the number of regulating lncRNAs. Consistent biological interpretation from the results of two different approaches and our follow-up experimental validation results indicate that the results obtained from the top 200 genes reflect the true biological associations between the lncRNA and cancer Hallmark processes. We revised the manuscript with this additional analysis on page 9 and added the data to the supplement (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The data further strengthen our prediction results, and we thank Reviewer 1 for raising this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Could the authors clarify the reason 50 Hallmark gene signatures were used in TCGA analysis instead of using the same co-essential modules in CCLE analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Here we aimed to identify lncRNAs that have a consistent association with proliferation/growthregulating functions both in cancer cell lines and patient samples. Our objective was to measure the consistency/reproducibility using completely independent training and test data sets. Hence, we utilized CCLE data and co-essential modules as the training data and TCGA and cancer Hallmark data as the independent test data. On page 21, we stated “Our multi-level verifications from literature searches, analysis of completely independent pan-cancer validation datasets, and follow-up biological experiments indicate that the proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs were identified with high confidence.” Moreover, the 50 Hallmark gene signatures include various cancer gene sets with different oncogenic functions. These high-quality gene signatures enabled us to additionally investigate if the cell line-derived predicted proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs preferentially regulate proliferation in the cancer patient samples compared to other oncogenic mechanisms (see Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Could the authors clarify the number of TCGA samples used in the analysis? For example, we know there are more than 1000 BRCA samples, but only 526 samples were used in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The multivariate regression model included DNA copy-number, DNA methylation, mRNA, and lncRNA expression data. Only the samples from which all these four types of omics data were generated were selected for the analysis. This resulted in the reduction of sample size for each cancer type. To improve clarity, we have added Venn diagrams for all ten cancer types in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 indicating how we obtained the number of samples in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 that we used for the multivariate regression analysis. We have also revised the figure legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In 7B, why were only a few cancer types listed instead of all ten cancer types?</p></disp-quote><p>Only the cancer types showing a significant correlation between the indicated lncRNA expression and overall patient survival were reported in Figure 7B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the multivariate regression, the authors should include a covariant, 'cancer type' if they used all data combined from different cancer types, to adjust potential cancer heterogeneity. Alternatively, they can perform such analysis for each cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that it was not clear in the manuscript that we performed the multivariate regression analysis for each of the ten TCGA cancer types separately. To clarify this in the revised manuscript, we edited the following sentence on page 9,</p><p>“To assess the impact of the cell line-derived proliferation/growth-linked lncRNAs in cancer patient samples; we evaluated lncRNA-mRNA associations independently in each of the 10 TCGA cancer types utilizing the same multivariate regression model (Methods section; Figure 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In lines 530-532: &quot;The BH adjusted regression P&lt;0.001 was used as the cut-off to select significantly associated lncRNA-mRNA pairs in CCLE or a specific TCGA cancer type.&quot; To identify significantly correlated lncRNA-mRNA pairs, the authors need to justify why they would not just use results from TCGA to replicate the associations.</p></disp-quote><p>There may be a misunderstanding on this point so we will clarify it here. Our objective in this study was to identify and verify reproducible proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs in different cellular contexts and not to evaluate the specific lncRNA-target gene pairs. To identify the proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs, we evaluated different data sets from cell lines, tumor tissues, and across cancer types. Literature mining verification and follow-up validation experiments showed that our approach accurately identified proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs. Identifying replicated lncRNA-gene associations would be useful in a future study to specifically investigate high-confidence lncRNA-target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

With a meta-analysis and statistical tests, we gained such confidence. For the reviewer’s convenience, we provide the following details that are stated in the Material and Methods in sub-section “Meta-analysis of lncRNA and co-essential module associations”, on page 30.</p><p>“Meta-analysis of lncRNA and co-essential module associations</p><p>For each proliferation/growth-linked co-essential module, we grouped the lncRNAs based on their positive and negative associations with the module, respectively. We ranked each group of lncRNAs based on their average regression scores with the module members, which indicates lncRNA-module association strength. For 78 proliferation/growth linked modules, we obtained rankings of 78 sets of positively and 78 sets of negatively associated lncRNAs. Obtained rankings were subjected to a probabilistic, non-parametric, and rank-based method RobustRankAggreg V1.1 (Kolde et al., 2012) to identify the lncRNAs with consistently positive or negative associations with the modules. The method assigns <italic>P</italic>-values as a significance score to indicate whether one achieves consistently better ranking under the null hypothesis that the ranked lncRNA lists are uncorrelated. We repeated the same analysis 78 times after excluding one of the rankings. Acquired <italic>P</italic>-values were averaged to assess the stability of the significance scores and further corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995) to minimize potential false positives. We considered the lncRNAs to be high-confidence proliferation/growth regulators if they had consistent positive- or negative association with statistical significance (BH corrected robust rank aggregation <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Therefore, after conducting a Tukey’s fences test, in the revised manuscript, we added to page 22, “Although different sample sizes have the potential to bias meta-analysis results, there is no outlier (Tukey’s fences test) in the distribution of sample sizes (Supplementary Table 11) across the 14 RNA-seq data that we used for the meta-analysis. Furthermore, our validation experiments on <italic>PSLR-1</italic> and <italic>PSLR-2</italic> indicate that the meta-analysis accurately predicted transcriptional changes in the cells treated by different p53 activating agents.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors may wish to include additional analyses using data for lung squamous cell carcinomas, as they are available in TCGA.</p></disp-quote><p>We specifically chose 10 different cancer types originating from different organs for our study. We did not include lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) because we had chosen to include the most frequent type of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, in response to this Reviewer’s suggestion, we evaluated TCGA LUSC data and compared the results with LUAD data. We determined the number of predicted proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs that have significantly (FDR &lt; 0.05; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) enriched association with different cancer hallmark categories in LUAD and LUSC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We observed a strong correlation (Spearman’s r = 0.84) between LUAD and LUSC in the number of lncRNAs that potentially regulate the indicated Hallmark categories. Specifically, proliferation is associated with the highest number of lncRNAs in both subtypes of lung cancer. Therefore, the LUSC data are similar to that of LUAD data, which further supports our conclusion that the identified lncRNAs have proliferation regulation potential across different cancer types.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Number of predicted proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs that have significant (FDR &lt; 0.05; GSEA) enrichment with the indicated cancer hallmark categories in LUAD and/or LUSC.</title><p>P-value was derived from Spearman’s rank correlation test.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-77357-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I hope my comments below could help authors improve their work in their revision.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressing this Reviewer's comments did improve the overall quality and clarity of our work.

In the revised version, we added the oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes present in the cancer gene census to the existing literature curated gene set.
