In Xuanwei City of Yunnan Province, the lung cancer incidence is among the highest in China, attributed to smoky coal combustion-generated PAH pollution. Here, we screened for abnormal inflammatory factors in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) from Xuanwei and control regions (CR) where smoky coal was not used, and found that a chemokine CXCL13 was overexpressed in 63/70 (90%) of Xuanwei NSCLCs and 44/71 (62%) of smoker and 27/60 (45%) of non-smoker CR patients. CXCL13 overexpression was associated with the region Xuanwei and cigarette smoke. The key carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced CXCL13 production in lung epithelial cells and in mice prior to development of detectable lung cancer. Deficiency in Cxcl13 or its receptor, Cxcr5, significantly attenuated BaP-induced lung cancer in mice, demonstrating CXCL13’s critical role in PAH-induced lung carcinogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09419.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09419.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09419.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lung cancer causes the most cancer deaths worldwide. For decades, people have known that lung cancer is associated with environmental factors, and both cigarette smoke and air pollution are known to cause cancers in humans. Smoke and air pollution both contain chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (or PAHs). These chemicals cause chronic inflammation of the lung, which in turn is a major risk factor for developing lung cancer.</p><p>However, it is unclear exactly how PAHs trigger inflammation and cancer. Xuanwei City in China is suited to the study of this question because until the 1970s its inhabitants used 'smoky coal' for cooking in unventilated indoor spaces; this produced high levels of small particles that contain high concentrations of PAHs. Women from this region, who traditionally do most of the cooking, have rates of lung cancer comparable to those of men. In other parts of China a woman’s chance of getting lung cancer is approximately half that of a man’s. Therefore, Xuanwei City provides a setting in which air pollution is a main contributor to lung cancer risk.</p><p>Wang, Cheng et al. have now compared the levels of certain proteins (which are linked to inflammation) in lung cancer patients from Xuanwei City with those in control regions of China. The level of one such protein marker, called CXCL13, was particularly high in almost all patients from Xuanwei City, but only highly expressed in half of the patients from the control regions. Moreover, there was also a clear link between cigarette smoke and CXCL13 expression because, in control regions, smokers were much more likely to have high levels of CXCL13 than non-smokers. To test whether PAHs cause CXCL13 expression, Wang, Cheng et al. first exposed normal lung epithelial cells, cancer cells and then mice to a PAH. These experiments showed that CXCL13 levels did indeed increase and the mice developed lung tumours. However, when the genes for CXCL13 or its binding partner were deleted, the mice no longer got cancer when exposed to the PAH. This shows that CXCL13 signalling is an important mechanism by which PAHs cause lung cancer. Lastly, further experiments showed that CXCL13’s binding partner is highly expressed on some immune cells that can promote lung cancer.</p><p>Importantly, the over-expression of CXCL13 occurred before the lung tumours developed. This might provide a new treatment strategy in which CXCL13 signalling could be inhibited after the exposure to PAHs. Future studies may now focus on discovering new drugs, or modifying existing drugs, to achieve this goal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09419.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09419.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CXCL13</kwd><kwd>environmental pollutant</kwd><kwd>lung cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81425025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Guang-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Key Program for Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB910800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Guang-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81171925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Guang-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81201537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grants from the State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Guang-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The chemokine CXCL13 is critical to the development of air pollution- and tobacco smoke-induced lung cancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Air pollution is a diverse mixture of pollutants that originated from anthropogenic and natural sources, is comprised of particulate matter (PM), gases (e.g., sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, ozone), organic compounds (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs), metals (e.g., lead, vanadium, and nickel), and others, such as microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akimoto, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Air pollution is a global environmental health risk that affects the populations in developed and developing countries alike, and satellite observations suggest that 80% of the global population resides in locations where the ambient pollutant concentrations exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guideline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Donkelaar et al., 2010</xref>). Outdoor air pollution in cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths annually worldwide in 2012, including 220,000 deaths due to lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">WHO, 2014</xref>). Recently, outdoor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loomis et al., 2013</xref>) and indoor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">WHO, 2010</xref>) air pollution has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of WHO. Indeed, the risk of lung cancer rises by 18% for every increase of 5 μg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the environment; the risk increases by 22% for every increase of 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in PM smaller than 10 μm (PM<sub>10</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2013</xref>). There have been efforts to investigate how air pollution causes human cancers by exposing cells and animals to PM or related chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Straif et al., 2012</xref>), but the carcinogenic mechanism remains elusive, at least in part, due to the difficulty of identifying human lung cancers that are causally associated with air pollution.</p><p>Xuanwei City of the Yunnan Province in China provides a significant association between air pollution and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mumford et al., 1987</xref>). Until the 1970s, residents of this region used smoky coal in unvented indoor fire pits for domestic cooking and heating, which are processes that release high concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>/PM<sub>10</sub> that contain high concentration PAHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mumford et al., 1987</xref>). Indoor air pollution in Xuanwei is associated with a significant increase in the absolute lifetime risk of developing lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>), and the lung cancer incidence in this region is among the highest in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mumford, et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, nearly all women in this region are non-smokers and cook food on the household stove, and the lung cancer incidence in women is high. In Xuanwei, the male-to-female ratio of lung cancer incidences is 1.09:1, while that of China’s national average reaches 2.08:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>). Tobacco smoke was weakly and non-significantly associated with lung cancer risk in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In the 1990s, a reduction in the lung cancer incidence was noted after stove improvement, supporting the association between indoor air pollution and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lan et al., 2002</xref>). These findings had been cited by the IARC monograph to classify indoor emissions from household coal combustion as ‘carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">WHO, 2010</xref>). However, lung cancer incidence in Xuanwei is still increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>), possibly due to pollutants generated by coal-burning industrial plants that have moved into the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao and Gao, 2012</xref>). Therefore, the population in this highly polluted region (HPR) provides a unique opportunity to dissect air pollution-related lung carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the key carcinogens of smoky coal combustion are PAHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2009</xref>), which are also the key carcinogens of tobacco smoke that causes more than 85% of global lung cancer deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hecht, 2012</xref>). Xuanwei lung cancer is, therefore, applicable to elucidate tobacco smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis.</p><p>Chronic inflammation can promote cancer formation, progression and metastasis by inducing oncogenic mutations, genomic instability, and enhanced angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). Studies show that PAHs can cause immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zaccaria and McClure, 2013</xref>) and induce the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CC chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and CXCL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">N'Diaye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Umannová et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dreij et al., 2010</xref>). These factors may facilitate cancer initiation and progression. However, most of these factors were identified in cellular and animal PAH exposure models. Clinically relevant inflammation factors should be identified to shed insights into PAH-related carcinogenesis and provide novel therapeutic targets for lung cancer.</p><p>To systematically investigate air pollution-induced lung carcinogenesis, we used Xuanwei lung cancers to analyze the abnormalities in the cancer genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), genome-wide DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs (miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2015</xref>] and lncRNAs), and inflammation factors. The abnormalities found in the HPR lung cancers were tested in patients from control regions (CRs) where smoky coal was not used, to compare the difference between HPR and control region (CR) lung cancers. In this study, we explored the abnormal inflammatory factors in HPR non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abnormal inflammatory factors in HPR NSCLCs</title><p>Using a microarray analysis of 84 cytokines/chemokines in tumor samples and their adjacent normal lung tissues of eight HPR NSCLCs, we found that the expression of four cytokines (<italic>IL-1F5, IL-1F9, MIF,</italic> and <italic>SPP1</italic>) and seven chemokines (<italic>CXCL13, CCL7, CCL20, CCL26, CXCL6, CXCL9,</italic> and <italic>CXCL14</italic>) was increased in tumors compared with their counterpart normal lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

BaP induced lung epithelial cells to secret CXCL13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which recruited tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and induced SPP1 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). SPP1 activated β-catenin by facilitating its translocation to the nucleus and promoted an EMT, leading to the progression of lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling was required for PAH-induced lung cancer, because knockdown of Cxcl13 or Cxcr5 attenuated BaP-induced lung cancer in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that the ubiquitous carcinogen BaP may induce tumor-promoting inflammation to facilitate the invasive growth and metastasis of lung cancer, shedding new insights into the carcinogenic mechanisms of air pollution.</p><p>CXCL13 may be associated with lung cancer risk in smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiels et al., 2013</xref>). We showed that in HPR, smoker and non-smoker NSCLCs had approximately equal expression levels of CXCL13, suggesting a carcinogenic effect of air pollution. In CR, however, smoker patients had higher CXCL13 expression than non-smoker cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, high CXCL13 expression was associated with advanced stage cancer and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results indicate that CXCL13 is a common and critical factor in air pollution-induced and tobacco smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the serum concentration of CXCL13 was elevated in mice before the emergence of detectable lung tumor by microCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that this chemokine may represent a biomarker for early diagnosis, which warrants further investigation.</p><p>PAHs are key carcinogens in air pollution and tobacco smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hecht, 2012</xref>), and cause mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>K-RAS</italic>, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hecht, 2012</xref>).

By treating 16HBE cells with a relatively low concentration (1 μM) of BaP for a long time course (30 days) to mimic BaP-induced lung cancer in humans, we showed that <italic>CXCL13</italic> was the most significantly up-regulated gene among the 84 cytokines/chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, CXCL13 was increased in 134/201 (66.7%) NSCLCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting the clinical relevance of CXCL13 in BaP-induced lung cancer. AhR is critical for the carcinogenic action of BaP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimizu et al., 2000</xref>). We found that CXCL13 was a direct target of AhR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and deficiency in CXCL13 or its receptor, CXCR5, abrogated BaP-induced lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), while an anti-CXCR5 antibody significantly inhibited lung cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results further demonstrate CXCL13’s critical role in environmental pollutant-induced lung cancer, but its role in pre-malignancy and cell transformation remains to be addressed.</p><p>Cross-talk between cancer cells and cells of the neoplastic stroma is involved in the acquired ability for invasive growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Using a whole -genome gene expression array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we discovered that TAMs secreted SPP1, which activates β–catenin and is regulated by this transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robertson and Chellaiah, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Tanani et al., 2001</xref>). SPP1 induced the nuclear localization and activation of β–catenin in epithelial and cancer cells, resulting in an EMT phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H–K</xref>). At this stage, the detailed mechanisms of CXCL13-CXCR5-induced SPP1 production were unclear. However, our results suggested that SPP1-β–catenin could form a positive feedback loop to promote EMT and lung cancer progression. CXCL13 was shown to be able to induce an EMT in breast cancer via RANKL and Src activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2014</xref>). We found that BaP or CXCL13 treatment or SPP1 overexpression in lung epithelial or cancer cells did not up-regulate RANKL or Src (data not shown), but did activate β–catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that CXCL13 may induce an EMT via different mechanisms in different settings.</p><p>Chemokines can modulate tumor cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, senescence and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). For example, CCL20 is induced by another important carcinogen in tobacco smoke, nicotine-derived nitrosaminoketone, and is overexpressed in smoker lung cancers and inversely associated with prognosis. CCL20 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

CXCL13 is overexpressed in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panse et al., 2008</xref>) and mediates prostate cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Haibi et al., 2011</xref>). Given their critical roles in cancer, pharmaceutical development pipelines are filled with new chemokine-targeting drugs to treat malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klarenbeek et al., 2012</xref>). DEX is a synthetic glucocorticoid used to counteract certain side effects of chemotherapies or as a direct chemotherapeutic agent in certain malignancies. It reduces lung tumor multiplicities in the tobacco smoke-exposed and non-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Witschi et al., 2005</xref>). We showed that DEX inhibited CXCL13 production by epithelial cells and SPP1 production by TAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), inhibited the EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), reduced the tumor burden and prolonged the life span of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), revealing a new mechanism for this existing drug. Because DEX is a wide-spectrum anti-inflammatory drug that may cause severe side effects, more specific, CXCL13/CXCR5-targeting antibodies or small molecules should be developed to combat lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related mortality accounting for 1.59 million deaths worldwide in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">WHO, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient samples</title><p>The study was approved by the local research ethics committees of all participating sites; all lung cancer samples were collected with informed consent.

It would also be of interest to perform a similar comparison in microarray data deposited from genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer to see whether in these models, which are not carcinogen induced, if <italic>CXCL13</italic> is not enriched. For example, mouse GEO datasets GSE6135, GSE21581, GSE54353 are from lung tumors derived following LKB1 inactivation.

Alternatively they could perform flow cytometry and sort by EPCAM or CD68.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> needs additional controls. The authors should use qPCR instead of PCR to present the ChIP data. In addition, although the specific induction of binding by BAP is nice, the authors also need to test another gene without the XRE element, perhaps <italic>CXCL12,</italic> which was used in another experiment. For the EMSA, it seems that the lane with the shift is overloaded. This blot is not convincing and needs to be repeated. Alternatively, if the results are not robust, they should be removed from the paper, since it erodes confidence in the ChIP result.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> which is a key component of this paper should include quantification of tumor burden by microCT (as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the CT images presented it appears there are tumors in <italic>Cxcl13<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Also at what time point were CTs performed? There should also be more rigorous quantification of tumor nodules in histologic sections between mouse groups (e.g. see Tan et al. PLOS One 2013; PMID 24260500). This data needs to be presented for the <italic>Cxcr5</italic> mice as well. Also for Figure 3—figure supplement 1 that is used to document <italic>Cxcl13</italic> inactivation; which band is it? If it is the lower band why is it higher in the hetereozygous mice?

As above, the authors could use TTF1 stain to mark lung cancer cells and CD68 stain to mark macrophages, or perform flow cytometry and sort by EPCAM or CD68.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09419.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>All three reviewers felt the work was interesting and of importance, but had concerns about several aspects of the paper that need to be addressed before considering publication.

In two works of TCGA (Nature 2014; Nature 2012), <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression was assessed by microarray or RNA-seq, and the results showed that <italic>CXCL13</italic> was not up-regulated in tumor samples compared to normal tissues (data not shown). Nevertheless, <italic>CXCL13</italic> in tumor samples of smokers was not increased compared to that in nonsmokers (data not shown). However, in several works documented in the Oncomine database, <italic>CXCL13</italic> was elevated in tumor compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), and was increased in smokers compared to non-smokers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results suggested that overexpression of <italic>CXCL13</italic> was not specific to the Chinese cohorts.</p><p>In mouse GEO dataset GSE54353, <italic>Cxcl13</italic> expression in wild type (normal), <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup>, and <italic>Lkb1(Stk11</italic>)<sup>-/-</sup><italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In GSE6135, <italic>Cxcl13</italic> in <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup><italic>Stk11</italic><sup>L/+, -/-, L/-</sup> mice was slightly but not statistically significantly higher than in <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup><italic>Stk11</italic><sup>wt</sup> mice (p=0.08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In GSE21581 dataset, <italic>Cxcl13</italic> was slightly elevated in primary tumors and significantly increased in metastatic tumors of the <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup><italic>Stk11</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, as compared to that of the <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These results suggested that <italic>Cxcl13</italic> might play a role in <italic>Stk11</italic>-related lung carcinogenesis which warrants further investigation.</p><p><italic>2) What are the expression levels of</italic> CXCR5 <italic>in human and mouse samples with lung cancers?</italic> </p><p>We tested the expression of <italic>CXCR5</italic> in 24 NSCLCs by qPCR, and found that in tumor samples it was slightly higher than in paired normal lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In tumor samples of mice treated with BaP at 50 or 100 mg/kg, <italic>Cxcr5</italic> was also slightly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) It is unclear which cell type is staining positive for CXCL13 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.

Alternatively they could perform flow cytometry and sort by EPCAM or CD68.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the comments and performed IHC and immunofluorescence assays to determine the source of Cxcl13. By IHC assay, we found that both the Cd68 positive macrophages and Ttf1 positive lung cancer cells were stained positive for Cxcl13, but Ttf1 positive cells constituted more than 95% of the cellular component of the lung tumor tissues of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This observation was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) using antibodies against Cxcl13 (green), Cd68 (red), and Ttf1 (white). DAPI was used to counter stain the nucleus.

The authors should use qPCR instead of PCR to present the ChIP data. In addition, although the specific induction of binding by BAP is nice, the authors also need to test another gene without the XRE element, perhaps</italic> CXCL12<italic>, which was used in another experiment. For the EMSA, it seems that the lane with the shift is overloaded. This blot is not convincing and needs to be repeated. Alternatively, if the results are not robust, they should be removed from the paper, since it erodes confidence in the ChIP result.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the comments, and performed qPCR to test the expression of <italic>CXCL13, CXCL12, CXCL14, CXCL11</italic> and <italic>CXCL2</italic> in ChIP experiment of cells co-incubated with or without BaP. The results showed that among these chemokines, only <italic>CXCL13</italic> was enriched and significantly up-regulated by BaP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> here and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> of the paper).

In the CT images presented it appears there are tumors in</italic> cxcl13<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>mice. Also at what time point were CTs performed? There should also be more rigorous quantification of tumor nodules in histologic sections between mouse groups (e.g. see Tan et al. PLOS One 2013; PMID 24260500).

Firstly, tumor nodules in histologic sections of mice upon BaP treatment were analyzed as describe (Tan et al. PLOS One 2013), and the result showed that at treatment time points of 120, 180, and 240 days, <italic>Cxcl13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice had much less lesions than <italic>Cxcl13</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Cxcl13</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For microCT analysis of the mice treated with BaP for 240 days, the tumor volume of <italic>Cxcl13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was significantly lower than <italic>Cxcl13</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Cxcl13</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Tumor burden of <italic>Cxcr5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, reflected by tumor nodules and microCT assays, was also significantly lower than <italic>Cxcr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Cxcr5</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I, J</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Cxcl13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/005626">https://www.jax.org/strain/005626</ext-link>). The mice were also called B6.129X1-<italic>Cxcl13<sup>tm1Cys</sup></italic>/J. A targeting vector was constructed in which base pairs 18-116 of exon 2 from the endogenous gene were replaced with an in-frame stop codon, a Mengo virus internal ribosome entry site, an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (EGFP), and a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance gene. The construct was electroporated into 129X1/SvJ derived JM-1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Correctly targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and the resulting chimeric males were backcrossed for germ-line transmission to C57BL/6J females. Offspring were mated with Cre-expressing C57BL/6J to remove the neomycin resistance gene. The neo-excised heterozygotes were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for ten generations before being made homozygous. Mice that are homozygous for the targeted mutation are viable, fertile and normal in size. No endogenous gene product (mRNA or protein) is detected, EGFP is not expressed. The primers to detect <italic>Cxcl13</italic> were designed by the Jackson Laboratory, and the expected results were: mutant=~240 bp, heterozygote =~240 bp and ~200 bp, wild type=~200 bp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www2.jax.org/protocolsdb/f?p=116:2:::NO:2:P2_MASTER_PROTOCOL_ID,P2_JRS_CODE:945,005626">https://www2.jax.org/protocolsdb/f?p=116:2:::NO:2:P2_MASTER_PROTOCOL_ID,P2_JRS_CODE:945,005626</ext-link>). Our results were in consistent with the references provided by the Jackson Laboratory, e.g., the higher one of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> was the inactivation band.</p><p>For <italic>Cxcr5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/006659">https://www.jax.org/strain/006659</ext-link>), a targeting vector was designed to replace the 350 bp coding region of exon 2 of the targeted gene with a neomycin resistance gene. The construct was electroporated into 129S2/SvPas-derived D3 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Correctly targeted ES cells were aggregated with morulae from outbred CD-1 mice and then transferred into pseudopregnant CD-1 females. Chimeric mice were bred with CD-1. The donating investigator reported that mutant mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for 8 generations prior to arrival at The Jackson Laboratory. Homozygous (CXCR5-deficient) mice are viable and fertile. No endogenous gene product (mRNA or protein) is detected.

As above, the authors could use TTF1 stain to mark lung cancer cells and CD68 stain to mark macrophages, or perform flow cytometry and sort by EPCAM or CD68.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the comments and performed IHC and immunofluorescence assays to determine the source of Spp1. By IHC assay, we found that the Cd68 positive macrophages were strongly stained by Spp1, whereas Ttf positive lung cancer cells were weakly stained by Spp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This observation was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (Figure 7B) using antibodies against Spp1 (green), Cd68 (red), and Ttf (white). DAPI was used to counter stain the nucleus. These results indicate that Cd68 positive macrophages were the main source of Spp1 in mice exposed to BaP.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
