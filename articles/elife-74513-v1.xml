Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) myofibroblasts are the primary cell type responsible for liver fibrosis, yet there are currently no therapies directed at inhibiting the activity of HSC myofibroblasts. To search for potential anti-fibrotic compounds, we performed a high-throughput compound screen in primary human HSC myofibroblasts and identified 19 small molecules that induce HSC inactivation, including the polyether ionophore nanchangmycin (NCMC). NCMC induces lipid re-accumulation while reducing collagen expression, deposition of collagen in the extracellular matrix, cell proliferation, and migration. We find that NCMC increases cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reduces the phosphorylated protein levels of FYN, PTK2 (FAK), MAPK1/3 (ERK2/1), HSPB1 (HSP27), and STAT5B. Further, depletion of each of these kinases suppress <italic>COL1A1</italic> expression. These studies reveal a signaling network triggered by NCMC to inactivate HSC myofibroblasts and reduce expression of proteins that compose the fibrotic scar. Identification of the antifibrotic effects of NCMC and the elucidation of pathways by which NCMC inhibits fibrosis provide new tools and therapeutic targets that could potentially be utilized to combat the development and progression of liver fibrosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nanchangmycin</kwd><kwd>liver fibrosis</kwd><kwd>hepatic stellate cells</kwd><kwd>compound screening</kwd><kwd>FYN</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mullen</surname><given-names>Alan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Scientists from Boehringer Ingelheim participated in the discussion on study design, data collection and interpretation, and the decision to submit the work for publication.

Liver injuries, including those caused by viral infection, excessive alcohol intake, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, can lead to fibrosis, the accumulation of abnormal scar tissue, in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bataller and Brenner, 2005</xref>). If left unchecked, liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bataller and Brenner, 2005</xref>). HSC myofibroblasts are the primary cell type responsible for liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mederacke et al., 2013</xref>). HSCs reside in the perisinusoidal space and represent 5–8% of total cells in the liver. In their quiescent, nonfibrotic state, they store vitamin A as retinol ester in lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geerts, 2001</xref>). In response to chronic liver injury, HSCs are activated and trans-differentiate into HSC myofibroblasts, characterized by the loss of lipid droplets, increased contractility, and secretion of ECM proteins, leading to fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bataller and Brenner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Resolution of liver fibrosis has been observed when the source of liver injury is removed, such as in patients with successful antiviral therapy against hepatitis B or C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benyon and Iredale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falize et al., 2006</xref>). Two mechanisms can contribute to the reduction of activated HSC myofibroblasts during resolution of liver fibrosis – apoptosis of activated HSC myofibroblasts and reversion of HSC myofibroblasts to a more quiescent phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman, 2008</xref>). With regression of fibrosis, 40–50% of HSC myofibroblasts revert to an inactive state in vivo, which is associated with reduced collagen expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kisseleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Troeger et al., 2012</xref>). These encouraging observations suggest that liver fibrosis is reversible and targeting HSC myofibroblasts to induce an inactive phenotype may serve as a therapeutic approach to treat patients with liver fibrosis.</p><p>Despite many efforts to understand HSC plasticity and target HSC myofibroblasts, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies directed at inhibiting the activity of HSC myofibroblasts. In our previous studies, we developed a small molecule screen to identify compounds that promote HSC inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In a pilot screen, this approach revealed the antifibrotic effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). In mechanistic studies, we identified that TCAs inhibit the enzyme acid ceramidase (aCDase). In subsequent studies, we demonstrated that inhibiting aCDase regulates YAP/TAZ-mediated HSC inactivation and reduces fibrogenesis in mouse models and in human precision cut liver slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsamman et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we expanded our screen approximately 10-fold to include 15,867 experimental wells and developed a secondary screen to evaluate primary hits. We find that nanchangmycin (NCMC), a polyether ionophore, promotes HSC inactivation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NCMC decreases proliferation, migration, and assembly of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix. In additional mechanistic studies, we show that multiple kinases and signaling pathways are involved in mediating the impact of NCMC on HSC activities, including the FYN, PTK2 (FAK) and MAPK1/3 (ERK2/1) pathways. Taken together, this study defines NCMC as a potent antifibrotic compound that inactivates HSC myofibroblasts and highlights the FYN, PTK2, and MAPK1/3 pathways as potential downstream targets to inhibit liver fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A high-throughput small molecule screen identifies compounds that inactivate human hepatic stellate cell myofibroblasts</title><p>To identify small molecules that induce reversion of HSC myofibroblasts to an inactive phenotype, we screened 24 compound libraries consisting of 15,867 experimental wells using a high-throughput method to quantify lipid droplet accumulation as an indicator of HSC inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1and and 2</xref>).

We quantified expression using qRT-PCR in HSC cDNA samples reverse-transcribed from equal amounts of total RNA. <italic>PSMB2</italic>, which encodes proteasome 20 S subunit beta 2, showed the least variation as indicated by standard deviation and was chosen as the reference mRNA for the secondary qRT-PCR-based screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>qRT-PCR was performed to quantify <italic>ACTA2, COL1A1,</italic> and <italic>PSMB2</italic> mRNA levels in each sample. Relative fold changes were calculated compared to DMSO control. We defined the following as criteria for compound advancement: 1.

Of the nine compounds selected, two subgroups of compounds were identified based on similar bioactivity – histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), including trichostatin A and abexinostat, and Na/K-ATPase inhibitors, including ouabain, digitoxigenin, and digoxin. Histone deacetylases are linked to a variety of fibrotic disorders, including liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pang and Zhuang, 2010</xref>). HDACIs, such as MC1568 and Valproate, have been reported to reduce HSC activation and alleviate liver fibrosis in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of HDACIs in our final candidate list supports the validity of our screening approach in identifying potential liver fibrosis inhibitors. Na/K-ATPase activity may play a role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sodhi et al., 2017</xref>), but it is not clear how Na/K-ATPases regulate HSC activity and liver fibrosis. Due to the toxicity and narrow therapeutic dose range of cardiac glycosides, which limit their potential application in treatment of liver fibrosis, we decided not to pursue further evaluation of this group of compounds. Nanchangmycin (NCMC), a natural product of <italic>Streptomyces nanchangensis</italic>, is a polyether insecticidal antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2002</xref>) and is one of the most potent hits. Studies of NCMC are limited, but it has been shown to have a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against diverse arboviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rausch et al., 2017</xref>) and potentially SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dittmar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Svenningsen et al., 2020</xref>).

Among the top gene sets negatively enriched in the NCMC-treated group were ECM-related signatures, including ECM structural constituent and collagen-containing ECM, as well as signatures relevant to migration, including contractile fibers. Of note, genes associated with oligosaccharide lipid intermediate biosynthetic process were positively enriched, possibly contributing to the re-accumulation of lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

HSCs were seeded onto plates containing inserts that block cells from accessing and attaching to a strip at the bottom of the well. After removal of the insert, DMSO or 1 µM NCMC was added, and HSCs filled the gap or ‘wound’ field through migration and proliferation. After 30 hr of treatment, the DMSO-treated control cells closed the gap, whereas the gap remained for NCMC-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). While inhibition of HSC migration by NCMC is likely the major contributor to the difference observed between NCMC treatment and controls at shorter time points, such as 6 hr for the transwell assay, the difference at longer time points could be attributed to reductions in both migration and proliferation.</p><p>We next determined how NCMC affects HSC proliferation. We treated HSCs isolated from two human donors with DMSO control and increasing concentrations of NCMC and counted Hoechst-stained nuclei on five consecutive days. NCMC treatment reduced cell proliferation at concentrations of 25 nM and higher, and this effect on proliferation was first evident on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A fraction of HSCs undergo apoptosis with the removal of fibrotic stimuli in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kisseleva et al., 2012</xref>), and we evaluated the contribution of apoptosis to the effect of NCMC on day 2. Based on the analysis of Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) by flow cytometry, NCMC treatment only showed a small increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in one of two donor HSC lines at 1 µM and no increase at 100 nM. There was also a small increase in necrotic cells in NCMC treatment compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, analysis of the proliferation marker Ki-67 and PI showed that NCMC treatment increased the percentage of G0 quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Activation of HSCs in the setting of chronic liver injury represents a critical event in fibrosis, as activated HSC myofibroblasts are the primary source of collagen production and excessive extracellular matrix deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maher and McGuire, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mederacke et al., 2013</xref>). With evidence that the scarring process in the liver is reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) and that HSC myofibroblasts demonstrate plasticity and can revert to an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kisseleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Troeger et al., 2012</xref>), there is increasing enthusiasm for development of approaches to promote HSC inactivation as a therapeutic strategy to treat liver fibrosis. Although some therapies under investigation in clinical trials, including PPAR agonists and TGF-β inhibitors, are anticipated to promote HSC inactivation, none have yet been recognized as effective antifibrotic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo and Lu, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, with the goal to identify new compounds with antifibrotic potential and novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of liver fibrosis, we performed a small molecule compound screen using primary human HSC myofibroblasts. Combining high-content microscopy imaging and high-throughput qPCR screening approaches as well as filtering methods that take into consideration both the potency and diversity of the candidates’ chemical structures, we screened 15,867 experimental wells and identified 19 top candidates that are potentially more potent than the previously discovered HSC-inactivating compound nortriptyline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). The top 19 compounds were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and the full datasets of the screening results are provided as Supplementary files, which can serve as a resource for future studies. Further studies to investigate the compounds identified by the screen will deepen our understanding of HSC biology and allow identification of additional genes and pathways that could be targeted to reduce liver fibrosis. There are two potential limitations of this screen. First, although lipid droplet re-accumulation is recognized as a feature of quiescent and inactivated HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zisser et al., 2021</xref>), it is possible that partially inactivated HSCs may not accumulate enough lipid droplets to pass our primary screen cutoff, and therefore compounds that act to reduce collagen expression or other fibrosis-related aspects of HSCs without affecting lipid accumulation may be missed in this screen. Second, the lipid accumulation and mRNA screens were conducted with primary human HSCs isolated from the same donor 1, therefore we performed the DRC screen in primary human HSCs isolated from donor 2, so that the final screen hits are not restricted to a single HSC isolate. We validated NCMC in primary HSC lines from two additional donors, but for the other positive hits in the screen, further validation in HSC from additional donors is needed.</p><p>We focused on NCMC because it strongly induced HSC inactivation, and the activity of NCMC was poorly understood. NCMC belongs to a group of naturally occurring polyether ionophores, which consist of over 120 known members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Among them, the compound monensin shares a similar chemical structure to NCMC and is also a positive hit in our primary screen. It was grouped in the same chemical cluster as NCMC, but NCMC was selected as the representative compound for this cluster in the screen because NCMC had a higher scaled value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This group of compounds demonstrates antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antimalarial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory activities and cytotoxicity in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kevin Ii et al., 2009</xref>). Although some polyether ionophores have been employed as veterinary antibiotics, none have been used as antibiotics in human, possibly due to concerns about toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huczyński, 2012</xref>). Indeed, we observe that NCMC demonstrated substantial cytotoxicity in cell culture at concentrations higher than 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, given that the EC50 of NCMC in lipid accumulation assay is in the range of 10–300 nM without inducing apoptosis, NCMC or compounds with similar structure may have potential as antifibrotic therapy within optimized therapeutic doses.</p><p>Despite the extensive study of some polyether ionophores, limited data are available describing the activity and mechanism of action of NCMC in mammalian cells. A screen for bioactive inhibitors of the Otub1/c-Maf axis in multiple myeloma cells demonstrated that NCMC induces c-Maf polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in the presence of Otub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). A-130-A, a close analog of NCMC, also inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and induced autophagy, and both A-130-A and NCMC increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as enhanced the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). To examine a wide variety of signaling pathways that may be affected downstream of NCMC, we performed a phospho-kinase array analysis to measure the phosphorylation of 37 kinases at a total of 43 different sites and the total protein expression of β-catenin and HSP60. Seven kinases, including FYN, HSPB1, MAPK1, MAPK3, STAT5A, STAT5B, and PTK2, were selected and further tested because their phosphorylated protein was reduced by NCMC treatment, and all were relatively abundant in HSCs. When depleted individually in HSCs from multiple donors, most of these kinases reduced <italic>COL1A1</italic> level consistently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that each may play a role in mediating NCMC’s effect on collagen expression. It is unclear why STAT5A siRNAs, which effectively depleted <italic>STAT5A</italic> but also reduced <italic>STAT5B</italic> mRNA level, did not significantly affect <italic>COL1A1</italic> expression, considering that reduction of <italic>STAT5B</italic> alone to a similar level by STAT5B siRNAs did demonstrate an inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that the expression of STAT5B protein is inhibited more efficiently in HSCs transfected with STAT5B siRNAs than those transfected with STAT5A siRNAs despite the similar mRNA levels. STAT5A/B homo- and heterodimers could have different individual DNA-binding specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurer et al., 2019</xref>), and the ratio of homo- to heterodimers could also affect transcription of the <italic>COL1A1</italic> gene.</p><p>Our investigations of FYN revealed that depletion or inhibition of FYN activity suppresses collagen expression in primary human HSCs and deposition of collagen in the ECM, but regulation via FYN did not explain all the effects observed with NCMC. The regulation of collagen expression by FYN is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating that FYN depletion and inhibition in the presence of TGF-β reduces collagen I expression in immortalized human and rat HSC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2020</xref>). This study also observed that FYN depletion and inhibition in the presence of TGF-β reduced HSC migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2020</xref>), however, our data did not show a consistent effect on migration with depletion of FYN. As cell migration is controlled by a complex signaling network, the difference in the basal activity of the signaling pathways up- or down-stream of FYN may account for the observed differences. In contrast, PTK2 and MAPK1/3 depletion showed a more robust and consistent inhibitory effect among all HSC lines tested, suggesting that these kinases may serve as the critical nodes regulating HSC migration. Depletion or inhibition of FYN or MAPK suppresses HSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pagès et al., 1993</xref>), and PTK2 regulates proliferation in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is likely that modulation of multiple kinases contributes to the anti-fibrotic effect of NCMC, although the involvement of each kinase may vary depending on the cellular context.</p><p>We found that NCMC increases cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although it has not been demonstrated experimentally, it is suspected that NCMC may increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by disrupting Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitors identified in our screen can also increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian and Xie, 2008</xref>), and increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been observed to inhibit MAPK1/3 in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuderland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 1997</xref>). As a ubiquitous second messenger with wide-ranging physiological roles, cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may be a key factor mediating the downstream anti-fibrotic activity of NCMC, but further investigations are needed to unravel the complete signaling cascade.</p><p>NCMC has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in a model where breast cancer cells were injected subcutaneously and a multiple myeloma subcutaneous xenograft model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Using the same administration method as described by Huang et al. (1 mg/kg NCMC delivered via intra-peritoneal injection) and increasing the dosing frequency to once daily, we were unable to detect NCMC in liver or muscle, while we observed increased concentrations of NCMC in fat compared to plasma. Our in vitro experiments with mouse liver microsomes support metabolization of NCMC in hepatocytes, which may counteract a potential local depot formation in the liver. As NCMC is not detectable in the liver and has a low plasma concentration with high plasma protein binding, we expect HSC exposure to NCMC to be very low. Consequently, chemical modifications of NCMC are needed to come to a drug suitable for the investigation of liver fibrosis in vivo. It is worth screening chemical modifications of NCMC for a more drug-like derivative in the future. Alternatively, molecules similar in structure to NCMC may be evaluated to identify additional compounds with similar activity in HSCs and greater metabolic stability.</p><p>Interestingly, salinomycin, another polyether ionophore, has been reported to protect hepatocytes against CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Salinomycin was tested in our primary screen and showed a modest effect on lipid accumulation but did not reach the cutoff for selection. A pharmacokinetic study of salinomycin revealed rapid metabolism by liver microsomes and showed that CYP3A4 is the major metabolizing enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Resham et al., 2015</xref>). Concomitant administration of ketoconazole, a selective CYP3A4 inhibitor with salinomycin in rats increased the systemic exposure of salinomycin to seven fold and the C<sub>max</sub> to three fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Resham et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that in vivo pharmacokinetics of polyether ionophores could also be improved via concomitant inhibition of the metabolizing enzyme.</p><p>In summary, this study has identified NCMC as a compound that increases cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulates multiple kinases, including FYN, PTK2, and MAPK1/3 to drive the inactivation of HSC myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Targeting an individual component of this complex network may suppress certain cellular activities and contribute to HSC inactivation, but it may be necessary to synergistically manipulate multiple targets to achieve antifibrotic effects among genetic diversity, as observed with responses in multiple primary human HSC lines. By regulating multiple signaling pathways, NCMC confers a more robust impact than observed with inhibition of only one pathway, and with structural modifications to improve delivery to the liver, similar compounds could represent a more effective strategy to reduce the progression of liver fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FYN (dominant negative mutant with Y213A mutation)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Amplified from the Addgene plasmid pRK5 DN-Fyn</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene plasmid pRK5 DN-Fyn (#16033)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK-293</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-1573</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary human hepatic stellate cells (donor 1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Isolated from human nonparenchymal liver cells (NPCs) purchased from Lonza (cat# HUCNP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lonza ID: 4105</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Age: 45;

On day 3, 100 nL/well of compounds from the libraries were transferred by a stainless-steel pin array and Seiko compound transfer robot to the assay plates in duplicates. On day 5, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted with DPBS from 16% stock, Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat# 15710) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were washed one time with DPBS and incubated with Bodipy 493/503 (0.25 μg/mL, Invitrogen, cat# D3922) and Hoechst (5 μg/mL, Invitrogen, cat# H1399) for 45 min at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with DPBS, and then 50 µl/well DPBS was added before sealing the plates with adhesive foil cover. The plates were imaged using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal (Molecular Devices) at the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB)-Longwood screening facility. Images of each well were analyzed using MetaXpress software to calculate the percentage of positive cells (the total number of Bodipy-positive cells [cutoff was adjusted for each plate] divided by the total cell count).</p><p>We developed a scoring system to rank the strength of a compound in inducing HSC reversion to the inactive phenotype. A score was calculated as follows: 1. Averaged percent positive cells from duplicates was used to calculate the distance from the baseline of the plate (percentile 75%), 2. Toxicity was penalized (the distance from the average number of cells in the compound wells to the number of cells in the nortriptyline wells), and 3. Poor reproducibility was penalized (the error of the two points to the average value of the duplicates). The score was then normalized using nortriptyline and DMSO scores for each plate. A new parameter was calculated termed ‘Scaled’ with the formula: Scaled = –1*(median (nortriptyline)-score)/abs(median (nortriptyline)-median(DMSO)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Consolidation of screening library</title><p>Chemical structures of the screening library were consolidated using the data science workflow software BIOVIA Pipeline Pilot. Protonation states of the structures were standardized, and counter ions were eliminated. We used canonical Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) as a unique linear textual representation of the chemical structure. This way, the initial 15,867 structures could be mapped onto 7696 unique canonical SMILES of which 4329 are represented by a single well in the library and 3367 occur in up to 19 wells. Multiple occurrences of individual canonical SMILES could be traced to multiple vendors and/or multiple molar concentrations of the individual probes.

The final incubation volume of 100 µl per time point contains TRIS buffer pH 7.6 at room temperature (0.1 M), magnesium chloride (5 mM), microsomal protein (0.5 mg/ml) and NCMC at a final concentration of 1 µM. Following a short pre-incubation period at 37 °C, the reactions were initiated by addition of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH, 1 mM) and terminated by transferring an aliquot into solvent after different time points. Additionally, the NADPH-independent degradation was monitored in incubations without NADPH, terminated at the last time point. The quenched incubations were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 g, 5 min). An aliquot of the supernatant was assayed by LC-MS/MS for the amount of NCMC. The half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> in vitro) is determined by the slope of the semilogarithmic plot of the concentration-time profile. The intrinsic clearance (CL_INTRINSIC) is calculated by considering the amount of protein in the incubation:</p><p>CL_INTRINSIC [µl/min/mg protein] = (Ln 2 / (half-life [min] * protein content [mg/ml])) * 1,000.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>MB is an employee of Boehringer Ingelheim</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>AS is an employee of Boehringer Ingelheim</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>JFD is an employee of Boehringer Ingelheim</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf6"><p>JFR is an employee of Boehringer Ingelheim</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf7"><p>ACM receives funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline for unrelated projects and is a consultant for Circ Bio and Third Rock Ventures</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Housing of the animals as well as the animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Animal Welfare Act (Directive 2010/63/EU) and the derived German Animal Welfare act (TierSchG) and Animal welfare directive (TierSchVersV).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Pau Sancho-Bru (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The primary concern shared by all three reviewers is the lack of an in vivo model to test the therapeutic efficacy of Nanchangmycin in modulating hepatic fibrosis. Specifically, an in vivo model of hepatic fibrosis to test clinical efficacy of this compound is absolutely essential for consideration of publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a thorough investigation of the anti-fibrotic activity of nanchangmycin. The authors utilize multiple different in vitro and ex vivo model systems to show nanchangmycin inhibits proliferation, migration and activation of HSCs. While the authors do a convincing job demonstrating these effects, the lack of an in vivo model to test the therapeutic potential of this compound limits enthusiasm for publication at this moment. For example, would nanchangmycin be successful at reversing CCL4 induced fibrosis in a rodent model? These data are needed to justify the clinical potential of nanchangmycin.

We first performed pharmacokinetic studies to estimate the dose necessary to achieve a NCMC concentration in the liver that approaches the effective concentration that inhibits fibrotic activity in HSCs. However, our in vivo PK analysis show that NCMC does not accumulate to detectable levels in the liver, even after four consecutive days of dosing. In addition, hepatic microsome experiments show that hepatocytes can also metabolize NCMC.</p><p>Therefore, it highly unlikely that NCMC will be a viable antifibrotic compound without modifications that increase NCMC concentrations in the liver. We discussed in the manuscript that screening of NCMC derivatives and analogs may yield a more-drug like compound with similar activity that could have greater therapeutic potential. Although modifying NCMC or screening of structurally similar compounds is out of scope for this study, our data 1. provide a resource where a large collection of compounds was tested for potential anti-fibrotic activities in primary human HSCs; 2. highlight NCMC as a potent compound that inactivates HSCs and suggest the potential activity of compounds with similar structures; 3. propose that multiple kinases play a role in the regulation of HSC activity, which may need to be targeted simultaneously to achieve sufficient inhibition of HSC’s fibrotic phenotype; and therefore extend our understanding on the regulation of HSC activities and will inspire future studies in the field of liver and fibrosis research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Would be important to provide more information on the data presented in the Supplementary tables and maybe an interpretation guide, so the readers can look for specific compounds.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

We highlighted these 19 compounds in the manuscript because they demonstrated a better DRC score than our positive control compound nortriptyline. The full screen results are provided as supplementary tables to allow others to filter based on their need to identify other promising compounds. We have also improved labeling in these supplemental tables to make them more user friendly as discussed above. We have revised in the Discussion section on page 17 to address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The kinase study is not convincing, and differences observed in the array are very modest. Basically, I am not sure about the design of the study, I believe results would be more clear stimulating the cells to enhance activation/migration and then evaluating the effect of NCMC on kinase phosphorylation and effects.</p></disp-quote><p>HSCs are spontaneously activated when cultured on regular plastic cell culture dishes. Therefore, we did not further stimulate the cells to enhance activation/migration. We agree that the differences observed in the array are modest, and this is why we validated the function of these identified candidates with further experiments (e.g., knockdown experiments) in HSCs from multiple donors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To finally prove the antifibrogenic effect of NCMC on liver fibrosis and increase the impact of the paper, the authors could incorporate a relevant disease model in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in vivo data would be helpful. We first performed pharmacokinetic studies to estimate the dose necessary to achieve a NCMC concentration in the liver that approaches the effective concentration that inhibits fibrotic activity in HSCs. However, our in vivo PK analysis show that NCMC does not accumulate to detectable levels in the liver, even after four consecutive days of dosing. In addition, hepatic microsome experiments show that hepatocytes can also metabolize NCMC.</p><p>Therefore, it highly unlikely that NCMC will be a viable antifibrotic compound without modifications that increase NCMC concentrations in the liver. We discussed in the manuscript that screening of NCMC derivatives and analogs may yield a more-drug like compound with similar activity that could have greater therapeutic potential. Although modifying NCMC or screening of structurally similar compounds is out of scope for this study, our data 1. provide a resource where a large collection of compounds was tested for potential anti-fibrotic activities in primary human HSCs; 2. highlight NCMC as a potent compound that inactivates HSCs and suggest the potential activity of compounds with similar structures; 3. propose that multiple kinases play a role in the regulation of HSC activity, which may need to be targeted simultaneously to achieve sufficient inhibition of HSC’s fibrotic phenotype; and therefore extend our understanding on the regulation of HSC activities and will inspire future studies in the field of liver and fibrosis research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p></disp-quote><p>In vivo validation of Nanchangmycin for liver fibrosis models is strongly recommended.</p><p>We agree that in vivo data would be helpful.
