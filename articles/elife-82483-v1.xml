Several studies have defined the complement of proteins that change subcellular location in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> following chemically induced DNA replication stress using methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or hydroxyurea (HU). How these protein movements are regulated remains largely unexplored. We find that the essential checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53 are responsible for regulating the subcellular localization of 159 proteins during MMS-induced replication stress. Unexpectedly, Rad53 regulation of the localization of 52 proteins is independent of its known kinase activator Mec1, and in some scenarios independent of Tel1 or the mediator proteins Rad9 and Mrc1. We demonstrate that Rad53 is phosphorylated and active following MMS exposure in cells lacking Mec1 and Tel1. This noncanonical mode of Rad53 activation depends partly on the retrograde signaling transcription factor Rtg3, which also facilitates proper DNA replication dynamics. We conclude that there are biologically important modes of Rad53 protein kinase activation that respond to replication stress and operate in parallel to Mec1 and Tel1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>protein localization</kwd><kwd>cell cycle checkpoint</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>retrograde signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-159913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name><name><surname>Loll-Krippleber</surname><given-names>Raphael</given-names></name><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>Nikko P</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Grant W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGS-D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM141159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanford</surname><given-names>Ethan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Smolka</surname><given-names>Marcus B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retrograde signaling activates the Rad53 checkpoint kinase independently of the canonical DNA replication stress response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA replication machinery serves to faithfully duplicate the genome in a highly regulated manner. Consistent with DNA replication being an essential cellular process, failure to replicate the genome leads to several physiological defects, including development disorders, neurodegeneration, growth defects, and predisposition to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ubhi and Brown, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). Endogenous and exogenous forms of DNA damage can act as obstacles that impair the processivity of the replication fork machinery, resulting in DNA replication stress. Chemically inducing methylation of nucleotide bases with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or depleting the nucleotide levels within a cell using hydroxyurea (HU) have both been shown to stall the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicioli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tercero et al., 2003</xref>). All forms of replication stress result in stretches of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is rapidly coated with replication protein A complex (RPA), the signal for replication checkpoint activation.</p><p>The eukaryotic replication checkpoint serves to promote survival in conditions of replication stress by preventing cell-cycle progression and increasing nucleotide levels to allow for proper DNA repair. In the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, RPA-coated ssDNA is recognized and bound by Ddc2, which recruits its binding partner and an essential replication checkpoint kinase, Mec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pardo et al., 2017</xref>). Several protein factors at stressed forks, including the Rad17/Mec3/Ddc1 complex and Dpb11, activate and/or potentiate Mec1 kinase activity. Mec1 subsequently phosphorylates histone H2A at Ser129, promoting the recruitment of a mediator protein Rad9, which is then phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>). Mec1 can also phosphorylate the checkpoint mediator and component of the replication fork complex Mrc1, which causes dissociation from Pol ε and mediates Rad53 phosphorylation by Mec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcasabas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). Both mediators are capable of binding Rad53 to increase its local protein concentration, stimulating Rad53 trans-autophosphorylation and full activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branzei and Foiani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2014</xref>). Hyperphosphorylated Rad53 then amplifies and transduces the signal cascade through several of its substrates, including another checkpoint kinase, Dun1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Numerous replication stress and DNA repair proteins organize into multiprotein complexes that can be observed as discrete nuclear foci using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lisby et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>). This regulated re-localization of proteins is a key feature of the replication checkpoint response. Indeed, several proteins involved in Mec1 activation (Ddc1, Ddc2, and Dpb11) form subnuclear foci when cells are treated with MMS or HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonilla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the spatiotemporal organization of recombination repair proteins into foci has proven to be a valuable tool in dissecting the genetic requirements for the order of assembly of repair foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>). Several studies have expanded on the repertoire of proteins that relocalize during replication stress by utilizing the budding yeast GFP collection to systematically probe protein subcellular location during replication stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dénervaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mazumder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>). We previously assessed protein location by manual inspection after treatment with HU or MMS and observed 254 proteins changing localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, protein movement involved almost every cellular compartment, covering 10 localization categories, with many localizations not involving the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, we, and others, have identified two distinct classes of nuclear foci. These include the DNA damage repair foci linked to DNA repair processes, and the intranuclear quality control compartments (INQ) involved in the turnover of replication stress factors, demonstrating that protein localization can provide insight into functional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>). While replication stress-induced protein localization has been well documented and has provided functional insight, the details of how these movements are regulated remains elusive.</p><p>Mec1 and Rad53 have a combined total of ~1200 protein targets that they phosphorylate during replication stress and DNA damage conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lanz et al., 2018</xref>), and are therefore prime candidates for regulators of protein localization changes during replication stress. In this study, we investigate how Mec1 and Rad53 control protein localization dynamics. We employ a high-throughput confocal imaging platform to monitor subcellular location changes of 322 proteins known to relocalize during MMS or HU treatment. We find that checkpoint signaling is responsible for 159 (49%) of the protein localization changes observed. Our analyses also reveal an unexpected subset of proteins whose proper subcellular localization depends on Rad53 yet is independent of the known canonical upstream activators of Rad53. Finally, we demonstrate that Rtg3 promotes phosphorylation of Rad53 during replication stress, revealing a biological connection between retrograde signaling and the DNA replication stress checkpoint response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Checkpoint kinases regulate replication stress-induced protein localization changes</title><p>Mec1 and Rad53 are essential checkpoint kinases that initiate and propagate the replication checkpoint signal to effector proteins via phosphorylation, with Rad53 directly phosphorylated by Mec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous studies have identified 322 proteins that change subcellular location following replication stress, relocalizing with varying dynamics following MMS and HU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dénervaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mazumder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srikumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Considering that these proteins are enriched for MMS-dependent phosphorylation targets, we assessed the role of the essential checkpoint kinases on their re-localization. We used Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) to introduce <italic>MEC1</italic> or <italic>RAD53</italic> null mutations<italic>,</italic> in addition to an <italic>SML1</italic> deletion required for cell survival, into an array of 322 strains, each expressing one of the GFP-protein fusions previously found to relocalize during replication stress. The resulting strains were imaged by high-throughput confocal microscopy and protein localization was computationally quantified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and imaged over four hours following 0.03% MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For each time point, the proportion of cells in the population with a protein-GFP localization change after MMS treatment was calculated using a computational image analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Importantly, the analysis method includes normalization to the median cellular GFP signal to minimize the influence of protein abundance changes on identification of localization change events. To facilitate comparisons among the control and the checkpoint mutants, the percent maximum value (% max) was calculated, normalizing each timepoint to the maximum percent of cells for a given protein re-localization across the three screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We also compared each mutant screen to the control screen by calculating log<sub>2</sub> ratios of localization percentage values (% max) for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To reveal proteins with similar re-localization patterns, we clustered the resulting measurements for all three screens together using a <italic>k-</italic>means algorithm such that proteins with similar localization trajectories were grouped together. The analysis converged on seven <italic>k</italic>-means clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53 regulate protein re-localization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A simplified schematic of replication checkpoint activation in yeast.

The MMS-induced re-localizations of the 40 proteins in cluster <italic>k</italic> = 5 depends on both <italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>RAD53</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), indicating that those proteins are downstream of the replication stress signal transduced by Mec1 to Rad53 to target protein. The 39 proteins in cluster <italic>k</italic> = 7 showed decreased re-localization only when <italic>MEC1</italic> was deleted, suggesting that these proteins are regulated by Mec1 but not by Rad53. As an example, the localization of Ddc2 to nuclear foci depends on <italic>MEC1</italic> but not on <italic>RAD53</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with previous analysis indicating that Ddc2 localization is regulated by Mec1 and not by Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melo et al., 2001</xref>). Two proteins (Rad50, Rfa1) in cluster <italic>k</italic> = 7 were identified as Mec1 targets in phosphoproteomic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>), and four (Mms21, Msh3, Nej1, Rad50) contain SQ/TQ motifs, which are consensus sites for Mec1 phosphorylation. Thus, cluster <italic>k</italic> = 7 contains proteins that are subject to Mec1 regulation, independent of Rad53. In total, 56% (159/284) of the proteins that change intracellular location (at least twofold change in percentage of cells with re-localization relative to wild-type at the corresponding time point) in response to MMS-induced DNA replication stress are regulated, either directly or indirectly, by the checkpoint kinase cascade in the expected fashion: their re-localization either depends on <italic>MEC1</italic> alone or depends on both <italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>RAD53</italic>. We further noted that the proteins with reduced localization in checkpoint mutants are found in 12 of the 15 subcellular compartments represented in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data suggest that the replication checkpoint kinases regulate a global protein localization response following replication stress, with targets that are not solely restricted to the nuclear compartment.</p><p>We also noted that deletion of either kinase can result in proteins exhibiting increased re-localization, particularly in the absence of DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). For example, Top3 nuclear focus formation was increased when <italic>MEC1</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The 36 proteins in cluster <italic>k</italic> = 6, on average, show increased re-localization in <italic>mec1</italic>∆ even at t = 0. Similarly, the 39 proteins in cluster <italic>k</italic> = 7 show increased re-localization in <italic>rad53</italic>∆ that is evident in the absence of replication stress. A likely explanation for the increased spontaneous re-localization that we observe is that deletion of either kinase causes increased DNA replication stress, a phenomenon that has been documented extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brush et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Kolodner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craven et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Motegi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Myung and Kolodner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pennaneach and Kolodner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shimada et al., 2002</xref>). Cells respond to genetically induced replication stress by activating the checkpoint response in the absence of the chemical stress inducer MMS. Ninety-six proteins show increased re-localization at t = 0 in a checkpoint kinase mutant, including a host of proteins that repair stressed and collapsed DNA replication forks, further emphasizing that DNA replication stress is present in checkpoint mutants and revealing a cohort of proteins that respond to the elevated stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rad53 functions during replication stress when Mec1 is absent</title><p>An unexpected and striking category of re-localization involved the 52 proteins in cluster <italic>k</italic> = 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which displayed reduced re-localization when Rad53 is absent, but were largely unaffected by <italic>mec1</italic>∆. Mec1 has long been recognized as the predominant upstream activator of Rad53. Studies in vitro have unambiguously shown that Mec1 phosphorylates Rad53 and promotes the trans-autophosphorylation of Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicioli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sweeney et al., 2005</xref>). In the absence of Mec1, activation of Rad53 by replication stress or DNA damage is not detected by standard protein kinase assays or by the characteristic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE that accompanies Rad53 activation.

We tested whether Rad54 protein levels are reduced in <italic>rad53</italic>Δ cells after MMS treatment, which could explain the decrease in nuclear Rad54 foci.

In the absence of mediator function the re-localization of Rad54 is unaffected, consistent with Rad54 re-localization being independent of signaling from Mec1/Tel1 to Rad53. Together, our data suggest that Rad54 focus formation depends on a pathway that transduces the signal elicited by MMS treatment to the checkpoint kinase Rad53 without a requirement for Mec1 and Tel1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rad53 kinase activity is required for Rad54 focus formation</title><p>We next considered the domains of Rad53 that could promote protein re-localization without activation by Mec1/Tel1 and the mediators Mrc1 and Rad9. Since canonical activation of Rad53 was not essential for Rad54 re-localization, it was possible that a kinase-independent function of Rad53 was involved. In addition to its kinase domain, Rad53 contains two forkhead-associated domains at its N- and C-terminal ends, termed FHA1 and FHA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bashkirov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Durocher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liao et al., 1999</xref>). FHA1 functions in binding some Rad53 substrates, and FHA2 is important for interaction with Rad9 and subsequent Rad53 activation by trans-autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Durocher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Durocher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pike et al., 2003</xref>).

Interestingly, mutation of FHA2 had only a modest effect, again consistent with the canonical Mec1-mediator axis of Rad53 activation playing at best a minor role in Rad54 re-localization.

Rad53 fused with a 10X-FLAG epitope was expressed from its native locus, and cells were treated with MMS.

Even in the absence of Mec1 and Tel1, phosphorylation was detected within the kinase and SCD2 domains of Rad53, including serine 480, which is a Mec1 S/T-Q consensus site in the SCD2 domain that promotes Rad53 activity when phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). Our data show that S480 can be phosphorylated by a kinase distinct from Mec1 and Tel1.

An additional four sites were reduced by at least 1.5-fold (T563, S745, S489, and S475). Notably, three of these sites (S473, S480, and S489) are Mec1/Tel1 consensus phosphorylation sites, and S480 and S489 are located within the Rad53 SCD2 domain, which is important for Rad53 oligomerization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma and Stern, 2008</xref>). Perhaps surprisingly, we did not detect changes in phosphorylation at T358. One possible reason may be the presence of redundant activities that promote T358 phosphorylation. Nevertheless, our data provide concrete evidence that the RTG pathway promotes phosphorylation of Rad53 on activation-relevant sites, in the absence of Mec1, consistent with the RTG pathway providing an unrecognized mode of Rad53 activation that can function in parallel to canonical Mec1-dependent Rad53 activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Rad53 phosphorylation is reduced when Rtg3 is absent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rad53-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from <italic>mec1</italic>∆ <italic>sml1</italic>∆ cells with or without <italic>rtg3</italic>∆, phosphopeptides were enriched, and quantified by SILAC-MS.

By measuring replication stress-induced protein re-localizations in <italic>mec1</italic>Δ and <italic>rad53</italic>Δ cells, we showed that the checkpoint kinases coordinate a global protein re-localization response and regulate the movement of 159 proteins during replication stress. Most importantly, the proper localization of 52 proteins depends on Rad53, but not on the upstream kinases or mediator proteins of the replication checkpoint signaling cascade. We show that the RTG signaling pathway contributes to this novel mode of Rad53 activation. We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) where cells with an impaired replication checkpoint (i.e., <italic>mec1</italic>Δ cells) sense and respond to MMS-induced damage via the RTG pathway, resulting in nuclear accumulation of Rtg3. Since Rtg3 is a transcription factor, we postulate that Rtg3 regulates the expression of a kinase or kinases capable of phosphorylating Rad53. Alternatively, Rtg3 may function as a scaffold that promotes Rad53 dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation. The resulting phosphorylation of Rad53 appears to sustain at least a subset of Rad53 functions. How DNA replication stress is sensed by the RTG pathway, and the additional effectors that function in this pathway, remains to be discovered.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Rad53 functions independently of canonical replication checkpoint signaling</title><p>Even though the replication checkpoint has been studied extensively, we suggest that Rad53 can be activated in the absence of its known activators, Mec1 and Tel1. Consistent with our inference, independent lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Rad53 exhibits genome stability functions independently of Mec1 and Tel1. In unperturbed cell cycles, <italic>rad53</italic>Δ cells display slower S-phase progression than <italic>mec1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manfrini et al., 2012</xref>), an effect that we also observed during replication stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Rad53 is recruited to replication fork proximal sites independently of the mediator Mrc1, suggestive of checkpoint-independent Rad53 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheu et al., 2021</xref>). Rad53 also binds to gene promoters independently of Mrc1 and Mec1, again indicating Rad53 function independent of Mec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheu et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>MEC1</italic> and <italic>RAD53</italic> have genetically distinct roles in stabilizing stressed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lanz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Segurado and Diffley, 2008</xref>), although Mec1-independent function of Rad53 was not noted. Finally, Rad53 function in the degradation of excess histones is Mec1-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>). We demonstrated that Rad53 is phosphorylated in MMS-induced DNA replication stress in cells lacking Mec1 and Tel1. Two sites were of particular interest: (1) a canonical S/T-Q phosphorylation site at Ser480 in the SCD2 domain, known to be important for Rad53 oligomerization, and (2) an autophosphorylation site at Thr358 that, when mutated to alanine, severely compromises full Rad53 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma and Stern, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2014</xref>). Our data are consistent with a model in which Rad53 kinase can contribute to replication stress resistance even in the absence of its main activators, Mec1 and Tel1. However, it remains to be seen whether Mec1-independent activation of Rad53 is present constitutively or is only active when canonical checkpoint signaling is compromised. At present, we cannot distinguish between Mec1-independent activation of Rad53 being an acute response or a longer-term adaptation. We note, however, that the Mec1-independent Rad53 activation phenomenon is observed in independently constructed <italic>mec1</italic>∆ strains without a need for long-term passaging of cells and is observed in <italic>rad9</italic>∆ and <italic>mrc1-AQ</italic> contexts where cell growth is not compromised as it is in <italic>mec1</italic>∆.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mec1-independent activation of Rad53 occurs through dimerization and phosphorylation</title><p>The typical mode for Rad53 activation requires its phosphorylation-dependent interaction with checkpoint mediator proteins Mrc1 or Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Durocher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sweeney et al., 2005</xref>). Upon replication stress, Mec1 is recruited to and activated at RPA-coated ssDNA, where it then phosphorylates Rad9, among many other targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rouse and Jackson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). Mec1 phosphorylation enables Rad9 binding to the Rad53 FHA2 domain. Mec1 then phosphorylates several residues in the Rad53 SCD1 domain, resulting in the oligomerization, autophosphorylation, and full activation of Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanchez et al., 1999</xref>). Our data indicate that Mec1-independent activation of Rad53 occurs in a similar manner. The phosphorylation at Ser480 of Rad53 that we detect in the absence of Mec1 promotes oligomerization, and phosphorylation at Thr358 of Rad53 in the absence of Mec1 indicates that dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation has occurred. Since Rad9 and Mrc1 are not required for the Mec1-independent Rad53 activity that we observe, we propose that additional factors serve to increase the local concentration of Rad53 enough to promote oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation. Concentration-dependent activation of Rad53 has been observed upon overexpression of Rad53 in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>), consistent with local concentration of Rad53 being sufficient to cause at least partial activation. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that a portion of total Rad53 protein can locally concentrate, activate, and exert its functions, independently of the canonical checkpoint activating factors Mec1, Tel1, Rad9, and Mrc1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Rtg3 functions to maintain genome stability</title><p>Changes in the mitochondrial state, or its dysfunction, activate a transcriptional program that adjusts metabolic activities and stress responses and is termed retrograde (RTG) regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giannattasio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jazwinski, 2013</xref>). In yeast, Rtg1 and Rtg3 are basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcriptional activators that translocate into the nucleus when cells experience mitochondrial dysfunction. Rtg2 is another key protein component of the RTG signaling pathway and is required for Rtg1/3 nuclear accumulation. RTG signaling integrates with another signaling pathway that senses intracellular stress, the TOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crespo et al., 2002</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that RTG signaling is also involved in genome maintenance. Most strikingly, our finding that Rtg3 contributes to Rad53 phosphorylation status implicates retrograde response factors in replication checkpoint signaling, Rad53 function, and cellular fitness upon exposure to DNA replication stress.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the notion that retrograde signaling impinges upon genome integrity pathways. Rtg2 inhibits the formation of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles (ERC), a form of genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borghouts et al., 2004</xref>). ERCs arise from recombination events between distal sites within a chromosome and are self-replicating episomes of ribosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stults et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szostak and Wu, 1980</xref>). Accumulation of ERCs has been correlated with yeast aging, and circular DNAs capable of driving genetic heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance are abundant in certain human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koche et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). Our understanding of circular DNA biogenesis, regulation, and function is far from complete. Nevertheless, the connection between Rtg2 and ERCs suggests roles for retrograde signaling in the maintenance of genome integrity.</p><p>Rtg3 also cooperates with Ino4 to regulate the expression of metabolism genes after MMS exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Workman et al., 2006</xref>). TCA cycle regulation, threonine biosynthesis, and permease trafficking pathways coordinate with one another to buffer dNTP pools, suggesting an indirect role of RTG in maintaining proper cellular nucleotide levels, which are crucial for normal DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koche et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, <italic>rtg1, rtg3,</italic> and <italic>rtg3</italic> deletion mutants exhibit severe growth defects in conditions of nucleotide limitation and have reduced levels of cellular dNTPs. In contrast, <italic>RTG3</italic> overexpression induces ribonucleotide reductase expression, further linking <italic>RTG3</italic> to dNTP pool regulation (our unpublished data). Consistent with a role in replication, Rtg3 was identified in a genome-wide search for factors that facilitate replication of long inter-origin gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Theis et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, we found that Rtg3 promotes proper S-phase progression. Like RTG signaling, Rad53 has essential roles in elevating dNTP levels for repair, preventing late origin firing, and phosphorylating Mrc1 to antagonize CMG helicase unwinding and slow the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McClure and Diffley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morafraile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morafraile et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Szyjka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsaponina et al., 2011</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mec1-Independent Activation of the Rad53 Checkpoint Kinase Revealed by Quantitative Analysis of Protein Localization Dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Boris Pfander (Reviewer #1); Dirk Remus (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing Editor agree that the study is significant and well-conducted, and they support publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The identification of pathways responsible for Rad53 activation independently from Mec1 is particularly relevant to the fields of DNA repair, checkpoint, and genome stability. The identification of a crosstalk between the retrograde pathway and checkpoint activation is also an interesting and important addition to these fields.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Did rtg3∆ and 2∆ affect any other HR proteins besides Rad54? (mostly Reviewer 3 but also pointed out by Reviewer 1)</p><p>2. The readout used in the work was GFP signal intensity and not subcellular localization. The two could be correlated in some but not all cases. For example, increase in GFP intensity could reflect protein forming DNA repair foci or protein level increase. It will help increase the clarity of the work if the readout can be better defined in the text and the distinction can be made regarding changes of signal intensity vs protein localization (Reviewer 3).</p><p>3. It can be difficult to discern whether the observed changes of GFP signal intensity in a mutant reflected a direct effect OR a secondary response to the chronical loss of the protein, particularly when some mutants used in the work showed chronic growth defects. It would be useful to validate the main findings using degron alleles. For example, does degron-driven loss of Mec1/Tel1 also affected Rad54 foci levels less prominently than Rad53 loss (Reviewer 3)?</p><p>4. Figure 4, did rtg2∆ rad53∆ and rtg3∆ rad53∆ cells show similar reduction of Rad54-GFP signals as rad53∆ cells? Could the authors speculate why rtg2∆ but not rtg3∆ worsened Rad54 signal reduction in mec1∆ cells? (Reviewer 3)</p><p>5. Rad53 phosphorylation have only been tested in mec1 background. It is important to show what is the contribution of Rtgs to Rad53 phosphorylation in a WT background (Reviewers 1 and 3).</p><p>6. Provide more timepoints for the FACS profiles to better highlight the effect of Rtg3 deletion in replication progression (Reviewer 1 and 2)</p><p>7. Provide biological duplicates for Figure 2D and 2E (Reviewer 3)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study shows the power of yeast genetics when combined with modern quantitative imaging and mass spectrometry technology. I would ask the authors to address the following points prior to publication.</p><p>1. Rad53 phosphorylation have only been tested in mec1 background. I think it would be an important information to the reader to show what is the contribution of Rtgs in an otherwise WT background. Even if under these conditions Mec1-dependent phosphorylation would dominate that would be important information.</p><p>2. Despite the initial screening effort, the authors focus exclusively on Rad54 focus formation throughout the paper. Ideally, they would show some of the later findings of the paper for other factors to show universality of their findings. At least, however, they should discuss why they focused on Rad54 and what cellular activity they think Rad54 focus formation corresponds to.</p><p>3. Compared to the very high experimental standard throughout the paper, I was not too convinced by the assay measuring S phase progression and would suggest that it is repeated with more timepoints.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 5C: The data for the control and RTG3-deletion background appear to be duplicated in the left and right panel of this figure. I recommend combining the two panels into a single panel to avoid such duplication. This should not diminish the clarity of the result presentation.</p><p>Figure 5D: The effect of RTG3 deletion on the FACS profiles is rather minor and may also be influenced by a delayed release from the α-factor arrest. How reproducible are these effects? Also: Since the FACS profiles of the DNA content are likely dominated by origin firing, have the authors tried to look for effects on origin activity after replication stress in these different genetic backgrounds? While not strictly required, this could provide further support for a role of Rtg3 in controlling S phase progression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few suggestions to help clarify methods used and data interpretation.</p><p>1) The readout used in the work was GFP signal intensity and not subcellular localization. The two could be correlated in some but not all cases. For example, increase in GFP intensity could reflect protein forming DNA repair foci or protein level increase. It will help increase the clarity of the work if the readout can be better defined in the text and the distinction can be made regarding changes of signal intensity vs protein localization.</p><p>2) It can be difficult to discern whether the observed changes of GFP signal intensity in a mutant reflected a direct effect OR a secondary response to the chronical loss of the protein, particularly when some mutants used in the work showed chronic growth defects. It would be useful to validate the main findings using degron alleles. For example, does degron-driven loss of Mec1/Tel1 also affected Rad54 foci levels less prominently than Rad53 loss?</p><p>3) Figure 2D and 2E, please provide quantification results of Rad54-GFP protein levels among the strains examined using biological duplicates.</p><p>4) Figure 4, did rtg2∆ rad53∆ and rtg3∆ rad53∆ cells show similar reduction of Rad54-GFP signals as rad53∆ cells?

Despite the initial screening effort, the authors focus exclusively on Rad54 focus formation throughout the paper.

We used Rad54 focus formation after MMS treatment largely as a reporter/read out for the Rad53-dependent and Mec1-independent pathway that we were interested in characterizing further. Rad54 focus formation was robust, easily distinguishable, and readily quantifiable, making it a great reporter for further assays. In addition, Rad54 has important roles in DNA repair, making it an attractive protein for more detailed analyses. We have expanded on our rationale for focusing on Rad54 (lines 173-177).</p><p>Added text:</p><p>“In subsequent assays, we use Rad54 re-localization as an exemplar of Mec1-independent regulation by Rad53.

Finally, among these 37 genes, 6 were identified in our screen as causing a reduction in Rad54-GFP focus formation in a <italic>mec1∆ sml1∆</italic> mutant background, 4 of which encode kinases (<italic>CDC28</italic>, <italic>HOG1</italic>, <italic>STT4</italic>, <italic>PHO80</italic>).</p><p>Stt4 does not have any known connections to histone regulation or the replication stress response. Stt4 is a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase that regulates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis (Audhya, A., and Emr, S.D., 2002, doi: 10.1016/s1534-5807(02)00168-5; Baird, D. et al., 2008, doi: 10.1083/jcb.200804003) and has no known protein substrates.</p><p>Hog1 kinase is reported to control Rtg1/Rtg3 transcription complex activity, at least in conditions of osmotic stress. Importantly, Hog1 is required for proper Rtg3 localization to the nucleus (Ruiz-Roig, C., et al., 2012, doi: 10.1091/mbc.E12-04-0289). Therefore, decreases in Rad54-GFP focus formation in Hog1 mutants may be due to reduced Rtg3 function, rather than the direct phosphorylation of Rad53 by Hog1 itself.</p><p>Finally, Pho80 and Cdc28 are both cyclin-dependent kinases with connections to cell-cycle progression. In our initial validation studies of our hits from the kinome-associated screen, both Cdc28 and Pho80 mutants did not reduce Rad54-GFP foci to the levels of <italic>RTG3</italic> deletion mutants. Therefore, it unlikely that these kinases are individually regulated by Rtg3, at least in the context of Rad54 focus formation during MMS-induced replication stress.</p><p>We decided not to speculate on these kinases or any potential connections with histone regulation in our manuscript, focussing instead on studies that suggest RTG signalling roles in nucleotide metabolism and replication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
