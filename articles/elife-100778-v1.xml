We regret this error, and the correct graph has been added in this correction. Crucially, this change has no impact on the conclusions of the paper, as the text was written referring to a previous iteration of this figure with the correct graph. Thus, no changes to the main text were made relating to this error.</p><p>The corrected Figure 5 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100778-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The originally published Figure 5 is shown for reference:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100778-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, when we carefully examined the manuscript in light of the duplicated figure, we found that several of the figure legends were inaccurate, as they described previous iterations of the figures.
