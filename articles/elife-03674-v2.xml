Proper oscillation of the clock depends on the complex formation and periodic turnover of the Period and Cryptochrome proteins, which together inhibit their own transcriptional activator complex, CLOCK-BMAL1. We determined the crystal structure of the CRY-binding domain (CBD) of PER2 in complex with CRY2 at 2.8 Å resolution. PER2-CBD adopts a highly extended conformation, embracing CRY2 with a sinuous binding mode. Its N-terminal end tucks into CRY adjacent to a large pocket critical for CLOCK-BMAL1 binding, while its C-terminal half flanks the CRY2 C-terminal helix and sterically hinders the recognition of CRY2 by the FBXL3 ubiquitin ligase. Unexpectedly, a strictly conserved intermolecular zinc finger, whose integrity is important for clock rhythmicity, further stabilizes the complex. Our structure-guided analyses show that these interspersed CRY-interacting regions represent multiple functional modules of PERs at the CRY-binding interface.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03674.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03674.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03674.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Since the very simplest organisms emerged on earth, the rhythms of life have been synchronized with the rising and setting of the sun. Even the most basic life forms have internal clocks that help them to maintain daily routines and adapt to shifting seasons. In animals, these internal clocks regulate processes such as the release of hormones that wake an animal up and the expression of genes necessary to carry out the activities of daily life. Later on, the clocks then trigger the release of hormones that cause drowsiness and the expression of the genes that are active during rest.</p><p>In mammals, these internal circadian rhythms are maintained by a feedback loop governed by four key proteins. Two of these proteins—CLOCK and BMAL1—work together to begin a process called transcription, whereby sections of DNA are used as a template to copy the information needed to make a protein. The two activating proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 recognize the sections of DNA where the genes that are controlled by the circadian clock are located and selectively turn on the expression of those genes.</p><p>Expression of the two other key circadian proteins—Period and Cryptochrome—is switched on by CLOCK and BMAL1. As Period and Cryptochrome proteins accumulate, they begin to inhibit the activity of CLOCK and BMAL1, helping to reduce the rate at which the circadian genes are transcribed as the day progresses.</p><p>Nangle et al. provide new insights into how the Period and Cryptochrome proteins interact with each other, using X-ray crystallography to reveal the molecular level details of the bond between the two proteins. Period stretches out as it ‘embraces’ Cryptochrome. One end of the Period protein then tucks into part of the Cryptochrome structure that is next to a large pocket. This pocket is where the Cryptochrome protein binds to CLOCK and BMAL1, suggesting that Period can influence whether this binding occurs.</p><p>The other end of the Period protein covers one end of the Cryptochrome protein. By doing so, enzymes cannot bind there, and so cannot break down Cryptochrome. Nangle et al. also discovered that a finger-like projection that includes a zinc ion acts as a clasp, strengthening the bond between Period and Cryptochrome.</p><p>These findings help to demonstrate how Period proteins act as a timekeeper that regulates how long Cryptochrome can turn down the activity of CLOCK and BMAL1. A deeper understanding of the molecular choreography among the four clock proteins holds promise for developing medications to treat the sleep disorders and circadian clock disruptions associated with a modern lifestyle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03674.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03674.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>cryptochrome</kwd><kwd>period</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Joseph S</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM007750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nangle</surname><given-names>Shannon N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM090247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Carla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA107134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>X-ray crystallography reveals the structural framework for understanding the function of mammalian transcriptional repression in the cellular circadian clock.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life on Earth evolved a self-sustaining molecular timing system that synchronizes cellular activities with the solar day. This endogenous clockwork prepares an organism for periodic environmental fluctuations and coordinates numerous physiological and behavioral processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>). At the molecular level, the mammalian circadian clock operates through an auto-regulatory transcription–translation feedback loop composed of four core components—the transcriptional activator proteins, CLOCK and BMAL1, and the transcriptional repressors, Periods (PERs) and Cryptochromes (CRYs). The heterodimeric CLOCK and BMAL1 complex acts as the positive arm of the loop by recognizing E-box elements and promoting the expression of clock-controlled genes, including <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>, and <italic>Cry2</italic>. The PER and CRY proteins function as the negative arm of the loop by blocking the activity of CLOCK-BMAL1 and inhibiting the transcription of their own and all other clock-controlled genes. The cyclic accumulation, localization, and degradation of the PER and CRY proteins are necessary to manifest a 24-hr rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Earlier studies suggested that CRYs are the predominant inhibitors of CLOCK-BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kume et al., 1999</xref>). Independent of PERs, overexpressed CRY1 and CRY2 can each potently inhibit the CLOCK-BMAL1-induced transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kume et al., 1999</xref>). This transcriptional repression activity of CRYs likely occurs through their direct interactions with BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shearman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Partch et al., 2014</xref>) and CLOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the important repressor function of CRYs, the PER proteins have been suggested as the rate-limiting factor of the rhythmic negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). With its protein abundance tightly regulated during the circadian cycle, PERs mediate the formation of the PER-CRY complexes and their nuclear localization. Once in the nucleus, PERs might physically bridge CRYs and CLOCK-BMAL1 and promote their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The critical role of PERs in driving the molecular clock is underscored by the complete loss of circadian rhythmicity upon constitutive overexpression of PERs, but not CRY1, in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McCarthy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ye et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Periodic degradation of PERs and CRYs represents another crucial step in the negative feedback loop. The F-box proteins, β-TrCP and FBXL3, have been discovered as the key ubiquitin ligases, responsible for promoting the polyubiquitination of PERs and CRYs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shirogane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Godinho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Reischl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Siepka et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylation of a degron sequence serves as the signal for PER ubiquitination by β-TrCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shirogane et al., 2005</xref>), whereas recognition of CRYs by FBXL3 is made through a large protein-interaction interface without the involvement of a canonical degron motif or any post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xing et al., 2013</xref>). This CRY-FBXL3 interface is susceptible to disruption by both the CRY cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the PER proteins, which have been suggested to control the stability of CRYs by directly competing with FBXL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xing et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although genetic studies have firmly established a central role of PERs in clock regulation, the molecular mechanisms by which PERs orchestrate the dynamic clock protein network remain elusive. Binding of PERs to CRYs, CLOCK, and BMAL1 have been detected both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kiyohara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Partch et al., 2014</xref>). However, the role of PER2 in coordinating the repression complex assembly is controversial. In addition, how PER–CRY interaction might interfere with FBXL3 for CRY binding also remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of a PER2–CRY2 complex, which provides the missing structural framework for understanding the multiple functions of PERs in driving the molecular clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterizing PER–CRY interactions</title><p>Mammalian PER1 and PER2 share ∼50% sequence identity and a common domain architecture comprised of tandem N-terminal PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domains, a central CK1δ/ε-binding region, and a ∼100 amino acid long C-terminal CRY-binding domain (CBD), which is necessary and sufficient for CRY binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yagita et al., 2002</xref>). The isolated PER2 CBD can stabilize CRY1/2 in vivo and compete with FBXL3 for CRY1/2 binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xing et al., 2013</xref>).

To first characterize the PER–CRY interaction, we performed an alanine-scanning mutagenic analysis of PER2-CBD. We initially targeted stretches of residues strictly conserved among vertebrate PER1/2 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, none of the 10 single mutants, which were distributed along the length of the CBD, showed any detectable defect in CRY1 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The PER2–CRY1 interaction was only abolished when alanine mutations were simultaneously introduced to two adjacent stretches of residues in the C-terminal, but not N-terminal half of PER2-CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results suggested an unusual binding mode of PER2-CBD onto CRYs and the importance of the C-terminal half of the CBD in complex formation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03674.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of the murine CRY2–PER2 complex at 2.8 Å.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PER2 CBD sequence alignment. 49% of PER2 CBD residues interact with CRY2 (blue dots).

In the crystal, PER2-CBD meanders along one side of CRY2-PHR and sinuously wraps around the region. With nearly half of the PER2 residues involved in binding, the two proteins bury a total 2800 Å<sup>2</sup> of solvent accessible surface area at the interface, which stretches over a distance of more than 215 Å. This unusually extensive interface provides a plausible explanation for the high-affinity binding between the two clock proteins and their insensitivity to mutational disruption.</p><p>In comparison to its FBXL3-, KL001-, and FAD-complexed forms, CRY2 adopts the same global fold when bound to PER2-CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The largest structural variations take place in two local regions, the interface loop next to the FAD-binding pocket and a serine-rich loop neighboring a secondary pocket (see below). The majority of PER2-contacting residues on CRY2 (85%) are strictly conserved between mammalian CRY1 and CRY2, suggesting that the two cryptochrome proteins share a common PER2 binding mode.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Interaction at the CRY2 C-terminal helix</title><p>The two stretches of residues, whose alanine mutations abrogated CRY1 binding, are mapped to a loop flanked by two α-helical regions in the C-terminal half of PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The PER2-CBD α3 helix preceding this loop packs against the long CRY2 C-terminal helix at an approximately 30° angle, while the region C-terminal to the loop locks onto the same CRY2 helix from the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Together, these PER2-CBD structural elements encircle the CRY2 C-terminal helix like an U-shaped clamp. Arg501 and Lys503 in the CRY2 C-terminal helix have previously been documented to be important for PER2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ozber et al., 2010</xref>). In the crystal, these two positively charged residues of CRY2 project in opposite directions and latch onto the surrounding PER2 regions by forming salt bridges with Asp1167 and Asp1206, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To confirm the critical role of the CRY2 C-terminal helix in binding PERs, we mutated two hydrophobic residues, Ile505 and Tyr506, at the end of this CRY2 helix, which are involved in fixing the α-helix to the rest of the CRY2 α-helical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, mutating both residues to aspartate completely abolished the PER2-binding activity of CRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

In the crystal structure of the FBXL3-CRY2 complex, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of FBXL3 engages CRY2 at the same site as PER2-CBD does in the PER2-CRY2 complex. The interface between FBXL3-LRR and CRY2 is also centered around the long C-terminal helix of the Cryptochrome protein. In fact, the CRY2 surface regions involved in contacting FBXL3-LRR and PER2-CBD share extensive overlapping regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Superposition analysis reveals that FBXL3 and PER2 cannot be simultaneously engaged with CRY2 without clashing into each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). PERs, therefore, have the capability of protecting CRYs from FBXL3-mediated ubiquitination and degradation by directly competing with the ubiquitin ligase for binding CRYs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Intermolecular zinc finger</title><p>Amino acid sequence alignment of vertebrate PER1/2 orthologs reveals that their sequence conservation ends at a CXXC motif near the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Thus, the secondary pocket of CRYs represents an important docking site for the heterodimeric transcriptional activators.

Our structural and mutagenic analyses of the PER2-CBD-CRY2 complex reveal a surprisingly robust binary assembly, which is resilient to mutational disruption. This stable complex is enabled by an extended binding mode of PER2-CBD, which spreads several distinct functional modules over a mostly linear interface. The hallmark of the PER–CRY interactions is its steric incompatibility with the FBXL3–CRY complex, which provides the structural basis for the competition of PERs and the FBXL3 ubiquitin ligase for controlling CRY stability. Interestingly, distant from the FBXL3–CRY interface, PERs also anchor themselves next to the putative CLOCK-BMAL1-binding pocket of CRYs, possibly regulating a specific step of transcriptional repression. Despite intensive genetic and cell-based studies, the precise spatial and temporal steps undertaken by PERs to coordinate transcriptional repression in the molecular clockwork remain unclear. On the one hand, PERs have been reported to be essential for CRYs to interact with CLOCK-BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, emerging evidence suggests that PERs binding might interfere with complex formation between CRYs and CLOCK-BMAL1 at certain steps during repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akashi et al., 2014</xref>). Conceivably, by interacting with the CRY C-terminal helix, PERs could compete with the C-terminus of the BMAL1 transactivation domain for CRY binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czarna et al., 2011</xref>). While detailed biochemical studies are necessary to resolve this controversy, our results offer the structural framework for in-depth mechanistic investigations.</p><p>Apart from the PER2-CBD-CRY2 complex, the crystal structures of CRY2 have been determined for four additional functional states, apo, FAD-, FBXL3-, and KL001-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nangle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xing et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these structures outline a rich landscape for the functional surfaces of mammalian CRYs, which distinguishes them from other members of the cryptochrome/photolyase superfamily. In their C-terminal α-helical domain, CRYs feature the conserved FAD-binding pocket, which is also targeted by the FBXL3 C-terminal tail and the clock-modulating drug, KL001. In their N-terminal α/β photolyase domain, CRYs have evolved the secondary pocket into a critical site for CLOCK-BMAL1 binding. Importantly, both CRY surface pockets are demarcated by structural elements with noticeable structural plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). The FAD-binding pocket is framed by the phosphate-binding loop and the interface loop on opposite edges, whereas the secondary pocket is guarded by the serine loop on one side. With the exception of the phosphate-binding loop, both the interface and serine loop have been shown to directly mediate protein–protein interactions. Lastly, the extreme C-terminal α-helix of the mammalian CRYs presents yet another important surface area, which is responsible for the mutually exclusive binding of FBXL3 and PERs. Remarkably, all these molecular interacting sites likely represent an incomplete functional map of CRYs. Numerous mutants identified in our random mutagenesis screen of functionally deficient CRY1 and CRY2 bear mutations of amino acids located outside these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McCarthy et al., 2009</xref>). Future structural studies are needed to paint a complete picture of CRY functional surfaces.</p><p>Our crystal structure of the PER2-CBD-CRY2 complex unveils a structurally important intermolecular zinc finger, which might function as a stabilizing ‘molecular clasp’. Although the evolutionary significance of the zinc-coordinating residues is apparent, as evidenced by their strict conservation across vertebrates, the functional significance of this unusual binding interface requires further investigation. On the one hand, the intermolecular zinc finger might be an intermediate product of the still evolving PER–CRY interface. On the other hand, it is plausible that this special protein interaction interface confers sensitivity to the fluctuating abundance of intracellular zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), which might serve as a tissue-specific clock-modulating ion.</p><p>During the preparation of this manuscript, the complex structure of mammalian CRY1-PHR and PER2-CBD was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmalen et al., 2014</xref>). With high sequence conservation between CRY1 and CRY2, PER2-CBD adopts a similar CRY-binding mode with a tetrahedral coordination of a zinc ion by an intermolecular CCCH zinc-binding motif. The major structural difference lies at the interface of the N-terminal region of PER2-CBD and the CRY secondary pocket. The CRY1-bound PER2-CBD fragment contains a residual fusion-protein sequence, which forms an artifactual ß-hairpin with the first five amino acids of the PER2-CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast to the PER2-bound CRY2 serine loop, but reminiscent of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY antenna loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zoltowski et al., 2011</xref>), the otherwise disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czarna et al., 2013</xref>) CRY1 serine loop adopts an inward conformation and occludes the secondary pocket. This conformational difference reveals a substantial degree of structural plasticity, which might be necessary for differential binding and regulation at this site. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmalen et al. (2014)</xref> identified a potential redox sensor involving a disulfide bond near the zinc finger between Cys412 and Cys363, which modulates CRY1-PER2 binding. However, in our circadian reporter assay, we did not detect any difference between the CRY1 wild type and C412A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). More in-depth analyses can now exploit the specific structural differences between the two complexes to explain the non-redundant roles of the two Cryptochrome proteins.</p><p>True to their name, Period proteins act as the master timekeepers in the circadian clock pathway, and likely use their multiple functional modules to simultaneously mediate the negative and positive phases of the clock through CRY stability and CRY-CLOCK-BMAL1 repression complex assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant protein purification</title><p>The mouse CRY2 (amino acids 1–512) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in High Five (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) suspension insect cells and isolated by glutathione affinity chromatography using buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT (dithiothreitol).

To date, the mechanistic roles of these two repressor proteins have remained largely unclear. Recently, several studies suggested that the molecular clock machinery relies on a sophisticated spatio-temporal complex assembly between CRY, PER and CLOCK:BMAL1. In this paper, the authors solved the crystal structure of mCRY2 (1-512) in complex with an mPER2 CRY-binding domain (CBD 1095-1215). Based on the structure information and mutagenesis analysis, the authors concluded that: (1) The N terminal of CBD is anchored at the edge of CRY secondary pocket that might be critical for the interactions with CLOCK:BMAL1, thus supporting the biochemical analysis of the clock protein interactions during the repressive phase of the TTFL. (2) Binding of PER2 to CRY interferes the interactions between FBXL3 and CRY. (3) A intermolecular Zinc finger motif stabilizes the CRY:PER complex. The paper is of good quality. The detailed interactions described between CRY and PER provide valuable information for future study to elucidate the molecular clock machinery.</p><p>Minor comments to address:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> can be cited when the authors refer to the structural variations of the interface loop and a serine-rich loop.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref> can be cited when the authors refer to the role of PER2 Trp1139 (page 8, second paragraph) that may correspond to the PER2 PIW mutant.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, why is the band of CRY2H491A is missing in the input (lane 5, bottom panel)?</p><p>4) A crystal structure of mCRY1 (1-496) in complex with PER2 (1132-1252) has been published recently (Schmalen I et.al. 2014). The authors should cite this paper and comment on the similarities and differences between the two studies.</p><p>5) As mentioned by the authors, the interaction modes between PER, CRY and CLOCK:BMAL1 is controversial. The CRY1:PER2 structure paper from Eva Wolf lab (Schmalen I et.al. 2014) suggests that CRY C-terminal helix is involved in both the BMAL1 binding and PER binding supporting the improbability of a CRY-PER-CLOCK-BMAL1 complex.
