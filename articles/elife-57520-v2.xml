The BBB also protects the brain against the entry of leukocytes and potentially harmful substances, a function that is compromised in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, cancer, after stroke, or in response to physical brain damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arvanitis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lopes Pinheiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thal and Neuhaus, 2014</xref>). The neurovascular unit, the anatomical structure underlying the BBB, comprised different cell types including endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and astrocytes, which are all located in close proximity and presumably affect each other through reciprocal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liebner et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has established that leukocyte extravasation – the exit from the blood stream into the tissue – generally occurs in postcapillary venules of the skin, muscle, and mesentery, whereas in lung and liver this process is confined to microcapillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strell and Entschladen, 2008</xref>). Even in the absence of neuroinflammation, peripherally activated circulating T cells can cross the endothelium of postcapillary vessels and reach the adjacent subarachnoid space. Here, T cells can encounter tissue resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs), but they are unable to traverse the astrocytic basement membrane and glia limitans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mapunda et al., 2022</xref>). In the absence of cognate antigen presented by APCs, T cells undergo apoptosis or re-enter the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mastorakos and McGavern, 2019</xref>). Accordingly, immune surveillance and the initiation of CNS immune responses are highly dependent on the cellular and molecular components of the postcapillary venules and the perivascular environment, but we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling has recently provided important insights into the cellular composition of the CNS and the arterial-venous zonation of brain vessels during postnatal development and adult homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sabbagh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, brain ECs demonstrate similar gene expression changes in various BBB dysfunction models, suggesting a common mechanism for compromised BBB function throughout different neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Munji et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these important insights, the molecular heterogeneity of vascular cells and their dynamic modulation, which is critical for BBB function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Villabona-Rueda et al., 2019</xref>), remains insufficiently understood. One critical technical issue is the low abundance of vascular cells relative to neural cell types in the brain.</p><p>In this study, we have established a protocol for the depletion of neurons and oligodendrocytes prior to droplet-based single-cell transcriptome analysis of non-neuronal cells in mouse cerebral cortex. We have generated a comprehensive resource of vascular gene expression at single-cell resolution during postnatal development, adulthood, ageing, and in the demyelinating neuroinflammatory condition of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of human multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Nun et al., 2014</xref>). This resulting data, which can be interrogated at single-cell.mpi-muenster.mpg.de, provides useful insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of blood vessels in brain and permits identification of functionally specialized reactive postcapillary venules (REVs), which we propose to regulate the infiltration of activated leukocytes during neuroinflammation. Using a computational framework, we have also constructed a detailed cell-to-cell intercommunication map of the brain vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA-sequencing of non-neuronal cell population in mouse cerebral cortex</title><p>To enrich vascular and vessel wall-associated cell types while preserving the heterogeneity of these populations, we depleted myelin-associated neurons and oligodendrocytes, the most abundant cell types in CNS, using a bovine serum albumin (BSA)-gradient method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

Juvenile ECs were annotated to six different subclusters corresponding to arterial, capillary/precapillary arteriolar (CapA), capillary/postcapillary venular (CapV), venous, mitotic, and tip ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Trajectory analysis indicates that there are one mitotic axis (M) and a tip cell axis (T), which are closely associated with venous populations (V), whereas arterial ECs (A) are found in a different branch of polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Distinct transcriptional profiles reveal the expression of venous genes in tip and mitotic ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>), while these two populations are also distinguished by specifically expressed transcripts such as <italic>Mcam</italic> for tip cells and <italic>Top2a</italic> for mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Pseudotime reconstruction analysis reveals a continuum of venous-to-arterial gene expression and also confirmed the presence of venous attributes in tip and mitotic ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G-J</xref>), consistent with previous findings that tip and mitotic ECs emerge from veins and are, in part, incorporated into arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pitulescu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed adult and aged EC populations. Although there was no striking change in gene expression profiles between adult and aged ECs (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = 0.9852), 407 genes were identified as differentially expressed (Padj &lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicates that genes related to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and the P53 signalling pathway are enriched in adult ECs, while genes related to cell adhesion molecules, chemokine signalling, and T cell receptor signalling are enriched in aged ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>), indicating that ECs undergo molecular changes toward a proinflammatory state during ageing, which is consistent with recently published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To investigate EC subtypes during homeostasis, we performed subclustering analysis of adult and aged ECs together. As expected, tip and mitotic EC populations are largely absent in these samples, whereas venous, CapV, CapA, and arterial ECs are clearly segregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Interestingly, we found one additional minor but distinctive subpopulation of venous ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; boxed area), which we subsequently termed REV. These ECs are characterized by the expression of <italic>Icam1</italic> and <italic>Vcam1</italic>, encoding intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), and the endothelial activation or dysfunction markers <italic>Vwf</italic> and <italic>Irf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). It has been reported that endothelial expression of ICAM-1 is essential for transcellular diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadier et al., 2015</xref>) but is suppressed by sonic hedgehog signalling in the CNS during homeostasis, thereby limiting infiltration of circulating inflammatory leukocytes through the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>). However, the small subpopulation of venous ECs we found from the single-cell transcriptome data shows consistent expression of <italic>Icam1</italic> even in immunologically naïve conditions both in adult and aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). To further characterize the <italic>Icam1</italic>-expressing REVs, we performed gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and revealed that 663 genes (Padj &lt;0.05) predominantly expressed in this cell population were significantly enriched in biological processes involving inflammatory/immune responses, cell adhesion, and leukocyte migration and adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). An alternative, nonlinear dimensionality reduction method called Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells (MAGIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Dijk et al., 2018</xref>) also shows a distinct subpopulation of venous ECs with predominant expression of Icam1 and Irf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), excluding the possibility that the heterogeneity of cerebral venous ECs is a computational artifact.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Endothelial cell (EC) subclustering and identification of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1<sup>+</sup>) endothelial population.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots of 10,741 adult and aged mouse ECs.

First, we analyzed the communication between REVs and adjacent CapV and venous ECs. REVs show expression of various autologous signalling molecules regulating fundamental aspects of EC behavior, including <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Tnfsf12</italic>, <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, <italic>Jag1</italic>, collagens, and immune-regulatory genes with their corresponding receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). CapV and venous ECs express higher level of <italic>Esam</italic>, which encodes EC-selective adhesion molecule, an immunoglobulin-like transmembrane protein associated with endothelial tight junctions. CapV and venous ECs also express the chemokine, and <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and REVs express the corresponding receptor <italic>Ackr3</italic> encoding CXCR-7, which might enable communication between EC subsets. Potential molecular interactions that upregulated in REVs by EAE include members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, TGFβ receptors, integrins, the HLA class II histocompatibility antigen gamma chain CD74, the receptor tyrosine kinase TEK, and the PLXNB2 receptor for semaphorin ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). These results also suggest that REVs are a major signal distributor among the EC populations in CNS, which is further enhanced by EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We also identify putative signalling interactions between REVs and other cell types in the brain vasculature during homeostasis and neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, REVs express growth factors including PDGF-B, CTGF, and TGFβ1, which regulate cellular behavior, tissue remodelling, and angiogenesis. Signalling to other cell types is further enhanced by EAE, which involves the activation of various signals in astroependymal cells. By contrast, expression of PDGF-A, IGF2, and PGF in mural cells and of IGF1, TGFB1, and IGFBP4 in PVMs, for example, was not significantly changed upon EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Our results collectively suggest that postcapillary venules form a specialized vessel compartment in the CNS. We propose that REVs might play roles in the regulation of immune surveillance in the CNS not only under homeostatic conditions but also in pathogenic neuroinflammation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Interactions between different endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations and blood-brain barrier (BBB) cell types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of potential ligand-receptor interactions for CapV, reactive endothelial venule (REV), and venous EC populations in adult and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) based on gene expression.

Using this data, we establish the existence of a specialized vessel subtype, which is characterized by a distinct endothelial gene expression profile and presence of ICAMs. In response to pro-inflammatory (LPS) stimulation or in the neuroinflammatory condition of EAE, REVs, but not the far more abundant ICAM-1<sup>-</sup> vessels, are associated with leukocytes, suggesting that the ICAM-1<sup>+</sup> subset of postcapillary venules serves as a first site of immune cell accumulation prior to entry into the brain parenchyma. Such a role of REVs as an interface for innate and adaptive immune cells might be also relevant under homeostatic conditions, when the recruitment of these cells is rare and their activity but also their entry into the brain parenchyma is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>). The association of MHCII<sup>+</sup> and Lyve1<sup>+</sup> PVM populations with REVs might mediate immunomodulatory responses, and the predominant gene expression changes in REVs upon immunological challenge highlight further that these vessels might be critical for the immune privileged status of the CNS with potential implications for ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Several previous studies on scRNA-seq analysis of murine or human brain have recovered only a limited number of vascular cells due to the comparably high abundance of neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). In other publications, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or microbead-mediated isolation of ECs as well as of both ECs and mural cells has provided insight into the organ-specific specialization, transcriptional regulation, and arterial-venous zonation of brain vessels in the healthy organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalucka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sabbagh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). While sorting based on certain cell surface markers or fluorescent reporters enables the efficient enrichment of the desired cell populations, it has to be considered that these approaches are biased and will miss cells lacking expression of the relevant markers. This limitation is avoided by our demyelination approach, which does not rely on the expression of specific cell surface proteins or fluorescent reporters. Despite of the differences in the experimental approach, data generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref> confirms the enriched expression of Icam1 and Vwf in a fraction of venous ECs, which is consistent with our own findings. Transcriptomic changes in brain ECs associated with the aging have been also investigated previously, and it has been proposed that soluble brain EC-derived Vcam1, generated by shedding, activates microglia and impairs the function of hippocampal neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yousef et al., 2019</xref>). Our own study confirms that aging increases transcripts associated with inflammation in brain ECs, and, in particular, in REVs. Similarly, EAE results in the upregulation of proinflammatory gene expression in ECs with potential implications for neuroinflammation and disease development.</p><p>In the healthy organism, the CNS contains a highly selective barrier system to restrict peripheral immune cell entry into brain parenchyma. During pathophysiological conditions, activated T cells can enter the perivascular space independent of antigen specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>) along postcapillary venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raine et al., 1990</xref>). However, only after acquiring the ability to move across the glia limitans by recognition of cognate antigen displayed by perivascular APCs, T cells traverse into the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lodygin et al., 2013</xref>). Firm attachment of T cells to ECs to resist the vascular shear stress and prolonged crawling before diapedesis is also critical for immune cell extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steiner et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings suggest that functionally specialized REV ECs enable the sustained immune surveillance process alongside the postcapillary venules, serving as the cellular gateway of BBB. In this sense, REVs share some functional features with high endothelial venules in secondary lymphoid organs that support circulating lymphocyte extravasation and physical contact with APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Girard and Springer, 1995</xref>). Because of the restricted afferent and efferent communication with lymphatic tissue in CNS parenchyma, these specialized postcapillary ECs are probably relevant for fine-tuned CNS immune reactions.</p><p>Our work also shows transcriptionally distinguishable subtypes of brain resident PVMs, physically associated with REVs in postcapillary venules, which might serve as APCs for CNS immune surveillance and thereby as gate-keepers at the BBB. It has been reported that PVMs are derived from early yolk-sac-derived erythromyeloid progenitors, similar to microglia and have minimal turnover during homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldmann et al., 2016</xref>). The transcriptional continuum between the PVM subtypes and the coherent activation upon EAE reflect the ability of PVMs to swiftly adapt to changing immunological and environmental cues. Nevertheless, PVMs retain distinct molecular characteristics relative to infiltrating peripheral macrophages even though all these cells are exposed to the same perivascular microenvironment. More detailed understanding of the mechanisms that determine the behavior of PVMs and peripheral macrophages upon neuroinflammation will be important, especially for attempts to target specific cell populations and modulate local immune responses. Delivery of drugs or therapeutic cells (e.g. chimeric antigen receptor T cells) across the BBB is a limiting factor in the future development of new therapeutics for the brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and various brain tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pardridge, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The sum of our work reveals critical aspects of vascular heterogeneity in the CNS and thereby provides a valuable resource for cell-cell interactions and the molecular modulation of immune cell trafficking into the CNS, with relevance for brain function in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 female mice were used unless stated otherwise. <italic>Cdh5- H2BGFP</italic>/<italic>tdTomato</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeong et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Cx3cr1-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jung et al., 2000</xref>), and <italic>Pdgfra-GFP</italic> transgenic mice were used to specifically label EC, Micro + PVM, and Fibro, respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below extensive revision is required before it is published. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Jeong et al. employ single cell transcriptional profiling to address cellular heterogeneity of the neurovascular unit. By using the murine cerebral cortex as the anatomical site of interest, the authors dissect cellular heterogeneity within four distinct conditions: aging, inflammation, development and adulthood. This approach has revealed a potential new endothelial subset – reactive endothelial venules, which are post-capillary endothelial cells with specialized functions particularly for immune cell transmigration and potential communication with perivascular macrophages within the brain parenchyma.</p><p>This study provides insight into largely understudied cell types in the neurovascular unit. Further, it provides for some interesting areas of future investigations into neuroimmune mechanisms that are used by the brain vasculature to control leukocyte transmigration in various health and disease conditions. However, as presented the work is not well-described or annotated, some methodology is not clear, numerous functional claims that are not supported by the data, and relevant work of other labs is not acknowledged and incorporated into the interpretations. The suggestion is to reformat the work as a resource paper with appropriate attributions of work of others, remove extensive unsubstantiated claims, and significantly improve description of the methodology and description of the data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. What is the gap in knowledge that is filled by this work? The scope of the study is on PVECs and a more suitable introduction with relevant literature citation and gap of knowledge should be included. The current broad claim of &quot;BBB heterogeneity&quot; is not very relevant to the current experimental design and findings in this manuscript. The authors should introduce REVs early on as it is a main finding. Although this cell population is in early data (Figure 2A) the first description and discussion of this cell population is towards the end of the main text.</p><p>2. There are many areas of bold claims about probable functional roles without functional data to support these ideas. It is suggested to remove these claims and reformat as a resource paper, with appropriate attribution of other work in the field and comparison of analyses. Specifically: (a) the presented work is done using mice, while recently the human cell atlas was published (PMID: 32214235) that should be re-analyzed to find REVs and address relevance of the mouse model for studies of human disorders; (b) work would benefit from comparison of authors' dataset with previously published data, e.g. of Sabbagh MF et al., 2018 (PMID: 30188322), Vanlandewijck M et al., 2018 (PMID:29925939), He L et al., 2018 (PMID:30129931) or Kalucka J et al. 2020 (PMID: 32059779) to examine reproducibility of gene expression, transcriptomic signatures, and EC subtypes for relevant conditions; (c) recently Tony Wyss-Coray and colleagues reported that brain capillary, arterial, and venous cells age differently at the transcriptome level, that aged capillaries upregulate innate immunity and oxidative stress pathways, and that hippocampal neural precursor activity is impaired via endothelial VCAM1 (PMID: 32234477, PMID: 31086348). These results should be discussed and adequately compared to the newly obtained results. Also, there is speculation and claims about a functional module that may exist between ICAM1+ vessels and PVMs, with little molecular detail in terms of validation or functional data to support this hypothesis. Simply having cell types in the same region does not dictate that they communicate in meaningful ways, so this claim should be removed. The model suggests that perhaps LYVE1+ PVMs may actively suppress leukocytes that enter through REVs but there is nothing to support this, so this claim should be removed.</p><p>3. Readability is very low, with extensive lack of concordance between text and data, precluding rigorous assessment. The authors submitted 4 main figures and 9 extended data figures, but refer to 7 main figures and 10 (or 11 based on the figure legend numbering) extended data figures. Some of the figures are missing and panels in figures do not match text (and the other way round). Legends poorly describe the panels. Abbreviations in Figures are not explained. Some figures are overcrowded and presented data is not explained in the main text (e.g. for Figure 1d). Authors should provide rationale behind prioritising the data presented in the main figures. There are several mistakes in the figures themselves. For example, in Figure 1a panels are said to represent UMAP, but t-SNE plots are shown.</p><p>4. Some provided images do not support validation claims, e.g. Extended Data Figure 8 does not support statement that ICAM-1 expression in the brain parenchyma remains restricted to veins/venules and slightly expands into adjacent vessels. Double or triple staining to clearly illustrate veins/venules vs. arteries is needed to support these assumptions. Also, based on provided representative images in Extended Data Figure 7c, loss of MBP protein is more severe during the onset of EAE and not in its peak as authors describe in the text. How can the authors explain that? It is also unclear why the authors used Olig2 staining for these experiments.</p><p>5. Methodology is not clear. Seq analysis cell numbers are a concern – it is unclear how many cells were obtained in each subpopulations. Methods must include more technical detail. For example, in Figure 2, ~11,000 endothelial cells are analyzed from both adult and aged mice – it is unclear why these two groups are pooled. Tony Wyss-Coray recently reported via seq that brain ECs are transcriptionally different from aged mice, so this could argue that pooling adult and aged ECs into the same analysis is a potential confound. Further, it is unclear how many cells make up ICAM1+ and other subpopulations (I,e, what are the cell numbers of ICAM1+ PVECs and ICAM1-PVECs?). Limited cell counts from the brain vasculature is a known technical issue for sequencing, so cell numbers are important to understand whether methods are appropriate. Are there thousands, hundreds or dozens of ICAM1+ ECs from this overall population? Also, pooling of 3 PVM groups seems likely to lead to possible confounding factors. Why are these 3 groups chosen? The analysis actually indicates that these populations are likely unique (or at least somewhat different) across these conditions, so pooling may not be appropriate. Is there a biological response for this pooling? If cell numbers needed to be increased, would it be more appropriate to increase the number of mice per condition and keep them separate?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Single cell transcriptomics reveals functionally specialized vascular endothelium in brain&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Notably, the overarching, unsubstantiated claims in the first version have been removed or have had significant data additions to help support these claims. Thank you for the addition of the discussion of how your scRNA-seq dataset compares to previously published datasets. Overall, the text is much more readable and the data progression is logical and clear. Prior to publication, there is still one major concern that needs to be addressed and we bring a few minor corrections below.</p><p>1. Figure 2, figure supplement 3G – the text in lines 161-162 claims that CD3+ T cells accumulate and penetrate the brain but the images do not clearly demonstrate this. Rather, it appears that they are accumulating, and perhaps not penetrating. This is a really important point to clarify – whether T cells are physically entering the brain at these sites needs to be explored. Better images showing the T cells in the brain parenchyma and/or quantification of the numbers of T cells accumulating and penetrating is warranted. It is also important to note there isn't a control here – there should be a negative (PBS) control to show that T cells in the LPS condition are actually different. EM would be able to prove these cells are transmigrating and/or flow cytometry quantification of T cell numbers in the brain parenchyma could be helpful.</p><p>Line 295 in the discussion states &quot;recruitment&quot;, but again there is no direct evidence that REVs are actually allowing T cells to recruit to the brain. Even though these sites are likely to be hotspots of leukocyte accumulation, be cautious about using recruitment.</p><p>2. Similar to the comments above, for Figures 5 E and F, the authors should show the negative control side-by-side so the reader can really appreciate the differences.</p><p>3. In your response to reviewer comments: &quot;LPS treatment promotes the adhesion of CD3+ cells to ICAM-1+ REVs (Figure 2-supplement 3G). While our findings indeed indicate that REVs are present in the absence of any challenge, leukocyte adhesion is extremely rare under baseline conditions. Thus, while we propose that REVs are poised for leukocyte transmigration, this is prevented by the BBB properties of the brain vasculature in the absence of inflammatory challenge.&quot;</p><p>Are you suggesting that LPS induces loss of BBB features and that controls the difference between the baseline activity of REVs and LPS-induced activity? If so, then presumably REVs are indeed able to allow for attachment of T cells in homeostatic conditions, but only under inflammatory conditions when the BBB is weakened, can recruitment actually occur? Some level of discussion on this topic could be helpful in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57520.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Jeong et al. employ single cell transcriptional profiling to address cellular heterogeneity of the neurovascular unit.

It has to be noted that many of the previous scRNA-seq studies for brain provide a rather limited coverage of ECs, reflecting the high abundance of neural cells, or have used positive selection (cell sorting) for the isolation of vascular cells. The latter will introduce a certain experimental bias, due to the expression of transgenic reporters, and will obviously miss cells lacking reporter expression.</p><p>The data generated by Han et al. (PMID: 32214235) and Human Cell Landscape database (http://bis.zju.edu.cn/HCL) is very useful, but contains only 74 vascular cells (ECs + pericytes) among the 8,531 adult brain cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

However, these ECs are not clearly segregated into different subpopulations by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (e.g. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph-based clustering approach). Instead, authors ordered cells into one-dimensional range using the SPIN method based on known arteriovenous markers, which excludes the identification of minor subpopulations. Nevertheless, Icam1 and Vwf are enriched in a fraction of venous ECs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), which is consistent with our own findings.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-57520-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>or Kalucka J et al. 2020 (PMID: 32059779) to examine reproducibility of gene expression, transcriptomic signatures, and EC subtypes for relevant conditions;</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to traditional EC phenotypes of venous to artery, Kalucka et al.

After removal of circulating cells by robust perfusion, we collected mononuclear cells using a Percoll gradient from the crushed brain tissues without enzymatic dissociation. This showed a striking increase in CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes at EAE onset and peak. The new data is shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similar to the comments above, for Figures 5 E and F, the authors should show the negative control side-by-side so the reader can really appreciate the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added negative control panels to Figure 2—figure supplement 3G as well as in Figure 5E. Control panels have been also added to Figure 5F, which has been repositioned to Figure 5—figure supplement 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In your response to reviewer comments: &quot;LPS treatment promotes the adhesion of CD3+ cells to ICAM-1+ REVs (Figure 2-supplement 3G). While our findings indeed indicate that REVs are present in the absence of any challenge, leukocyte adhesion is extremely rare under baseline conditions. Thus, while we propose that REVs are poised for leukocyte transmigration, this is prevented by the BBB properties of the brain vasculature in the absence of inflammatory challenge.&quot;</p><p>Are you suggesting that LPS induces loss of BBB features and that controls the difference between the baseline activity of REVs and LPS-induced activity? If so, then presumably REVs are indeed able to allow for attachment of T cells in homeostatic conditions, but only under inflammatory conditions when the BBB is weakened, can recruitment actually occur? Some level of discussion on this topic could be helpful in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that REVs facilitate the transmigration of activated leukocyte during neuroinflammation and are already primed for this role under homeostatic conditions without immune cell activation. In the healthy (unchallenged) brain, the adhesion and accumulation of leukocytes in REVs are extremely rare events because immune cells are not activated and LFA-1, a receptor for ICAM-1 expressed on leukocytes, has a low affinity for ICAM-1. However, reports in the literature support that “innate and adaptive immune cells are…known to have protective/healing properties in the CNS, as long as their activity is regulated, and their recruitment is well controlled” (quote taken from a review by Schwartz et al., PMID: 24198349). It therefore seems possible that REVs are able to mediate the attachment of T cells to the brain vasculature in homeostatic conditions and might even control the rare entry of these cells into the brain parenchyma. Immune cell accumulation is greatly enhanced under inflammatory conditions when the BBB is weakened. The expansion of REVs might contribute to this accumulation together with other factors such as the release of chemokines and the activation of immune cells.</p><p>We have added a statement to the Discussion on page 12 of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
