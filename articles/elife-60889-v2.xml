Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interactions with numerous proteins, including a still incompletely understood physical and functional interaction with the human Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger NHE1. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype and mutant NHE1, we discovered multiple accessible states of this functionally important complex existing in different NHE1:CaM stoichiometries and structures. We determined the NMR solution structure of a ternary complex in which CaM links two NHE1 cytosolic tails. <italic>In vitro</italic>, stoichiometries and affinities could be tuned by variations in NHE1:CaM ratio and calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) and by phosphorylation of S648 in the first CaM-binding α-helix. In cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-induced NHE1 activity was reduced by mimicking S648 phosphorylation and by mutation of the first CaM-binding α-helix, whereas it was unaffected by inhibition of Akt, one of several kinases phosphorylating S648. Our results demonstrate a diversity of NHE1:CaM interaction modes and suggest that CaM may contribute to NHE1 dimerization and thereby augment NHE1 regulation. We propose that a similar structural diversity is of relevance to many other CaM complexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SLC9A1</kwd><kwd>Na+/H+ exchanger</kwd><kwd>Ca2+-signaling</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008390</institution-id><institution>Danish Research Academy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4181-00344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF15OC0016670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0034070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>Stine Falsig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF19OC0057241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>Stine Falsig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0032996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008398</institution-id><institution>Villum Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF20-0491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>Stine Falsig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sjøgaard-Frich</surname><given-names>Lise M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NHE1-CaM complexes of multiple stoichiometries regulate cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent NHE1 activity and can contribute to NHE1 dimerization, the latter shown by the NMR structure of CaM linking two NHE1 cytosolic tails.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitously expressed EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding hub protein, which regulates a plethora of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cellular processes such as ion transport, muscle contraction, proliferation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berchtold and Villalobo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chin and Means, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Villalobo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Villarroel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yap et al., 2000</xref>). CaM is a small, α-helical protein consisting of two similar, but not identical, N- and C-terminal domains (for CaM termed the N-lobe and C-lobe, respectively) connected by a helical linker with a disordered, flexible hinge. Upon changes in the free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, CaM binds up to four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. This induces structural rearrangements exposing hydrophobic patches through which CaM interacts with numerous structurally and functionally different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tidow and Nissen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Villalobo et al., 2018</xref>). In most cases where this has been studied to date, CaM wraps both its lobes around its α-helix-forming targets, exemplified by the interaction with myosin light chain kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikura et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meador et al., 1992</xref>). However, recent structures have shown diversity in binding and a range of CaM binding modes and motifs exist. Indeed, in some cases, CaM with Ca<sup>2+</sup> present only in one lobe is bound to the target, whereas in other cases only the apo-form of CaM is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nunomura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nunomura et al., 2011</xref>). Still, common features of CaM-binding regions, such as high α-helix propensity, net positive charge, and obligate hydrophobic docking residues, exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Villalobo et al., 2018</xref>). CaM also engages with many membrane proteins and examples include the CaM substrates estrogen receptor alfa (ERα; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv10.1 (eag1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schönherr et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>), and aquaporin 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reichow et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One widely studied CaM-binding membrane protein is the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger, NHE1 (SLC9A1), a major acid-extruding transporter localized in the plasma membrane in essentially all mammalian cells studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orlowski and Grinstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pedersen and Counillon, 2019</xref>). Upon activation by cytosolic acidification or a wide range of mitogenic and other signaling events, NHE1 extrudes H<sup>+</sup> from the cytosol in exchange for Na<sup>+</sup> ions. In addition to its role in intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) regulation, NHE1 regulates key cellular functions such as proliferation, growth/death balance, cell volume, cell motility, and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orlowski and Grinstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pedersen and Counillon, 2019</xref>). Consequently, NHE1 hyperactivity is implicated in many important pathologies including cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stock and Pedersen, 2017</xref>), as well as cardiovascular disease, especially ischemia-reperfusion damage and cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karmazyn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prasad et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>NHE1 which, like many other membrane transport proteins, functions as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fafournoux et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pedersen and Counillon, 2019</xref>), consists of a 12-transmembrane (TM)-helix transport domain and an ~300 residue long cytoplasmic C-terminal domain with extensive disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nørholm et al., 2011</xref>). Via this tail, NHE1 activity is regulated through multiple phosphorylation–dephosphorylation events and interactions with a plethora of binding partners, one of which is CaM (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orlowski and Grinstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pedersen and Counillon, 2019</xref>). CaM binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Köster et al., 2011</xref>) as originally demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> by binding of either an NHE1 fusion protein or full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>). The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded CaM to NHE1 in response to an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elicits an alkaline shift in the pH<sub>i</sub> sensitivity of NHE1 in cells, resulting in its activation at less acidic pH<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wakabayashi et al., 1994</xref>). Mechanistically, NHE1:CaM interaction has been proposed to activate NHE1 by relieving an autoinhibitory interaction of the C-terminal tail of NHE1 with its TM region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wakabayashi et al., 1997</xref>). CaM binding has also been implicated in activation of NHE1 by a wide range of hormones and growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, serotonin, angiotensin, and endothelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coaxum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Turner et al., 2007</xref>). NHE1:CaM interaction was suggested to be regulated by Akt kinase-mediated phosphorylation of S648 of human NHE1. However, the role of S648 phosphorylation in NHE1 regulation has been reported both as inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Snabaitis et al., 2008</xref>) and stimulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meima et al., 2009</xref>), pointing to a possible context dependence of NHE1:CaM complex formation.</p><p>Two neighboring α-helical CaM-binding sites of NHE1 each bind CaM, but with different affinities. For an NHE1 variant deleted in CaM-binding region 2 (CB2, defined as D656-L691), <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> was ~20 nM and for an NHE1 variant deleted in CaM-binding region 1 (CB1, defined as N637-A656) <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> was ~350 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>). Testifying to its importance, deletion or mutation of CB1 resulted in loss of NHE1 [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wakabayashi et al., 1994</xref>). A crystal structure of CaM bound to a peptide of NHE1 containing both CaM-binding sites (A622-R690) revealed an unusual binding mode. CaM assumed an extended configuration, and the N-terminal CaM-binding site of NHE1 (H1 in the following) made an uncommon interaction with the ‘back side’ of the C-lobe, whereas the N-lobe of CaM engaged with the low-affinity C-terminal site of NHE1 (H2 in the following) forming an α-helix in the hydrophobic ligand-binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Köster et al., 2011</xref>). This extraordinary mode of CaM binding, combined with the fact that NHE1 forms active dimers in the membrane, raises the possibility that in solution other types of CaM complexes of relevance to the function of NHE1 may exist. So far, the only analysis of the complex in solution was conducted using small-angle X-ray scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Köster et al., 2011</xref>). Here, the derived molecular envelope showed a poor fit to the crystal structure, further spurring a re-evaluation of the conformational landscape of the CaM:NHE1 complex to understand its functional relevance.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger:calmodulin (NHE1:CaM) interactions <italic>in vitro</italic> adopt different stoichiometries.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sketch of NHE1 (blue) in the membrane highlighting helical elements in the cytoplasmic tail and known phosphorylation sites (red stars).

Our findings reveal that, in solution, CaM interacts with NHE1 by exploiting different binding modes and stoichiometries, thereby forming several possible structures. Accordingly, in cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced NHE1 activation, but not NHE1:CaM proximity, was modulated by mutations preventing (S648A) or mimicking (S648D) phosphorylation, as well as reduced by charge-reversal (CR) mutations of the first CaM-binding site. This was not dependent on Akt kinase, inhibition of which did not affect Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation of NHE1 under these conditions. Consistent with this notion, S648 phosphorylation could be mediated by other Ser/Thr kinases. We propose that the interaction between CaM and NHE1 is highly dynamic, involving both CaM-binding helices of NHE1, and with a functional role of S648 that is not exclusively downstream from Akt.

In line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>), H1 bound CaM with high affinity. In addition, we surprisingly observed that one CaM molecule bound two H1 peptides (n = 1.92 ± 0.06, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Fitting the ITC data to a binding model with two independent sites revealed similar high affinities (<italic>K<sub>d,1</sub></italic> = 27 ± 8 nM; <italic>K<sub>d,2</sub></italic> = 42 ± 6 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), but with different enthalpic and entropic contributions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

This interaction showed only one transition, indicating the formation of a 1:1 complex (n = 1.15 ± 0.08, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Finally, the binding isotherm for the H1H2 peptide displayed two distinct transitions, suggesting successive binding events and/or diverse binding modes with different CaM:H1H2 stoichiometries.

The NMR signals of CaM in complex with H1H2 were at all tested stoichiometries and conditions severely broadened and made direct determination of the three-dimensional structure of this complex by NMR impossible. We therefore addressed this structure using NMR data recorded on the CaM complexes with the individual H1 and H2 peptides. From a comparison of these high-quality assigned spectra to the broad signals in the CaM:H1H2 spectra, we could extract information and infer important structural details of the CaM:H1H2 complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Both lobes of CaM can interact independently with H1 with high affinity</title><p>En route to understanding the spectra of the CaM:H1H2 NMR spectra, we started out titrating <sup>15</sup>N-labeled CaM with increasing concentrations of unlabeled H1 and followed the changes in shape, intensity, and position of the NMR peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Upon addition of H1 (50 µM CaM + 50 µM NHE1), most signals from both CaM lobes broadened drastically, indicating exchange between free and bound state(s) on an intermediate NMR timescale (<italic>k<sub>ex</sub> ≈ Δδ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prestel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This suggests dynamics in the complex occurring on the microsecond to millisecond timescale. After addition of excess H1 peptide (50 µM CaM + 125 µM H1, denoted 1:2 in the following), the signals re-sharpened and no further spectral changes were observed upon further addition of H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). This is in line with the CaM:H1 stoichiometry of 1:2 obtained by ITC. Although at a molar ratio of 1:1 all the NMR signals were broadened by exchange processes, it was evident that signals from the C-lobe of CaM were located close to the position of the fully bound state (1:2), while signals of the N-lobe were positioned close to those of the free form of CaM, as exemplified for G135 and G62, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This suggested that in the main state at a 1:1 stoichiometry H1 is bound to the higher affinity C-lobe, as depicted in the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. Not all peaks could be followed throughout the titration, but the high-quality NMR spectra of the 1:2 (CaM:H1) complex allowed assignments of CaM in the ternary complex and mapping of the chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) onto the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Large CSPs were observed for residues throughout CaM, highlighting binding of H1 to both lobes. The rate constants for dissociation of H1 from the C-lobe and N-lobe were determined by 2D NMR lineshape analysis to <italic>k<sub>off,1</sub></italic> = 40 ± 5 s<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>k<sub>off,2</sub></italic> = 16 ± 3 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), revealing a &gt;10 times faster association with the C-lobe than with the N-lobe. To further substantiate these results, the opposite titration was performed: <sup>15</sup>N-labeled H1 was monitored as the concentration of unlabeled CaM was increased. Only a few signals from the free peptide were visible at 37°C, presumably due to its disordered nature, while at a 1:2 (CaM:H1) molar ratio, two sets of signals became distinct and could be assigned to H1 bound to either of the two CaM lobes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). When more CaM was added, the set of signals originating from H1 bound to the N-lobe decreased in intensity and vanished at a molar ratio of 3:1 (CaM:H1).

Inverting the titration gave a similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). However, in this case the spectral quality of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled H2 in both free and bound states was inferior with very heterogeneous signal intensities and only few assignable signals, likely originating from weak self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This will interfere with CaM interaction and provides a likely explanation for the affinity variations obtained from different titration setups.</p><p>Taken together, these data show that each of the CaM lobes can bind one NHE1 H1 with high affinity forming a 1:2 complex, with the C-lobe energetically slightly favored. CaM binds NHE1 H2 with lower affinity in a 1:1 complex with both CaM lobes involved, suggesting a more classical CaM binding as depicted in the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CaM can interact with NHE1 H1H2 in different conformations with different stoichiometries</title><p>We now revisit the complex between CaM and H1H2 by NMR. First, we titrated unlabeled H1H2 into <sup>15</sup>N-labeled CaM and compared the <sup>15</sup>N HSQC fingerprint spectra at different stoichiometries to those obtained with H1 or H2 alone. At a molar ratio of 1:2 (CaM:H1H2), the <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum closely resembled the state where only H1 is present in twofold excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). This suggested that at this stoichiometry each CaM lobe interacts with one H1 of H1H2 in a ternary complex, while H2 is not involved in the interaction, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>. At a stoichiometry of 1:1, the signals of the N-lobe of CaM still overlaid almost perfectly with the spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled CaM at saturation with H1. However, signals of the C-lobe now overlaid with the spectrum of CaM bound to H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>). Thus, at this molar ratio, the major state is the N-lobe of CaM bound to H1 and the C-lobe bound to H2, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. It is worth noting that a second set of very weak peaks was detectable for many of the residues. Comparing these to the spectra from the simpler systems of the individual peptides, this suggested the presence of a minor state with the opposite architecture: the N-lobe of CaM bound to H2 and the C-lobe bound to H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The severely broadened signals may thus be explained by exchange between these two states, and judging from the relative signal intensities, the equilibrium was highly shifted toward the H1:N-lobe;H2:C-lobe complex, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. A titration of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled H1H2 with CaM supports these findings, although the spectral analysis was complicated by severe signal overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c, d</xref>). At a stoichiometry of 1:2 (CaM:H1H2), two sets of signals originated from each residue of H1, while signals from H2 closely resembled those of unbound H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). This suggests a state with H1 bound to both CaM lobes, while H2 did not partake in the interaction. At a stoichiometry of 1:1, signals from H1 overlapped with the N-lobe bound state, while signals from H2 were either invisible or closely resembled the C-lobe bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). For both H1H2:CaM stoichiometries analyzed, the described complexes were the major states as judged by the relative NMR signal intensities. It is, however, important to note that at 1:1 as well as 1:2 (CaM:H1H2) stoichiometries the NMR signals were drastically broadened compared to those of free CaM or of the 1:2 complex saturated with H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, d</xref>), indicating a dynamic equilibrium of states with different stoichiometries, including potential higher order oligomers. Due to these challenges, it was not possible to determine the atomistic structure of the CaM:H1H2 complexes directly. Instead, to assess the absolute sizes of the complexes and support the proposed complex architectures (cartoons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, d</xref>), we used pulsed field gradient NMR diffusion measurements (PFG-NMR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiple angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). The results of these experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–i</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. The mass of the complex at a 1:1 stoichiometry as determined from SEC-MALS (25.0 ± 1.6 kDa) was in perfect agreement with the expected molecular weight of a 1:1 complex (25.5 kDa) and suggested that, if higher oligomers were present, their population was low under these conditions. Unfortunately, the H1H2 peptide interacted with the column material when not fully saturated with CaM, which made the analysis of the free peptide as well as the 1:2 complex by SEC-MALS impossible. However, these complexes were readily accessible by DLS and PFG-NMR: both experiment series showed a stepwise increase of the complex size from free CaM to the complexes formed at 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometries, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Calmodulin (CaM) interaction with NHE1<sub>622-692</sub> (H1H2) at two different stoichiometries.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The 1:2 CaM:NHE1<sub>622-692</sub> (H1H2) complex (molar ratio 1:2).

To obtain a more detailed understanding of this interaction, we determined the structure of the ternary complex of CaM bound to two H1 peptides using NMR, which is the major state in solution when either H1 or H1H2 are present in twofold excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, b</xref>). Furthermore, the spectral quality of the complex with H1 was far superior to the exchange-broadened spectra of the CaM complex with H1H2. Therefore, the 1:2 complex of CaM and H1 constituted the foundation for obtaining the NMR constraints for structure determination. The results of the structure determination are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>. Both CaM lobes have one H1 bound inside the hydrophobic cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). An overlay of the 10 lowest energy structures shows that the individual lobes are well defined (backbone RMSD: N-lobe + H1<sub>N</sub> = 0.77 ± 0.16 Å; backbone RMSD C-lobe + H1<sub>c</sub> = 0.83 ± 0.18 Å), while no NOEs between the two lobes could be obtained, suggesting that the linker region remains flexible in the bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, c</xref>). In both lobes, the interaction surface is defined by contacts between the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic H1 (L623, I631, I634, L635, N638, L639, T642, and L646; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, e</xref>) and the central methionines in the hydrophobic cleft of each CaM-lobe. For the N-lobe, this involves M37, M52, M72, and M73; and for the C-lobe M110, M125, M145, and M146. In addition, a high complementarity in electrostatics is evident, with multiple positively charged residues on the opposite side of NHE1 H1 (K625, K637, R632, K633, R636, K641, R643, R645) complementing the negatively charged surface of CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–i</xref>). Although this complex is very different from that shown in the published crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Köster et al., 2011</xref>), inspection of the neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice reveals that the mode of interaction between the CaM C-lobe and H1, which we describe here by NMR, was also present in the crystal, but was translated as crystal contacts between symmetry-related molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The minor state observed by NMR at a stoichiometry of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) is similar to the crystal structure in that it has the same overall architecture (i.e., H1 bound to the hydrophobic cleft of the C-lobe and H2 bound to the hydrophobic cleft of the N-lobe). However, in the crystal structure, CaM binds to H1 and H2 from two different H1H2 molecules, while in solution we show by PFG-NMR, DLS, and SEC-MALS that the fraction of such higher oligomers is low at concentrations of 50 µM and below. The absolute protein concentration is certainly a parameter that can shift the equilibrium in this dynamic system, and the high concentrations used for crystallization might favor the formation of higher oligomers. Thus, collectively, these data depict a highly flexible system that is sensitive to the conditions under which they are studied.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The ternary complex between calmodulin (CaM) and two Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger (NHE1) H1s.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon of the complex showing the two lobes of CaM in gray and the two NHE1 H1 helices in green.

Under conditions where both Ca<sup>2+</sup> (here 2 mM) and high EDTA (here 6.6 mM) were present, free CaM gets stripped of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

In contrast to their inhibitory effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced NHE1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h, i</xref>), none of the three variants abolished NHE1:CaM PLA <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a, b</xref>). We therefore examined the solution NMR structure of the 1:2 (CaM:H1) complex and the positions of the different mutated residues. In the complex, the four residues K641, R643, R645, and R648 are all solvent exposed both when bound to the N-lobe or the C-lobe of CaM, with some hydrophobic contacts from K641 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c, d</xref>). Likewise, in either of the lobes, S648 does not form direct contacts with CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c, d</xref>).

To investigate the phosphorylation of S648 by these kinases and study how it impacts NHE1:CaM interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>, we tried to phosphorylate the H1H2 peptide using either recombinant Akt or PKCδ in an <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assay. Phosphorylation of a single residue by Akt was confirmed by mass spectrometry, and S648 was identified by NMR, while PKCδ gave rise to mono-, double-, and triple phosphorylated forms of H1H2, identified by NMR at residues T642, S648, and T653 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, H1H2 is a potential target for other kinases. We used ITC to measure the affinity of monophosphorylated (pS648) H1H2 for CaM. As for the unphosphorylated H1H2, we observed two transitions in the binding isotherm and fitted this to a two-site binding model. The first binding event gave a <italic>K<sub>d,1</sub></italic> = 5 ± 4 nM with a stoichiometry n<sub>1</sub> = 0.93 ± 0.02, while the second binding event gave a <italic>K<sub>d,1</sub></italic> = 2700 ± 600 nM with n<sub>2</sub> = 1.16 ± 0.06 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, indeed, phosphorylation of S648 results in a tenfold weakened binding to CaM compared to WT.</p><p>We next asked whether Akt or PKC were essential regulators of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent NHE1 activity. A 10 min stimulation with ionomycin had no detectable effect on Akt activation (phosphorylation) in PS120 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). Furthermore, Akt activity was ablated under both control and ionomycin conditions by the Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>), yet Akti-1/2 had no significant effect on ionomycin-stimulated NHE1 activity after an acid load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Similarly, two well-established PKC inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I) – targeting PKCα, -β1, -β2, -γ, -δ, and -ε – and Gö6983 – targeting PKCα, PKCβ, -γ, -δ, and -ζ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>) – also had no significant effects on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent NHE1 activity after acidification. These observations suggest that other kinases than Akt and these PKC isozymes can regulate S648 phosphorylation in the context of an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>Our results show that S648 is phosphorylated by Akt and PKCδ <italic>in vitro</italic>, weakening H1H2 binding to CaM tenfold. However, under the conditions studied, inhibition of Akt or multiple PKC isoforms does not alter Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced cellular WT NHE1 activity. Thus, other kinases are likely important for S648 phosphorylation. Our findings also identify T642 and T653, present within the binding interface of the H1H2 NHE1 complex, as other phosphorylation sites potentially important for regulating NHE1:CaM interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CaM is highly abundant in cells and its interactome comprises hundreds of proteins, the majority of which form 1:1 complexes with CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berchtold and Villalobo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Villalobo et al., 2018</xref>). Most existing structures of CaM complexes have been determined by crystallography and X-ray diffraction, providing static representations of the interactions. Here, we used solution NMR and reveal that the energy landscape of the CaM complex with the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1 – a key regulator of pH<sub>i</sub> in mammalian cells – is much broader than previously anticipated. In solution, it populates several different states with different affinities and structures, and the equilibrium between these states can be modulated by phosphorylation, NHE1:CaM ratio, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a, b</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, we found that NHE1 and CaM can form either 1:1 or 2:1 (NHE1:CaM) complexes with similar affinities but different structures, suggesting that the complex is highly dynamic and that the relevant state at any time is dependent on the availability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM and NHE1 in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, apo-CaM can associate weakly with NHE1-binding sites in a different type of complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). A recent study of the interaction between CaM and a truncated, minimal version of eEF-2K showed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C-lobe of CaM bound the truncated eEF-2K in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] introduced an avidity effect through additional binding to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded N-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In a cellular context, where resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is around 50–80 nM, a low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM] scenario is more likely than complete absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Under such low Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, our results show that <italic>in vitro</italic> NHE1:CaM interaction can stabilize Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the C-lobe of CaM, resulting in an apo-state N-lobe and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded C-lobe bound to H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). At higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM], corresponding to, for example, mitogenic stimuli, which can increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to up to around 1 µM, the present study indicates that two scenarios are possible: one is a 1:1 NHE1:CaM complex, with the major state having the N-lobe bound to H1 and the C-lobe bound to H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>), and the second is a 2:1 NHE1:CaM complex, with the CaM N- and C-lobes both interacting with H1 on two adjacent NHE1 C-tails, potentially stabilizing the dimeric state of NHE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). As CaM is limiting in a cellular context, the two latter scenarios will be modulated both by local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and CaM interactions with other proteins at any given time. Although the total cellular [CaM] is 5–6 µM as measured in various cell types, the global free Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM concentration in a cell has been estimated to be around 50 nM, that is, ~1% of the total [CaM] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Persechini and Stemmer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saucerman and Bers, 2012</xref>). Both [CaM] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may, however, reach much higher concentrations locally, for example, close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mori et al., 2004</xref>), and the precise local Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM availability around NHE1 will be dependent on local and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and competition with other CaM-binding proteins of various affinities. Our data suggest that in a cellular context CaM is bound to NHE1 at basal global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. It is, however, possible that the local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> immediately surrounding the NHE1 C-tail may reach substantially higher levels due to local complex formation with Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yi et al., 2009</xref>).

The affinity of one CaM lobe for ERα is almost 100-fold lower than what we measured for H1 of NHE1, further supporting a unique role of the 1:2 CaM:NHE1 complex. For membrane proteins, both CaM-mediated multimerization and apo-CaM binding are well studied for tetrameric, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels. Small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup>-(SK) channel monomers form 1:1 complexes with apo-CaM through C-lobe binding, thereby keeping the channel inactive. When [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases, the N-lobe also associates with the channel, triggering dimerization and channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barros et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schumacher et al., 2001</xref>). Another example is the eag1/Kv10.1 channel, which is inhibited by CaM. Also for this interaction, the stoichiometry is 1:1, and it is proposed that CaM acts as a molecular clamp interacting with domains from neighboring subunits, thereby ‘twisting’ the pore closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>).</p><p>NHE1 proteins are functional homodimers involving several incompletely understood mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pedersen and Counillon, 2019</xref>). Based on our findings, it could be speculated that CaM binding contributes to NHE1 C-tail dimerization in a similar way as was observed for ERα, with CaM binding to H1 on two separate NHE1s in a 2:1 (NHE1:CaM) stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>), as shown in the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Conceivably, the 1:1 stoichiometry observed for CaM:NHE1<sub>622-692</sub>, with a C-lobe:H2 and N-lobe:H1 interaction, could also be possible through a 2:2 complex. This would require each CaM to span two NHE1 C-tails, binding to two different sites on two tails, forming a crossover structure (not shown). Whether this is feasible in a given cellular context will depend on the structural organization of the C-tail complexed with its binding partners and on the interaction of the NHE1 lipid interaction domain (LID) with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2020</xref>). At the conditions studied here, we did not detect the 2:2 complex. However, a role for CaM as a dimerization switch would provide a structural understanding of previous reports of dimerization sites in the C-terminal tail of NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fafournoux et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hisamitsu et al., 2004</xref>), as well as reports based on kinetic analyses of transport indicating that dimerization contributes to the regulation of NHE1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hisamitsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lacroix et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otsu et al., 1989</xref>). Finally, in addition to the direct NHE1:CaM interactions studied here, the spectrum of NHE1:CaM interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> additionally involves indirect interactions, such as within the complex between the disordered NHE1 C-tail and the CaM-binding Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hisamitsu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Since the discovery that NHE1 is a CaM-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wakabayashi et al., 1994</xref>), interaction with CaM has emerged as important for its regulation in response to a wide range of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coaxum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Turner et al., 2007</xref>). In most cases, however, the mechanisms involved have remained unaddressed. Initially, release of an autoinhibitory interaction with an allosteric ‘pH sensor site’ on NHE1 by CaM interaction was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wakabayashi et al., 1994</xref>). However, detailed kinetic analyses have questioned the existence of such a site and indicated that NHE1 activity is regulated by its dimerization state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lacroix et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otsu et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pedersen and Counillon, 2019</xref>). Our finding that CaM may contribute to stabilization of the NHE1 dimer state would reconcile these models. Finally, given the key role of anionic lipids including phosphatidyl-inositol(4,5)-diphosphate (PI[4,5]P<sub>2</sub>) in regulating NHE1 by interacting with the C-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharonovitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shimada-Shimizu et al., 2014</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM could also regulate NHE1 through electrostatic tuning of the NHE1:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction. Such mechanisms are reported for several other membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monteiro et al., 2014</xref>) and would be consistent with the folding of the NHE1-LID domain upon membrane interaction, bringing the CaM-binding region in close proximity to the NHE1-LID and the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The role of phosphorylation of S648 in NHE1 regulation has been a conundrum, with apparent conflicting findings in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Snabaitis et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we show that S648 phosphorylation, located at the distant end of H1, reduced NHE1:CaM interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>, yet both the H1-CR variant and the two phosphorylation variants, S648A and S648D, retained close (≤40 nm) proximity to CaM in cells. This may reflect that the effect of phosphorylation on the interaction was not strong enough to fully prevent interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, the observation mirrors a recent study of CaM binding to smoothelin-like 1 (SMTNL1), where, CaM-SMTNL1 proximity was retained in cells upon mutation, despite loss of interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ulke-Lemée et al., 2015</xref>). Our results agree with earlier work showing that cellular NHE1:CaM interaction is partially retained in an NHE1 variant functionally similar to our H1-CR variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 1994</xref>). Additionally, cellular NHE1:CaM interactions may occur through C-tail interactions with other proteins (e.g., calcineurin) or membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2020</xref>), independent of the residues studied here but also giving rise to PLA signals. Finally, while NHE1:CaM proximity in the absence of interaction cannot be excluded, the observed binding of NHE1 to apo-CaM <italic>in vitro</italic> and the lack of effect of ionomycin on the number of proximity events observed in cells indicate that a fraction of NHE1:CaM complexes are present at all times.</p><p>In congruence with the reduced CaM affinity of the S648-phosphorylated H1H2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced NHE1 activity in PS120 cells was reduced by the S648D phospho-mimicking variant. Inhibiting the kinase responsible for S648 phosphorylation would therefore be expected to increase Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced NHE1 activity. In our hands, an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> did not activate Akt, one obvious candidate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Snabaitis et al., 2008</xref>), and inhibition of Akt had no significant effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated NHE1 activity. Furthermore, S648 was phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by both Akt and PKC, which have overlapping consensus sites, strongly indicating that other kinases than Akt can act via S648 to regulate NHE1. We reasoned that the conventional PKCs, which require an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> for activation, were particularly relevant in this context. However, inhibition of conventional PKCs using two different inhibitors also had no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced NHE1 activation. Furthermore, as R643, R645, and R647, which are mutated in NHE1 H1-CR, also did not abrogate CaM:NHE1 complexes in cells and as they constitute key residues of the Akt and PKC consensus recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rust and Thompson, 2011</xref>), this can support an additional role for other kinases. Whether these phosphorylation sites are interdependent, potentially allowing a rheostatic response as, for instance, reported for the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borg et al., 2007</xref>), remains to be addressed. T653 has not been studied in the context of CaM but has been implicated in NHE1 regulation by Rho kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wallert et al., 2015</xref>) and β-Raf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms involved in physiological regulation of NHE1 via S648 (and T642 and T653) deserve further studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that NHE1 and CaM engage in diverse complexes of different NHE1:CaM stoichiometries and structures <italic>in vitro</italic>. The interactions can be dynamically tuned by variations in the concentrations of NHE1, CaM, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and by phosphorylation of S648. In cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced NHE1 activity was reduced by mutation in the first CaM-binding helix, as well as by mimicking S648 phosphorylation, but not by inhibition of Akt. In contrast, NHE1:CaM proximity was not lost by these mutations, likely reflecting further complexity of NHE1:CaM interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>. S648 phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> was facilitated by both Akt and PKC, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated NHE1 activity was not affected by Akt inhibition, suggesting that multiple kinases regulate S648 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we determined the structure of the ternary complex between CaM and two NHE1 peptides, pointing to a possible role of CaM in stabilizing NHE1 dimers via binding to two C-terminal regulatory tails. Our results provide novel insight into the dynamics and regulation of NHE1:CaM interaction, and we suggest that an additional NHE1 regulatory layer tuned by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM availability may contribute to NHE1 dimerization. As CaM binding to membrane proteins is widespread, similar regulatory mechanisms and structural diversity may be relevant for tuning oligomerization and function in many other membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Antibody against NHE1 (#sc-136239) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX.

recognize the importance of structural dynamics studies of complexes, emphasizing that biological systems are not fixed, but rather interact dynamically with their targets. Your work focusing on the engagement of calmodulin with the Na/H exchanger NHE1, using a number of different biophysical methods, in particular NMR, provides a nice illustration of this, with multiple states modulated by the stoichiometries of the components. It further adds to the many different important roles of calmodulin in its interactions with targets.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Dynamic NHE1-Calmodulin complexes of varying stoichiometry and structure regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent NHE1 activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Walter J Chazin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All of us are convinced of the importance of solution NMR in studies of the sort that you do involving multiple interactions and dynamic systems. Yet there were several flaws identified, including the lack of a structure of CaM bound to the full C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (or a fragment containing H1 and H2) and establishment of binding stoichiometry to full length NHE1. Is it a 1:2 or 2:2 complex, or a mixture of both? A 2:2 complex would agree with the crystal structure, whereas 1:2 stoichiometry would support the NMR structure of CaM/H1. Lastly, it was felt that the section on phosphorylation did not contribute substantially to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript presents NMR, ITC and functional data for the protein calmodulin (CaM) and its interaction with NHE1. Importantly, the study suggests that CaM may bind to NHE1 in multiple ways and that CaM binding may stabilize dimerization of NHE1. The data and approach all seem satisfactory. However, I have a few serious concerns below about the interpretation of the NMR structure in Figure 4 (and implications in Figure 7), and the narrow scope of the approach, which all need to be addressed before a final evaluation can be made.</p><p>1) The NMR structure of CaM bound to the NHE1 H1 helix (residues 620-650) in Figure 4 provides a very narrow view of the CaM interaction with NHE1, and is difficult to interpret the wider significance of this structure without knowing the overall stoichiometry of CaM binding to the full-length NHE1. Is the overall stoichiometry of CaM bound to full-length NHE1 known? If not, then it needs to be determined in this study in order to properly interpret the structure in Figure 4. For example, does the full-length NHE1 dimer bind to two CaM (2:2 complex) or just one CaM (1:2 complex)? If the CaM/NHE1 stoichiometry is 2:2, then the crystal structure of CaM bound to H1H2 complex (2YGG) already explains how CaM could stabilize dimerization of NHE1. The crystal structure (Figure 4—figure-supplement 1) shows that the CaM C-lobe binds to H1 of one molecule from NHE1 dimer, while the CaM N-lobe binds to H2 of the second molecule from NHE1 dimer. In other words, the two CaM lobes are domain swapped in the NHE1 dimer, which reveals how CaM stabilizes NHE1 dimerization as a 2:2 complex. So, if the overall CaM/NHE1 stoichiometry is measured to be 2:2, then the crystal structure already nicely explains how CaM stabilizes dimerization of NHE1 and the NMR structure in Figure 4 would merely confirm what was already known from the crystal structure. Alternatively, if the overall stoichiometry turns out to be 1 CaM per NHE1 dimer (1:2 complex), then the prediction from the crystal structure about domain swapping may be wrong, and the NMR structure in Figure 4 will in that case become far more interesting. For example, if the overall stoichiometry is 1:2, then the structure depicted in Figure 7f would explain how CaM stabilizes dimerization by having each CaM lobe bind to H1 (while H2 does not bind to CaM). This is at complete odds with the 2:2 structure (crystal structure) in which the CaM C-lobe binds to H1 and CaM N-lobe binds to H2. A simple way to distinguish the 1:2 model (Figure 7F) from the 2:2 model (crystal structure) would be to delete H2 from the full-length NHE1. The deletion of H2 should not affect CaM-induced dimerization of NHE1 in the 1:2 model, because CaM does not bind to H2 in this model. However, the deletion of H2 should abolish CaM-induced dimerization of NHE1 in the 2:2 model. So, in addition to measuring the overall CaM/NHE1 stoichiometry, it will also be necessary to prepare the H2 deletion construct of NHE1 and see if this deletion mutant impairs CaM-induced NHE1 dimerization.</p><p>2) Why was the NMR structure only reported for CaM/H1 complex? It would be far better to report the NMR structure of CaM bound to H1H2 or the entire C-terminal cytosolic domain. Does CaM bind to H1H2 (or cytosolic domain) as a 2:2 complex in solution? In other words, does CaM induce dimerization of H1H2 in solution (like what is implied in the crystal structure)? Does the C-terminal cytosolic domain form a dimer in solution, and does CaM binding stabilize this dimerization?</p><p>3) Figure 3D shows a model of CaM bound to H1H2 in a 1:1 complex. This model predicts the CaM N-lobe binds to H1 and CaM C-lobe binds to H2, which is the exact opposite of what was shown in the crystal structure (CaM N-lobe binds to H2). The discrepancy here needs more explanation. How do you know that the CaM N-lobe is bound to H1 in the 1:1 complex here? The NMR structure of CaM bound to H1H2 is needed here to prove whether the N-lobe actually binds to H1 or H2 in the CaM/H1H2 complex.</p><p>4) Figure 7 shows various types of CaM/NHE1 interaction. Unfortunately, the most interesting interaction (2:2 complex predicted from the crystal structure) is not shown. An extra panel should be added in Figure 7 to show the 2:2 interaction (implied from the crystal structure), in which the CaM N-lobe binds to H2 from one molecule of NHE1 dimer, and the CaM C-lobe binds to H1 from the other molecule of NHE1 dimer. The 2:2 interaction should depict two CaM molecules interacting in a crisscrossed fashion with the NHE1 dimer. Again, it will be important here to experimentally test the 1:2 model (Figure 7F) versus the 2:2 model implied by the crystal structure. The H2 deletion described above in point 1 can distinguish these models. The most direct way to determine which model is functionally most relevant would be to measure the overall stoichiometry of CaM/NHE1. Is it 1:2 or 2:2 or perhaps a composite of the two? Without knowing the CaM/NHE1 stoichiometry, the functional relevance of the NMR structure in Figure 4 cannot be properly understood.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports several interesting observations about the interaction of calmodulin with NHE1, a Na+/H<sup>+</sup> transport channel.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript presents NMR, ITC and functional data for the protein calmodulin (CaM) and its interaction with NHE1. Importantly, the study suggests that CaM may bind to NHE1 in multiple ways and that CaM binding may stabilize dimerization of NHE1. The data and approach all seem satisfactory. However, I have a few serious concerns below about the interpretation of the NMR structure in Figure 4 (and implications in Figure 7), and the narrow scope of the approach, which all need to be addressed before a final evaluation can be made.</p><p>1) The NMR structure of CaM bound to the NHE1 H1 helix (residues 620-650) in Figure 4 provides a very narrow view of the CaM interaction with NHE1, and is difficult to interpret the wider significance of this structure without knowing the overall stoichiometry of CaM binding to the full-length NHE1. Is the overall stoichiometry of CaM bound to full-length NHE1 known? If not, then it needs to be determined in this study in order to properly interpret the structure in Figure 4. For example, does the full-length NHE1 dimer bind to two CaM (2:2 complex) or just one CaM (1:2 complex)?</p></disp-quote><p>The in vivo stoichiometry of flNHE1 to CaM i is not known and in our opinion not trivial to obtain, since there is no experimental protocol established to express and purify dimeric flNHE1 or the complete cytosolic domain. Further, as we previously showed, flNHE1 and Calmodulin also interact indirectly via Calcineurin (Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2019), thus obtaining a reliable stoichiometry in vivo would require the separation of these interactions, which we do not consider feasible. We would be grateful for any suggestions of how to prove the stoichiometry in vivo. Equally importantly, the in vitro part of our study shows that there is not a single complex with ONE fixed stoichiometry but that there are various complexes formed depending on the conditions and availability of the binding partners. Thus, we propose that the stoichiometry of flNHE1 to CaM in vivo is similarly variable, allowing fine-tuning of NHE1 function in response to the specific subcellular environment, including the free concentrations of CaM and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in conjunction with NHE1 phosphorylation state and other regulatory interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the CaM/NHE1 stoichiometry is 2:2, then the crystal structure of CaM bound to H1H2 complex (2YGG) already explains how CaM could stabilize dimerization of NHE1. The crystal structure (Figure 4—figure-supplement 1) shows that the CaM C-lobe binds to H1 of one molecule from NHE1 dimer, while the CaM N-lobe binds to H2 of the second molecule from NHE1 dimer. In other words, the two CaM lobes are domain swapped in the NHE1 dimer, which reveals how CaM stabilizes NHE1 dimerization as a 2:2 complex.</p></disp-quote><p>The crystal structure does not show a 2:2 complex and the article describing the crystal structure does not suggest a 2:2 complex in any way. The unit cell is 1:1 and the accompanying SAXS data is in clear disagreement with a 2:2 stoichiometry. The SAXS data is also in poor agreement with the proposed 1:1 complex (pdb-code: 2YGG), suggesting that the 1:1 model we propose in Figure 3d is actually the main complex in solution. The following are citations from the original paper describing the crystal-structur (pdb-code: 2YGG): “The overall structure shows a 1:1 binding stoichiometry of the NHE1CaMBR and CaM.”… “The scattering curves and the distance distribution function P(R) calculated from the crystal structure do not fit the experimental data perfectly (Figure 5A and B), where a shoulder at Dmax of 40–60 Å was more apparent for the complex structure. However, the deviations were small, and the agreement is fully consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry of CaM and NHE1CaMBR in the complex. Any differences between the measured and calculated scattering curves can be attributed to flexibility of the NHE1CaMBR helix termini as well as the CaM helix connecting the lobes. The SAXS data show that the complex is monomeric in solution”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So, if the overall CaM/NHE1 stoichiometry is measured to be 2:2, then the crystal structure already nicely explains how CaM stabilizes dimerization of NHE1 and the NMR structure in Figure 4 would merely confirm what was already known from the crystal structure.

So, it might very well be that complexes with different stoichiometries (1:1, 1:2, 2:2) are populated under different conditions in vivo, making the regulation of NHE1 a complex multistep process rather than a simple on/off switch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is at complete odds with the 2:2 structure (crystal structure) in which the CaM C-lobe binds to H1 and CaM N-lobe binds to H2.</p></disp-quote><p>All complexes described in this study in solution are at odds with the 1:1 (not 2:2) crystal structure. We think that crystallization is not the best method to study this dynamic, multi-state system and that the complex that crystallized in the previously published work is only populated to a very small extent in solution. In contrast, our solution NMR approach provides strong experimental evidence for the proposed models in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A simple way to distinguish the 1:2 model (Figure 7F) from the 2:2 model (crystal structure) would be to delete H2 from the full-length NHE1.

And the suggested experiment is definitely an interesting option. But whatever the outcome of this experiment will be, it will be far from simple to interpret: first, the suggested interpretation is based on the assumption that the interaction has to be either a 1:2 or a 2:2 complex in the cell, neglecting that both forms of the complex might have a cellular function and regulate NHE1 differently and even be present simultaneously. Second, it will be difficult to pinpoint the functional effect of deleting the full H2 to the interaction with CaM, since other functional implications of this part of the protein might be present (for example the week self-association we also describe in the manuscript). Finally, as also pointed out in the manuscript, the dimerization of full-length NHE1 is supported by multiple interactions in both the transmembrane and cytosolic regions of the protein rather than only by H2. It would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to dissect the contributions of each interaction from studies of the full-length protein in vivo and arrive at conclusive findings. Just as one example, Kd values for each interaction will be affected by the specific subcellular environment. Hence, while we fully acknowledge its limitations, a major strength of the in vitro experiments is the ability to study the interactions in a highly controlled environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why was the NMR structure only reported for CaM/H1 complex?

Higher order complexes are also possible.” For this reason it was not possible for us to do a “classical” structure determination of the CaM:H1H2 complexes by NMR. In our opinion there is no way to determine the structure of this dynamic ensemble of complexes in a classic way since it is too small for cryo-EM, crystallization only gives an artifact of a minor subpopulation, and the dynamic nature of the complex in solution renders its NMR signals broad and inaccessible for higher dimensional NMR experiments needed for a structure determination. Our strategy of deducing structural information of the complex state with H1H2 by comparing the peak positions in the 15N-HSQC with the well-defined single state complexes of CaM with H1 or H2 is therefore the only way to come up with the models of the full complex at different stoichiometries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3D shows a model of CaM bound to H1H2 in a 1:1 complex.

Thus, the 2 models we propose in Figure 3A,D are very well supported by experimental evidence (~280 observations of chemical shifts on calmodulin that are additionally backed up from the NMR studies on labelled NHE1 as shown in the figure supplement 2), so we are not sure what more evidence we can provide, since a full structure determination is not possible for the reasons described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7 shows various types of CaM/NHE1 interaction.

We believe this is the only way to deduce models of the full complex at different stoichiometries. Indeed, the state populated with excess H1 is the same state we see when CaM is saturated with H1H2. The NMR spectra overlap nicely and thus allow access to the CaM:H1H2 structure through the CaM:H1 complex.</p><p>At a 1:1 stoichiometry of CaM:H1H2 all 70 peaks (140 chemical shifts) of the CaM N-lobe (or N-domain) overlap strikingly well with the state where CaM is bound to H1. The same is true for the 70 peaks of the C-lobe (or C-domain) and H2 (Figure 3D-F). At a 1:2 stoichiometry all 140 peaks of CaM:H1H2 overlap with the state where CaM is bound to H1. This indicates the NMR-structure we solved is equivalent to the major state in solution at a stoichiometry of 1:2 (CaM:H1H2). So the two models we propose in Figure 3A,D are very well supported by experimental evidence: ~280 observations of chemical shifts on CaM that are additionally backed up from the NMR studies on labelled NHE1 as shown in Figure supplement 2 and the size determinations in our revised manuscript. Since a direct structure determination is not possible for the reasons described above, we believe our approach is the most appropriate, and we think we can provide ample experimental evidence for the conclusions that we draw.</p><p>While this was mentioned in the original manuscript and the data shown, we agree that we did not make this point sufficiently clear. To emphasize this important information, we have therefore rewritten the manuscript, and now initiate this section by presenting the CaM:H1H2 complex and highlighting that the quality of these spectra did not allow for its full structure determination. We then explain our comparative strategy for elucidating the structure of the 1:2 complex using the complexes of CaM with the individual peptides. This has resulted in a complete rewrite of the text in this part of the manuscript, and we now explain the logics of our approach much clearer (please see the revised manuscript). We thank the reviewer for spurring this rewrite, which we think have improved the clarity of our strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is no longer true that CaM uses the wrap-around mode of binding in the vast majority of cases.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree, and the statement has been rephrased to “In most cases where this has been studied to date, CaM wraps both its lobes around its α-helix-forming targets, exemplified by the interaction with myosin light chain kinase (Ikura et al., 1992; Meador, Means and Quiocho, 1992). However, it is now clear that a single CaM binding mode or a single binding motif does not exist.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Observing that Akt is not critical to calcium-induced activation of NHE1 is interesting, but this line of study would be much more significant if the kinase(s) that phosphorylate S648 were identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this mechanism would be highly interesting to unravel. We therefore carried out a series of new experiments. As our data showed that both Akt and protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) phosphorylated this residue in vitro (Figure supplement 9B), we tested the effect of two well-established PKC inhibitors, bisindoylmaleimide I (BIM 1) – targeting PKCα, -β1, -β2, -γ, -δ, and –ε, and Gö6983 – targeting PKCα, PKCβ, -γ, -δ and -ζ. The data, presented as new Figure 6f, show that preincubation with even high doses of these PKC inhibitors does not prevent ionomycin-induced NHE1 activation. Thus, we conclude that while Akt and PKC can phosphorylate S648, they are not essential for calcium-induced NHE1 activation. It may be noted that BIM I also inhibits GSK3 (Hers, Tavare and Denton, 1999), hence, this kinase, which has a similar consensus sequence as Akt and PKC, is also not required for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation. Given that we identified several other potential phosphosites on NHE1 that may play a role but require extensive further studies, a full understanding of the mechanism will await further studies.

Although the total cellular [CaM] is 5-6 µM as measured in various cell types, the global free Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM concentration in a cell has been estimated to around 50 nM, i.e. ~1% of total [CaM] (Persechini and Stemmer, 2002; Saucerman and Bers, 2012). Both [CaM] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may, however, reach much higher concentrations locally, e.g. close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Mori, Erickson andYue, 2004), and the precise local Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM availability around NHE1 will be dependent on local and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and competition with other CaM binding proteins of various affinities.
