interventions. The pathophysiology consists of a prominent inflammatory component that can be targeted to prevent cartilage degradation and structural defects. Intracellular metabolism has emerged as a culprit of the inflammatory response in chondrocytes, with both processes co-regulating each other. The role of glutamine metabolism in chondrocytes, especially in the context of inflammation, lacks a thorough understanding and is the focus of this work. We display that mouse chondrocytes utilize glutamine for energy production and anabolic processes. Furthermore, we show that glutamine deprivation itself causes metabolic reprogramming and decreases the inflammatory response of chondrocytes through inhibition of NF-κB activity. Finally, we display that glutamine deprivation promotes autophagy and that ammonia is an inhibitor of autophagy. Overall, we identify a relationship between glutamine metabolism and inflammatory signaling and display the need for increased study of chondrocyte metabolic systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glutamine</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>chondrocyte</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR072623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abu-Amer</surname><given-names>Yousef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR074992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abu-Amer</surname><given-names>Yousef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>85160-STL-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abu-Amer</surname><given-names>Yousef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR076758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mbalaviele</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI161022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mbalaviele</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Glutamine deprivation reprograms chondrocytes, attenuates inflammation, and such intervention may be protective against joint inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Joint disease afflicts millions of individuals around the world, though these conditions are greatly understudied. While many different diseases can affect the joints, osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common, affecting over 200 million individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen et al., 2022</xref>). Significant advancements have been made in the treatment of classical inflammatory joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, due to identification of therapeutic targets and biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palfreeman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shams et al., 2021</xref>). Disease modifying compounds, especially with the advent of biologics, have revolutionized the management of these patients and allowed improved joint outcomes. However, OA still lacks disease modifying interventions, leading to significant medical and financial burden in the United States and around the globe. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedenbaugh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). OA can affect many different joints and presents in a variety of manners, likely contributing to the lack of clear disease pathophysiology or therapies, though inflammatory and biomechanical factors play a role, amongst other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deveza and Loeser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mobasheri and Batt, 2016</xref>). OA is characterized by joint degradation, with articular cartilage damage and joint space narrowing. Clinically, patients have increased pain and loss of joint mobility that can progress to significantly impair functionality. Interventions include use of NSAIDs and intra-articular steroid injections for pain relief as well as joint replacement surgeries. However, there are currently no medications for preventing or reversing joint damage caused by OA, and several clinical trials have failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the disease is indolent and slowly progressing, often presenting with its classical symptoms long after joint degradation has begun and usually long after inciting factors, such as joint injury, have taken place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blasioli and Kaplan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roos and Arden, 2016</xref>). Clearly, there is a need for novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and overall understanding of disease pathophysiology.</p><p>Various groups have shown that inflammation is a driver of OA, even though it may not present like traditional inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldring and Otero, 2011</xref>). Joint inflammation causes cartilage-resident chondrocytes, as well as other joint infiltrating cells, to generate catabolic enzymes to promote an overall joint degradative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blasioli and Kaplan, 2014</xref>). Inflammatory stimuli activate signaling pathways such as the NF-κB pathway, which are important drivers of OA disease but have not been successfully targeted in OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catheline et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). These stimuli can range from cytokines to mechanical stress to inorganic particulate matter, making it difficult to target specific inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu-Bryan and Terkeltaub, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Bosch, 2019</xref>). Due to this, it is necessary to identify targetable cellular processes that modulate downstream inflammatory and catabolic activity in articular chondrocytes in response to a variety of stimuli.</p><p>Metabolic reprogramming is one such process that has gained interest in various cell types and disease state as a disease driver and may also be important in OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiellini, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). Intracellular metabolism does far more than energy production and can modulate the inflammatory response of cells through regulation at various levels, ranging from epigenetics modifications to redox modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu and Wang, 2018</xref>). As such, chondrocyte intracellular metabolism has come into focus recently as a potential therapeutic target for modulating catabolic activity through regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways. Supporting this finding, we have shown recently that inflammatory stimuli alter the metabolism of chondrocyte, which can then regulate inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Glucose metabolism has been fairly extensively studied in chondrocytes, though the role of other substrate pathways, such as fatty acid or amino acid metabolism, has been less well studied. However, understanding the role of these other substrate pathways is critical since many metabolic pathways are interconnected and likely play a role in OA pathogenesis. In support of this claim, several groups have displayed recently that modulation of metabolic pathways can protect against OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abboud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu-Bryan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). In humans, studies have shown that OA and RA joints have altered metabolite levels in the synovial fluid, though it is unclear if these changes are due to disease or drivers of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhbari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhai, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, it has been displayed that systemic metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baudart et al., 2017</xref>) likely influence OA development, potentially through nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sellam and Berenbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhuo et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these findings, it is probable that altered cell metabolism can be used not only as a biomarker of joint health but also as a therapeutic target. To help address some of the knowledge gaps in the field, we focused in this study on the role of glutamine in chondrocyte physiology and in response to inflammatory stimulation.</p><p>Glutamine is highly abundant throughout the body and is essential for many anabolic processes but can also be utilized for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cruzat et al., 2018</xref>). Some recent studies have elaborated the function of glutamine metabolism in chondrocyte physiology, though more understanding is required. One group demonstrated that inflammatory stimulation altered glutamine uptake and glutamate release in chondrocytes, with glutamate receptor involved in modulation of chondrocytes inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piepoli et al., 2009</xref>). Another group showed that glutamine metabolism is critical for regulating anabolic activity, glutathione production, and epigenetic modifications in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stegen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, several studies have highlighted that glutamine levels are altered in synovial fluid of OA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhbari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>). These studies highlight that glutamine is likely to be an important substrate for chondrocytes, both in healthy and disease states.</p><p>In this study, we aim to characterize the role of glutamine metabolism in the inflammatory response of chondrocytes. Recent work has begun to explore the role of glutamine in the chondrocyte inflammatory response, primarily utilizing glutamine supplementation to display potentially protective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). However, the overall paucity of data in the field suggests the need for further research and a different approach to understanding the role of glutamine in OA chondrocytes. We utilize glutamine deprivation in the context of IL-1β stimulation as well as supplementation of glutamine downstream products to determine their function in the inflammatory response. We focus on NF-κB signaling as well as autophagy, both of which have been shown to be cooperatively important players in OA disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chondrocytes utilize glutamine for intracellular energy metabolism</title><p>We have previously shown that chondrocytes under inflammatory conditions undergo metabolic reprogramming, with increased reliance upon glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that there is mitochondrial dysfunction with inflammatory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">López-Armada et al., 2006</xref>). During these conditions, there is decreased reliance upon glucose as a source of TCA cycle substrates, though other energy substrates such as glutamine can still fuel TCA activity to drive anabolic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez-Reyes and Chandel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meiser et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we seek to determine if chondrocytes can utilize glutamine to fuel anaplerotic TCA cycle activity. We observe that IL-1β stimulation alters the expression of glutamine and glutamate transports, as well as several key glutamine metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chondrocytes rely upon glutamine for energy production.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Primary murine chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β (10ng/mL) for 24hr.

Culturing chondrocytes in glutamine free media led to a slight decrease in viability, suggesting that chondrocytes require glutamine for energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Since the first step of glutamine metabolism and entry to TCA cycles is conversion to glutamate, a process catalyzed by glutaminase (GLS), we utilized a GLS inhibitor, CB-839, which mimics the effect of glutamine deprivation on cell metabolism by preventing glutamate generation. We confirmed that GLS inhibition significantly reduced intracellular glutamate to levels approaching that of glutamine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We also observed a decrease in ATP levels with GLS inhibition, further confirming that chondrocytes do utilize glutamine for energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Given that chondrocytes clearly rely upon glutamine, we then performed Seahorse analysis to confirm that chondrocytes utilized glutamine for metabolism and energy production. We note that IL-1β stimulation increases glycolysis and causes a dramatic decrease in OxPhos, likely via mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>). We observed that glutamine deprivation led to a decrease in both extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR), with a more dramatic effect on OCR, likely due to contribution of glutamine to TCA anaplerotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>). ECAR is generally viewed as a surrogate for glycolytic activity in the form of lactic acid mediated acidification, though there is also a contribution of carbon dioxide generated from de-carboxylation during TCA cycle. We observe similar effects on metabolism with GLS inhibition, indicating that glutamine breakdown by GLS is an essential step for energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p><p>We sought to determine if human OA cartilage also exhibits altered expression of glutamine metabolic enzymes. We noted that human OA cartilage displays increased expression of various glutamine metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-H</xref>), potentially suggesting increased glutamine metabolism. We validate that OA cartilage is more catabolic and inflammatory through measurement of NF-κB inhibitor zeta (<italic>Nfkbiz</italic>) and matrix metalloprotease 3 (<italic>Mmp3</italic>) expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I-J</xref>). We also note that IL-1β stimulation of human chondrocytes isolated from knee cartilage caused some glutamine metabolic enzyme changes, though less significantly than OA chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K-M</xref>), indicating that metabolic changes in human cells may be a chronic change or in response to other inflammatory stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Glutamine deprivation causes metabolic reprogramming to inhibit glycolysis</title><p>Given that glutamine primarily supplies TCA cycle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>), and not glycolytic substrates, we were surprised to observe that glutamine deprivation of chondrocytes was able to cause a reduction in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. We sought to determine what impact glutamine deprivation may have on systems such as glycolysis which tend to primarily utilize glucose, and if glutamine modulation is able to modify glycolytic activity. Furthermore, we have previously shown that metabolic reprogramming toward increased glycolysis induced by IL-1β can promote catabolic activity and OA disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We observe that glutamine deprivation itself was able to induce metabolic reprogramming that supports TCA activity. We noted increased expression of glutaminase (<italic>Gls</italic>) with glutamine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and slight increase in some TCA cycles enzyme expression such as malate dehydrogenase (<italic>Mdh</italic>) and succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (<italic>Sdha</italic>), with insignificant changes in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>). However, glutamine deprivation inhibited the expression of various glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Furthermore, we observe that glutamine deprivation can prevent many of the glycolytic and PPP enzymes metabolic changes observed with IL-1β stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). This is further supported by the finding that glutamine deprivation can reduce lactate production by chondrocytes, a marker of glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), confirming that the decrease in ECAR seen with glutamine deprivation is at least partially due to decreased glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Based on our findings, it appears that glutamine deprivation supports TCA cycle activity but inhibits glycolysis and PPP. This may be a compensatory mechanism utilized by cells in the absence of glutamine to sustain ATP production via utilization of the energy favorable TCA cycle, as well as anabolic activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Glutamine deprivation causes metabolic reprogramming to inhibit glycolysis.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Primary murine chondrocytes were cultured in media containing 4 mM glutamine or 0 mM glutamine for 24 hr.

However, we did note that glutamine is in fact required for the production of various downstream substrates, such as asparagine and aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>). Given that glutamine deprivation reduced OxPhos activity and ATP levels, but did not reduce TCA metabolite levels, chondrocytes may be able to generate TCA metabolites by utilization of other anaplerotic processes. These systems can generate metabolites but usually do not generate energy.

We observed that glutamine deprivation led to a decrease in inflammatory and catabolic gene expression in response to IL-1β, with a reduction in expression of genes such as interleukin 6 (<italic>Il6</italic>) and matrix metalloprotease 13 (<italic>Mmp13</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). We then sought to determine the mechanism by which glutamine can regulate the inflammatory response. We measured NF-κB activity since it is the principle inflammatory response pathway to IL-1β that we have previously demonstrated is important for OA development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>). We observe using chondrocytes derived from p65-luciferase reporter mice that glutamine deprivation dose dependently inhibits NF-κB activation, as measured by luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). It has also previously been displayed that IκB-ζ is a critical pro-inflammatory mediator of NF-κB activity in chondrocytes treated with IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). We observe that glutamine deprivation leads to a decrease in IκB-ζ protein expression and stability, at least partially due to inhibition of NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Our earlier work has also shown that IκB-ζ is a redox sensitive protein that is stabilized by oxidative stressors from metabolic sources such as Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and the mitochondria, so we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the absence of glutamine in response to IL-1β stimulation. We observed decreased ROS production in the absence of glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), likely due to decreased inflammatory response and a reduction in pro-oxidative metabolic changes we have previously characterized. It should be noted that glutamine is important for the production of the anti-oxidant molecule glutathione in chondrocytes; however, this result seems to suggest that glutamine deprivation can reduce oxidative species generation more significantly than glutathione production may be reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stegen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Glutamine deprivation inhibits the inflammatory response.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Primary murine chondrocytes were cultured in media containing 4 mM glutamine or 0 mM glutamine for 24 hr.

We also observed that GLS inhibition was also able to potently decrease IκB-ζ protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that glutaminolysis contributes to IκB-ζ-mediated gene expression. Furthermore, GLS inhibition reduced NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The glutaminolysis reaction performed by GLS generates glutamate and free ammonia from glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). Glutamate can then be converted to a-ketoglutarate, glutathione, or undergo transaminase reactions. On the other hand, ammonia is a reactive species, often viewed as a waste product, and can be incorporated into amino acids or urea for its removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurmi and Haigis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spinelli et al., 2017</xref>). We sought to determine if glutamate or ammonia generated by GLS can regulate the inflammatory response of chondrocytes. We supplemented chondrocytes with ammonia or glutamate and measured the inflammatory response. We observed that ammonia supplementation was pro-inflammatory, activating NF-κB and increasing IκB-ζ protein levels in the setting of IL-1β stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). It also increased expression of inflammatory and catabolic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Ammonia supplementation also partially rescued inflammatory gene expression under glutamine deprivation conditions. Glutamate supplementation did not have a significant impact on NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This finding suggests that ammonia generation from glutamine metabolism may be involved in promoting inflammation through stabilization of IκB-ζ and its transcriptional program. While glutamine is a major source of ammonia production, it is not the only source of ammonia, as asparagine is another amino acid with an amide side chain that can generate ammonia. We then sought to determine if asparagine supplementation in the absence of glutamine may be able to rescue the effect of glutamine deprivation. However, we observed that asparagine supplementation was unable to do so, suggesting that glutamine deprivation may activate unique pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Given that we did not observe an increase in inflammation with glutamate supplementation, we then tested the efficacy of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) inhibitor, EGCG, which blocks the conversion of glutamate to α-KG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2006</xref>), a process that also releases an ammonia group and is critical for the generation of pro-inflammatory downstream metabolites such as succinate. We note that EGCG treatment also slightly reduced the inflammatory response represented by <italic>Il6</italic> expression, though less potently than glutamine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This is expected given that EGCG blocks α-KG production and glutamate-based ammonia release in TCA cycle but does not alter glutamine generation into glutamate or other downstream products. Hence, EGCG only partially mimics glutamine deprivation and as such is less anti-inflammatory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Glutamine deprivation activates autophagy</title><p>Since it is well known that nutrient deprivation can induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russell et al., 2014</xref>), we sought to determine what impact glutamine deprivation would have on chondrocyte autophagy processes, especially in the context of inflammation. We note that IL-1β stimulation of chondrocytes leads to a decrease in autophagy, as noted by accumulation of p62 protein. We then observe that there is an upregulation of autophagy with glutamine deprivation, as indicated by a decrease in p62 protein, which is often an indication of autophagy progression as p62 is degraded by autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). We also note a significant decrease in LC3 protein levels with glutamine deprivation due to increased consumption of LC3 through autophagy. We validated this through chloroquine treatment, an inhibitor of autophagy, which can rescue LC3 and p62 levels in glutamine deprivation conditions, indicating that LC3 and p62 are being processed by autophagy. We validated these findings by immunofluorescence, which displayed that chloroquine treatment led to far greater increase in LC3-positive punctate in cells under glutamine deprivation conditions compared to glutamine replete conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Ammonia treatment led to an increase in LC3b and p62, likely through blockade of autophageosome-lysosome fusion.

These findings were confirmed through increased number of LC3 positive punctate in ammonia treated cells but not in glutamate treated cells, indicating opposing effects of ammonia and glutamate on autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>One of the major cell stress response factors involved in regulating metabolism and autophagy is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which can modulate intracellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">B’chir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Leary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stegen et al., 2022</xref>). Mechanistically, we observe that glutamine deprivation is able to increase ATF4 protein expression, which is reduced with IL-1β stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1N-O</xref>). We note that at around 12 hr of glutamine deprivation, <italic>Atf4</italic> expression increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1P</xref>). ATF4 activation is a well-known response system to amino acid deprivation, and it is known to be a driver of autophagy processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ye et al., 2010</xref>). ATF4 is also a mediator of metabolic reprogramming, which we observe with glutamine deprivation and IL-1β stimulation. Suspecting that ATF4 may be important in OA, we note that OA mouse cartilage (meniscal-ligamentous injury [MLI]) has decreased expression of ATF4, mimicking the effect of IL-1β stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1Q</xref>). Based on these results, it is predicted that ATF4 may be an anti-inflammatory factor and will be the focus of future work.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>mTOR2 but not mTOR1 is activated by glutamine deprivation</title><p>Since mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is another critical factor connecting metabolism and autophagy, we interrogated mTOR activation in the setting of glutamine deprivation and inflammation. mTOR activation has been shown to be a driver of metabolic changes, especially for glycolytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Magaway et al., 2019</xref>).

Rapamycin has been suspected to be protective in many disease states through the downstream effects of mTOR inhibition, such as increasing longevity and preventing aging-associated diseases in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Selvarani et al., 2021</xref>). We validate that rapamycin can block mTOR1 activation through complete abrogation of phospho-S6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We show that rapamycin treatment can reverse some metabolic changes induced by IL-1β, such as increased glycolytic enzyme expression using LDHA as a representative gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also note that rapamycin treatment is able to upregulate expression of glutamine synthase (<italic>Gs</italic>) and <italic>Gls</italic> but did not affect glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (<italic>Got2</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). However, under glutamine deprivation conditions, rapamycin treatment only affected <italic>Gls</italic> expression, but not <italic>Gs</italic> or <italic>Got2</italic>. We then measured the impact of mTOR1 inhibition by rapamycin on the inflammatory response and unexpectedly observed that rapamycin increases the expression of inflammatory and catabolic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). It also reverses some of the inflammatory inhibition induced by glutamine deprivation, suggesting an important role for mTOR1 in the anti-inflammatory effect of glutamine deprivation. Rapamycin treatment has been displayed systemically to be anti-osteoarthritic in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pal et al., 2015</xref>), though there is precedence for rapamycin to be pro-inflammatory in intra-cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weichhart et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This work displays that glutamine utilization by chondrocytes is important for their physiology and inflammatory response and may be an important player in OA. We show that chondrocytes utilize glutamine for energy production even when glucose is abundant, indicating that chondrocytes rely upon multiple substrates for metabolism. However, we observe that glutamine deprivation is able to decrease chondrocyte glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which was unexpected since prior groups have mainly described glutamine as fueling the TCA cycle in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). This finding was enlightened when we noted that glutamine deprivation caused metabolic reprogramming to inhibit glycolytic activity by significantly decreasing expression of glycolytic enzymes but maintained TCA metabolites. This was an unanticipated new interaction between glutamine and glucose metabolism which may be a compensatory mechanism that forces chondrocytes to rely upon other energy sources such as fatty acid oxidation to maintain anabolic processes. In addition, this reprogramming caused by glutamine deprivation may actually be protective in the context of inflammation, as will be discussed further. Future work utilizing an untargeted metabolomics approach will be useful for understanding the contribution and interactions of various substrate pathways to chondrocyte metabolism and physiology.</p><p>From an inflammatory standpoint, which is important for OA pathophysiology and cartilage degradation, we observed that glutamine deprivation was able to decrease chondrocyte expression of inflammatory and catabolic genes in response to IL-1β stimulation. Mechanistically, we observed decreased NF-κB activation and expression of IκB-ζ with glutamine deprivation. We also note that glutamine deprivation reduces ROS generation in response to IL-1β stimulation, which we have previously shown is protective and can block IκB-ζ expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>). This effect may be mediated via the metabolic reprogramming induced by glutamine deprivation, reversing metabolic changes induced by IL-1β that we have previously shown are pro-inflammatory. For example, LDHA and PPP activity have previously been shown to be pro-inflammatory in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arra et al., 2020</xref>), but these processes are decreased in the setting of glutamine deprivation. In this manner, glutamine deprivation may further decrease the inflammatory response through a reduction in oxidative stressors and metabolic modulation. We find that our results may conflict with some recent work which showed that glutamine supplementation to chondrocytes is protective through reduction in inflammatory factors. There are several differences in the methodology used to study the impact of glutamine between these two studies. We utilize glutamine deprivation, while the other group utilized glutamine supplementation of up to 20 mM to media that already contained glutamine at 2.5 mM concentration. It is possible that both of these processes can activate protective mechanisms, such as autophagy or reduction in oxidative stress with deprivation, or production of α-KG and activation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA’s) with over-supplementation. Overall, it is clear that the role of substrate metabolism in chondrocytes requires more nuanced study.</p><p>We then noted that glutamine deprivation is able to promote autophagy and activates stress response systems such as ATF4 pathway. These systems are likely required for maintenance of amino acid levels and anabolic activity in the absence of glutamine. However, autophagy and stress systems have also been shown to be protective and may hold therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aman et al., 2021</xref>). For example, intermittent fasting and rapamycin as autophagy promoting compounds have gained interest recently as modalities for driving protective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mattson and de Cabo, 2020</xref>). Our prior work has also demonstrated that autophagy can also regulate inflammatory responses through modulation of NF-κB and other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adapala et al., 2020</xref>), which may be involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of glutamine deprivation. Our future work will focus on understanding the role of ATF4 stress response system and autophagy in the modulation of chondrocyte inflammatory response and NF-κB activity. We can also utilize well-accepted autophagy assay systems such as LC3-GFP mice as well as knockout models of critical autophagy components in order to further study autophagic flux in the setting of nutrient deprivation. This can provide greater insight into the effects on autophagic flux and downstream impact on inflammatory processes.</p><p>Our work also briefly explored the interaction of mTOR and inflammatory response in the setting of nutrient deprivation. Interestingly, our work displays that inhibition of mTOR1 by rapamycin was pro-inflammatory and pro-catabolic, in contrast with other studies that showed that rapamycin is protective in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caramés et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takayama et al., 2014</xref>). This finding raises questions regarding the therapeutic potential of rapamycin for the treatment of aging associated disease such as OA, which has gained interest in recent the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Selvarani et al., 2021</xref>). Rapamycin is well known to be an activator of autophagy, a supposedly ‘protective’ process, yet use of rapamycin increases the production of catabolic factors in the setting of inflammation. It is possible that these results are due to the complex interactions of mTOR1 and mTOR2, which can have significantly different downstream functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jhanwar-Uniyal et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that dysregulation of the balance of these systems can influence cell metabolism and also lead to a pro-inflammatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szwed et al., 2021</xref>). Our future work will explore the differing roles of mTOR1 and mTOR2 in the chondrocyte inflammatory response to better understand the role of modulators such as rapamycin as therapeutics.</p><p>Our study then focused on the GLS reaction, which is one of the rate-limiting steps of glutamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herranz, 2017</xref>). We demonstrated that ammonia is an inhibitor of autophagy and promotes inflammatory responses, while glutamate is not. Prior studies on the role of ammonia in regulation of autophagy have demonstrated that ammonia is able to both induce and inhibit autophagy through various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soria and Brunetti-Pierri, 2019</xref>). It is possible that ammonia derived from glutamine may be pathological, especially if it is not appropriately recycled. The role of ammonia and ammonia-removal processes in chondrocytes require further study, especially in the context of inflammation, to determine their importance in joint disease. In addition, measurement of ammonia levels in synovial fluid may provide insight into the health of OA and RA joints. Our finding that glutamate treatment does not influence inflammatory response is in agreement with a prior study showing that exogenous glutamate did not influence inflammatory response of chondrocytes, although N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade was anti-inflammatory, raising interesting questions about the role of glutamate in chondrocyte physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piepoli et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, our work suggests that glutaminolysis may be pro-inflammatory through the production of ammonia which can block protective autophagy unless systems exist for ammonia incorporation and removal that can prevent this effect.</p><p>The results of this work lay the foundation for further investigation into glutamine metabolism as a possible therapeutic target. Several inhibitors exist that may hold some therapeutic potential, such as the GLS inhibitor CB-839, which is currently in clinical trials for anti-tumor potential and can be repurposed for the treatment of OA. Use of genetic mouse models will also provide more detailed in vivo pre-clinical information when combined with OA models. In addition, further work will be performed to determine if glutamine and downstream metabolite levels can be correlated to OA disease severity, allowing for the development of biomarkers. Another major knowledge gap is the understanding of non-glutamine amino acid and fatty acid utilization by chondrocytes, which can be performed through combined metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomics-based approaches. Finally, more work needs to be performed using human samples such as articular cartilage and synovial fluid to create better translational models since OA is unlikely to be a single disease entity but a variety of sub-conditions with their own unique pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deveza and Loeser, 2018</xref>). A complete understanding of chondrocyte metabolism may provide an expanded toolbox for the understanding of OA and give rise to a personalized approach for patient treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Multiple treatments were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test multiple comparisons test for greater than two groups. Student’s T test was used for comparing two groups. Student’s T test was performed for comparing same biological samples subject to different treatments. p-Values are indicated where applicable. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.0005, and ****p&lt;.0001. Histology and immunostaining data were scored by investigators blinded to the experimental conditions. Male and female mice were used at equal ratios for cell culture to avoid sex bias. Sample size determination was not required.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

We believe that there are several possible explanations for the differing results. Importantly, our work focuses on glutamine deprivation while the paper by Ma et al., 2022 utilizes glutamine supplementation to supra-physiological levels. It’s possible that both of these approaches can activate protective pathways that may be useful for the treatment of OA. We also added explanatory background sentences to better explain why we may have been “surprised” at some results. For example, we explain why it was unexpected that glutamine deprivation would reduce oxidative stress on line 8 of page 8. Overall, there is further work that needs to be done to explore these unexpected findings in further mechanistic details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A few points need to be taken into consideration in order to make this manuscript suitable for publication.</p><p>Figure 3F shows that ammonia stabilizes IkBz protein expression, not IkBz (Nfkbiz) gene expression as stated on page 8 line 11.

It is clear that EGCG targets an enzyme multiple steps downstream of glutamine breakdown, hence it is unlikely to have the same broad signaling effect that glutamine deprivation will have. Furthermore, glutamine can contribute to many different substrates, while EGCG primarily blocks aKG production.</p><p>We addressed to some degree the different functions of mTOR1 and mTOR2 and speculated about why rapamycin may be pro-inflammatory. Unfortunately, mTOR2 is understudied, especially in the context of inflammation. This will be the focus of future work, as we interrogate the different functions of mTOR1 and mTOR2 in chondrocytes. However, we included several references that describe the functions of mTOR1 and mTOR2 in the context of metabolism and immunity.</p><p>We included a figure showing that asparagine supplementation was unable to rescue glutamine deprivation, and explain why we believed it may not be able to. It is potentially related to some unique function of amino acid sensing machinery and interchangeability of ammonia and substrates from asparagine vs glutamine.</p><p>Language was modified to be more scientific.</p></body></sub-article></article>
