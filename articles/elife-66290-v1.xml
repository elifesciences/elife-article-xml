within the genome is the key epigenetic feature. To understand how each histone variant is targeted to the genome, we developed a new method, the RhIP (<italic>R</italic>econstituted <italic>h</italic>istone complex <italic>I</italic>ncorporation into chromatin of <italic>P</italic>ermeabilized cell) assay, in which epitope-tagged histone complexes are introduced into permeabilized cells and incorporated into their chromatin. Using this method, we found that H3.1 and H3.3 were incorporated into chromatin in replication-dependent and -independent manners, respectively. We further found that the incorporation of histones H2A and H2A.Z mainly occurred at less condensed chromatin (open), suggesting that condensed chromatin (closed) is a barrier for histone incorporation. To overcome this barrier, H2A, but not H2A.Z, uses a replication-coupled deposition mechanism. Our study revealed that the combination of chromatin structure and DNA replication dictates the differential histone deposition to maintain the epigenetic chromatin states.</p></abstract><kwd-group

chromatin, in which the basic structural unit is the nucleosome. The nucleosome is composed of around 150 base pairs of DNA and a histone octamer consisting of two copies of each core histone, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Chromatin is not only the storage form of genomic DNA but also the regulator of DNA-templated processes, such as transcription, replication, repair, and chromosome segregation. To enable these processes, chromatin forms various structures that can be reversibly altered. Historically, cytological studies first identified euchromatin and heterochromatin, which are transcriptionally active and inactive regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Passarge, 1979</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that euchromatin coincides with nuclease hypersensitivity, indicating that it forms a more accessible structure (open chromatin) than heterochromatin (closed chromatin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garel and Axel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Spiker et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tsompana and Buck, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Weintraub and Groudine, 1976</xref>). Although these chromatin structures are involved in the regulation of DNA template-mediated processes, little is known about how the open and closed chromatin configurations are formed and maintained.</p><p>Among the chromatin associated proteins, histones have a significant impact on the chromatin structure. In humans, the canonical histones, H2A, H2B, and H3.1, have non-allelic variants with distinct expression and/or localization patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buschbeck and Hake, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maehara et al., 2015</xref>). Canonical H3.1 and H2A are expressed in S phase and show genome-wide localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buschbeck and Hake, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wu et al., 1982</xref>). In contrast, the histone variants H3.3 and H2A.Z are expressed throughout the cell cycle and concentrated at promoters in both open chromatin and pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyarchuk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DranÃ© et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greaves et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin and Felsenfeld, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raisner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rangasamy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sarcinella et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wu et al., 1982</xref>). In addition, H3.3 localizes at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). Another H2A variant, MacroH2A, is found at transcriptionally suppressed chromatin, such as inactive X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costanzi et al., 2000</xref>). Along with the canonical H2A, the localization of H2A.X, which functions in DNA repair, is genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yukawa et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, in spite of the high-sequence homology between the canonical and variant forms, each histone has specific functions. A previous study identified the six essential residues responsible for the H2A.Z-specific functions, which are located in the Î±C helix called the M6 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarkson et al., 1999</xref>). The H2A.Z swap mutant, in which M6 was replaced with the equivalent residues in H2A, failed to rescue the embryonic lethality of the H2A.Z null mutant in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Thus, the importance of M6 in the organism was evident; however, its molecular mechanism remained elusive.</p><p>Histone deposition and exchange have been studied for more than 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">ClÃ©ment et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura and Cook, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Louters and Chalkley, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tachiwana et al., 2010</xref>). An in vivo histone deposition study must distinguish the pre-incorporated histones (parental histones) from the newly incorporated histones (new histones). To enable this, initial studies used radio-labeled histones and revealed that histone deposition occurred by both replication-coupled and replication-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Louters and Chalkley, 1985</xref>). In principle, the replication-independent histone deposition would accompany histone eviction from chromatin, in a process described as histone exchange or turnover. Several key proteins involved in these mechanisms have been identified. Anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1), together with chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), plays indispensable roles in replication-coupled H3.1 deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tyler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tyler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tyler et al., 2001</xref>). CAF-1 is a heterotrimeric complex composed of p150, p60, and p48, and directly interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), leading to the assembly of H3.1 at replicating chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moggs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</xref>). The histone regulator A (HIRA) or death-associated protein (DAXX) promotes the accumulation of H3.3 at transcription sites and regulatory elements in a replication-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DranÃ© et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ray-Gallet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>H2A- and H2A.Z-specific chaperones have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Obri et al., 2014</xref>). Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT), a histone chaperone, may be involved in replication-coupled H2A deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Orphanides et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ransom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wittmeyer and Formosa, 1997</xref>). Recent studies revealed that FACT binds to the H3-H4 complex, indicating that FACT functions in H3-H4 depositions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tsunaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). ANP32E functions in H2A.Z eviction from chromatin, and the SNF2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) chromatin-remodeling subunit YL1 promotes H2A.Z deposition at gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Latrick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Obri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wong et al., 2007</xref>). The histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex, NuA4/TIP60, also functions in H2A.Z deposition by interacting with pre-deposited H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">GÃ©vry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giaimo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shia et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The precise distribution of histones is crucial for chromatin organization and its epigenetic states. The ChIP-seq analysis method is powerful and useful to visualize steady state histone localizations; however, it does not enable the analysis of the incorporation of each histone into open/closed chromatin or both (genome-wide). To analyze histone incorporations, several approaches using fluorescence imaging, mass spectrometry, inducible tagged proteins, and labeling of newly synthesized proteins have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deal and Henikoff, 2010</xref>). Imaging-based methods, such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and SNAP/CLIP-tag technology, were developed to analyze the histone dynamics in living cells. FRAP is suitable for investigating the histone mobility in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura and Cook, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tachiwana et al., 2010</xref>). The SNAP/CLIP-technology is effective for analyzing the histone deposition, as it can distinguish parental histones from new histones in cells with cell-permeable fluorophores that covalently bind to the tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">ClÃ©ment et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>). Although these are powerful methods, they have resolution limitations since they are based on imaging. The SNAP/CLIP-technology led to the establishment of the time-ChIP method, in which a biotin-labeled SNAP-histone is captured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deaton et al., 2016</xref>). The time-ChIP method was developed to measure the stability of parental histones, rather than the histone incorporation, as it has a time lag during the synthesis and labeling of histones, which limits the time resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deaton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siwek et al., 2018</xref>). The tetracycline (Tet) inducible expression system, which induces the expression of epitope-tagged histones, has been applied for analyses of nucleosome turnover/histone exchange. However, this system also has a time resolution limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yildirim et al., 2014</xref>). To uncover the correlation between histone incorporation and open/closed chromatin structures, a new analysis method for the histone incorporation at the DNA sequence level is desired.</p><p>Permeabilized cells are useful to dissect the molecular pathways in nuclear events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okuno et al., 1993</xref>). In assays with such cells, the cellular membranes are permeabilized by a nonionic detergent treatment. In the permeabilized cells, the chromatin and nuclear structures remain intact and react with exogenously added proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maison et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Misteli and Spector, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Saitoh et al., 2006</xref>). A previous study showed that an exogenously added GFP-tagged histone, prepared from cultured human cells, was incorporated into the chromatin of permeabilized cells in the presence of a cellular extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, permeabilized cells are suitable for monitoring replication timing, by labeling the nascent DNA with exogenously introduced nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Misteli and Spector, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we developed a new method, in which a reconstituted histone complex, instead of a fluorescent protein-tagged histone, was added to permeabilized cells. We named this the RhIP assay (<italic>R</italic>econstituted <italic>h</italic>istone complex <italic>I</italic>ncorporation into chromatin of <italic>P</italic>ermeabilized cell). Since the histone complexes are reconstituted in vitro using epitope-tagged recombinant histones, RhIP with sequencing allows the analysis of incorporations at the DNA sequence level, without the need for specific antibodies. We found that the chromatin structure regulates the histone incorporations, which may be necessary for maintaining the epigenetic state of chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RhIP assay reproduces in vivo histone deposition</title><p>To understand how histones are incorporated into chromatin in cells, we developed the RhIP assay, in which an in vitro reconstituted histone complex, nucleotides, and a cellular extract are added to permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first confirmed that the RhIP assay can recapitulate the specific histone incorporations observed in cells. The H3.1-H4 incorporation into chromatin is coupled with replication, while the H3.3-H4 incorporation occurs throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>). We reconstituted H3-H4 complexes in vitro, using recombinant H3.1, H3.3, and H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The recombinant H3.1 and H3.3 were fused to HA and FLAG tags at their C-termini, respectively. The permeabilized cells were then prepared by treating HeLa cells with a nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, and the reconstituted H3-H4 complexes were mixed with the cellular extract and nucleotides. Cy5-dUTP was also added, in order to monitor DNA replication. After the reaction, the exogenously added H3.1 and H3.3 were detected with antibodies against the HA and FLAG tags, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref>). As a result, the H3.1 was detected in the Cy5 positive cells (S phase cells), while the H3.3 was detected irrespective of the Cy5 signal. As the co-incubated H3.1â3HA-H4 and H3.3-3FLAG-H4 complexes showed different staining patterns, they were incorporated into the chromatin by specific mechanisms, rather than non-specifically, in the RhIP assay.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RhIP (<italic>R</italic>econstituted <italic>h</italic>istone complex <italic>I</italic>ncorporation into chromatin of <italic>P</italic>ermeabilized cells) assay recapitulates the replication-coupled H3.1-H4 and -dependent H3.3-H4 depositions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the RhIP assay, using reconstituted H3.1-H4 and H3.3-H4 complexes.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, the amounts of precipitated DNA are nearly the same between the H3.1 and H3.3 samples, as judged from the SYBR Gold staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, upper); however, the amount of nascent DNA labeled with Cy5 is much greater in the H3.1 sample than in the H3.3 sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, lower). This result indicates that H3.1 is incorporated into replicating chromatin more efficiently than H3.3. We further performed the RhIP-ChIP-seq of H3.3 to examine the distribution of incorporated H3.3 in the RhIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that exogenously added H3.3 was preferentially incorporated into transcriptionally active genes, rather than inactive genes. This distribution pattern is consistent with many previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pchelintsev et al., 2013</xref>). The RhIP-ChIP-qPCR analysis also demonstrated the H3.3 enrichment at the transcriptionally active GAPDH, as compared to that at the inactive gene, LNC02199 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Thus, our results imply that the reconstituted H3.1-H4 and H3.3-H4 complexes are incorporated into the chromatin of permeabilized cells with the same dynamics as observed in intact cells.</p><p>CAF-1 and HIRA are key factors for the H3.1 and H3.3 depositions in vivo, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DranÃ© et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ray-Gallet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tyler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tyler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tyler et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore examined whether their roles can be recapitulated in the RhIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We first analyzed whether CAF-1 and HIRA remain in the permeabilized cells or are extracted during the permeabilization process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Our immunoblot showed that both CAF-1 (p60) and HIRA remained in the permeabilized cells. We then performed the RhIP-immunostaining assay of H3.1 or H3.3 using CAF-1- or HIRA-knockdown cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). For a precise evaluation, we co-cultured the control and knockdown cells on the same coverslips, and performed RhIP-immunostaining assays of H3.1 or H3.3. The knockdown cells were judged by immunostainings for CAF-1 (p60) (cells with arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>) and HIRA (cells with arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). For the detection of H3.1, cells were synchronized to S phase by adding thymidine 18 hr before performing the RhIP assay. As a result, the H3.1 incorporation was detected in CAF-1-positive S phase cells (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Similarly, the H3.3 was detected in HIRA positive cells (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). We also investigated whether H3.1 and H3.3 were incorporated into the chromatin or merely bound to histone chaperones, CAF-1 and HIRA, respectively, which are present in the chromatin of the permeabilized cells. After performing the RhIP assay, we washed the cells with PBST containing 300 mM NaCl prior to the fixation and immunostaining processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We found that that the exogenously added H3.1 or H3.3 was still detected after washing the cells with PBST containing 300 mM NaCl, even though CAF-1 and HIRA were no longer detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3BâE</xref>). Therefore, the exogenously added H3.1 and H3.3 were mostly incorporated into the chromatin of the permeabilized cells in the RhIP assay. These data demonstrated that the H3.1 and H3.3 incorporations into chromatin in cells were correctly recapitulated in the RhIP assay.</p><p>We further examined whether the cellular extract is essential or replaceable by the histone chaperones, NAP1 or ASF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). NAP1 and ASF1 bind to the H2A-H2B and H3-H4 complexes in vivo, respectively, and both promote nucleosome formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishimi et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Munakata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tachiwana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tyler et al., 1999</xref>). Human NAP1 and ASF1 were purified as recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). The H3.1-H4 complex was then added to the permeabilized cells in the absence of the cellular extract or in the presence of NAP1 or ASF1, and the incorporation was analyzed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4C</xref>). Without the cellular extract or the histone chaperone, the exogenously added H3.1 was not detected in the permeabilized cells, indicating that no H3.1 incorporation had occurred. NAP1 promoted the promiscuous incorporation irrespective of DNA replication, and ASF1 facilitated H3.1 accumulation in the nucleoli. These data indicated that the functional deposition of the exogenously added histone complex requires the cellular extract, which may contain essential components. Together with the fact that the efficiency of RhIP-ChIP of exogenously added H3.3 is almost the same as that of endogenous H3.3 ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>), we conclude that the RhIP assay reproduces cellular histone deposition and is suitable for analyzing histone incorporation in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H2A.Z incorporation into chromatin differs from that of H2A andÂ H2A.X</title><p>Among the H2A family members, canonical H2A and the H2A.X variant show even and broad genome-wide distributions, but H2A.Z specifically localizes in open chromatin, including promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buschbeck and Hake, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raisner et al., 2005</xref>). To test whether this difference reflects their deposition manners, we performed the RhIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The H2A-H2B and H2A.Z-H2B complexes were reconstituted in vitro using recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and added to permeabilized cells, which were then immunostained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The H2A and H2A.Z signals were both observed in the Cy5-negative and -positive permeabilized cells, indicating that their incorporations occur irrespective of DNA replication. We also found that H2A forms foci in the S phase nuclei. We then merged the images of the H2A and Cy5 signals. The replication foci change as cells progress through S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leonhardt et al., 2000</xref>). In early S phase, the replication foci are present throughout the nucleoplasm, except for the nucleoli. The foci then accumulate at the nuclear periphery and around the nucleoli. In late S phase, the foci increase in size but decrease in number. We found that the H2A signals overlapped well with the replication foci throughout replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The H2A.Z signals overlapped with the early replication foci to some extent, but they were clearly eliminated from the late replication foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In contrast to the difference between H2A and H2A.Z, the H2A and H2A.X signals overlapped well with each other, suggesting that their incorporation mechanism is the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that H2A, H2A.X, and H2A.Z can be incorporated into chromatin in a replication-independent manner; however, during S phase, H2A and H2A.X are preferentially incorporated into the chromatin of ongoing replication sites, in contrast to H2A.Z.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The H2A.Z and H2A deposition patterns are different in the RhIP assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the RhIP assay, using the reconstituted H2A-H2B and H2A.Z-H2B complexes.

We investigated whether the efficiencies of H2A and H2A.Z incorporation into replicating chromatin change, according to the replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). For this analysis, the cells were synchronized in early S phase by a double thymidine block, and then early and late S phase cells were collected at 0 and 5 hr post thymidine-release, respectively. The synchronized cells showed the typical early and late replication foci representing nascent DNA labeled with Cy5-dUTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Using these cells, we performed RhIP-ChIP assays of H2A and H2A.Z. The results revealed that the incorporation efficiencies of both H2A and H2A.Z into replicating chromatin did not change, irrespective of the replication timing in S phase. This implies that the efficiencies of replication-coupled histone deposition are not different between open (early S-replicating) and closed (late S-replicating) chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Open and closed chromatin structures regulate histone deposition</title><p>The RhIP-ChIP assay showed that the H2A.Z deposition on nascent DNAs was constant in the early and late S phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the RhIP-immunostaining revealed that more signals of H2A.Z incorporation were overlapped at the early replicating foci than the late replicating foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). This discrepancy may arise from the lower resolution of the immunostaining imaging. Some of the overlapping signals of H2A.Z and Cy5 in early S phase might represent the replication-independent H2A.Z deposition that occurred close to, but not exactly at, the replication sites in open chromatin. To determine whether the efficiency of the histone deposition depends on the open/closed chromatin configuration, we performed RhIP-ChIP-seq and analyzed the H2A and H2A.Z incorporations in each type of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). First, we investigated the replication-independent histone deposition using asynchronous permeabilized cells, in which the majority of the cells are out of S phase. We found that the RhIP-ChIP-seq profiles of H2A and H2A.Z showed a strong correlation (0.62 Pearson correlation) and specific peaks at megabase resolution, which were not observed in the input samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We noticed that these patterns are similar to the DNaseI-seq results, which mapped open chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tsompana and Buck, 2014</xref>), suggesting that H2A and H2A.Z are predominantly incorporated into open chromatin regions. We then analyzed the efficiency of histone incorporations into open and closed chromatin using the chromHMM data (Core 15-state model), which classified the open and closed chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ernst and Kellis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The ChIP/input ratios of each chromatin region revealed that H2A and H2A.Z were efficiently incorporated into transcriptionally active open chromatin, while their incorporations into closed chromatin were inefficient. These results indicate that histone incorporation occurs mainly in the open chromatin regions in a replication-independent manner, and closed chromatin suppresses histone incorporation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The incorporation of histones H2A and H2A.</title><p>Z mainly occurs at less condensed chromatin and H2A incorporation into condensed chromatin requires a replication-coupled deposition mechanism.

A series of studies using the yeast SRCAP ortholog SWR1 revealed the mechanism of chromatin remodeling-mediated H2A.Z deposition and showed that ATPase activity is essential for the H2A.Z deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altaf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mizuguchi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sun and Luk, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether ATP is required for the deposition of H2A.Z in the RhIP assay. As cellular ATP is removed during the permeabilization process, the permeabilized cells lack ATP. We then prepared the ATP-reduced cellular extract and used it in a RhIP-ChIP-seq analysis of H2A.Z with or without ATP supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We found that ATP facilitated H2A.Z deposition at active TSS and enhancer regions as effectively as ANP32E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicated that the H2A.Z deposition in the RhIP assay is a net result of the ANP32E-mediated eviction and deposition of H2A.Z, and the replacement of pre-incorporated H2A with H2A.Z by chromatin remodeling. As ATP is used in multiple biological processes, such as transcription, splicing/translation, molecular chaperone functions, and so on, the possibility that these ATP-dependent reactions affected the H2A.Z incorporation in this assay cannot be excluded. Intriguingly, the efficiencies of H2A.Z incorporations into insulator regions are less affected under ANP32E- or ATP-reduced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>).

Previous histone incorporation analyses using genetically encoded histone genes have revealed chromatin dynamics, including nucleosome turnover kinetics, but have limitations on the time resolution, as they require time to synthesize and/or label histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deal and Henikoff, 2010</xref>). In contrast, the RhIP assay can detect histone incorporation with better time resolution, as it does not require histone synthesis or labeling. In fact, we could analyze histone incorporations in the early and late S phases separately, using synchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By combining RhIP with ChIP-seq, the RhIP assay enables the analysis of histone incorporation at the DNA sequence level, while ChIP-seq reveals their static presence. Scatter plot analyses of the H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq replicates at known H2A.Z sites showed a quite high correlation (0.95 Pearson correlation coefficient), while the H2A and H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq data showed a weaker correlation as compared with one of the replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, the RhIP-ChIP-seq analysis of H2A.Z also showed the reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and better enrichment (S/N ratio) as compared with ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>), probably due to the high-affinity antibody against the epitope-tag. Together with the fact that the RhIP-ChIP assay requires a small number of cells (approximately 8Â ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> cells), the RhIP assay is suitable for the biochemical analysis of ChIP samples. The effects of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones on their incorporation have remained elusive. Methods to produce histones with PTMs in vitro have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nadal et al., 2018</xref>), and thus the analysis of the effects of PTMs on histone incorporation will be the next target for the RhIP assay.</p><p>The proper combination of histone chaperones and histone variants ensures correct histone localization. Therefore, if only histone variants are increased, then the excess histone variants may bind to unsuitable histone chaperones, leading to ectopic localization. Indeed, the overexpressed histone H3 variant, CENP-A, in cells aberrantly binds to the H3.3 chaperone, DAXX, leading to ectopic localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacoste et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, the ectopic localizations of histones were not observed. Therefore, there may be sufficient amounts of free histone chaperones under these conditions. We performed the RhIP assay simultaneously with two different histone variants, which do not share the same chaperone. This suggests that they do not affect each otherâs incorporations. Since the amounts of exogenously added histones can be increased in the RhIP assay, it may be suitable for competition assays to analyze the overexpression of a specific histone variant.</p><p>The RhIP assay successfully reproduced the replication-coupled H3.1 incorporation and replication-independent H3.3 incorporation throughout the genome. Furthermore, the H3.1 and H3.3 incorporations required CAF-1 and HIRA, respectively, in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Although CAF-1 is present in permeabilized cells, replication-coupled H3.1 deposition required the cellular extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that one (or more) unknown cytosolic factor(s) couples newly synthesized H3.1 to chromatin-binding proteins, such as the CAF-1 complex.</p><p>The present study has revealed the correlation between histone incorporation and chromatin structure, using the RhIP assay. We analyzed the incorporation of the H2A family members, H2A, H2A.X, and H2A.Z. We found that the incorporations of H2A-H2B and H2A.X-H2B into transcriptionally active open chromatin can occur in both replication-coupled and -independent manners, whereas their incorporation into transcriptionally inactive closed chromatin occurs only in a replication-coupled manner in late S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This indicated that histone exchange would rarely occur in closed chromatin. Thus, the genome-wide localization of H2A and H2A.X is achieved by a combination of deposition into open chromatin and replication-coupled deposition into closed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, H2A.Z exhibited a much lower frequency of replication-coupled deposition, as compared to H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Together with the fact that the amount of H2A.Z is much lower than that of H2A in S phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wu et al., 1982</xref>), we concluded that little to no H2A.Z is incorporated into closed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is consistent with previous observations that the H2A.Z and DNA methylation localizations are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nothjunge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zilberman et al., 2008</xref>), and that H2A.Z predominantly exists at promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buschbeck and Hake, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Link et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Obri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schones et al., 2008</xref>). The means by which H2A.Z becomes enriched at specific regions of open chromatin have remained enigmatic. Our study suggested that the H2A.Z elimination from transcriptionally inactive chromatin is due to the low frequencies of histone exchange and replication-coupled H2A.Z incorporation, which may partially explain the H2A.Z distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, H2A.Z was specifically incorporated into chromatin around the TSS of expressed genes in the RhIP assay, in excellent agreement with the steady state localization of H2A.Z revealed by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>). We also found that the H2A.Z depositions in active TSS and enhancer regions decreased in the ANP32E knockdown cellular extract, indicating that the ANP32E-mediated eviction promotes the new deposition of H2A.Z in the RhIP assay. However, other mechanism(s) may also exist, because the decrease in the H2A.Z deposition was relatively moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). This is consistent with the results that ANP32E knockout mice did not show any apparent effects on their viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reilly et al., 2010</xref>), even though proper H2A.Z incorporation is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Our data also showed that ATP promoted the H2A.Z deposition in active TSS and enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>), suggesting that the H2A.Z deposition is an ATP-dependent process. Taken together, the H2A.Z deposition in the RhIP assay is the net result of the ANP32E-mediated eviction and deposition of H2A.Z, and the replacement of pre-incorporated H2A with H2A.Z by ATP-dependent processes. We also found that the correlation between the RhIP-ChIP-seq and ChIP-seq of H2A.Z at known H2A.Z peaks in the gene body is lower, as compared with all known H2A.Z peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> center and right). This may reflect the fact that the RhIP assay cannot assess histone recycling; ThatÂ is, the re-deposition of the evicted histone, which is observed during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeronimo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">TornÃ et al., 2020</xref>).

As human pericentric heterochromatin is composed of repetitive DNA sequences (satellite repeats), we could not analyze H2A.Z incorporation into pericentric heterochromatin by the RhIP-ChIP-seq assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Previous studies showed that the transcriptional activation of pericentric satellites accompanies the structural changes from heterochromatin to euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jolly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rizzi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saksouk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Valgardsdottir et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the pericentric region of human chromosome nine is heterogeneous, with both heterochromatic and euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilbert et al., 2004</xref>).

Histones reportedly form a pre-deposition complex, which includes many transcription-related factors, before their incorporation into chromatin in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunleavy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Obri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, the H2A-H2B pre-deposition complex contains Spt16 and SSRP1, which form the heterodimer complex FACT that functions in transcription facilitation, and the pre-deposition H2A.Z-H2B complex also includes a chromatin remodeling factor (SRCAP), a histone acetyltransferase (TIP60), and acetyl-lysine-binding proteins (GAS41, Brd8). If histone exchange usually occurs in closed chromatin, then these transcription-related factors might accumulate in the closed chromatin and alter the epigenetic chromatin states. Therefore, the deficiency of replication-independent histone exchange in closed chromatin may be important for maintaining a transcriptionally inactive state.</p><p>In spite of the high-sequence homology between H2A and H2A.Z, their localizations are different. By using the swapping mutant, we analyzed the residues responsible for the specific depositions of H2A and H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We identified residues 88â100 of H2A as being responsible for its replication-coupled deposition. Although the means by which this region contributes to the incorporation into replicating chromatin remain unknown, a factor that binds this region and allows H2A to assemble at a replicating site may exist. The major H2A-specific chaperones, Spt16 and Nap1, which are components of the H2A pre-deposition complex, do not bind to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Gurrieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kemble et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the protein that recognizes these residues is likely to be a chromatin protein involved in replication, rather than a component of the H2A pre-deposition complex. This region is a counterpart of the H2A.Z M6 region, and the H2A.Z_M6 swapping mutant did not compensate for the embryonic lethality of the H2A.Z knockout in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarkson et al., 1999</xref>). As this region is essential for the H2A.Z eviction by ANP32E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gursoy-Yuzugullu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Obri et al., 2014</xref>), the incorporated H2A.Z_M6 mutant may not be removed from closed chromatin, thus resulting in aberrant gene expression and impaired embryonic development.</p><p>In conclusion, our novel method elucidated the mechanism of histone incorporation at the DNA sequence level, and revealed that the chromatin structure is the first determinant of histone localization.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The beads were then washed three times each with 500 Î¼l of ChIP buffer, ChIP buffer containing 500 mM KCl, and TE. The beads were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of ChIP elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, and 1% SDS), and incubated overnight at 65Â°C to reverse the cross-links. The DNA was then eluted with 0.4 mg/ml Proteinase K, and further purified with a PCR clean-up kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL). The DNA libraries were prepared using a SMARTer ThruPLEX Tag-seq Kit (Takara Bio) for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, or a SMARTer ThruPLEX DNA-seq kit (Takara Bio) for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

After an overnight incubation at 65Â°C, the resulting DNA was recovered as described above and the concentration was measured. Then, one two-hundredth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> spike-in chromatin (Active Motif) was mixed with the rest of the chromatin. Two Î¼g of spike-in antibody (Active Motif) per 50 ng of <italic>Drosophila</italic> spike-in chromatin were mixed with ProteinA/G magnetic beads (Pierce). The spike-in antibody beads were then mixed with 50 Î¼l of anti-HA-tag mAb-Magnetic Beads and the chromatin mixture. Subsequent steps were performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ChIPâseq data analysis</title><p>For ChIP-seq data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, the in-read unique-molecular-identifiers (tags) were extracted using UMI-tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) with the command: umi_tools extract --<monospace>extract</monospace>-method=regex --<monospace>bc-pattern</monospace>='(?p&lt;umi_1&gt;.{6})(?p&lt;discard_1&gt;.{0,3}GTAGCTCA){sÂ &lt;=Â 2}'. The extracted reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) using hisat2 (version 2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). The PCR-duplicates were removed using umi_tools dedup. The read counts on 15 chromatin states were calculated using BED-Tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). The definition of the ChromHMM track was obtained from the consolidated data set of the Roadmap Epigenomics project (E117_15_coreMarks_hg38lift_mnemonics.bed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>). The BED files of enhancer and insulator regions used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> were also extracted from ChromHMM track. The overall concentrations of the ChIP signals (log2 ratio) were calculated as the ratio of the proportion of reads in each chromatin state between the ChIP and input DNA data; thatÂ is, log<sub>2</sub>(ChIP/Input) after normalization of the total reads. The signal tracks (bigwig files) were created at 1 bp intervals on the genome, and then the counts were normalized as CPM (Reads Per Million reads), using deepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">RamÃ­rez et al., 2014</xref>). ChIP-seq signals were visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer, IGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). The Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated throughout 800 bp intervals with the multiBigwigSummary program of deepTools, and plotted with the plotCorrelation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">RamÃ­rez et al., 2014</xref>). The multiBigwigSummary program was also used to compute the average scores for RhIP-ChIP-seq data and ChIP-seq data (GEO:GSM1003483) at H2A.Z sites, which were determined with replicates of the ChIP-seq data (GEO:GSM1003483) by the mergePeaks program of HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). The computeMatrix programs of deepTools were utilized to analyze the peak localizations at the centers of TSS, the known H2A.Z sites, and the H2A.Z peaks of the RhIP-ChIP-seq data. Genes with five or more read counts in the RNA-seq data (GSE140768 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, GSE123571 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were defined as expressed genes, and the rest were regarded as non-expressed genes. The H2A.Z peaks of the RhIP-ChIP-seq data were also determined with the mergePeaks program of HOMER.

It provides a new tool to dissect the mechanisms of chromatin assembly and disassembly genome-wide, and to determine how cell cycle and chromatin structure influence these dynamics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> as a Tools and Resources article. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers read each other's reviews and discussed their comments.</p><p>Although the general enthusiasm is high, significant doubts remain with regard to how faithfully RhIP recapitulates endogenous remodeling activities. In addition, it is unclear how feasible it is to use RhIP to dissect mechanism. For example, can a specific remodeling pathway be blocked by factor depletion? Since substantial amounts of additional work are required to substantiate the conclusions claimed in the paper, we are unable to accept the manuscript in the current form. We are however happy to reconsider if the following concerns are addressed.</p><p>1. Given the unique genomic localization of H2A.Z, the authors wisely used H2A.Z as a benchmark to assess the robustness of the RhIP approach. Indeed, site-specific deposition was observed when permeablized cells were incubated with recombinant H2A.Z and (cytosolic) extracts. While this is an interesting result, it remains unclear how well the H2A.Z sites observed by RhIP-ChIP-seq correlate with endogenous H2A.Z sites. The authors should report the percentage of H2A.Z sites correctly identified by RhIP. Scatter plots should be used to compare the relative occupancy of H2A.Z between the RhIP-ChIP-seq data and known H2A.Z sites. Are there H2A.Z sites in the RhIP-ChIP-seq data not seen in vivo. When presenting anecdotal evidence as in Figure 4A, endogenous H2A.Z tracks should be included for comparison.</p><p>2. Genomic data analyses generally lack rigor. This is epitomized in Figure 4-supplement 2. The fraction-against-rank plots give little information on the concordance of the two replicates. Do the H2A.Z sites identified in the replicates correlate spatially (e.g. along the genome), quantitatively (e.g. peak height), and qualitatively (e.g. width of peaks)? For example, relative H2A.Z occupancy at known H2A.Z sites of the two H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq replicates should be plotted against each other. The H2A RhIP-ChIP-seq datasets could serve as negative control.</p><p>3. It is important to assess how individual factors contribute to a particular remodeling pathway. Given that the steady-state H2A.Z occupancy is a net result of deposition and eviction and that multiple remodeling factors are involved in these processes, whether the observed H2A.Z peaks in RhIP-ChIP-seq represent the consequence of one or more of these factors should be evaluated. For example, are SRCAP and p400/TIP60 responsible for different H2A.Z sites across the genome? Is ATP required for H2A.Z deposition? Is ANP32E responsible for removing H2A.Z at enhancers and insulators? Does transcription contribute to H2A.Z eviction? Proper spike-in controls should be incorporated into the RhIP-ChIP-seq samples before and after the addition of factor-depleted extracts to allow quantitative assessment. Since cytosolic extracts were used, it is not surprising that some factors may be under represented. If such biases do exist, the authors should consider using nuclear extracts and/or provide evidence on how much remodeling factors partitioned into the fractions relative to input (e.g. SRCAP western blots).</p><p>4. The title suggests that RhIP is generally applicable to all histones. But there was no mention of the H3 results in the Abstract or the Discussion. In addition, while immunostaining shows H3.1 and H3.3 are incorporated into the nucleus of permeabilized cells at the expected cell cycle stages, microscopy lacks the resolution necessary to validate if H3.1 and H3.3 are targeted to the expected genomic locations. For example, is H3.3 more enriched at active genes? CAF1 and HIRA knockdown should be used to verify if H3.1 and H3.3 are indeed deposited by these pathways. Finally, to show that H3.1 and H3.3 are indeed inserted into nucleosomes, the MNase experiment similar to the one in Figure 3C should be performed.</p><p>5. Major improvement of the description of methods is required to allow rigorous assessment of the approach. The current methods section lacks critical details necessary to carry out the experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Tachiwana and coworkers have developed a histone deposition assay called RhIP that recapitulates site-specific incorporation of tagged histones into the chromatin of permeabilized cells using cellular extracts. The authors showed that RhIP recapitulates replication-dependent and -independent deposition of histone H3.1 and H3.3, respectively. They also showed that RhIP allows site-specific deposition of H2A, H2A.X and H2A.Z. However, the paper falls short in showing that RhIP can actually be used to dissect molecular mechanisms. For example, if extracts from chaperone/remodeler-depleted cells were used, could a specific histone deposition step be blocked? Could purified proteins then be added back to restore histone deposition activity? In addition, what contribution endogenous factors (i.e. from the permeabilized cells) have on RhIP is unclear.</p><p>An <italic>eLife's</italic> Tools and Resources article does not require to report major new biological insights; however, it must be able to demonstrate such advances can be made by applying the new tools. In this respect, whether the RhIP approach can be used to dissect mechanism cannot be evaluated. Therefore, I do not recommend the manuscript in the current form to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Other major issues:</p><p>1. 'Open chromatin' and 'close chromatin' are loosely defined terms. The authors should use specific histone marks (e.g. H3K4me3 or H3K27me3) as reference for co-localization analysis of the incorporated histones.</p><p>2. Based on the data presented in Figure 4, the robustness of site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z using RhIP cannot be rigorously evaluated. For example, while H2A.Z appears to be deposited at the promoters of some genes, there are H2A.Z peaks outside of promoters. Are these mis-incorporated H2A.Z molecules (i.e. RhIP artifact)? Or are they bona fide H2A.Z sites. The authors should provide endogenous H2A.Z ChIP-seq data for comparison and evaluate how well RhIP recapitulates endogenous H2A.Z deposition.</p><p>3. Transfection reagents for proteins, such as the Chariot system, have previously been used to deliver chromatin factors into mammalian cells (Larson AG et al. Nature 2017. PMID:28636604). What is the deposition efficiency of RhIP compared to Chariot?</p><p>4. A related question is how efficient is RhIP? What is the percentage of nascent histones incorporated by RhIP? The authors should perform western blots to compare the relative amounts of tagged and untagged histones.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Tachinawa et al. presents a new method (called RhIP) that monitors incorporation of histone dimers into permeabilized cells. The authors test H3.1 and H3.3 containing H3-H4 dimers and then they primarily focus on the incorporation of H2A-H2B dimers and their variants containing H2A.X or H2A.Z. The readouts of the assay range from immunofluorescence, to Chromatin IP (ChIP) and ChIP-seq.</p><p>Overall, the method is interesting and may become a powerful tool to study chromatin dynamics. However, I have some comments that may improve the current manuscript.</p><p>1. As this has been submitted as a Tool and Resource article, I was expecting a much clearer explanation of how the RhIP is carried out. In the method section, every step of the procedure need to be spelled out more clearly. Currently one has to go back to older publications and it becomes quite difficult to recapitulate what has been done in details.</p><p>2. If I understand correctly, the authors co-incubate different histone dimers In Figure 1-2 and 5, but not in Figure 3 (and 4 perhaps). This means that the Immunofluorescence results depend on the &quot;competition&quot; between the H2A and the H2A.Z (or h3.1-H3.1) dimers, while the ChIP and ChIP-seq data in figure 3 and 4 only look at incorporation of a single dimer type (without competition for binding between different variants). This makes the comparison of the results quite challenging. What would the result of Figure 1-2 and 5 be if the different histone dimers would be added individually, rather than as a mixture? This would greatly clarify what are the properties that control dimers incorporation in this assay.</p><p>3. The authors do not really acknowledge that the incorporation observed in their studies is the net result of assembly AND disassembly pathways. This needs to be part of the narrative, because the experiments do not address which of these pathways is involved and to what extent. For example, on page 11, lines 10-14, or in page 12, line 1-2 or line 18-19, only suppression of deposition mechanisms are taken into account in the interpretation of the data, but a strong disassembly activity here may result in the same effect.</p><p>4. The MNase digestions in Figure 3 are very interesting. Can the authors include a higher exposure gel to show that the overall incorporation of Cy5dUTP is the same for H2A and H2A.Z input samples?</p><p>5. In Figure 4 C and E (and supplement 1), are the differences between samples statistically significant, or are these only trends? And what about Figure 1D?Please clarify this.</p><p>6. The title and the discussion suggest that the RhIP method is generally applicable and validated both for &quot;histones&quot; (as I understand it, it is H3-H4 and H2A-H2B (and variants thereof)). I found the H3-H4 part rather thin compared to the H2A-H2B (and variant) analysis. This is to the point that H3-H4 are completely omitted from the final model of the manuscript. Can the author address this with a title and discussion that focuses on H2A-H2B rather than &quot;histones&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Chromatin structure-dependent histone incorporation revealed by a genome-wide deposition assay&quot; by Tachiwana et al. put-forward a novel method, termed RhIP that allows a detailed investigation of mechanisms fostering histone deposition. In this approach the authors substitute permeabilized cells with recombinantly expressed tagged histones and cytosolic extracts (or chaperone proteins), and then measure histone chromatin deposition using various methods, ranging from immunofluorescence microscopy to RhIP/ChIP-sequencing. While this is an interesting method, some technical questions remain that need to be addressed and clarified. Most importantly, the authors need to show that the factors (chaperones) responsible for a faithful temporal and spatial histone variant deposition (or ejection) are actually still present in the permeabilized cell nucleus or available in the cell extract. The observation that H2A.Z is deposited into open but not condensed chromatin, could be explained by lack of (one) H2A.Z-specific chaperone/remodelling complex(es) after permeabilization. The authors need to demonstrate that these observations are not caused by a rather artificial experimental system that might not resemble the in vivo situation.</p><p>My specific concerns are listed in more detail below:</p><p>1. There are some clarifications on technical aspects of the RhIP assay missing. As I understood it, this assay was performed with a cytosolic extract, at least this is mentioned in the Materials and methods section. It would be interesting to see whether the known H2A.Z-specific chromatin remodeller complexes, such as SRCAP, p400/TIP60, ANP32E, INO80, etc. that are mostly nuclear proteins and required for H2A.Z deposition/ejection, are also present in this extract. The extracts as well as the cells after permeabilization and reconstitution should be immunoblotted for these chaperones to verify their presence. Additionally, have the authors performed these experiments in the presence or absence of ATP?</p><p>2. Figure 2: The authors have shown in Figure 2E that the H2A.Z signal overlaps with the dUTP signal in early but not in late S-phase cells. This result is in contrast to other studies using EdU-staining and microscopy in living cells that observed H2A.Z signals only overlapping with late (constitutive heterochromatin) replicating cells (e.g. Boenisch et al., 2012) and other studies showing H2A.Z levels at transcriptional start sites (euchromatin, early replicating) to be decreased during S-phase (e.g. Nekrasoph et al., 2012, NSMB). This discrepancy needs to be explained and discussed.</p><p>3. Figure 5: This is a relevant experiment, and a RhIP-ChIP-seq experiment should be included to show in greater detail that H2A.Z-M6 resembles more H2A than H2A.Z when looking at TSS (see Figure 4B).</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chromatin structure-dependent histone incorporation revealed by a genome-wide deposition assay&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

While replication-dependent mechanisms are well captured by RhIP, it is less clear if transcription and chromatin remodeling is functional in this system and thus if transcription-dependent nucleosome exchange processes are faithfully recapitulated. It is important to improve the comparison of RhIP with 'in vivo' (i.e. existing ChIP-seq datasets) localisation and explicitly develop hypotheses why in some cases the data matches the 'in vivo' situation and in others not.</p><p>a. Lines 279-301 and Figure 4. There is moderate correlation between genome-wide H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq and H2A.Z ChIP-seq (Figure 4C). However, it seems H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP might be selectively detecting TSS specific signals rather than gene body specific associations (Figure 4A and 4E). It would be helpful to comment on the genetic elements (e.g. gene body) at which H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP and H2A.Z ChIP show low or no correlation and make a comparison. This way strengths and weaknesses of the assay can be better evaluated and compared to already existing protocols. The image resolution of Figure 4A should be improved.</p><p>b. Suppl. Figure 1.1 H3.3 distribution across the active and inactive genes were plotted in Suppl Figure 1. However, how active and inactive status of genes was defined, and which data was utilized for this analysis were not indicated under the Methods. These parameters and data source should be included. Transcript levels for GAPDH and LNC02199 should also be indicated or the reader should be referred to a table containing transcription data (i.e. RNA-Seq). I also think that it would be helpful if the authors can comment on the efficiency of H3.3-HA ChIP compared to pull down of endogenous H3.3 by comparing RhIP-ChIP-seq and previously reported H3.3 ChIP-seq analyses.</p><p>c. The genomics analysis presented in Figure 3 is somewhat rudimentary, the signals from H2A and H2A.Z appear overall very correlated (Figure 3A, B), albeit the correlation genome-wide calculated in Figure 3-S2 is 'medium'. The scatter plot could be shown better to see potentially different 'population of loci, some that correlate well and 'outliers'. Judging from Figure 3B, it appears that there is a good correlation across broad chromatin states with the notable excavation of active TSS. This is in line with the known H2A.Z mechanism, but could be elaborated in plots a bit clearer. How do the profiles look across highly expressed and non-expressed genes?</p><p>The cell-cycle-synchronized plots are only summarized in the heatmap in Figure 3C,D. Example loci could be shown as in Figure 3A.</p><p>2. It would be helpful to improve the interpretation of the data to include all existing caveats to the assay setup.</p><p>a. The new ATP addition experiments (figure 5E-F) are interpreted as if the only effect of ATP is on chromatin remodellers. It is well possible that by adding ATP in this conditions, additional factors (i.e. transcription, splicing/translation, molecular chaperones, etc) are being affected and responsible for the effect.</p><p>b. The authors alternate setups where they either co-incubate different histone dimers, or they use a single histone dimer isoform. It is really unclear to the readers what is the reason for this and how does this affect the results/interpretation. In cases where a mixture of histone dimers were present (i.e. Figures 1A-D, 2, 6), competition between the H2A/H2A.Z-X or H3.1/H3.3 dimers may take place, while in the others this competition is not present. This makes the comparison of the results quite challenging, and their conclusions unclear. This should be discussed at the very least, as it has implications on understanding the properties that control histone incorporation during RhIP.</p><p>c. The RhIP-ChIP-seq protocol uses formaldehyde crosslinking instead of native mononucleosomal IP as used in Figure 1H, leaving room for interpretation if the pull-down histone is indeed incorporated into chromatin. Immunofluorescence also does not necessarily prove incorporation of histones into chromatin, since i.e. the fractionation in Figure 1-S2 shows that HIRA and CAF1 remain tightly bound to the isolated nuclei. Thus, accumulation of the epitope-tagged H3 in the nucleus of cells could merely mean that is bound to the histone chaperones present in the nucleus (competing away endogenous histones). It is not possible to discern from the data what the incorporated amount versus the chaperone-bound fraction of recombinant histone is.</p><p>d. The functional assessment of ANP32E knockdown lacks statistical analysis â clearly the quite robust knockdown (Figure 5B) does not majorly abrogate TSS incorporation of H2A.Z. Is the difference statistically significant? What is the explanation for the relatively small effect size?</p><p>e. Lines 275-277. Please revisit the conclusion and make the statement clearer on H2A.Z incorporation and elimination.</p><p>We suggest adding these references:</p><p>The authors make a thorough effort to place their method in the context of existing pulse-labeling methods, but Tet-ON based pulsing methods, which do give similar results have not been discussed: Mito, Y., Henikoff, J.

These comments are shared with you, but the reviewers do not expect these experiments to be performed in the revised version of the manuscript. We hope these will help you improve the discussion part and future studies.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Deposition of H3.3 seems rather inefficient as judged from the genome-wide profiling RhIP-ChIP-seq experiment in Figure 1-S1, and deposition appears to only occur at TSS but not across the gene bodies of active genes as observed in cells (please make sure to provide primary data on GEO for a revised submission). As I understand, the RhIP-ChIP-seq protocol uses formaldehyde crosslinking instead of native mononucleosomal IP as used in Figure 1H, leaving room for interpretation if the pull-down histone is indeed incorporated into chromatin. Immunofluorescence also does not necessarily prove incorporation of H3.1/H3.3 into chromatin, since the fractionation in Figure 1-S2 shows that HIRA and CAF1 remain tightly bound to the isolated nuclei. Thus, accumulation of the epitope-tagged H3 in the nucleus of cells could merely mean that is bound to the histone chaperones present in the nucleus (competing away endogenous histones). It is not possible to discern from the data what the incorporated amount versus the chaperone-bound fraction of recombinant histone is. Potentially, the product of the RhIP reaction could itself be fractionated using e.g. a salt gradient, which would provide evidence if the retained H3 histones are nucleosomal (retained up to ~500mM NaCl) or non-nucleosomal and dissociating at lower salt concentrations.</p><p>Further, in Figure 1H shoes that Cy5-labeled mononucleosomes are at very low abundance within the input (almost undetectable Cy5 signal in lanes 2,3,4) but highly enriched in both H3.1 and H3.3 IP. The fraction of replicated chromatin in each lane can be estimated by the Cy5/SYBR gold ratio. Assuming completely random (i.e. replication-independent) incorporation of recombinant histones, the Cy5/SYBR gold ration after IP (lanes 6,7) should be equivalent to that ratio before IP (lanes 4,5,6). Yet, in lanes 6,7, there's much more Cy5 signal thus, a strong enrichment for replicating chromatin. This suggest that not only H3.1 but also a considerable fraction of H3.3 is incorporated replication-dependent in this assay. This is entirely possible given the known role of HIRA/H3.3 in gap-filling after replication fork, especially if normal replication-dependent pathways are impaired (Ray-Gallet et al., Mol Cell, 2011). Again it needs to be stressed that the IF experiment Figure 1C do not necessarily prove that H3.3 is incorporated into nucleosomes in cells not undergoing replication.</p><p>Lastly, the knockdown experiments in Figure 1-S2 appear to confirm known roles of CAF-1 and HIRA, but important controls have and opportunities to both validate the system and learn something new have been missed: following the flowchart of Figure 1-S2B, it is evident that there's ample opportunity to test the authors hypothesis that RhIP assay indeed recapitulates the assembly pathways known in cells. For example, CAF-1 and HIRA knockdown should each be tested for epitope tagged H3.1 and H3.3, to exclude the possibility that what we are looking at here is chromatin assembly and not mere binding to nuclear chaperones. Furthermore, replication can only proceed in the presence of all four deoxynucleotides whereas chromatin remodeling requires only ATP. Thus by adding, or not, nucleotides, it can be explicitly tested if active replication is needed. Consider following setup and expected results:</p><p>no siRNA + dNTPs + ATP â nuclei are positive for H3.1 and H3.3 (shown in Figure 1-S2)</p><p>no siRNA â dNTPs + ATP â no replication! So nuclei should be negative for H3.1 unless the H3.1 signal is actually coming from H3.1 binding to CAF1. But H3.3 incorporation should be unaffected if truly replication-independent!</p><p>no siRNA â dNTPs â ATP â in the absence of nucleotides and ATP there is no energy to remove existing nucleosomes. Since we have to assume that DNA in isolated nuclei is normally chromatinized, chromatin assembly with epitope-tagged histones H3 would require prior nucleome eviction. This cannot happened without energy. Thus, in this control nuclei should be negative for H3.3. If they are still positive, then H3.3 is most likely bound by nuclear chaperones but not incorporated.</p><p>siCAF + dNTPs + ATP â nuclei are negative for H3.1 (shown in Figure 1-S2) but should be positive for H3.3 (not assayed). If gap-filling assembly via HIRA is active in RhIP assay, than H3.3 signal should even increase upon CAF1 depletion!</p><p>siHIRA + dNTPs + ATP â nuclei are negative for H3.3 (shown in Figure 1-S2) but should be remain for H3.1 when in replication (not assayed).</p><p>Figure 1 figure supplement 1B: It would make the argument stronger if the authors could show that this difference is not observed for H3.1-containing dimers.</p><p>Figure 1 figure supplement 1B: It would make the argument stronger if the authors could show that this difference is not observed for H3.1-containing dimers.</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>Since there is no negative control present for H2A, H2A.X, H2A.Z incorporation (all nuclei are positive irrespective of cell cycle), there remains an more pertinent concern that some or most of the fluorescent signal observed after RhIP could arise from non-incorporated histones that accumulate with chaperones in the nucleus. Again, a biochemical fractionation could cleanly show this, potentially also a pre-extraction protocol before immunostaining. A negative control (H2A or H2A.Z chaperone knockdown that abrogates fluorescent signal) should be established, or a -ATP control as used for the genomics experiment in Figure 5.</p><p>In Figure 2F, as with Figure 1H, it is evident that replicated chromatin is overrepresented in both H2A and H2A.Z pulldowns, suggesting that both are deposited also in a replication-dependent manner (also supported by Figure 2D image quantification). Comparison to the very similar looking fold-enrichment from pure synchronized S phase population Figure 2-S2 actually may suggest that most incorporation into proper nucleosomes is replication-dependent in this assay.</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>Is ANP32E acting catalytically (i.e. small amounts would be sufficient for keeping up eviction activity)? What's maybe more surprising is that ATP depletion is not really effective. Histone eviction requires ATP. Thus this mean there are many pre-existing nucleosome-free regions? Or could this suggest that much of the signal observed does not correspond to properly assembled nucleosomes?</p><p>Given the hypothesis put forward from Figure 5 (ATP-dependent remodeling and ANP32E together facilitate H2A.Z incorporation), then it should be tested if combined ANP32E + ATP depletion has an synergistic, additive or no additional effect beyond the single treatments.</p><p>Figure 6</p><p>The image-based analysis does support the conclusion that the M6 mutant behaves H2A-like, but it is unclear what the mechanistic insight gained from this experiment is, again acknowledging that this mutant has been constructed according to known reports.</p><p>Figure 1H: beyond demonstrating that the epitope-tagged histone associates with nucleosomal-sized DNA, a protein gel or blot would be revealing to demonstrate a stoichiometric relationship of H3, H4, H2A, H2B. A very interesting question could be addressed by assessing the ratio of epitope-tagged H3.1/3 to untagged H3 in these nucleosomal fragments: do replication-dependent and independent deposition pathways assemble homotypic H3/H4 tetramers with only exogenous (tagged) H3.1, H3.3? Or is the tagged histone H3 mixed equally with endogenous (untagged) histone H3, thus suggesting that one new H3/H4 dimer is paired with an existing H3/H4 dimer during the assembly process.</p><p>I would highly recommend performing time-course experiments to really understand the kinetics, dynamic range and saturation of the system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66290.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the general enthusiasm is high, significant doubts remain with regard to how faithfully RhIP recapitulates endogenous remodeling activities. In addition, it is unclear how feasible it is to use RhIP to dissect mechanism. For example, can a specific remodeling pathway be blocked by factor depletion? Since substantial amounts of additional work are required to substantiate the conclusions claimed in the paper, we are unable to accept the manuscript in the current form. We are however happy to reconsider if the following concerns are addressed.</p><p>1) Given the unique genomic localization of H2A.Z, the authors wisely used H2A.Z as a benchmark to assess the robustness of the RhIP approach. Indeed, site-specific deposition was observed when permeablized cells were incubated with recombinant H2A.Z and (cytosolic) extracts. While this is an interesting result, it remains unclear how well the H2A.Z sites observed by RhIP-ChIP-seq correlate with endogenous H2A.Z sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree that it is important to clarify how well the H2A.Z sites observed by RhIP-ChIP-seq correlate with the endogenous H2A.Z sites detected by ChIP-seq. Accordingly, we have reanalyzed our data, and made new figures in our revised manuscript. To clearly answer this question, we separated your comments and answered each one, as below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should report the percentage of H2A.Z sites correctly identified by RhIP. Are there H2A.Z sites in the RhIP-ChIP-seq data not seen in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>According to this comment, we visualized the H2A.Z sites of the RhIPChIP-seq read density across the endogenous H2A.Z peaks determined by ChIP-seq, using heatmaps (new Figure 4D and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A). We found that the H2A.Z incorporated by the RhIP assay exists in almost all endogenous H2A.Z peaks, while the H2A is excluded from the H2A.Z peaks. The reversed heatmap, which depicts the H2A.Z of the ChIP-seq read density across the H2A.Z peaks determined by the RhIP-ChIP-seq, showed that only 3% of the H2A.Z peaks are specific for the RhIP assay (new Figure 4E and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B). We described these analyses on page 15, lines 297-303.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Scatter plots should be used to compare the relative occupancy of H2A.Z between the RhIP-ChIP-seq data and known H2A.Z sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We drew scatter plots showing the comparison between the RhIP-ChIP-seq and ChIP-seq data at known H2A.Z sites. We found a moderately linear relationship between H2A.Z (RhIP-ChIP-seq) and H2A.Z (ChIP-seq), but little to no correlation between H2A (RhIP-ChIP-seq) and (ChIP-seq) (new Figure 4C). We described this on page 15, lines 293-297.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Genomic data analyses generally lack rigor. This is epitomized in Figure 4-supplement 2. The fraction-against-rank plots give little information on the concordance of the two replicates. Do the H2A.Z sites identified in the replicates correlate spatially (e.g. along the genome), quantitatively (e.g. peak height), and qualitatively (e.g. width of peaks)? For example, relative H2A.Z occupancy at known H2A.Z sites of the two H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq replicates should be plotted against each other. The H2A RhIP-ChIP-seq datasets could serve as negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we confirmed the reproducibility of the RhIP-ChIP-seq of H2A.Z according to this suggestion. We plotted the H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq replicates at known H2A.Z sites, which showed a quite high correlation (0.95 Pearson correlation coefficient), while the H2A and H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq data showed a weaker correlation, as compared to one of the replicates (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A). Moreover, the aggregation plots of the two H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq replicates at known H2A.Z sites showed similar accumulation patterns (new Figure 4D and new Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A). In contrast, the aggregation plot of the H2A RhIP-ChIPseq showed the exclusion of H2A at the known H2A.Z sites (new Figure 4D). We described these findings on page 18, lines 377-382.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is important to assess how individual factors contribute to a particular remodeling pathway. Given that the steady-state H2A.Z occupancy is a net result of deposition and eviction and that multiple remodeling factors are involved in these processes, whether the observed H2A.Z peaks in RhIP-ChIP-seq represent the consequence of one or more of these factors should be evaluated. For example, are SRCAP and p400/TIP60 responsible for different H2A.Z sites across the genome? Is ATP required for H2A.Z deposition?</p></disp-quote><p>According to these suggestions, we first examined the permeabilized cells for the presence of SRCAP, TIP60 and ANP32E. The fractionation and following western blot analysis confirmed that SRCAP and TIP60 are still in the permeabilized cells, suggesting that the chromatin remodeling activity may be involved in the H2A.Z deposition in the RhIP assay. Since chromatin remodeling requires ATP, we then prepared the ATP-reduced cellular extract and tested it in the RhIP assay with or without ATP supplementation (new Figures 5E and F). As a result, ATP promoted the H2A.Z depositions in active TSS and enhancer regions, suggesting that the H2A.Z deposition in the RhIP assay requires a chromatin remodeling activity that hydrolyzes ATP. We described these new results on pages 1617, lines 329-341.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is ANP32E responsible for removing H2A.Z at enhancers and insulators? Does transcription contribute to H2A.Z eviction?</p></disp-quote><p>Our fractionation and western blot analysis showed that ANP32E is removed from permeabilized cells during the permeabilization process (new Figure 5A). As ANP32E is present in the cellular extract, which is used in the RhIP assay, we prepared the ANP32E-knockdown cellular extract and performed a RhIP-ChIP-seq analysis of H2A.Z (new Figures 5B-D). As a result, the efficiency of H2A.Z incorporations into active TSS and enhancer regions, where endogenous H2A.Z is predominantly localized, was decreased upon the ANP32E-knockdown (new Figure 5D and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A). This indicates that the ANP32Edependent evictions of the pre-incorporated H2A.Z in active TSS and enhancer regions promotes the incorporation of exogenously added H2A.Z in the RhIP assay. We described these data on page 16, lines 313-328.</p><p>We note that a previous paper reported that ANP32E-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells showed an increased number of H2A.Z peaks in insulator regions. In the RhIP assay using the ANP32Eknockdown cellular extract, the changes in the efficiency of the H2A.Z deposition in the insulator regions were less than those in the active TSS and enhancers (new Figure 5D). This discrepancy may arise from the fact that the H2A.Z distribution pattern of the knockout MEFs represents chromatin reorganization over a long time during embryogenesis, thus facilitating the adaptation to the ANP32E-knockout condition. This may include compensation for the ANP32E-mediated H2A.Z evictions. In contrast, our RhIP-seq analysis using the ANP32E-knockdown cellular extract instead represents the chromatin dynamics after the acute depletion of ANP32E. Consistent with our data, another previous paper showed that the introduction of recombinant ANP32E to zebrafish embryos resulted in the global loss of H2A.Z from the nucleus (P. J.

First, we checked for the existence of CAF-1 and HIRA in permeabilized cells. Our fractionation followed by western blotting analysis showed that these factors were retained in permeabilized cells (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A). We then prepared the CAF-1- or HIRA-knockdown permeabilized cells and performed the RhIP-immunostaining assay of H3.1 or H3.3 (new Figure 1âfigure supplements 2B-D). In this assay, we co-cultured the control and knockdown cells on the same coverslips for a precise evaluation. The knockdown cells were judged by immunostainings for CAF-1 (p60) and HIRA. As a result, we found that the intensities of both the incorporated H3.1 and H3.3 were significantly decreased in the CAF-1- and HIRA-knockdown cells, respectively. Therefore, H3.1 and H3.3 are deposited by the CAF-1- and HIRA-dependent pathways in the RhIP assay, respectively. We described these results on pages 9 and 10, lines 163-180.</p><p>Ray-Gallet, D., Woolfe, A., Vassias, I., Pellentz, C., Lacoste, N., Puri, A., et al. (2011).

Moreover, we found that the amount of nascent DNA in the H3.1 RhIP-ChIP sample was more than that in the H3.3 RhIP-ChIP sample.

While replication-dependent mechanisms are well captured by RhIP, it is less clear if transcription and chromatin remodeling is functional in this system and thus if transcription-dependent nucleosome exchange processes are faithfully recapitulated. It is important to improve the comparison of RhIP with 'in vivo' (i.e. existing ChIP-seq datasets) localisation and explicitly develop hypotheses why in some cases the data matches the 'in vivo' situation and in others not.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important comment. Based on the suggestions, we performed additional analyses as described below, which allowed us to hypothesize that the difference between the RhIP-ChIP-seq and ChIP-seq may reflect the recycling frequency of the evicted histone complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. Lines 279-301 and Figure 4. There is moderate correlation between genome-wide H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP-seq and H2A.Z ChIP-seq (Figure 4C). However, it seems H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP might be selectively detecting TSS specific signals rather than gene body specific associations (Figure 4A and 4E). It would be helpful to comment on the genetic elements (e.g. gene body) at which H2A.Z RhIP-ChIP and H2A.Z ChIP show low or no correlation and make a comparison. This way strengths and weaknesses of the assay can be better evaluated and compared to already existing protocols.</p></disp-quote><p>According to this suggestion, we have re-analyzed our data and created a new scatter plot between the RhIP-ChIP-seq and ChIP-seq data of H2A.Z at known H2A.Z sites in gene bodies, exclusively (new Figure 4C right). As this reviewer pointed out, we found that there is a fairly linear relationship between them in the gene bodies, indicating that the RhIP-ChIP-seq preferentially detects TSS-specific incorporation. This may have originated from the fact that H2A.Z can be exchanged more dynamically at TSS, as compared to gene bodies. Alternatively, as the histones that are evicted during transcription can be recycled (1, 2), the lower correlation between RhIP-ChIP and ChIP of H2A.Z in gene bodies may reflect the lower frequency of de novo H2A.Z deposition and the higher frequency of H2A.Z recycling during transcription. We described these analyses on page 15, lines 301-304 and discussed them on page 22, lines 453-457.</p><p>1.

The genomics analysis presented in Figure 3 is somewhat rudimentary, the signals from H2A and H2A.Z appear overall very correlated (Figure 3A, B), albeit the correlation genome-wide calculated in Figure 3-S2 is 'medium'. The scatter plot could be shown better to see potentially different 'population of loci, some that correlate well and 'outliers'.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. First, we would like to explain that the analysis presented in Figure 3A shows the entire genome-wide pattern. On the other hand, the scatter plots in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A were calculated at H2A.Z peaks detected in ChIP-seq. As this reviewer pointed out, H2A.Z and H2A are differently incorporated at H2A.Z peaks locally, as the correlation is moderate (Pearson correlation is 0.48). This is consistent with the results shown as the heatmap in Figure 4D, in which the H2A of RhIP-ChIP-seq showed no accumulation at the H2A.Z peaks of ChIP-seq. On the other hand, they are globally incorporated with certain similarity (Pearson correlation is 0.62, new Figure 3A right). We describe this on page 13, line 257 and page 16, lines 307-309.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Judging from Figure 3B, it appears that there is a good correlation across broad chromatin states with the notable excavation of active TSS.

We have recalculated our data and revised the aggregation plot to show the expressed and non-expressed genes separately (new Figure 4B).

It would be helpful to improve the interpretation of the data to include all existing caveats to the assay setup.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We addressed this comment, as described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. The new ATP addition experiments (figure 5E-F) are interpreted as if the only effect of ATP is on chromatin remodellers. It is well possible that by adding ATP in this conditions, additional factors (i.e. transcription, splicing/translation, molecular chaperones, etc) are being affected and responsible for the effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. We discussed the possible effects of ATP addition, on page 18 lines 353-355.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors alternate setups where they either co-incubate different histone dimers, or they use a single histone dimer isoform. It is really unclear to the readers what is the reason for this and how does this affect the results/interpretation. In cases where a mixture of histone dimers were present (i.e. Figures 1A-D, 2, 6), competition between the H2A/H2A.Z-X or H3.1/H3.3 dimers may take place, while in the others this competition is not present. This makes the comparison of the results quite challenging, and their conclusions unclear. This should be discussed at the very least, as it has implications on understanding the properties that control histone incorporation during RhIP.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewerâs concern. We understand that the proper combination of histone chaperones and histone variants ensures the correct localizations of histone variants. However, if one histone variant is increased, then the excess histone variant may bind to unsuitable histone chaperones, leading to ectopic localization. Indeed, the overexpressed histone H3 variant, CENP-A, in cells aberrantly binds to the H3.3 chaperone, DAXX, leading to ectopic localizations (1). In this study, we performed the RhIP assay with two different histone variants simultaneously, which do not share the same chaperone. Therefore, if the amounts of added histone complexes are appropriate, then they would only interact with their defined chaperones and be deposited in a specific manner. As a result, we observed different staining patterns in the same nucleus when H3.1 and H3.3 or H2A/H2A.X and H2A.Z were co-incubated (Figures 1A-D, 2, 6), which proved that they were incorporated into the chromatin by specific mechanisms, rather than non-specifically incorporated. These results also indicate that there is little to no competition under these conditions. Therefore, the results are unlikely to change if one or two histone variant(s) was/were used for the RhIP assay. However, as the reviewer mentioned, the competition assay using this system is worth trying, to analyze the overexpression situations of a specific histone variant. We added this discussion on page 20, lines 402-412.</p><p>1.

The RhIP-ChIP-seq protocol uses formaldehyde crosslinking instead of native mononucleosomal IP as used in Figure 1H, leaving room for interpretation if the pull-down histone is indeed incorporated into chromatin. Immunofluorescence also does not necessarily prove incorporation of histones into chromatin, since i.e. the fractionation in Figure 1-S2 shows that HIRA and CAF1 remain tightly bound to the isolated nuclei. Thus, accumulation of the epitope-tagged H3 in the nucleus of cells could merely mean that is bound to the histone chaperones present in the nucleus (competing away endogenous histones). It is not possible to discern from the data what the incorporated amount versus the chaperone-bound fraction of recombinant histone is.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. This point is critical and must be clarified experimentally. We therefore performed an additional RhIP-immunostaining assay. We treated the cells with PBST containing 300 mM NaCl after the RhIP reaction, to wash out the nuclear proteins that are associated with chromatin, and then fixed the cells. In fact, CAF-1 and HIRA were no longer detected by the immunostaining; however, the exogenously added H3.1 and H3.3 were still detected in the permeabilized cells. This result indicates that the exogenously added H3.1 and H3.3 were mostly incorporated into the chromatin of the permeabilized cells in the RhIP assay, as shown by the native ChIP experiment. We added these data in the new Figure 1âfigure supplement 3 and described them on page 10, lines 175-184.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The functional assessment of ANP32E knockdown lacks statistical analysis â clearly the quite robust knockdown (Figure 5B) does not majorly abrogate TSS incorporation of H2A.Z. Is the difference statistically significant?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We think the TSS incorporation of H2A.Z. significantly changed upon the ANP32E knockdown, with a p-value below 10<sup>-50</sup>. We would like to be cautious about mentioning this, because we included more than forty thousand loci for each in our analysis. With such a large number of samples, the p-value tends to be close to zero; therefore, it does not necessarily show practical significance (1).</p><p>1. Lin, M., Lucas, H. C., Jr., and Shmueli, G.

We suggest the presence of a redundant mechanism, which is consistent with the previous report that ANP32E knockout mice did not exhibit any apparent effects on their viability (1), even though proper H2A.Z incorporation is essential for cell survival and proliferation. We also found that ATP promotes the H2A.Z depositions in the RhIP assay. Since ATP is essential for many biological processes, such as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and transcription, the H2A.Z deposition in the RhIP assay may require ATP-dependent processes. Taken together, the H2A.Z deposition in the RhIP assay is the net result of the ANP32E-mediated eviction and deposition of H2A.Z, and the replacement of pre-incorporated H2A with H2A.Z by ATP-dependent processes. This is our explanation for the limited effects of the ANP32E knockdown on the H2A.Z incorporation. We discussed this on pages 21-22, lines 443-457.</p><p>1.
