mesentery. This regenerating anlage plays a pivotal role in the formation of a new intestine. Despite its significance, our understanding of the molecular characteristics inherent to the constituent cells of this structure has remained limited. To address this gap, we employed state-of-the-art scRNA-seq and hybridization chain reaction fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses to discern the distinct cellular populations associated with the regeneration anlage. Through this approach, we successfully identified 13 distinct cell clusters. Among these, two clusters exhibit characteristics consistent with putative mesenchymal cells, while another four show features akin to coelomocyte cell populations. The remaining seven cell clusters collectively form a large group encompassing the coelomic epithelium of the regenerating anlage and mesentery. Within this large group of clusters, we recognized previously documented cell populations such as muscle precursors, neuroepithelial cells, and actively proliferating cells. Strikingly, our analysis provides data for identifying at least four other cellular populations that we define as the precursor cells of the growing anlage. Consequently, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that the coelomic epithelium of the anlage is a pluripotent tissue that gives rise to diverse cell types of the regenerating intestinal organ. Moreover, our results provide the initial view into the transcriptomic analysis of cell populations responsible for the amazing regenerative capabilities of echinoderms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sea cucumber</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>blastema</kwd><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>holothurian</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R25GM061151-22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miranda-Negrón</surname><given-names>Yamil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 GM103475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina-Feliciano</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name><name><surname>Valentín-Tirado</surname><given-names>Griselle</given-names></name><name><surname>Luna-Martínez</surname><given-names>Kiara</given-names></name><name><surname>Beltran-Rivera</surname><given-names>Alejandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Miranda-Negrón</surname><given-names>Yamil</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia-Arraras</surname><given-names>José E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R15GM124595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina-Feliciano</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name><name><surname>Valentín-Tirado</surname><given-names>Griselle</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia-Arraras</surname><given-names>José E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The intestinal coelomic epithelium provides dedifferentiated precursor cell populations that drive the adult holothurian intestinal regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals exhibit a remarkable diversity in their responses to injury, ranging from basic wound healing to the complete regeneration of lost structures. At one end of the spectrum are species that heal wounds without regenerating the missing part, while at the other end are those capable of recreating structures identical to the original. Despite these differences, all animals possess some level of regenerative ability. This capacity for regeneration can vary not only between different species but also within the same species, depending on the tissue or organ involved.</p><p>For decades, scientists have tried to understand these vast differences in regeneration capacities across the animal kingdom. For this they have focused on those species that show amazing regenerative abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>), including coelenterates (hydra) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Vogg et al., 2019</xref>), flatworms (planaria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Reddien, 2018</xref>), fish (zebrafish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gemberling et al., 2013</xref>), and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brockes and Kumar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Roy and Gatien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Joven et al., 2019</xref>), among others. These studies have uncovered various mechanisms that regeneration-competent species exhibit to regenerate tissues, entire organs, body parts, and, in some cases, complete bodies. Key findings include the discovery of essential processes, such as the formation of a blastema – a mass of proliferating cells that plays a crucial role in regenerating the lost structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Min and Whited, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Poleo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Santos-Ruiz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Seifert and Muneoka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Stocum, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Zenjari et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Among deuterostomes, echinoderms are considered prime exponents of regenerative capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Candia-Carnevali et al., 2024</xref>). Within this group, holothurians, commonly known as sea cucumbers, exhibit an extraordinary form of regeneration. They can regenerate their internal organs following evisceration, a process in which they expel their viscera in response to stress or predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Byrne, 2023</xref>). This extraordinary ability makes them a valuable model for studying regeneration in complex organisms. The regeneration of the digestive system in holothurians, in particular, has garnered significant interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dolmatov, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mashanov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Medina-Feliciano and García-Arrarás, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Quispe-Parra et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Su et al., 2022</xref>). Upon evisceration, the holothurian intestine, which constitutes nearly their entire digestive tract, begins to regenerate from the mesentery, a supportive tissue layer where the original intestine was attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> provide a schematic view of the regeneration process and identify key structures for those not familiar with the holothurian model. A thickening at the injured end of the mesentery, known as an ‘anlage’ or ‘rudiment’, initiates this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>). As will be discussed later, this structure is analogous to a blastema but differs in that the cell proliferation mainly occurs in the surrounding epithelium, rather than in the mesenchymal cells, as observed in classical blastemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Carlson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intestinal regeneration in <italic>H. glaberrima</italic>.</title><p>(A) Schematic view of normal and regenerating tissues as viewed in cross sections of normal and regenerating intestines.

This dedifferentiation process is crucial for regeneration, involving a spatial and temporal gradient starting at the injury site and extending along the mesentery border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>). The new coelomic epithelial layer that forms around the anlage is distinct from the original mesothelium and shows significant morphological and molecular changes compared to the mesenteric tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Candelaria et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mashanov et al., 2005</xref>). Further examination of holothurian regeneration reveals that most cellular division occurs within the anlage’s coelomic epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>). These proliferating cells are hypothesized to differentiate into various cell types, including myocytes and neurons, as well as mesenchymal cells, through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>). The gene expression profiles during the formation and growth of the anlage suggest extensive reprogramming, leading to a more plastic cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ortiz-Pineda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Quispe-Parra et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Rojas-Cartagena et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The process of intestinal regeneration in holothurians raises fundamental questions of regenerative phenomena, particularly concerning the identity, origin, and fate of progenitor cells, involved in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarado and Tsonis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Candia-Carnevali et al., 2024</xref>). In this context, the role of the anlage, and specifically the mesothelium (also named celothelium) in echinoderms, deserved particular attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Candia-Carnevali et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Smiley, 1994</xref>). This tissue, mainly composed of coelomic epithelia and myocytes, exhibits significant morphological and gene expression changes that are associated with the dedifferentiation process. These dedifferentiated cells form the coelomic epithelium of the anlage and appear to be the principal source of cells for the new intestine. Despite these findings, little is known about the cell composition and dynamics of the anlage nor of its coelomic epithelium.</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers tremendous promise to dissect the cellular contributions of the holothurian intestinal anlage and identify the specific cells involved in generating a new intestine.

We corroborate our findings using hybridization chain reaction fluorescent in situ hybridization (HCR-FISH) to verify the presence and location of specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). The characterization of the cellular populations and their gene expressions serves to answer various questions such as: What are the cellular precursors? What is the role of the coelomic epithelium? What are the similarities and differences of the anlage and a classical blastema? This research not only advances our understanding of the unique regenerative capabilities of holothurians but also contributes to the broader field of regenerative biology, highlighting the diverse strategies employed by different organisms to restore lost tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Previous work from our laboratory has shown that the rudiment or anlage that forms at the tip of the mesentery plays a pivotal role in the formation of the new intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">García-Arrarás et al., 2019</xref>). This transient mass of cells is thought to give rise to most intestinal cell types, the sole exception being the luminal cells. Therefore, to maximize the characterization of the cells in the regenerative anlage, we chose to perform scRNA-seq in the tissues of 9-day post evisceration (dpe) regenerating animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>). At this stage, a well-formed anlage consists of epithelial cells surrounding a large area of connective tissue populated with mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). More importantly, different cell populations undergoing proliferation or differentiation can be found at this stage. Since some of the cellular processes during regeneration occur in a spatio-temporal gradient along the length of the mesentery, we separately surveyed the anlage and the mesentery tissues accordingly. Thus, for each animal, the anlage was separated from the mesentery, and both tissues were processed independently, for a total of four scRNA-seq runs.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell heterogeneity: Immuno- and cytochemical analyses</title><p>The strength of the scRNA-seq data depends mainly on the dissociation and isolation of the cell populations from the dissected tissue. Since our focus was on the cells of the regenerating anlage, we devised a dissociation protocol that favored the isolation of the cells within this structure. To determine, at least partially, the cell types in our original dissociation, we performed immuno- and cytochemical analyses on the enzyme-dissociated cell suspension that was used for the scRNA-seq. The labeling obtained for each marker is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We found that, in the dissociated anlage, 5% of the cells were labeled with a spherulocyte (immune cell) marker, 2–7% with phalloidin (a muscle marker), 40% with a mesenchymal marker (KL14-antibody), and a large number of cells (32–60%) with a mesothelial marker (MESO-antibody). Similar populations were found in the mesentery, although in this tissue, 5–10% of cells expressed the neuronal markers, heptapeptide GFSKLYFamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanco et al., 1995</xref>), and RN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Díaz-Balzac et al., 2007</xref>). This analysis suggested that most of the cells originate from the regenerate coelomic epithelium.</p><p>Different populations were also observed with three different tubulin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the 9-dpe anlage, anti-acetylated alpha tubulin labeled about 7% of the cells, anti-beta tubulin labeled about 70% of the cells, while an anti-alpha tubulin labeled about 80% of the cells. Except for the acetylated alpha tubulin, which labeled about 1% of the cells dissociated from the mesentery versus 7% of those from the anlage, anti-alpha and beta labeling percentages were similar in both mesentery and anlage dissociated cells.</p><p>Finally, a cell population labeled with fluorescently labeled phalloidin accounted for about 7% of the cells in both mesentery and anlage. These cells, however, did not correspond to the elongated muscle cells of the mesentery. Instead, they were rounded cells with labeling found in the cytoplasm surrounding one side of the nuclei.</p><p>Two cell populations from the mesentery were absent or greatly underrepresented in the scRNA-seq. Firstly, the muscle cells of the mesentery, due to their non-dissociation by the protocol used, were not found in the dissociated cell suspension. Their elongated morphology would have further complicated their passage via cell separation system for sequencing. Secondly, the majority of neurons from the neuronal network associated with the mesentery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nieves-Ríos et al., 2020</xref>) could not be dissociated. We did observe structures that resembled a tangled mass of cells immunoreactive to some of our neuronal markers. This suggests that the mesentery nervous component, being unable to be isolated as single cells, was not sequenced.</p><p>In summary, the immuno- and cytochemical results show that the dissociated cell populations sequenced correspond to cellular phenotypes that have been previously described within the regenerating anlage. The abundance of these cells in the sequenced samples corresponds to the ease of their dissociation by trypsin. Thus, dedifferentiated cells of the mesentery and anlage epithelium (which are loosely connected to each other) and those of the connective tissue are probably over-represented compared to differentiated cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell populations defined by scRNA-seq</title><p>Analysis of scRNA-seq data resulted in a total of 3844 cells, with 2392 originating from the two anlage samples and 1452 from the two mesentery samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon dataset integration and graph-based clustering, we identified 13 clusters, each thought to represent singular cell types or cell states in the regenerating intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, each cluster has a unique transcriptomic are clusters C0, C1, C3, and C4 of the epithelial layer populations, which share many top genes, albeit at different expression levels.

This is also true for the mesenchymal clusters, where these two clusters have overlap of some genes, that are not expressed by other clusters. Therefore, these results show the interaction of these clusters and their transcriptomic relationship depending on where they are localized within the regenerating intestinal tissue.</p><p>Identifying the top genes expressed by each cluster also provides essential, notwithstanding limited, information for their complete identification.

Coelomocytes can be subdivided into different populations by using morphological, physiological, and molecular characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ramírez-Gómez et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Many of the coelomocyte characteristics correlate with the top differentially expressed genes of cell populations within our data. These immune-like clusters (C6, C10, C11, and C12) have high expression of genes related to the immune system that are not shared with any other cluster. For example, C6 embodies a distinct cell population that represents a substantial number of cells (6% of all cells, 8% of the mesentery, and 4% of the cells in the anlage). These cells are the only population expressing <italic>FBCD1</italic> (fibrinogen C domain-containing protein 1). Cells in C6 also express other genes such as various tyrosine protein phosphate receptors, integrin alpha-8 (<italic>ITA8</italic>), platelet glycoprotein V (<italic>GPV</italic>), leucine-rich repeats, and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 2 (<italic>LRIG2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The immune identity of C6 is also supported by the resulting gene set enrichment of gene ontology (gseGO) terms related to immune responses, such as <italic>ubiquitin-dependent ERAD pathway</italic>, <italic>innate immune response activating cell surface receptor signaling pathway</italic>, <italic>respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress</italic>, <italic>phagocytosis,</italic> and many more related to defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, C10 and C12 transcriptomic profiles suggest they correspond to immune-like populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, C10 shows various uncharacterized genes along with <italic>HCK</italic> (tyrosine-protein kinase HCK), <italic>DMBT1</italic> (deleted in malignant brain tumors 1), <italic>ALS</italic> (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein complex acid labile subunit), <italic>GPV</italic>, and <italic>IRF8</italic> (interferon regulatory factor 8), <italic>FER</italic> (tyrosine-protein kinase Fer). The top GO-enriched terms of this cluster support its involvement in immune process, some of these being <italic>lipase activity regulation</italic>, <italic>Fc receptor-mediated stimulatory signaling pathway</italic>, <italic>cellular pigmentation</italic>, <italic>B cell activation involved in immune response</italic>, and <italic>Fc receptor signaling pathway</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The transcripts expressed by C12 show a more complex profile, where most of the top genes are uncharacterized.

Second, while arrows from C8 are not terminal, they are directed toward C1. This suggests that cells in C1 provide cells for the growth of the anlage via proliferation. Thus, these results support C5, C9, and C4 as terminal cell clusters that we have described as muscle, neuroepithelial, and the nascent coelomic epithelium cells, respectively. Third, velocity embedding shows shorter arrows that point from clusters 0 and 1 toward terminal populations previously described. Therefore, cells of C0 and C1 are not undergoing significant transcriptional changes. The RNA velocity results of the rest of the clusters are less interesting as they do not show directions toward any other clusters, mainly because of their individuality within the UMAP. However, it is interesting that arrows of the mesenchymal cell populations show distinct directions and lengths. Based on the results, it seems that portions of both mesenchymal clusters (C2 and C7) have gone or are undergoing more extensive differentiation changes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Trajectory analysis of cell populations from the regenerating intestinal tissue.</title><p>(A) UMAP plot of all identified clusters.

The velocity assessment of these newly clustered populations resulted in a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). Here, we can see that the differentiating cells (C4, C5, and C9) have long arrows, suggesting that these cells are going through an advanced stage of transcriptional change compared to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>). It is clear from these results that C1 future states are cells of C3 and, to some extent, C4. Moreover, it seems that C0 has a closer relationship to cells of C5 and C9 and that some cells of these clusters could potentially differentiate into cells of C4 (the coelomic epithelium cells). In this case, to complement and confirm our RNA velocity interpretation, we also performed a pseudotime analysis using Slingshot, which relies on the expression data of each cluster. This analysis showed C1 in an earlier pseudotime than C3, C4, and C0 in the resulting two lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). The resulting lineages differed by the terminal clusters, one containing C5 (muscle) and the other C9 (neuroepithelial). Thus, it supports what we have already visualized on the RNA velocity embeddings.</p><p>The results described so far show that C0, C1, and C4 are cells in distinct differentiation states, but we wanted to have a clearer view of the cell clusters that potentially have an essential role in the regeneration process. For this, we made another subset of cells that corresponded to C0, C1, C3, and C4, but uniquely from cells of the anlage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). The rationale was that cells from the mesentery are certainly at a different state from those of the anlage and thus could interfere with the pseudotime of cells from the anlage. The RNA velocity analysis using this subset strengthened our previous inferences. First, C1 seems to be the least dedifferentiated cell cluster, whose future state will be cells of C3 and part of the population of C4. Second, that C0 seems to be in a specialized state of differentiation that has a relationship to C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). This would explain the relationship of this cluster to that of the differentiating cells of C5 and C9. Interestingly, portions of C1, C0, and C4 appear to be in an advance process of differentiation based on their longer arrows compared to C3 and another portion of C4 close to C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). The Slingshot analysis of the anlage cells from C0, C1, C3, and C4 revealed that the pseudotime starts at a point of convergence that contains a portion of cells from C1 and C0. Yet, it further supports the cells from C1 as the least differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11H</xref>). C1 is then followed by cells of C3, C4, and, lastly, C0, which for the most part seems to be at a more advanced differentiation state with a closer relationship to differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we employed scRNA seq and HCR-FISH techniques to examine the cellular phenotypes in regenerating intestinal tissues of the sea cucumber <italic>H. glaberrima</italic>. These techniques have been seldom used to characterize echinoderm cells, and the few studies available are mainly limited to embryonic stages of sea urchins (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Lytechinus variegatus</italic>) and the sea stars (<italic>Patiria miniata</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cocurullo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Foster et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Meyer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Paganos et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Paganos et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Paganos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tominaga et al., 2023</xref>). Nonetheless, these studies provide an excellent description of the cell population and dynamics arising from major germ lines during echinoderm development. We now apply the same techniques to explore cell phenotypes involved in intestinal regeneration in holothurians. This is, to our knowledge, the first time scRNA-seq and HCR-FISH have been used in adult echinoderms to analyze the cellular and molecular basis of their amazing regenerative properties. This research integrates the extensive cellular and molecular information on intestinal regeneration in holothurians collected over the past two decades, offering a comprehensive view of the cellular phenotypes and molecular changes involved.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell types and differentiation stages in the 9-dpe regenerating intestine</title><p>Our study has focused on the description of cells present in the 9-dpe regenerating intestine of the sea cucumber, where cells are known to have gone through dedifferentiation and are, at this timepoint, in the process of differentiating into specialized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>). Based on our analysis, we have identified 13 distinct populations that form part of the regenerating intestinal mesentery and anlage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). One intriguing finding was the lack of significant differences in the cell clusters between the anlage and the mesentery. However, this can be explained by two different facts. First, we have previously shown that many of the cellular processes that take place in the anlage, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, dedifferentiation, and ECM remodeling, occur in a gradient that begins at the tip of the mesentery where the anlage forms and extends significantly into the mesentery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">García-Arrarás et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">García-Arrarás et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mashanov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Reyes-Rivera et al., 2024</xref>). Similarly, migrating cells move along the connective tissue of the mesentery to the anlage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cabrera-Serrano and García-Arrarás, 2004</xref>). Thus, there is no clear partition of the two regions that would account for distinct cell populations associated with the regenerative stage. Second, the two cell populations that would have been found in the mesentery but not in the regenerating anlage, mature muscle and neurons, were not dissociated by our experimental protocol as to allow for their sequencing. Current experiments are being done using single-nuclei RNA sequencing to overcome this hurdle.</p><p>Among the 13 clusters we have described, the major divisions are clusters corresponding to the coelomocyte, coelomic epithelium, and mesenchyme cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we can now use the information that our laboratory and others have gathered to pinpoint the cellular mediators and their activity during regeneration. The coelomic epithelia, for example, is highly influential in the regeneration process as it is the site where major cellular events occur, particularly cell division, dedifferentiation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the mesenchyme ECM is known to undergo remodeling during the regeneration process, which is also critical for the proper growth of the new tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Quiñones et al., 2002</xref>). However, while much of the events have been described using microscopic and histological tools, we need a more comprehensive understanding of the transcriptomic characteristics of specific cell populations involved in the regeneration process.</p><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>The sea cucumber contains various mesenchymal and coelomocyte populations</title><p>Among the phenotypes identified are clusters of mesenchymal (C2 and C7) and coelomocyte cell populations (C6, C10, C11, and C12). The mesenchymal populations demonstrated a unique expression of <italic>ERG</italic> and <italic>ETS-1</italic>. ERG, in particular, has been related to embryonic development, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dhordain et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Iwamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Vlaeminck-Guillem et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). More importantly, the expression of <italic>ERG</italic> has been associated with mesenchymal identity in other echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Meyer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tominaga et al., 2023</xref>). In these studies, <italic>ERG</italic> has been reported as the marker gene of mesenchymal cells of sea urchin and sea star larva by scRNA-seq analyses, and the localization of <italic>ERG</italic> on embryonic precursor mesenchymal cells of the sea urchin was further confirmed by in situ analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Meyer et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, this latter group also reported these mesenchymal cells to express a GATA transcription factor (<italic>GATA3</italic>) and <italic>ETS1</italic>, which in our dataset are also being expressed only by populations within this supra-cluster (<italic>GATA2</italic> and <italic>ETS1;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The expression of <italic>PRG4</italic> (proteoglycan-4) reinforces the mesenchymal identity of this supra-cluster in the regenerating intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which correlates with previous studies that have identified a proteoglycan-like molecule in the mesenchyme of 7-dpe regenerating intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Vázquez-Vélez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><italic>ETS-1</italic> has long been associated with developmental processes of mesenchymal formation in sea urchin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Koga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Rizzo et al., 2006</xref>). In other studies, <italic>ERG</italic>, a member of the ETS gene families, has been found to be necessary for controlling mesenchymal identity and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mochmann et al., 2014</xref>). Further analyses of their individual marker genes suggest that these cells might be involved in EMT. For instance, C2 expresses <italic>TIMP3</italic>, a metalloproteinase inhibitor that aids in the ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dewing et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>NPNT</italic>, a gene reported to be related to development and cancer processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Magnussen et al., 2021</xref>). These genes are also crucial for cells undergoing EMT as the cells need to detach from the other cells and the basal lamina that forms the epithelium. Comparatively, the expression profile of C7 with genes such as <italic>PA21B</italic> (phospholipase A2), <italic>TMPS9</italic> (transmembrane protease serine 9), <italic>SEPP1</italic>, <italic>DMBT1</italic>, <italic>ITIH3</italic>, and <italic>SVPE1,</italic> and its GO results suggest this mesenchymal population is undergoing different processes. Based on these contrasting expression profiles, we propose that C2 corresponds to cells that have recently undergone EMT from the coelomic epithelium and eventually differentiate into a more specialized phenotype (C7). Our pseudotime results further support this developmental transition as cells in C7 appears to be in a more advanced stage compared to those of C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, these two populations correspond to the first transcriptomic description of mesenchymal phenotypes reported in sea cucumber regenerating intestine.</p><p>Our dataset contains four distinct populations that we have characterized as coelomocytes. The coelomocyte populations reported in different holothuroid species ranged between 4 and 6 distinct types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hetzel, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ramírez-Gómez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). Studies from our laboratory previously revealed four different coelomocyte populations in <italic>H. glaberrima,</italic> distinguished by their morphology, histochemistry, and phagocytic activity. These were lymphocytes, phagocytes, spherulocytes, and a population named ‘giant cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ramírez-Gómez et al., 2010</xref>). The distinctive gene expression profile of each of the coelomocytes that we have identified can provide insights into the differences in their role as immune/circulating cells within the sea cucumber. For example, the C6 marker gene fibrinogen-like protein, which is part of a protein family known as FREP, makes this population of great interest. Mainly because these molecules have been vastly studied across invertebrates, and multiple immune roles have been proposed, including phagocyte recognition and encapsulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hanington and Zhang, 2011</xref>). A distinct example is that of C10, where the expression of <italic>HCK</italic>, <italic>FER,</italic> and <italic>ITF8</italic> markers suggests this might be a macrophage-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dolgachev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Shuttleworth, 2018</xref>). Specifically, <italic>HCK</italic>, a member of Src family kinases (SFK), has been closely related to macrophage activation and polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhattacharjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Poh et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, recent studies in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> found that an Src homolog mediates the phagocytosis of <italic>Vibrio splendidus,</italic> which further supports C10 immune identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wan et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, to our knowledge, this would be the first report of the expression profile of distinct coelomocyte populations in an adult echinoderm species, setting up the stage for integrating these populations with the previously described ones.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-2"><title>The coelomic epithelia of the intestinal anlage is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells</title><p>Our research findings align with previous microscopic descriptions of cells in the normal and regenerating mesothelium and coelomic epithelia. In our data, we can easily identify the cell population that forms the cluster exhibiting a proliferative phenotype (C8). Proliferative cells in the regenerating intestine are primarily localized within the coelomic epithelium of the anlage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Reyes-Rivera et al., 2024</xref>), and the gene expression profile documented here unequivocally identifies these as proliferative. These cell proliferation genes are specific to C8, with minimum representation in other populations. Interestingly, as mentioned before C8 expresses at lower levels many of the genes of other coelomic epithelium populations. Nevertheless, even if we mask the top 38 proliferation genes (not shown), this cluster is maintained as an independent cluster, suggesting that its identity is conferred by a complex transcriptomic profile rather than only a few proliferation-related genes. Therefore, the identity and potential role of C8 could be further described by two distinct alternatives: (1) cells of C8 could be an intermediate state between the anlage precursor cells (discussed below) and the specialized cell populations or (2) cells of C8 are the source of the anlage precursor populations from which all other populations arise. The pseudotime data is certainly complex and challenging to interpret with our current dataset, yet the RNA velocity analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref> would suggests that cells of C8 transition into the anlage precursor populations, rather than being an intermediate state. This is also supported by the Slingshot pseudotime analysis that incorporates C8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, additional experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>A second population of cells that can be well correlated to previously described cells is that with a muscle cell phenotype (C5). The evidence suggests that this cell population represents those cells from the coelomic epithelium that are differentiating into myocytes. This evidence includes (1) the top-expressed genes by the cells in this cluster are all muscle-associated genes; (2) the top-enriched terms are all related to muscle morphogenesis; (3) the cluster is mostly composed of cells that come from the anlage where muscle formation is known to be taking place at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Murray and García-Arrarás, 2004</xref>); (4) differentiated muscle cells were not dissociated by the enzymatic procedure strongly suggesting that the muscle cells that we have identified in our data are those that are in a differentiation process, rather than fully differentiated cells closer to the body wall; and (5) the cells in this cluster were identified by HCR-FISH of <italic>MYH7</italic>. These cells are localized toward the basal region of the coelomic epithelium, the region where the differentiating myocytes are known to be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Murray and García-Arrarás, 2004</xref>). Moreover, among the top expressed genes of this cluster is Troponin I (<italic>TNNI1</italic>), which has also been reported to be highly expressed in muscle precursor cells of the sea star embryo and immature cardiomyocytes of the chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mantri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tominaga et al., 2023</xref>). The high differentiation activity of these cells is also supported by our pseudotime analysis, where distinct cells within the cluster are in individual differentiation states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D and E</xref>). Further analysis of these populations could allow us to understand the transcriptional changes these cells undergo to become fully specialized muscle cells.</p><p>An additional population in our dataset is the neuroepithelial population (C9). This population has <italic>STARD10</italic>, among its top expressed genes, known to be a phospholipid transfer protein present in a neural cell population. This population has been localized in the coelomic epithelium of the intestine, among other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">García-Arrarás et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Rosado-Olivieri et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, cells of this cluster have high expression of other genes reported to be expressed by neuronal cells of regenerative and developmental tissues, such as beta-tubulin in developing human gut and sea urchin larva, and synapsin in planaria regenerating tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cocurullo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elmentaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">King et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, an earlier study showing that beta-tubulin-positive cells arise from dedifferentiated cells of the regenerating intestinal tissue of the sea cucumber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">García-Arrarás et al., 2019</xref>) also suggests that similar to the muscle population, these cells are neuroepithelial cells that are differentiating rather than fully specialized. Further support for this theory lies in the main contribution to C9 coming from anlage cells and their terminal differentiation state observed in the pseudotime analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>).</p><p>The remaining four clusters of the coelomic epithelium supra-cluster are more challenging to characterize. Nonetheless, we will explore some hypotheses regarding their cellular phenotypes. The identity of C4 was put forward based on its close transcriptional and pseudotime correlation with populations of the coelomic epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). Additionally, in our in situ hybridization, its marker gene UNC5C as well as another gene <italic>SC6A5</italic> (not shown here) are mainly expressed by the coelomic epithelial cells of the normal intestine, strongly suggesting that the cells expressing this gene in the anlage are those that will become the coelomic epithelial cells of the regenerated organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>C0 remains an intriguing cell population. On one hand, it appears to be closely related, by its gene expression, to other coelomic epithelial populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, it may represent an unknown cell population or cell stage. The in situ expression suggests that this cluster represents the cellular population of the mesentery or peritoneal coelomic epithelium. In this case, we might be evidencing differences in the coelomic epithelium of the mesentery (exemplified by C0) from those of the coelomic epithelium of the intestine (exemplified by C4). Future experiments will be needed to address this controversy.</p><p>Lastly, C1 and C3 share many common genes and represent distinct populations but are still closely associated, regardless of the clustering parameters or the statistical assessment performed. Although we considered combining them into a single cluster, we ultimately decided against it as they likely represent different stages of cell development or plasticity in the regenerating intestine. One-to-one comparisons revealed that C1 expressed various ribosomal gene markers, while C3 expressed specific genes such as <italic>EPHA4</italic> (ephrin type-A receptor 4) and <italic>LRIG3,</italic> indicating distinct transcriptomic states. Additionally, all trajectory analyses revealed that C1 cells appear to give rise to C3 cells.</p><p>Further characterization of C1 and C3, within the anlage coelomic epithelium, suggests that these cells probably serve as cellular precursors to differentiating cells. The evidence from pseudotime analyses and gene expression of C1 and C3 strongly supports this conclusion. These cells appear to exhibit pluripotency with the potential to form muscle, neurons, coelomic epithelia, and mesenchymal cells in the regenerating intestine. Their gene expression profiles include markers from gene families associated with embryonic development such as Hox, zinc fingers, basic helix-loop-helix, and others, some of which are linked to stemness and pluripotency. For example, <italic>HSP90A</italic>, a molecular chaperone essential for stem cell pluripotency, and markers like <italic>HES1</italic> and TGFb, essential for maintaining stem cell proliferation, are present in these cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aztekin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Mishra et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the expression of <italic>PIWL1</italic> (piwi-like protein 1) and <italic>YAP1</italic> further supports the classification of these clusters as precursor cells of the intestinal anlage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In hydra, piwi-like molecules are exclusively localized in stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Juliano et al., 2014</xref>), and in mice, <italic>YAP1</italic> is expressed only in multipotent cells during intestinal epithelium regeneration, vital for their emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayyaz et al., 2019</xref>). Ultimately, trajectory analysis also supports C1 as a precursor cell population, as the dividing cells (C8) appear to give rise to C1, which then progresses toward C3. This analysis aligns with evidence of a proliferation center in the coelomic epithelia that provides precursor cells essential for the growth of the anlage.</p><p>In summary, C1 and C3 cells are probably dedifferentiated cells from the mesentery mesothelium, retaining markers common to all epithelial cells. Similar to what is known in other highly regenerative organisms, these dedifferentiated cells can proliferate and then redifferentiate into the cells of the new organ. Future experiments will determine whether they retain the memory of their previous phenotype (muscle or coelomic epithelium) or are completely pluripotent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The coelomic epithelium of the intestinal anlage is pluripotent</title><p>Our study reveals that the coelomic epithelium, as a tissue layer, is pluripotent. It fulfills the definition of pluripotency; a group of cells that has the ability to differentiate into many, but not all, cell types. Microscopy studies across different echinoderm species have consistently suggested that the coelomic epithelium can differentiate into various cell types. Among these are the formation of muscle cells and neurons in sea cucumbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dolmatov et al., 1996</xref>), mesenchymal cells in brittle star (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Piovani et al., 2021</xref>), and even immune cells (coelomocytes) in sea star (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Byrne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Sharlaimova et al., 2021</xref>). In some species, the coelomic epithelium has even been proposed to transdifferentiate into intestinal luminal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mashanov et al., 2005</xref>). In our analysis, we can identify the cells in the coelomic epithelium that are differentiating toward muscle (C5), neurons (C9), coelomic epithelium (C4), and mesenchymal cells (C2 and C7) corroborating what has been previously described in <italic>H. glaberrima</italic> studies. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether individual cells are pluripotent, thus a more definitive conclusion will be reached once lineage-tracing experiments can be done.</p><p>The coelomic epithelium of the regeneration anlage could also be the source of other cell types. This is exemplified in the brittle star <italic>Marthasterias glacialis,</italic> where it has been suggested that the coelomic epithelium is not only involved in arm regeneration but also serves as a source of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Guatelli et al., 2022</xref>). This report indicated that ‘residential stem cells’ in the regenerating arm of the brittle star originate from the coelomic epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Candia-Carnevali et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, in the sea cucumber <italic>Holothuria forskali</italic>, the injured mesothelial layer has been identified as the source of undifferentiated cells that differentiate into the cells of the growing organ and into phagocytic cells, now recognized as coelomocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">VandenSpiegel et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Of particular interest, our study reveals that the mesentery coelomic epithelia population (C0) exhibits localized expression of <italic>SAA1</italic>, an immune response-related gene. This finding, in line with previous reports of SAA1 localization in the coelomic epithelium of the regenerating intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Santiago et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), raises the intriguing possibility that the coelomic epithelium of the sea cucumber regenerating intestine could also be the source of coelomocytes, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Guatelli et al., 2022</xref>. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that in the sea star <italic>Asteria rubens,</italic> coelomocytes arise from its coelomic epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Vanden Bossche and Jangoux, 1976</xref>). However, our current results, while suggestive, do not yet provide conclusive evidence to support this in the sea cucumber, at least not in the coelomic epithelia of the 9-dpe regenerating intestine.</p><p>Currently, there is no definitive evidence identifying the precursor cells that give rise to these cell populations in echinoderms. However, given our gene expression data and the interactions observed among the cell populations, we postulate that cells from C1 stand as the precursor cell population from which most of the cells in the anlage coelomic epithelium arise. This is based on their preferential localization within the anlage coelomic epithelium, their lack of any clear differentiated cell marker, and their association with the cell dividing cluster. Granted, much more experimental evidence will be needed to arrive at this conclusion. Nonetheless, it provides a focus on the most likely, and probably most intriguing, cell population. It also provides the path to explore multiple questions that arise from our results. Can C1 be subdivided into other cell populations? Are the cells in this cluster pluripotent? Do these cells originate from the same cells via dedifferentiation? These and many other questions will indeed be tested in future experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The intestinal anlage as a regeneration blastema</title><p>The intestinal anlage is a particular regenerative structure that has long been described as a blastema-like structure due to its remarkable morphological resemblance to the ‘classical blastema’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">García-Arrarás, 1998</xref>). As stated previously, a blastema is usually described as a transient structure composed of a mass of proliferating undifferentiated cells. This structure is found at the site of injury and will give rise to the regenerated organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Seifert and Muneoka, 2018</xref>). The blastema cells can originate from different lineages across species. For example, in some amphibians the blastemal cells originate from dedifferentiated muscle, cartilage, fibroblast, and other tissues, while in others they include cells that originate from muscle satellite cells, a type of stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Globus et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sandoval-Guzmán et al., 2014</xref>). In Planaria, they originate from undifferentiated stem cells known as neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baguñà, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). The blastema is overlayed by a wound epidermis that is formed by a re-epithelization process following injury, which develops into a specialized wound epidermis that in amphibians is known as the apical epithelial cap (AEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aztekin, 2021</xref>). Since its first description, more than 100 years ago, the blastema has been regarded as the best indicator of regeneration, and its presence is associated with tissues or organs that are highly regenerative. In fact, it has been proposed that the presence or absence of a blastema defines the regenerative success or failure of the regeneration process. However, as more regenerative species continue to be studied, the classical definition of a blastema has been reconsidered, moving toward its functional role rather than its histological or structural characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Seifert and Muneoka, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The blastema of salamanders and newts have long served as models to describe a blastema cellular and molecular properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Globus et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Scimone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Tajer et al., 2023</xref>). The sea cucumber intestinal anlage stands as a different structure in terms of the tissue compartmentalization of certain activities. Yet, when examined closely, much of the processes and signaling molecules described in the amphibian blastema also take place in the holothurian anlage, although their spatial occurrence might differ. For instance, we and others have previously described the dedifferentiation process by which muscle cells dedifferentiate and proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García-Arrarás et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dolmatov, 2021</xref>). Thus, similar to some amphibian blastema cells, the cells of the holothurian anlage coelomic epithelium are proliferative undifferentiated cells that originated via a dedifferentiation process. Moreover, some of the genes expressed by the amphibian blastema cells or the overlying AEC, such as Wnt, Tgf-beta, and Fgf, are also known to be expressed during sea cucumber regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). In amphibians, some of these factors are thought to be released by cells of the AEC, serving as a way of modulating the blastema cell activity. For example, FGF1 is expressed in the cells of the AEC while FGF receptors were localized to blastema cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Zenjari et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, both FGF and Wnt signaling have been shown to be vital for the formation of the blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Makanae et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This expression of Fgf and Wnt and their possible functions correlate with what has been found in sea cucumbers. Not only are the same growth factors expressed in C1 and C3, but a recent study highlighted the role of <italic>FGF4</italic> as a modulator of cell proliferation during the intestinal regeneration of the sea cucumber <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). This group demonstrated that inhibiting <italic>FGF4</italic> and its receptor, <italic>FGFR2,</italic> negatively affected cell proliferation of the mesothelial layer during intestinal regeneration. Similar results have been shown for Wnt, primarily a study by our laboratory demonstrating that Wnt pathway inhibition, either by pharmacological drugs or by RNAi, caused a reduction in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alicea-Delgado and García-Arrarás, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bello et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, in the sea cucumber coelomic epithelium of the anlage, cells are also involved in intercellular communications that modulate cellular dynamics through factors similar to those found in the AEC-blastema cell modulation.</p><p>The holothurian anlage and the amphibian blastema exhibit some differences. In the latter, there is a clear separation of the AEC and the underlying blastema cells. In amphibians, the AEC has been shown to actively participate in the formation and maintenance of the blastemal cells, particularly in their proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, in holothurians, cells with both blastema and AEC characteristics can be found within the coelomic epithelium. In fact, both <italic>PRRX1</italic> (paired mesoderm homeobox protein), a gene expressed by amphibian blastema cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lin et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>HES1</italic> (transcription factor HES-1), a marker gene of the amphibian AEC, are expressed by the holothurian coelomic epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aztekin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Our data has allowed us to construct a model of the cell populations we identified in the 9-dpe intestinal anlage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This model presents the coelomic epithelium of the anlage as a heterogeneous layer of cells comprising of six cell populations corresponding to distinct differentiation states. Among these are cell populations that seem to be in the process of differentiation toward muscle (C5), neuroepithelium (C9), and intestine coelomic epithelial cells (C4). We also propose the presence of undifferentiated (C0, C1, C3) and proliferating cell populations (C8) in the coelomic epithelia, which give rise to the cells in this layer. Underneath the coelomic epithelia are the mesenchymal cells (C2, C7), some of which may have originated from the coelomic epithelial layer via EMT. Moreover, the sea cucumber intestinal anlage behaves as a blastema since it uses similar mechanisms to fulfill the same role in the regeneration of the new organ. In this case, the cells of the coelomic epithelium would be those considered akin to the blastemal cells. Our results, thus, provide an alternative view of cell precursors and regenerating structures with similarities and differences to those of better-studied regenerating animal models.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Model of cellular organization of the intestinal anlage.</title><p>Various cell populations can be identified in the connective tissue (CT) and coelomic epithelium (CE) in the anlage of the sea cucumber <italic>H. glaberrima</italic> at 9 dpe.

Medina-Feliciano et al. investigated the single-cell transcriptomic profile of holoturian regenerating intestine following evisceration, a process used to expel their viscera in response to predation. Using single-cell RNA-Sequencing and standard analysis such as &quot;Find cluster markers&quot;, &quot;Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology&quot; and &quot;RNA velocity&quot;, they identify 13 cell clusters and their potential cell identity. Based on bioinformatic analysis they identified potentially proliferating clusters and potential trajectories of cell differentiation. This manuscript represents a useful dataset that can provide candidate cell types and cell markers for more in-depth functional analysis of the holoturian intestine regeneration.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are supported only by bioinformatic analyses since the in vivo validation through HCR is not sufficient to support them.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The Authors are providing a single-cell dataset obtained from sea cucumbers regenerating their intestines. This represents the first fundamental step to an unbiased approach to better understand this regeneration process and the cellular dynamics taking part in it.</p><p>- The Authors run all the standard analyses providing the reader with a well digested set of information about cell clusters, potential cell types, potential functions and potential cell differentiation trajectories.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The Authors frequently report the percentage of cells with a specific feature (either labelled or expressing a certain gene or belonging to a certain cluster). This number can be misleading since that is calculated after cell dissociation and additional procedures (such as staining or sequencing and dataset cleanup) that can heavily bias the ratio between cell types. Similarly, the Authors cannot compare cell percentage between anlage and mesentery samples since that can be affected by technical aspects related to cell dissociation, tissue composition and sequencing depth.</p><p>- The Authors did not validate all the clusters.</p><p>- There is no validation of the trajectory analysis and there is no validation of the proliferating cluster with H3P or EdU co-labeling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100796.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This research offers a comprehensive analysis of the regenerative process in sea cucumbers and builds upon decades of previous research.

They present a single-cell RNAseq atlas for the reconstitution of Holothuria glaberrima gut following self-evisceration in response to a potassium chloride injection. The authors provide data characterizing cellular populations and precursors of the regenerating anlage at 9 days post evisceration.

There is ambiguity about the meaning of this term in the field, but most researchers seem to currently have in mind that the &quot;blastema&quot; definitions includes a discrete spatial organization of cells, and here these cells are much more spread out. This could be a good opportunity for the authors to engage in this dialogue, perhaps parsing out the nuances of what a &quot;blastema&quot; is, what the term has traditionally referred to, and how we might consider updating this term or at least re-framing the terminology to be inclusive of functions that &quot;blastemas&quot; have traditionally had in the literature and how they may be dispersed over geographical space in an organism more so than the more rigid, geographically-restricted definition many researchers have in mind. However, if the authors choose to elaborate on these issues, those elaborations do belong in the discussion, and the more provisional terminology we mention here could be used throughout the paper until that element of the revised discussion is presented. We would welcome the authors to do this as a way to point the field in this direction as this is also how we view the matter. For example, some of the genes whose expression has been observed to be enriched following removal of brain tissue in axolotls (such as kazald2, Lust et al.), are also upregulated in traditional blastemas, for instance, in the limb, but we appreciate that the expression domain may not be as localized as in a limb blastema. Additionally, since there is now evidence that some aspects of progenitor cell activation even in limb regeneration extend far beyond the local site of amputation injury (Johnson et al., Payzin-Dogru et al.), there is an opportunity to connect the dots and make the claim that there could be more dispersion of &quot;blastema function&quot; than previously appreciated in the field. Diving a bit more into these nuances may also enable a better conceptual framework of how blastema function may evolve across vast evolutionary time and between different injury contexts in super-regenerative organisms.</p><p>• Authors addressed this comment and agree it is interesting, but given how much territory they had to cover and space limitations, they will save this type of discussion and comparative theoretical work for the future.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is much improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100796.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Medina-Feliciano</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Valentín-Tirado</surname><given-names>Griselle</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Luna-Martínez</surname><given-names>Kiara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Beltran-Rivera</surname><given-names>Alejandra</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Miranda-Negrón</surname><given-names>Yamil</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Garcia-Arraras</surname><given-names>José E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews</bold>:</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>The entire study is based on only 2 adult animals, that were used for both the single cell dataset and the HCR.

While the scRNAseq was indeed performed in two animals (n=2), the HCR-FISH was performed in 3-5 animals (depending on the probe used). These were different animals from those used for the scRNAseq.

Finally, in many occasions a zoomed out image would help the reader to provide context and have a better understanding of where the signal is localized.</p></disp-quote><p>Fluorescent photos have been changed to color-blind friendly colors.

I would encourage to Authors to remove a lot of the details (list of genes and GO terms) that can be found in the figures and stressed only the most important elements that they will need to support their conclusions. Having full and abbreviated gene names and the long list of references makes the text difficult to read and it is challenging to identify the main point that the Authors are trying to highlight.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been abbreviated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1: I would suggest adding a graph of holothurian anatomy before and after the evisceration to provide more context of the process we are looking at and remove 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>Information on the holothurian anatomy has been included in a new Fig 1 and in supplementary figure S1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2: I would suggest removing this figure that is redundant with Figure 3 and several genes are not cluster specific.

I would encourage the Authors to shorten the text and shorten paragraphs that have repeating information. - It might be out of the scope of the Authors but the readers would benefit from having a manuscript that focuses more on the novel aspects discovered with the single-cell RNA-Seq and then have a review that will bring together all the literature published on this topic and integrating the single-cell data with everything that is known so far.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to shorten the discussion by eliminating redundant text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- An intriguing finding is the lack of significant difference in the cell clusters between the anlage and mesentery during regeneration. This discovery raises important questions about the regenerative process. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the implications of this finding. For example, does it suggest that both organs contribute equally to the regenerated tissues?</p></disp-quote><p>The lack of significant differences in the cell clusters between the anlage and the mesentery is somewhat surprising but can be explained by two different facts. First, we have previously shown that many of the cellular processes that take place in the anlage, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, dedifferentiation and ECM remodeling occur in a gradient that begins at the tip of the mesentery where the anlage forms and extends to various degrees into the mesentery. Similarly, migrating cells move along the connective tissue of the mesentery to the anlage. Thus, there is no clear partition of the two regions that would account for distinct cell populations associated with the regenerative stage. Second, the two cell populations that would have been found in the mesentery but not in the regenerating anlage, mature muscle and neurons, were not dissociated by our experimental protocol as to allow for their sequencing. Our current experiments are being done using single nuclei RNA sequencing to overcome this hurdle. This has now been included in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Proliferating cells are obviously important to the study of regeneration as it is assumed these form the regenerating tissue. The authors describe cluster 8 as the proliferative cells. Is there evidence of proliferation in other cell types or are these truly the only dividing cells? Is c8 of multiple cell types but the clustering algorithm picks up on the markers of cell division i.e. what happens if you mask cell division markers - does this cluster collapse into other cluster types? This is important as if there is only one truly proliferating cell type then this may be the origin of the regenerative tissues and is important for this study to know this.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer highlights, we also believe this to be an important aspect to discuss. We have addressed this in the manuscript discussion with the following: “Our data suggest that there appears to be a specific population of only proliferative cells (C8) characterized by a large number of cell proliferation genes, which can be visualized by the top genes shown in Fig 3. These cell proliferation genes are specific to C8, with minimum representation in other populations. Interestingly, as mentioned before C8 expresses at lower levels many of the genes of other coelomic epithelium populations. Nevertheless, even if we mask the top 38 proliferation genes (not shown), this cluster is maintained as an independent cluster, suggesting that its identity is conferred by a complex transcriptomic profile rather than only a few proliferation-related genes. Therefore, the identity and potential role of C8 could be further described by two distinct alternatives: (1) cells of C8 could be an intermediate state between the anlage precursor cells (discussed below) and the specialized cell populations or (2) cells of C8 are the source of the anlage precursor populations from which all other populations arise. The pseudotime data is certainly complex and challenging to interpret with our current dataset, yet the RNA velocity analysis showed in Fig 11B would suggests that cells of C8 transition into the anlage precursor populations, rather than being an intermediate state. This is also supported by the Slingshot pseudotime analysis that incorporates C8 (S13 Fig).</p><p>Nevertheless, additional experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The schematic model presented in Fig 10 is essential for clarifying the paper's findings and will provide a crucial baseline model for future research. However, the comparison of the data shown in the HCR figures with the schematic is challenging due to the lack of spatial context in the HCR figures. The authors should find a way to provide better context in the figures, such as providing two-color in situ images to compare spatial relationships of cell types and/or including lower resolution and side-by-side fluorescent and bright field images if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure has been modified to explain the spatial arrangement of the tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make several strong statements in the discussion that weren't well connected to the findings in the data. Specifically:</p><p>“Regardless of which cell population is responsible for giving rise to the cells of the regenerating intestine, our study reveals that the coelomic epithelium, as a tissue layer, is pluripotent.”</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been expanded to better explain the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>738 “…we postulate that cells from C1 stand as the precursor cell population from which the rest of the cells in the coelomic epithelium arise”.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been expanded to better explain the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>748 “differentiation: muscle, neuroepithelium, and coelomic epithelium cells. We also propose the presence of undifferentiated and proliferating cell populations in the coelomic epithelia, which give rise to the cells in this layer…”</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been expanded to better explain the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>777 “amphibians, the cells of the holothurian anlage coelomic epithelium are proliferative undifferentiated cells and originated via a dedifferentiation process…”</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been expanded to better explain the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific questions:</p><p>- Is there any way to systematically compare these cells to evolutionarily-diverged cells in distant relatives to sea cucumbers? Or even on a case-by-case basis? For example, is there evidence for any of these transitory cell types to have correlate(s) in vertebrate gut regeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a most interesting question but one that is perhaps a bit premature to answer due to multiple reasons. First, most of the studies in vertebrates focus on the regeneration of the luminal epithelium, a layer that we are not studying in our system since it appears later in the regeneration process. Second, there is still too little data from adult echinoderms to fully comprehend which cells are cell orthologues to vertebrates. Third, we are only analyzing one regenerative stage. It is our hope that this is just the start of a full description of what cell types/stages are found and how they function in regeneration and that this will lead us to identify the cellular orthologues among animal species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major revisions:</p><p>- If lineage tracing is within the scope of this paper, it would provide more definitive evidence to the conclusions made about the precursor populations of the regenerating anlage.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This is certainly one of the next steps, however at present, it is not possible due to technical limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor revisions:</p><p>- Line 47: &quot;for decades&quot; even longer! Could the authors also cite some other amphibians, such as other salamanders (newts) and larval frogs?</p></disp-quote><p>References have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 85: &quot;specially&quot;-could authors potentially change to &quot;specifically&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 122: Authors should add the full words of what these abbreviations stand for in the caption for Figure 1 or in Figure 1A itself.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 153: What conclusions are the authors trying to make from one type of tubulin presence compared to the others? It's unclear from the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors are not trying to reach any particular conclusion. They are just stating what was found using several markers, and the possibility that what might be viewed first hand as a single cell population might be more heterogenous. Although the tubulin-type information might not be relevant for the conclusions in the present manuscript, it might be important for future work on the cell types involved in the regeneration process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 226: Could the authors clarify if &quot;WNT9&quot; is &quot;WNT9a&quot;. Figure 3 lists WNT9a but authors refer to WNT9 in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The gene names in Fig 3 are based on the human identifiers. H. glaberrima only has one sequence of Wnt9 (Auger et al. 2023) and this sequence shares the highest similarity to human Wnt9a, thus the name in the list. We have now identified the gene as Wnt9 to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 236-237: Can authors rule out that some immune cells might infiltrate the mesenchymal population?</p></disp-quote><p>No, this cannot be ruled out. In fact, we believe that most of the immune cells found in our scRNA-seq are indeed cells that have infiltrated the anlage and are part of the mesenchyma. This has been reported by us previously (see Garcia-Arraras et al. 2006). We have now included this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 452-453: The over-representation of ribosomal genes not shown. Would it be possible to show this information in the supplementary figures?</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence has been modified, the data is being prepared as part of a separate publication that focuses on the ribosomal genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 480: Could authors clarify if it's WNT9a or just WNT9?</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed Wnt9. See previous response above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 500: In future experiments, it would be interesting to compare to populations at different timepoints in order see how the populations are changing or if certain precursors are activated at different times.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer. These are ongoing experiments or are part of new grant proposals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 567-568: Choosing 9-dpe allowed for 13 clusters, but do authors expect a different number of clusters at different timepoints as things become more terminally differentiated?</p></disp-quote><p>Definitely, we believe that clusters related to the different regenerative stages of cells can be found by looking at earlier or later regeneration stages of the organ. A clear example is that if the experiment is done at 14-dpe, when the lumen is forming, cells related to luminal epithelium populations will appear. It is also possible that different immune cells will be associated with the different regeneration stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 653: References Figure 10D (not in this manuscript). Are authors referring to only 1D or 9D or an old draft figure number?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, this was a mistake where the reference is to a previous draft. It has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 701: &quot;our study reveals that the coelomic epithelium, as a tissue layer, is pluripotent.&quot; Phrasing may be better as referring to the cell population making up the tissue layer as pluripotent/multipotent or that the cells it contains would likely be pluripotent or multipotent. Additionally, lineage tracing may be needed to definitively demonstrate this.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been modified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 808: The authors may make a more accurate conclusion by saying that the characteristics are similar to blastemas or behave like a blastema rather than it is blastema. There is ambiguity about the meaning of this term in the field, but most researchers seem to currently have in mind that the &quot;blastema&quot; definition includes a discrete spatial organization of cells, and here these cells are much more spread out.

Though we would love to elaborate on the blastema topic, as suggested by the reviewer, we believe that it would extend the discussion too much and that the topic might be better served in a different publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the discussion, it would be important not to leave the reader with the impression that all amphibian blastema cells originate via dedifferentiation. This is not the case. For example, in axolotls (Sandoval-Guzman et al.) and in larval/juvenile newts, muscle progenitors within the blastema structure have been shown to originate from muscle satellite cells, a kind of stem cell, in stump tissues (while adult newts use dedifferentiation of myofibers to generate muscle progenitors in the blastema). Most cell lineages simply have not been evaluated in the level of detail that would be required to definitively conclude one way or the other, and the door is open for a more substantial contribution from stem cell populations than previously appreciated especially because new tools exist to detect and study them. Providing the reader with a more nuanced view of this situation will not negatively impact the findings in this paper, but it will show that there is biological complexity still waiting to be discovered and that we don't have all the answers at this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures: Overall, the figures need minor work.</p><p>- Figure 1A: Can the authors draw a smaller, full-body cartoon and feature the current high-mag cartoon as an inset to that?
