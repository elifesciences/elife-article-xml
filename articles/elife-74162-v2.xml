The dynamic regulation of plasma membrane nano-environments has recently emerged as a key fundamental aspect of plant signaling, but the molecular components governing it are still mostly unclear. The receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) controls ligand-induced complex formation of the immune receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) with its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and perception of the endogenous peptide hormone RAPID ALKALANIZATION FACTOR 23 (RALF23) by FER inhibits immunity. Here, we show that FER regulates the plasma membrane nanoscale organization of FLS2 and BAK1. Our study demonstrates that akin to FER, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) extensin proteins (LRXs) contribute to RALF23 responsiveness and regulate BAK1 nanoscale organization and immune signaling. Furthermore, RALF23 perception leads to rapid modification of FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale organization, and its inhibitory activity on immune signaling relies on FER kinase activity. Our results suggest that perception of RALF peptides by FER and LRXs actively modulates plasma membrane nanoscale organization to regulate cell surface signaling by other ligand-binding receptor kinases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>receptor kinase</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>nanoscale organization</kwd><kwd>peptide

organisms evolved sophisticated surveillance systems to monitor changes in their environment. In plants, receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor proteins (RPs) are the main ligand-binding cell-surface receptors perceiving self, non-self, and modified-self molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hohmann et al., 2017</xref>). For example, recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) initiates signaling events, leading to pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeFalco and Zipfel, 2021</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) FLS2 and EFR recognize the bacterial PAMPs flagellin (or its derived epitope flg22) and elongation factor-Tu (or its derived epitope elf18), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gómez-Gómez and Boller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zipfel et al., 2006</xref>). Both FLS2 and EFR form ligand-induced complexes with the co-receptor BAK1 (a LRR-RK also referred as SERK3) to initiate immune signaling, such as the production of apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS), and calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schulze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thor et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that the <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 1-LIKE (CrRLK1L) FERONIA (FER) and the GPI-anchored protein LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) are required for flg22-induced FLS2-BAK1 complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stegmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the endogenous peptide hormone RALF23 is perceived by a LLG1-FER heterocomplex, which leads to inhibition of flg22-induced FLS2-BAK1 complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stegmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). As such, although FER and LLG1 are positive regulator of PTI, RALF23 is a negative regulator. How these components regulate FLS2-BAK1 complex formation remains however unclear.</p><p>Several members of the CrLKL1L family are involved in RALFs perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu, 2021</xref>). Among them, FER plays a pivotal role in the perception of several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RALF peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stegmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abarca et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu, 2021</xref>). In addition, cell wall-associated LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT-EXTENSINs (LRXs) proteins are also involved in CrRLK1L-regulated pathways and were shown to bind RALFs with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mecchia, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moussu, 2020</xref>). Structural and biochemical analyses indicate that RALF binding by CrRLK1L/LLG complexes and LRXs are mutually exclusive and mechanistically distinct from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moussu, 2020</xref>). While CrRLK1Ls and LRXs have emerged as important RALF-regulated signaling modules, it is still unknown whether LRXs are also involved in RALF23-mediated regulation of immune signaling.</p><p>Plasma membrane lipids and proteins dynamically organize into diverse membrane domains giving rise to fluid molecular patchworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gronnier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballweg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaillais and Ott, 2020</xref>). These domains are proposed to provide dedicated biochemical and biophysical environments to ensure acute, specific, and robust signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gronnier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobson et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, FLS2 localizes in discrete and static structures proposed to specify immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bücherl et al., 2017</xref>). The cell wall is thought to impose physical constraints on the plasma membrane, limiting the diffusion of its constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feraru, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinière, 2012</xref>). Indeed, alteration of cell wall integrity leads to aberrant protein motions at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinière, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenna, 2019</xref>). Notably, perturbation of the cell wall affects FLS2 nanoscale organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenna, 2019</xref>). Despite its utmost importance, it remains largely unknown how the cell wall and its integrity modulate the organization of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, both CrRLK1Ls and LRXs are proposed cell wall integrity sensors and conserved modules regulating growth, reproduction, and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herger et al., 2019</xref>). However, their mode of action and potential links between cell wall integrity sensing and RALF perception are still poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we show that FER regulates the plasma membrane nanoscale organization of FLS2 and BAK1. Similarly, we show that LRXs contribute to RALF23 responsiveness and regulate BAK1 nanoscale organization and immune signaling. Importantly, our work reveals an unexpected uncoupling of FER and LRX modes of action in growth and immunity. We demonstrate that RALF23 perception leads to rapid modulation of FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale organization and that its inhibitory activity on immune signaling requires FER kinase activity. We propose that the regulation of the plasma membrane nanoscale organization by RALF23 receptors underscores their role in the formation of protein complexes and initiation of immune signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FER regulates membrane nanoscale organization of FLS2 and BAK1</title><p>We combined variable angle total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (VA-TIRFM) and single-particle tracking to analyze the lateral mobility of FLS2-GFP in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines.

Using this approach, we found that FLS2-GFP fluorescence was maintained into well-defined and static structures in WT, while it appeared more disperse and more mobile in both <italic>fer</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To substantiate these observations, we used the previously established spatial clustering index (SCI), which describes protein lateral organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gronnier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tran et al., 2020</xref>).

To inquire for a potential defect in FLS2 plasma membrane accumulation, we observed subcellular localization of FLS2-GFP using confocal microscopy. The analysis revealed a decrease in FLS2-GFP accumulation in <italic>fer</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Whether the proposed role of FER in regulating endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) accounts for this defect is unknown. Altogether, these results show that <italic>FER</italic> is genetically required to control FLS2-GFP nanoscale organization and accumulation at the plasma membrane.</p><p>To further characterize the impact of <italic>FER</italic> loss of function in RK organization, we analyzed the behavior of BAK1-mCherry at the plasma membrane. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments previously suggested that the vast majority of BAK1 molecules are mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hutten et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this result, BAK1-mCherry was more mobile than FLS2-GFP in the WT (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Given that BAK1 is a common co-receptor for multiple LRR-RK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hohmann et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that BAK1 might dynamically associate with various pre-formed signaling platforms, such as FLS2 nanodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bücherl et al., 2017</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, we were not able to perform high-quality single-particle tracking analysis for BAK1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>, see Materials and methods section). However, visual inspection of particles behavior suggested that BAK1-mCherry was less mobile in <italic>fer-4</italic> than in WT (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Accordingly, reconstructed VA-TIRFM images and kymographs showed that BAK1-mCherry fluorescence was more structured and static in <italic>fer-4</italic> than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we observed an increase of BAK1-mCherry SCI in <italic>fer-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Confocal microscopy analysis did not reveal significant differences in BAK1-mCherry plasma membrane accumulation between <italic>fer-4</italic> and WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, these data show that loss of <italic>FER</italic> perturbs FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale organization, albeit in an opposite manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and H</xref>). Previous reports have similarly shown that altering the composition of the cell wall can lead to opposed effects on the mobility of different proteins. For instance, inhibition of cellulose synthesis increases the mobility of HYPERSENSITIVE-INDUCED REACTION 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daněk et al., 2020</xref>) but limits the mobility of LOW-TEMPERATURE-INDUCED PROTEIN 6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinière, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daněk et al., 2020</xref>). Modification of pectin methyl esterification status of the cell wall increases the mobility of FLS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McKenna, 2019</xref>) but decreases the mobility of FLOTILIN 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daněk et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that various membrane environments are differentially regulated by the cell wall and the proposed cell wall integrity sensor FER.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LRX3, LRX4, and LRX5 regulate BAK1 nanoscale organization and PTI signaling</title><p>LRXs are dimeric, cell wall-localized, high-affinity RALF-binding proteins suggested to monitor cell wall integrity in growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumberger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mecchia, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moussu, 2020</xref>).

However, despite several attempts, we could not retrieve homozygous <italic>lrx3/4/5</italic> lines expressing FLS2-GFP.

Thus, like in <italic>fer</italic> mutants, perturbation in PTI signaling observed in <italic>lrx3/4/5</italic> correlates with alterations of plasma membrane RK organization.</p><p>LRX3, LRX4, and LRX5 have been proposed to sequester RALF peptides to prevent internalization of FER and inhibition of its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Following this logic, defects in PTI observed in <italic>lrx3/4/5</italic> could be explained by a depletion of FER at the plasma membrane. However, our confocal microscopy analysis and western blotting with anti-FER antibodies indicated that FER accumulation and plasma membrane localization were not affected in <italic>lrx3/4/5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, VA-TIRFM revealed that FER-GFP transiently accumulated in dynamic foci, independently of <italic>LRX3/4/5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). Together, these results suggest that LRX3/4/5 do not prevent RALF association with FER to modulate PTI. Moreover, our results suggest that active monitoring by the proposed cell wall integrity sensors FER and LRXs regulates plasma membrane nanoscale dynamics of RKs.</p><p>The ability of LRX3/4/5 to associate with RALF23 in planta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) prompted us to test whether LRX3/4/5 are required for RALF23 responsiveness. Indeed, <italic>LRX3, LRX4,</italic> and <italic>LRX5</italic> were required for RALF23-induced inhibition of elf18-triggered ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Similarly, we observed a decrease in RALF23-induced seedlings growth inhibition in <italic>lrx3/4/5</italic> compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Altogether, these data show that LRX3/4/5 contribute to RALF23 responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), and that LRXs and FER have analogous functions in regulating PTI.</p><p>We next asked whether FER and LRX3/4/5 form a complex. For this, we made use of a truncated version of LRX4 lacking its extensin domain (LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup>), previously used to assess protein complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herger et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with previous reports based on transient expression in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herger et al., 2020</xref>), co-immunoprecipitation experiments with stable transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that FER was constitutively associated with LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup>-FLAG, and that RALF23 treatment did not modulate this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that direct monitoring of the cell wall mediated by a possible FER-LRX complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herger et al., 2019</xref>) is not regulated by RALF23. In agreement with structural and biochemical analyses of RALF-binding by CrRLK1Ls/LLGs and LRXs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moussu, 2020</xref>), FER-LLG1 and LRX3/4/5 may form distinct RALF23 receptor complexes. Similar to their roles in pollen tube and root hair growth and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mecchia, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moussu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herger et al., 2020</xref>), future investigations are thus needed to understand the exact molecular link between RALF-binding LRXs and CrRLK1s.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional dichotomy of FER and LRXs in regulating growth and immunity</title><p>In line with previous reports, our data show that FER and LRXs can form a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herger et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Moreover, they are known to associate with the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumberger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng, 2018</xref>) and are proposed to cooperatively relay its properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herger et al., 2019</xref>). We thus asked if direct cell wall sensing underlies FER and LRXs function in PTI. In the context of growth and cell expansion, plants overexpressing LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup> are phenotypically reminiscent of <italic>lrx3/4/5</italic> and <italic>fer-4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>). This dominant negative effect is proposed to be caused by competition of the overexpressed truncated LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup> with endogenous LRXs and consequent loss of cell wall anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dünser, 2019</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of LRX1<sup>ΔE</sup> inhibits root hair elongation, phenocopying <italic>LRX1/LRX2</italic> loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herger et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, we observed that LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup> overexpression did not affect flg22-induced interaction between FLS2 and BAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In good agreement with this notion, overexpression of LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup> did not affect flg22- nor elf18-induced ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To corroborate these results, we tested inhibition of root growth triggered by flg22 treatment. Consistent with the positive role of FER and LRX3/4/5 in PTI, we observed that <italic>fer-4</italic> and <italic>lrx3/4/5</italic> were hyposensitive to flg22 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). By contrast, overexpression of LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup> did not affect inhibition of root growth by flg22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, we observed that LRX4<sup>ΔE</sup> overexpression did not impact RALF23 responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the function of LRX3/4/5 in PTI is distinct from their role during growth.</p><p>The ectodomain of FER contains two malectin-like domains, malA and malB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which share homology with malectin, a carbohydrate-binding protein from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boisson-Dernier et al., 2011</xref>). Despite lacking the canonical carbohydrate-binding site of malectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moussu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), malA and malB were proposed to bind pectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2021</xref>), and FER-mediated cell wall sensing regulates pavement cell and root hair morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). To investigate if direct cell wall sensing underlies FER’s function in regulating PTI, we used transgenic lines expressing a FER truncated mutant, lacking the malA domain, C-terminally fused to YFP (FER<sup>∆malA</sup>-YFP) in the <italic>fer-4</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed that FER<sup>∆malA</sup>-YFP did not complement the cell shape and root hair elongation defects of <italic>fer-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), emphasizing the importance of malA in FER-regulated cell morphogenesis. In contrast, immunoprecipitation assays showed that FER<sup>∆malA</sup>-YFP fully complemented flg22-induced complex formation between endogenous FLS2 and BAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) as well as ROS production in response to flg22 and elf18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that malA-mediated cell wall sensing underlies specific function(s) of FER in regulating growth and cell morphology, but is dispensable for FER’s role in PTI. Interestingly, we observed that expression of FER<sup>∆malA</sup>-YFP restored inhibition of growth triggered by RALF23, suggesting that malB is sufficient for RALF responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), as suggested by its physical interaction with RALF23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). While we cannot formally exclude the implication of pectin-binding by malB in regulating immunity, the contrasted context-dependent functionality of FER<sup>∆malA</sup>-YFP suggests that FER’s function in PTI is primarily mediated by RALF perception. Altogether, our data indicate molecular and functional dichotomy of FER and LRXs in regulating growth and immunity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>FER malectin A domain regulates cell morphogenesis not pattern-triggered immunity (PTI).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of RALF23 perception by FER-LLG1 complex.

The function of RALF receptors in other processes might similarly rely on the regulation of RK nanoscale dynamics, and the identification of the corresponding regulated RKs is an exciting prospect for future investigation. Further work will be required to decipher how FLS2 and BAK1 associate in a ligand-dependent manner within the plasma membrane and to understand how FER and LRXs control this process. While FER associate with LLG1 to perceive RALF peptides, whether perception of these peptides by LRXs involves additional unknown components remains open. For both FER-LLG1 and LRXs, it will be important in the future to identify the components mediating RALF23 signaling and modification of FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale dynamics. Because FER-LLG1 and LRX3/4/5 – components of distinct RALFs receptor complexes – are genetically required to control FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale dynamics, we hypothesize that perception of additional RALF peptides may be involved in regulating this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Plants have evolved coordinated RK protein-protein interaction networks to process extracellular signals into specific responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smakowska-Luzan et al., 2018</xref>), and thus may have co-evolved mechanisms to regulate these interactions in both space and time. Our results suggest that perception of endogenous peptides by distinct receptor complexes actively modulates the plasma membrane nanoscale organization to regulate cell surface signaling by other RKs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Diffusion coefficients of individual particles were determined using TraJClassifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>). For each particle, the slope of the first four time points of their mean square displacement (MSD) plot was used to calculate their diffusion coefficient according to the following equation: MSD = (x – x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y – y<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> and D = MSD/4<italic>t</italic>, where x0 and y0 are the initial coordinates, and x and y are the coordinates at any given time, and <italic>t</italic> is the time frame.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Quantification of SCI</title><p>Genotype and/or treatment-dependent variation in fluorescence intensity of FLS2-GFP and fluorescence pattern of FLS2-GFP and BAK1-mCherry compromised the use of a unique set of parameters to compute nanodomain size and density across the different experiments. To uniformly quantify differences in membrane organization of both FLS2 and BAK1 across all experiments, we used the SCI that was shown to be largely insensitive to variation in fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gronnier et al., 2017</xref>). Quantifications were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gronnier et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, fluorescence intensity was plotted along an 8-µm-long line on maximum projection of VA-TIRFM images. Three plots were randomly recorded per cell and at least eight cells per condition per experiment were analyzed. For each line plot, the SCI was calculated by dividing the mean of the 5% highest values by the mean of 5% lowest values. Because the absence of correlation between fluorescence intensity and SCI was assessed on confocal microscopy images and for a single protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gronnier et al., 2017</xref>), we tested whether this was also the case in our experimental conditions. Indeed, we consistently observed poor to no correlation between variation in fluorescence intensity and values of SCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments</title><p>20–30 seedlings per plate were grown in wells of a 6-well plate for 2 weeks, transferred to 2 mM MES-KOH, pH 5.8, and incubated overnight. The next day flg22 (final concentration 100 nM) and/or RALF23 (final concentration 1 µM) were added and incubated for 10 min. Seedlings were then frozen in liquid N2 and subjected to protein extraction. To analyze FLS2-BAK1 receptor complex formation, proteins were isolated in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM NaF, 1.5 mM activated Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% IGEPAL. For immunoprecipitations, α-rabbit Trueblot agarose beads (eBioscience) coupled with α-FLS2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>) or GFP-Trap agarose beads (ChromoTek) were used and incubated with the crude extract for 3–4 hr at 4°C. Subsequently, beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0,1% IGEPAL) before adding Laemmli sample buffer and incubating for 10 min at 95°C. Analysis was carried out by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To test the association between Flag-LRX4 and FER, total protein from 60 to 90 seedlings per treatment per genotype was extracted as previously described. For immunoprecipitations, M2 anti-Flag affinity gel (Sigma A2220-5ML) was used and incubated with the crude extract for 2–3 hr at 4°C. Subsequently, beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% IGEPAL) before adding Laemmli sample buffer and incubating for 10 min at 95°C. Analysis was carried out by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jan Petrášek (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>From the written reviews and discussion, there was much enthusiasm for the work, but two general concerns emerged: (1) replicated data were not fully analyzed and reported and (2) the ability of a broad audience to engage with and appreciate the detailed work would be enhanced by modifications to the text. From the individual reviews appended below you will find specific examples of places where modifying text or presentation would have the largest impact.</p><p>1) That &quot;similar results were found among three replicates&quot; is mentioned in nearly every figure, but these replicates are not shown. After a healthy discussion among the reviewers about what was essential to show, all three reviewers concurred that in the cases of single particle tracking and the quantitative imaging of mobility (reported, for example, in Figures 1C, G; 2F; 4C), the data from the three replicates should be analyzed and the differences between experiments reported. This is in part because this paper has the potential to serve as a standard bearer for this technique.</p><p>In the case of Western blots, showing a single representative blot was fine, but the band intensities should be quantified using standard densitometry scans.

An example in plants is the receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) that has been implicated in numerous processes including cell wall integrity signaling and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Using a series of cell biological and biochemical approaches, the authors show, using the intensively studied FLS2-BAK1 immune receptor complex and its previous identified ligands and signaling potentiators or inhibitors, that different domains and activities of FER have discrete roles in different cellular events. They further show that FER and LRX proteins may affect the mobility of plasma membrane proteins in their nanodomains, though precisely how loss of FER or LRX leads to changes in nanodomain properties is not entirely clear. This detailed work adds interesting and important information about how individual proteins and cellular milieus can alter signaling. Additional discussion and presentation of these findings is an integrative model would help to make the details illustrative of general signaling rules and would broaden the impact of this work outside of the plant immunity niche.</p><p>From the set-up of this paper, I imagined that the authors would show a unified way in which FER and/or LRXs affected a cellular feature (e.g. nanodomain formation) and this would account for multiple activities. The results of their experiments, however, showed that they can separate activities of FER (e.g. malectin A domain being involved in cell morphogenesis but not PTI whereas FER kinase activity is not required for PTI). I am left not quite knowing how direct FER activity is on FLS2-BAK1 behaviors. I was expecting it to be indirect through some nanodomain organization, but I failed to find this thread followed through. The direct effects of FER are also interesting results, but as an outsider to the PTI and cell wall integrity fields, I find it challenging to synthesize the results into a general overall model. I don't think the authors need more experiments, but I do think a figure that summarizes their updated concept of how FER works would make this paper accessible and appreciated by a wider audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper provides insight into the molecular mechanisms which mediate a plants immune response. Specifically looking at the dynamic organization of nano-domains of immune receptors, where the role of hormone peptides, co-receptors and the cell wall upon this domain are examined. This thus provides insights into overall plant physiology and into the finer details of membrane dynamic organization and signaling hubs. The authors use a range of experimental approaches (genetic, biochemical, live imaging) to show that FER regulates the formation of the FLS2-BAK1 complex, that additional receptors also regulate the stabilization these complexes on membrane as 'nano-domains'. Furthermore, they show that a domain of FER that regulates cell shape is dispensable for the immune response and RALF23 (a ligand for FER) also stabilizes BAK into nanodomains.</p><p>The story presented shows a logical progression and is based upon the results presented.</p><p>The major strength of the paper is the methods used. For example, high resolution imaging of the cell surface is utilized to directly visualize the dynamics of these proteins, and this is coupled with single particle tracking analysis, thus providing an accurate picture of these domains and their dynamics. Genetic lines are used to specifically examine the functionality of the proteins and their domains.</p><p>However, in order to improve the manuscript, I believe the authors should provide further details about the methods used and analysis details. For example, at present many of the figures are presented with statistical analysis to compare experimental conditions, but in the figure legends they state 'similar results were obtained in three independent experiments'. To present the data as robustly as possible, I suggest that the authors should show and perform statistical analysis on these similar experiments. Thus, providing the readers with a chance to evaluate how robust the effect is and to understand how variable the experiments were.</p><p>A weak experimental point is the examination of protein accumulation on the plasma membrane – which is used to show that the nanodomain results in the stabilization of FLS on the membrane, preventing them from being endocytosed. Here single channel images are used to determine the amount of protein based on fluorescent intensity without further controls (e.g. molecular, biochemical, internal signal controls, to confirm the overall amount of protein in the different lines). Additionally, it is not clarified if the fer mutants used have altered endocytosis in general.</p><p>The legends/methods need further details. For example, in figure 1 supplemental 1, it is not clear what the data points are; are they individual tracks, or cells from the same plant? Thus, it is important to clarify further how the analyses was conducted (ie, what the data points plotted are, further details on Ns/repeats).</p><p>I am not sure 'propensity' is the appropriate word, perhaps 'property', line 23.</p><p>In order to appeal to non-specialists, and to aid the readers comprehension, the authors should consider introducing less abbreviations and focusing on only the critical ones. For example, just in the 1st introduction paragraph (lines 41-55) there are 9, thus at present, it is quite hard to follow the text.</p><p>The authors should change the word static to describe the FLS foci on the cell surface (line 108). The foci are not static as they appear and disappear over time, thus they should consider using the terminology, 'laterally stable foci' or something similar.</p><p>As much of the analysis of live imaging relies on trackMate, and while the authors detail the settings used, there is no information about how the threshold values was selected. This is important as for example, during the videos, there is bleaching during acquisition which could result in the shortening of tracks. Furthermore, while I understand that is visually easy to show these results with kymographs, the authors should include a histogram of the foci spot lifetimes (as they have already tracked the spots) to more robustly depict the data.</p><p>In general, while the videos with tracking are a great addition to the manuscript, at present the fact that the tracks remain after the spots have disappeared is distracting and makes it hard to see the dynamics of the foci. It should be simple enough to change the videos with trackMate (it is just a case of changing the track display mode to 'show local tracks' and play with the 'show track depth' option), which would greatly improve the usefulness of the tracking videos.</p><p>The western blots should be quantified to show the results are robust and reproducible. And there are some signals which appear to be saturated.</p><p>While I understand the focus is on the FLS BAK dynamics, I think it would be interesting to show how specific this interaction is for mediating the formation of the nanodomains.

(23-09-2021-RA-<italic>eLife</italic>-74162) brings an original set of data describing the role of FER receptor kinase in the control of PM organization and dynamics of plant immune receptor kinases FLS2 and its co-receptor BAK1. Using an advanced fluorescence microscopy approach combined with biochemistry and molecular biology, authors show how the perception of plant peptide hormone RALF23 triggers a specific changes in the distribution of receptor kinases FLS2 and BAK1 in cells at the surface of cotyledons (epidermis of 5-day-old young seedlings). Moreover, these changes are shown to be regulated also by other other receptors of FER, i.e. LRX3, LRX4 and LRX5. The formation of the immune receptor kinase complexes with downstream signalling are therefore suggested to be under the control of RALF23 peptide hormone through the action of both FER and LRXs. Moreover, the data allowed authors to conclude that the effects on root hair growth and immune response are uncoupled in the case of both FER and LRXs receptor pathways and that the kinase activity of FER is needed for the inhibitory effect of RALF23 on the immune response, while the role of FER kinase in the pattern recognition receptors-triggered immunity is kinase-independent. The manuscript is very detailed, bringing the description of the nanoscale localization of receptor kinases; however, the biology behind the observed effects is still a point for future research. Results are basically supported by data, although I have some comments on their presentation.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This work combines in a very effective way advanced fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry and molecular genetics, this all in a well-established model of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. I really appreciate the level of microscopy details that were possible to perform in a quantitative way. For sure, the microscopy approach shown here is very important for any future work in this field and in numerous technical aspects, it truly paves the road for other researchers.</p><p>It is very important that there are more elements of the pathway analyzed in one experimental/observation setup. Without considering both FER and LRXs and evaluating them separately, it would not be possible to conclude on the extent of the changes in the nanoscale organization of RKs involved in the RALF23-controlled pathway. Of course, such work is very technology-demanding and time-consuming.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>I feel that this report needs more attention to the biology itself. For the broader community, it would be perfect to understand in what process the mechanism described here is crucial. Therefore, I feel that authors would much improve this manuscript if they would be able to defend why they use epidermal lobed cells in 5-day-old seedlings. I know that there might be plenty of technical reasons, previous work, etc., but biologists would ask about it; considering that effects on cell growth are shown in root hairs, while all immune responses are studied in cotyledon epidermal lobed cells. The introduction on why it is actually so important to study described processes in cotyledons would help.</p><p>Perhaps I am wrong, but the &quot;plasma membrane nanoscale landscape&quot;, as mentioned in the last sentence of the abstract, is related to the nanoscale organization of receptor kinases studied here, not the &quot;landscape&quot; of the PM itself. Of course, PM is extremely dynamic, but this manuscript is not focused on the understanding of PM structural changes provoked by the activity of individual receptor kinases. It is rather focused on surprisingly complex dynamics of individual receptor protein kinases with the PM. This I feel needs to be presented in a clearer form.</p><p>Statistics is provided for the majority of analyses. However, authors mention in numerous cases (at least in 17 analyses) that &quot;similar results were obtained in three independent experiments&quot;. I think that in the case of quantifications of microscopy images, it would be perfect to understand how observed differences in the dynamics of receptor kinases are robust when analyzed in these three mentioned biological repetitions. It would also be informative to include some rationale on the selection of cells for the analysis, e.g. was the size the criterion or something else?</p><p>For a broader community of readers, it might be perhaps better to introduce a bit what is that „peptide hormone&quot;. I know that authors are very deeply involved in the RALF23 and often simply call this molecule „peptide&quot;. However, in the title of this manuscript, the term “peptide hormone&quot; is used, but, the word &quot;hormone&quot; is not used in the manuscript at all. For broader community, this is a bit difficult to follow.</p><p>I think that for sure the biological implication of this work would be enhanced if data from biological repetitions mentioned in the text would be involved.</p><p>Kymographic analyses are not described in methods nor in captions. Axes of kymograms shown in the manuscript are not annotated; therefore it is not clear how actually dynamic the processes are. Time scale would help here.</p><p>In the Figure 1, suppl. Figure 1 the caption is not mentioning the statistics used in this analysis.</p><p>Line 877 – subscript should be used for numbers in chemical formulas.</p><p>VA-TIRFM is mentioned by authors as the main microscopy method used in this contribution. I hope I got it right, therefore, the abbreviation TIRFM in all main and supplementary captions should be changed to VA-TIRFM, as well as in the description of the microscopy itself (lines 807 and 862).</p><p>Line 869 – the reference to the suppl. image is not correct, it should not be Sup Figure 15, but Figure Suppl 6.</p><p>The quality of language is very good, however, there are some subtle grammar issues, e.g. on line 136 – „BAK1 might dynamically associates with&quot;, I found also some typos etc (line 831, the sentence should begin with a capital letter). I did not have time to find all of them, I encourage authors to check it again.</p><p>In vivo advanced fluorescence GSD microscopy is used here and I appreciate a lot this technique and how it is implemented. It would be perhaps good to discuss how far individual markers characterize the mobility of the structure where it is located (PM, cell wall, cytoskeleton, etc.) and how far this technique might be taken as the characterization of the mobility of the particular molecule within the particular structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74162.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>From the written reviews and discussion, there was much enthusiasm for the work, but two general concerns emerged: (1) replicated data were not fully analyzed and reported and (2) the ability of a broad audience to engage with and appreciate the detailed work would be enhanced by modifications to the text.

Furthermore, VA-TIRM experiments consistently showed a decrease in FLS2-GFP accumulation at the plasma membrane (Figure 1; Figure 1 – supplemental figure 2 and Figure 4 – supplemental figure 4). Similar to previous studies, we observed that compromised in nanodomain organization correlates with a defect in plasma membrane accumulation, but we do not claim that these observations demonstrate causality.

It would also be informative to include some rationale on the selection of cells for the analysis, e.g. was the size the criterion or something else?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his proposition and now provide data from individual experiments and their statistical analysis. Concerning the observation by VA-TIRFM: after placing the center of cotyledons of 5-day-old seedlings (entire seedlings were mounted between cover slips and slides) at the center of the objective lens, we screened, by moving in x and y, using pre-defined and fixed laser angle and power, for cells surfaces in distance range of the evanescent wave without additional a priori selection criterions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For a broader community of readers, it might be perhaps better to introduce a bit what is that „peptide hormone&quot;. I know that authors are very deeply involved in the RALF23 and often simply call this molecule „peptide&quot;. However, in the title of this manuscript, the term “peptide hormone&quot; is used, but, the word &quot;hormone&quot; is not used in the manuscript at all. For broader community, this is a bit difficult to follow.</p><p>I think that for sure the biological implication of this work would be enhanced if data from biological repetitions mentioned in the text would be involved.</p></disp-quote><p>We now introduce RALF23 as a peptide hormone in the introduction. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Kymographic analyses are not described in methods nor in captions. Axes of kymograms shown in the manuscript are not annotated; therefore it is not clear how actually dynamic the processes are. Time scale would help here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added scale bars for all kymographs. The kymographs were generated using “orthogonal views” (Image/Stacks/Orthogonal views). This information has been added to the material and methods section. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Figure 1, suppl. Figure 1 the caption is not mentioning the statistics used in this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now implemented. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 877 – subscript should be used for numbers in chemical formulas.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now corrected. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>VA-TIRFM is mentioned by authors as the main microscopy method used in this contribution. I hope I got it right, therefore, the abbreviation TIRFM in all main and supplementary captions should be changed to VA-TIRFM, as well as in the description of the microscopy itself (lines 807 and 862).</p></disp-quote><p>This is now corrected; we replaced TIRFM by VA-TIRFM throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 869 – the reference to the suppl. image is not correct, it should not be Sup Figure 15, but Figure Suppl 6.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now corrected. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The quality of language is very good, however, there are some subtle grammar issues, e.g. on line 136 – „BAK1 might dynamically associates with&quot;, I found also some typos etc (line 831, the sentence should begin with a capital letter). I did not have time to find all of them, I encourage authors to check it again.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now checked and corrected the manuscript for grammar issues. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In vivo advanced fluorescence GSD microscopy is used here and I appreciate a lot this technique and how it is implemented. It would be perhaps good to discuss how far individual markers characterize the mobility of the structure where it is located (PM, cell wall, cytoskeleton, etc.) and how far this technique might be taken as the characterization of the mobility of the particular molecule within the particular structure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your interest. We haven’t performed such a comparative analysis and are therefore unfortunately not in the position of evaluating it limits.</p></body></sub-article></article>
