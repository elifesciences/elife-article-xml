Yet, vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes. Surprisingly, our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion, have common reductions in neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets. To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects, an unbiased phospho-(p)-proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity, hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs. Thus, our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although the clinical presentation of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can vary widely, the core features are repetitive behaviors and difficulties with social interactions and communication. In most cases, the cause of autism is unknown. However, in some cases, such as a form of ASD known as 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, specific genetic changes are responsible.</p><p>Despite this variability in possible causes and clinical manifestations, the similarity of the core behavioral symptoms across different forms of the disorder indicates that there could be a shared biological mechanism. Furthermore, genetic studies suggest that abnormalities in early fetal brain development could be a crucial underlying cause of ASD. In order to form the complex structure of the brain, fetal brain cells must migrate and start growing extensions that ultimately become key structures of neurons.</p><p>To test for shared biological mechanisms, Prem et al. reprogrammed blood cells from people with either 16p11.2 deletion syndrome or ASD with an unknown cause to become fetal-like brain cells. Experiments showed that both migration of the cells and their growth of extensions were similarly disrupted in the cells derived from both groups of individuals with autism.</p><p>These crucial developmental changes were driven by alterations to an important signaling molecule in a pathway involved in brain function, known as the mTOR pathway. However, in some cells the pathway was overactive, whereas in others it was underactive. To probe the potential of the mTOR pathway as a therapeutic target, Prem et al. tested drugs that manipulate the pathway, finding that they could successfully reverse the defects in cells derived from people with both types of ASD.</p><p>The discovery that a shared biological process may underpin different forms of ASD is important for understanding the early brain changes that are involved. A common target, like the mTOR pathway, could offer hope for treatments for a wide range of ASDs. However, to translate these benefits to the clinic, further research is needed to understand whether a treatment that is effective in fetal cells would also benefit people with autism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>neurites</kwd><kwd>cell

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication and the presence of repetitive and restrictive interests and behaviors. Though these common impairments define ASD, there is marked heterogeneity in both clinical presentation and etiological underpinnings among affected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones and Klin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim and Lord, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betancur, 2011</xref>). In turn, this heterogeneity raises the possibility that there are ‘different’ ASD subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ousley and Cermak, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eaves et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beglinger and Smith, 2001</xref>). Yet, despite this heterogeneity, all autism subtypes are united by their core behavioral phenotypes. Consequently, we postulate that there may be common pathways linking different autism subtypes. Yet, few studies have compared multiple ASD subtypes to investigate possible commonalities.</p><p>About 10–15% of autism cases are genetically defined and caused by single gene mutations or copy number variants (CNVs) while most of ASD etiology remains undefined or idiopathic. Yet, much of our knowledge of ASD pathophysiology is derived from rodent studies of syndromic rare variant genes. Consequently, our insight into a majority of ASD pathophysiology has been limited and we have little knowledge of the similarities and differences between idiopathic and genetically defined autisms. Several studies have uncovered the convergence of both rare and common variant ASD risk genes onto the developing mid-fetal cerebral cortex (8–24 weeks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Willsey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parikshak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grove et al., 2019</xref>). During this period, neural precursor cells (NPCs) undergo proliferation, migration, and differentiation to form neurons and establish normal brain cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liszewska and Jaworski, 2018</xref>). Now, with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, we can study human neural development in cells derived from individuals with both genetic and idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. iPSC studies of monogenic, CNV, and idiopathic ASD have observed alterations in basic developmental processes, such as synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acab and Muotri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yang and Shcheglovitov, 2020</xref>). However, many of these studies focused on terminally differentiated neurons, with very few examining developmental events that correspond to mid-fetal cortical development that precede synapse formation, such as neurite outgrowth and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Packer, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Prem et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, there is little insight into whether and how extracellular factors (EFs), which coordinate neurodevelopment by regulating signaling, contribute to ASD pathogenesis in human NPCs.</p><p>To begin addressing these questions, we studied early neurite development and cell migration using human iPSC-derived NPCs from two different autism subtypes – an idiopathic cohort (I-ASD) and a genetically defined CNV 16p11.2 deletion (16pDel) cohort. We demonstrate remarkable convergence in neurite and migration phenotypes despite whole genome sequencing (WGS) showing no genetic overlap between the datasets. Specifically, we observed reductions in both neurite outgrowth and migration in NPCs derived from all individuals with ASD. Furthermore, to expand our understanding of NPC response to mid-fetal environmental stimuli, we stimulated NPCs with extracellular factors (EFs: growth factors, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters) that are expressed in the mid-fetal period and are known to regulate neurodevelopment. Surprisingly, our EF studies revealed that all unaffected NPCs responded to selected EFs with increases in neurite outgrowth and migration while I-ASD NPCs failed to respond to any of the tested EFs, suggesting the possibility of impaired signaling pathways. Thus, to identify mediating signaling pathways, an unbiased p-proteome analysis was conducted, which showed significant overlap in p-peptides between I-ASD and 16pDel datasets with less overlap in the total proteome. Bioinformatics revealed the mTOR pathway as one of the strongest points of convergence between the two ASD subtypes, which was supported by western analyses. Moreover, modulation of the mTOR pathway with small molecules rescued and reproduced ASD NPC phenotypes indicating that mTOR signaling defects are mechanistically linked to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Nonetheless, there were also ASD subtypes as evidenced by differential responses to EFs between I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs as well as distinct mTOR alterations including elevations and reductions. Overall, our studies indicate that despite the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, two distinct ASD subtypes have dysregulation of mTOR signaling which mediates the surprisingly uniform neurodevelopmental phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patient cohort, rigor and reproducibility, and study design</title><p>The I-ASD cohort was selected from the previously reported New Jersey Language and Autism Genetics Study. From three separate families, iPSCs were generated from three male probands with ASD and their sex-matched unaffected siblings (Sib) served as controls (see Materials and methods).</p><p>For comparison, we selected a genetically defined ASD cohort with 16p11.2 deletion CNV. The CNV deletes 28 genes, increases autism risk by ~20-fold, and is one of the most common ASD-associated mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Weiss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Niarchou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Qureshi et al., 2014</xref>). This cohort consists of three individuals, two males (16pDel M-1, 16pDel M-2) and one female (16pDel F). For sex-matched controls, we selected three iPSC lines from the NIH Regenerative Medicine Program (NIH).</p><p>We analyzed these 12 individuals (six I-ASD-Sib and six 16pDel-NIH) extensively for developmental phenotypes utilizing two to five clones per individual (except for NIH) and two to five independent neural inductions to ensure extensive rigor and reproducibility (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Whole genome sequencing</title><p>WGS was conducted on I-ASD dataset and demonstrated that no individuals harbored the 16p11.2 deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Moreover, no I-ASD individual had rare non-synonymous protein-coding variants in the 28 genes deleted in 16p11.2. Finally, there are no rare protein-coding non-synonymous genetic variants shared between all three I-ASD individuals. These data are consistent with the two datasets being genetically distinct with no common or shared genetic drivers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>I-ASD and 16pDel have common defects in neurite outgrowth and cell migration</title><p>During the mid-fetal developmental window, there are a few critical cellular processes that occur and are essential for the normal function and architecture of the brain. These processes include proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Within differentiation, neurite outgrowth is a critical cytoskeleton-dependent process necessary for normal neural connectivity in the brain. Elaboration of neurites is an important mechanism to assess for proper development in neuronal cells and multiple studies of NDDs have reported impairment in neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gleeson and Walsh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Uppal and Hof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wegiel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kathuria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Marchetto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshpande et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Prem et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we first assessed neurite outgrowth in I-ASD NPCs at 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Given the genetic heterogeneity of the I-ASD cohort, we expected to find personalized phenotypes.

To understand how I-ASD NPCs compared to genetically unrelated neurotypical individuals, we also compared I-ASD NPCs to Sibs from other families (e.g. I-ASD-1 to Sib-2).

Moreover, differences in migration area were not related to the initial neurosphere size (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, despite genetic heterogeneity both neurite outgrowth and cell migration are similarly impaired in all three I-ASD NPCs.</p><p>This remarkable convergence prompted us to examine the 16pDel ASD cohort for these phenotypes.

This indicates that defects in neurite outgrowth are a common feature across two genetically distinct subtypes of autism. Interestingly, 16pDel NPCs do have a higher percent of neurites than I-ASD (7.4% vs 5.1%, p&lt;0.01) indicating potential subgroup differences. There was no difference in neurite extension between Sib NPCs (11.3%) and NIH NPCs (12.7%) (p=0.1).</p><p>Lastly, we assessed migration in 16pDel NPCs. Once again, like I-ASD NPCs, all three 16pDel NPCs have impaired migration when compared to Sib and NIH NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Surprisingly, given the absence of genetic overlap between the cohorts, there is considerable overlap between I-ASD and 16pDel p-proteome results with 67 p-proteins (67/105) and 107 phosphorylation sites (107/149) shared between I-ASD and 16pDel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The large differences in the p-proteome along with minimal changes in the proteome suggest that phosphorylation and signaling could be dysregulated in both forms of ASD. Moreover, the p-proteome overlap between I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs suggests that different genetic mutations could converge on common signaling pathways.</p><p>To further assess p-proteome data, bioinformatic analyses were performed. To begin to understand the biological processes that could be dysregulated, G-profiler analysis was conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Reimand et al., 2019</xref>). For both I-ASD and 16pDel p-proteome, alterations in cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and developmental processes were identified, correlating well with our defined cellular phenotypes. To identify dysregulated signaling pathways, QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Krämer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schubert et al., 2015</xref>). IPA of I-ASD p-proteome determined the top three enriched modules are tight junction signaling, mTOR signaling, and synaptogenesis signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, ). For the 16pDel p-proteome, the top three pathways are EIF2 signaling, regulation of EIF4 and p70S6K signaling, and mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, ). Comparison analysis indicated the three most overlapping pathways between I-ASD and 16pDel as mTOR signaling, telomerase signaling, and HIPPO signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>In terms of canonical signaling pathways, mTOR has the highest enrichment in our datasets. The mTOR pathway includes a cascade of activation of molecules including phosphorylation of AKT and activation of p70S6K and ultimately phosphorylation of S6. Interestingly, IPA expression network analysis of p-proteome reveals strongly altered p-S6 as a central node of convergence in both I-ASD and 16pDel networks along with other mTOR members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).

As there were no small molecule activator and inhibitor pairs for p-S6 when experiments were being conducted, we instead employed an AKT activator (SC-79) and AKT inhibitor (MK-2206), which have been used extensively in other systems to modulate mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Takizawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>).

However, one phenotype that diverges between I-ASD NPCs and 16pDel NPCs is responsiveness to EFs. Unlike Sib, NIH, and 16pDel NPCs, the I-ASD NPCs do not respond to EFs (PACAP, NGF, and 5-HT) which stimulate neurite outgrowth and migration in all other NPC subgroups. Given that PACAP, NGF, and 5-HT act through different receptor systems we postulated that dysregulated signaling could potentially contribute to lack of I-ASD response to EFs. Thus, to further investigate if this failure to respond to EFs is due to mTOR signaling defects, we treated the I-ASD NPCs with ‘subthreshold’ amounts of mTOR agonist and inhibitor which did not maximally increase p-S6 or elicit neurite outgrowth on its own. To do so, we performed parallel dose-response studies and selected drug doses that did not elicit neurite outgrowth on their own but did elicit a non-maximal p-S6 increase (data not shown). For Family-1, agonist SC-79 (0.1 µg/mL) did not stimulate neurite outgrowth in I-ASD-1 NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Unexpectedly, we found common deficits in neurite outgrowth and cell migration in all six ASD NPCs. Yet, WGS revealed that I-ASD and 16pDel individuals did not share any rare variants in the 28 genes deleted in the 16p11.2 CNV and the three I-ASD individuals share no rare functional protein-coding variants that were ASD specific. Despite the genetic heterogeneity within the I-ASD cohort and between I-ASD and 16pDel cohort, p-proteomic analyses show significant overlap between I-ASD and 16pDel with convergence onto the mTOR pathway. Subsequent western analyses validated these p-proteome differences and uncovered two distinct mTOR molecular subtypes, characterized by increased or decreased p-S6. Importantly, the mTOR differences are responsible for the shared neurodevelopmental phenotypes since manipulation of the mTOR pathway with small molecules could rescue the autism NPC deficits and reproduce autism NPC phenotypes in control NPCs. Lastly, this is one of the first studies to utilize EFs to uncover differences not apparent in control conditions which subsequently allowed for definition of two further subtypes of ASD in our dataset, EF responsive (16pDel) and EF unresponsive (I-ASD). Remarkably, mTOR manipulation also rescued EF non-responsiveness indicating the importance of this pathway as a driver of disease phenotypes. Thus, our study supports that ASD subtypes with non-overlapping genetics can have common dysregulation of mTOR signaling which is responsible for the converging common neurodevelopmental phenotypes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Altered neurite outgrowth and migration are a common phenotype in all six ASD NPCs</title><p>While most ASD iPSC studies have investigated terminal neuronal differentiation phenotypes, our study has focused on NPCs and may be the first to find common NPC neurite and migration impairments in two different ASD subtypes.

Thus, our studies provide further evidence to altered developmental neuronal phenotypes in ASD.</p><p>Multiple studies indicate that NPCs are a biologically relevant cell type for ASD. Genetic studies, including extensive WES and GWAS analysis, have reproducibly identified human mid-fetal cerebral/cortical (8–24 weeks) development as a window for when and where most ASD risk genes are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Willsey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parikshak et al., 2013</xref>). During this window, NPCs are formed and undergo migration and early neurite extension. Recently altered NPC development has also been identified as a consistent neurodevelopmental phenotype for numerous ASD risk genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia-Forn et al., 2020</xref>). Given that human iPSC-derived NPCs are similar transcriptionally and functionally to cortical NPCs, our studies provide experimental evidence of NPC developmental dysregulation in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hofrichter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yan et al., 2013a</xref>). Furthermore, by comparing two subtypes of ASD, we show, as suggested by genetics studies, that this early developmental dysregulation may be a common feature among multiple forms of ASD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>mTOR signaling as a point of convergence in ASD</title><p>Our p-proteome, westerns, and small molecule analyses identified altered mTOR signaling as a point of convergence for the shared ASD neurite and migration phenotypes. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize unbiased p-proteomics in ASD NPCs and were able to uncover marked differences in the p-proteome for both ASD subtypes when compared to control. Interestingly, despite non-overlapping genetics, significant overlap was observed (67/105) at the p-proteome level between I-ASD and 16pDel. Further, about a third of these p-proteins are common with 102 high confidence ASD risk genes or relevant gene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that we are identifying similar pathways as described by others. In contrast, very few proteomic changes were noted in I-ASD (9/9700) and 16pDel (48/9700) NPCs when compared to unaffected individuals. This could suggest either the proteome is relatively unaltered in ASD NPCs, or the changes are quite varied between samples so no consistent significant results were observed.</p><p>The convergent signaling results are even more remarkable when we consider the WGS results and total proteome results. There is no rare variant overlap between the two ASD datasets, or among the three I-ASD individuals. While some I-ASD individuals have rare variants in genes that could affect mTOR signaling, these were often also shared by the Sib (e.g. TSC-1 rare variants). Given that the non-overlapping variants could potentially converge onto the mTOR pathway, we subsequently ran IPA on WGS data which did not uncover convergence onto the mTOR pathway or any other classical signaling pathway such as ERK, WNT, or CREB, but did find common alterations in immune regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Likewise, pathway analysis of published transcriptome data from 16pDel ASD patient iPSCs or lymphoblastic tissue also reveals no mTOR enrichment or dysregulation in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blumenthal et al., 2014</xref>). These results are also mirrored in the total proteome analyses which do not suggest mTOR enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that even without genetic mutations or protein changes in the mTOR pathway, multiple rare and common variant genes could interact to lead to dysregulation of mTOR pathway signaling. Moreover, the presence of high and low mTOR I-ASD NPCs could conceivably be dependent upon the specific type of genetic mutations present and their effect on mTOR signaling. Consistent with this possibility, all three 16pDel individuals who share the same CNV deletion have NPCs with high mTOR signaling. Ultimately, genetic analyses alone did not reveal convergence onto the mTOR pathway or alteration in the signaling milieu in our cohort. We were only able to detect our remarkably convergent mTOR deficits and alterations in signaling by utilizing p-proteomics and studying cellular signaling through western blotting, further indicating that ASD could be a disorder of intracellular signaling.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that mTOR signaling dysfunction could be a common mechanism for autism, monogenic syndromic disorders, which can exhibit ASD such as tuberous sclerosis (TSC), PTEN-associated ASD, and neurofibromatosis-1, have mutations that directly affect mTOR pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Enriquez-Barreto and Morales, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dasgupta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Winden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rangasamy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costales and Kolevzon, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, some studies of syndromic diseases where the driving mutation is not in the mTOR pathway, such as Fragile-X, Angelman, Rett syndrome, and Phelan-McDermid syndrome (22q13 deletion), also show mTOR alterations in human postmortem samples, embryonic stem cell models, and hiPSC-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Winden et al., 2018</xref>). In 16pDel, because the MAPK3 gene is deleted, both rodent and human studies have uncovered alterations in ERK1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pucilowska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pucilowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deshpande et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly for 16pDel, altered mTOR has not been reported previously. On the other hand, there are no iPSC studies of I-ASD that show mTOR abnormalities. However, recent studies in peripheral white blood cells identified mTOR signaling proteins and p-proteins as being predictors of not only ASD diagnosis but also disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Onore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rosina et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, it is unclear whether WBC mTOR alterations are sufficient to suggest that mTOR is contributing to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in these I-ASD individuals. Regardless, our study adds to the growing literature that mTOR signaling dysfunction is a shared pathogenic mechanism among different types of ASDs and raises the possibility that mTOR dysregulation could be observed commonly across multiple additional ASD subtypes. Thus, studying mTOR in multiple ASD subtypes could be important in deciphering the molecular etiology of ASD.</p><p>Of course, while mTOR seems to play an important role in multiple subtypes of ASD, numerous other signaling pathways have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD. As noted above, in 16p11.2 deletion, ERK/MAPK3 is part of the 11.2 segment and implicated in driving some of the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with the deletion and duplication syndromes. The WNT pathway, which includes CHD8 (an autism-related chromatin modifier) and beta-catenin, has long been implicated in ASD pathogenesis. The WNT pathway, much like mTOR, is thought to regulate neuronal proliferation and has been associated with macrocephalic phenotypes seen in ASD. For example, a study by Marchetto et al. found that NPCs derived from individuals with macrocephaly and I-ASD displayed excessive proliferation as well as altered WNT signaling. In our p-proteome analyses, the ERK/MAPK and PKA pathway have also been shown to be enriched. Ultimately, altered cellular signaling seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other NDDs. Importantly, our study indicates that ASD NPCs not only have enrichment of dysregulated mTOR but that mTOR dysregulation is driving autism-associated phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The mTOR pathway and EF responses</title><p>The importance of mTOR signaling was further highlighted by our small molecule gain and loss of function analyses and EF studies.

Furthermore, by changing Sib control p-S6 to ASD levels, the neurodevelopmental defects could be reproduced demonstrating that the mTOR signaling differences are mechanistically linked to the shared neurodevelopmental defects for both I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs. In addition, as one of the first studies to challenge ASD NPCs with EFs, we were able to uncover the importance of mTOR in the regulation of the signaling milieu and uncover differences between I-ASD and 16pDel in their ability to respond to EFs. Specifically, by utilizing subthreshold doses of SC-79 and MK-2206, we were able to facilitate responses to EFs in all I-ASD NPCs. These results suggest that mTOR homeostasis and ambient levels may be critical for facilitating several cellular processes including the ability for other signaling pathways to function effectively. As 16pDel NPCs had no EF response impairments, different ASD subtypes or different genetic backgrounds may have distinct thresholds for maintaining signaling homeostasis. Our studies point strongly to the importance of the signaling milieu and mTOR regulation in the control of neurodevelopment and ASD pathogenesis.</p><p>Interestingly, in I-ASD NPCs, mTOR seems to play a pivotal role in EF responsiveness. Both ‘high’ and ‘low’ I-ASD NPCs fail to respond to EFs while altering mTOR milieu with subthreshold doses of MK-2206 or SC-79 allows the I-ASD NPCs to respond to EFs. Yet, remarkably, 16pDel NPCs, which share elevated mTOR signaling with I-ASD-2 NPCs, have no deficits in EF responsiveness. This suggests that mTOR dysregulation alone is not sufficient to cause EF deficits in all NPCs. While there are several commonalities between 16pDel NPCs and I-ASD NPCs, our proteomic analyses show that there are significant differences as well. Specifically, the I-ASD p-proteome has 38 differently phosphorylated proteins that are not shared with the 16pDel and the 16pDel p-proteome has 351 differently phosphorylated proteins not shared with the I-ASD NPCs. Analysis of these ‘differently’ expressed p-proteins show that I-ASD NPCs seem to have dysregulation in tight junction signaling as well as in proteins such as spectrin and ankyrin which are essential to appropriate stabilization of membrane proteins (such as signaling receptors) to the underlying cytoskeleton. Thus, it is possible that interaction of mTOR defects with tight junction/anchoring molecules lead to the lack of responses to numerous EFs (all of which work on different receptor systems). We have not conducted specific studies into the difference between I-ASD and 16pDel when it comes to EF responsiveness, though the p-proteome results provide the above tantalizing clues which could be focused on in future research. Regardless, the most interesting point is that despite many commonalities, I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs do not share the EF unresponsiveness phenotype, though for I-ASD NPCs, EF responsiveness can be altered by targeting mTOR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>EF responses and ASD</title><p>In the developing brain, EFs regulate basic developmental processes like neurite outgrowth and migration and alterations in EFs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Otto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hashimoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cameron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lu and DiCicco-Bloom, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yan et al., 2013b</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DiCicco-Bloom, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nicot and DiCicco-Bloom, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Korsching et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rajakumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lazar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Temple and Qian, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Speranza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boukhris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Veenstra-VanderWeele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we selected three EFs, PACAP, NGF, and 5-HT, known to be expressed during the ‘critical window’ of mid-fetal development, with well-established roles in regulation of early neurodevelopmental phenotypes to stimulate I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs in both our neurite outgrowth and neurosphere assays to assess for ASD-specific response differences. Strikingly, NPCs derived from all three idiopathic patients are unresponsive to all three EFs tested, while all the unaffected patient NPCs had increased neurite outgrowth or migration in response to EFs. Such differential response to EFs has been noted in previous work in our lab on the Engrailed-2 KO model of developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rossman et al., 2014</xref>). Though studies are limited, further exploration may show that differential responses to regulatory molecules may be a characteristic of some types of developmental disorders. Indeed, meta-analyses have found that about 30% of children with ASD have elevations in blood 5-HT. This increased 5-HT could be due to dysregulated 5-HT production, enhanced uptake, impaired clearance, or a compensatory response to decreased sensitivity to 5-HT in the ASD brain. At the same time, our studies found that unlike I-ASD NPCs, 16pDel NPCs have a typical response to all three EFs with increases in neurite outgrowth and migration. Response to EFs could also have implications for the treatment of individuals with ASD, for example, SSRI are commonly used to treat comorbid depression/anxiety in ASD, but if these individuals have neural cells that are less responsive to 5-HT, this treatment could be less effective, though further research is needed to understand whether NPC responses to EFs/drugs correlate with drug responses in the individual. In sum, while different subtypes of ASD can have common underlying neurobiology, there are subtypes or perhaps even patient-specific differences in the defects seen in ASD. By conducting experiments with EFs we were able to find two distinct subgroups of ASD which would not have been apparent if we had conducted our experiments in control conditions alone, showing the utility of studying patient-derived cells under different conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Subtyping ASD</title><p>The heterogeneity of ASD, the subjective nature of clinical categorization, and the current inability to stratify and subtype the disorder have been postulated as reasons for the decades of unsuccessful clinical trials in ASD. Effectively subtyping ASD would help us uncover the multiple pathways through which ASD can manifest in different individuals, allow us to take a more ‘personalized’ approach to etiological studies, and could help us understand which therapeutics would be best suited to certain ASD subpopulations. As our study is one of the first to compare two disparate forms of ASD, it has given us insight into both convergent and personalized phenotypes in ASD populations.</p><p>Despite common neurodevelopmental phenotypes, both a ‘low’ and ‘high’ mTOR signaling subtype is present in our ASD NPCs. This phenomenon of ‘too much’ or ‘too little’ of a pathway or gene leading to similar outcomes has been seen before in MECP-2 gain and loss of function as well as in Timothy syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Peters et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ramocki et al., 2010</xref>). Our gain and loss of function studies showed that mTOR dysfunction drives impaired neurodevelopment. Thus, characterizing ASD by mTOR levels could help us identify which groups may be candidates for mTOR activators vs inhibitors in future drug trials. Another subtype-specific difference was that I-ASD individuals failed to respond to EFs while 16pDel ASD individuals had typical increases in neurites and migration under EF stimulation. This difference in EF response did not correlate with the mTOR defects. Specifically, both I-ASD-2 and 16pDel had ‘high’ mTOR signaling but only I-ASD-2 failed to respond to EFs, indicating that our EF studies help us glean more information than molecular studies alone. While there are no medications that target the core symptoms of ASD, we do use drugs that modulate monoamines such as serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine to manage certain behavioral symptoms in ASD. Furthermore, comorbid conditions such as depression are common in ASD and notoriously difficult to treat with our usual medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, understanding whether certain subtypes of ASD are responsive to EFs like 5-HT or even medications by using iPSC-derived cells may help us better tailor treatments for ASD and its comorbid conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Study limitations and future directions</title><p>Our study is one of the first to show the remarkable convergence of neurodevelopmental and molecular phenotypes in two distinct autism subtypes using rigorous methods such as utilization of multiple iPSC clones and neural inductions. The extensive rigor of our analyses that included a total of 29 distinct iPSC clones and 61 distinct neural inductions lends to relatively small sample sizes (though similar to other iPSC studies) with only six autism probands, three of each subtype. Thus, it is difficult to know whether our observed phenotypes are generalizable to all individuals with 16pDel, I-ASD, or other ASDs. However, it is important to note that our sample had significant clinical and genotypic heterogeneity yet, we could still uncover common phenotypes. Expanding our study design to other subtypes of ASD or other NDDs would help establish if common underlying mechanisms could be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gandal et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While our studies reveal important alterations in early neurodevelopment in ASD, our monolayer NPC studies do not recapitulate the 3D nature or complex interactions occurring in the developing brain. Moreover, as hiPSC-derived NPCS are most similar to fetal cortical radial glial cells, the phenotypes observed in our dishes may not directly parallel the structural or functional defects in the ASD brain. Neuropathological studies of ASD have indicated brain defects suggestive of dysregulated development. However, studies have not been conducted to determine whether, for example, a defect in migration in ASD iPSC-derived NPCs is correlated with altered cortical lamination in the patient from whom the cells were derived. To understand this, MRI and postmortem analyses need to be conducted to correlate iPSC results with neuropathological alterations. Interestingly, an iPSC study of ASD patients with MRI-defined macrocephaly found that affected NPCs proliferated faster than control NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marchetto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Connacher et al., 2022b</xref>), suggesting correlation between structural MRI and NPC phenotypes.</p><p>Our data potentially suggests that mTOR could serve as a target to employ precision medicine techniques in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sato, 2016</xref>). However, given that NPCs that are fetal in nature, it is unclear whether targeting mTOR in a child or adult would treat disease phenotypes. Importantly, however, we know that signaling pathways such as mTOR continue to play roles in the postnatal and adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pagani et al., 2021</xref>). For example, mTOR is critical for the regulation of processes such as the moment-to-moment modification of dendritic spines which are essential to learning, memory, and integration of information in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ganesan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nicolini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tordjman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henry et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that mTOR defects, which in the prenatal period leads to altered neurites or migration, could in the adult brain cause altered dendritic functioning and plasticity which could consequently lead to behavioral symptoms of ASD. As such, targeting mTOR in the adult brain could alleviate ASD symptoms. Preclinical mouse models of Rett syndrome support this concept, as treatment of adult animals with mTOR-activating IGF-1 reduced anxiety levels and increased exploratory behaviors, suggesting that targeting mTOR can have an effect outside of the fetal developmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castro et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, clinical trials of IGF-1 in children with Rett syndrome and rapamycin in children with TSC have not thus far had promising effects on behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Khwaja et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sahin M, 2018b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sahin M, 2018a</xref>). While early neurodevelopmental processes may no longer be occurring in the postnatal brain, studying NPCs can provide insight into the initial processes that contribute to ASD pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient cohorts</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Idiopathic autism (I-ASD)</title><p>I-ASD patients were selected from a larger cohort of 85 New Jersey families recruited by the Brzustowicz laboratory as part of the New Jersey Language and Autism Genetics Study (NJLAGS).

At least 150 cells were counted per dish and the proportion of cells with neurites was calculated in each dish.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Neurosphere migration assay</title><p>Neurospheres were formed by dissociating confluent NPCs and plating 1 million cells into uncoated 35 mm dishes with 100 NEM. No small molecules or EFs were added during this formation step. NPCs were then incubated at 37°C for 24–96 hr (varied from line to line) to allow aggregation into neurospheres. Sphere size was assessed daily using a live-ruler on a phase contrast microscope. When a majority of spheres reached an approximate diameter of 100 μm (±20 μm), the migration assay was performed.</p><p>To coat plates, a Matrigel aliquot was dissolved into 6 mL of ice-cold 30 NEM. Appropriate vehicles and EFs were added to the 30 NEM/Matrigel mixture as desired. For migration the following EFs and small molecule inhibitors were used as noted above in the neurite section (PACAP, SC-79, MK-2206). Then, 1 mL of the 30 NEM/Matrix ± EF mixture was added into the six-well plate. Plates were then incubated for 30 min at 37°C. While plates were incubating, neurospheres were collected from the 35 mm dishes and placed into a 15 mL conical tube. The tube was centrifuged at 100×<italic>g</italic> and the pelleted spheres were gently resuspended using a P1000 in 1–3 mL of pre-warmed 30 NEM (with appropriate concentration of EF or small molecule added). 200 μL of the sphere suspension was then placed into the 30 NEM Matrigel plates. Spheres were allowed to migrate for 48 hr and were fixed for 30 min in 4% PFA, washed, and stored in PBS + 0.05% sodium azide.</p><p>Neurospheres were imaged at 10× on a phase contrast microscope. At least 15 neurospheres across all dishes were imaged per condition. Spheres that were not in contact with another exhibited a contiguous migrating cell carpet and intact inner cell mass were imaged. Average migration was measured using ImageJ. To measure migration, the outer contour of a neurosphere was traced using the freehand line tool and the enclosed area was measured. Then, the inner cell mass area was measured. Migration was quantified by subtracting the inner cell mass area from the total neurosphere area. At least 15 neurospheres were analyzed per condition. Exclusion criteria are detailed in JOVE methods paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Williams et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given that neurospheres are not the same size when plated, it was important to ensure that initial sphere size (ISS) did not affect migration. As such, proof of principal tests were conducted to assess if ISS influenced migration. Migration and ISS data were obtained from each ‘diagnosis’ group (Sib, NIH, I-ASD, 16pASD) over two experiments with 15 neurospheres each. Linear modeling was conducted in R studio utilizing the basic equation lm(Migration~ISS±diagnosis) where ‘lm’ allows R to conduct linear modeling, ~ allows for R to calculate the relationship between migration and ISS utilizing any variables and data specified. Results of these analyses and others are found in the supplement, but ultimately, these studies showed us that the ISS did not affect migration, whereas diagnosis did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, for all remaining neurosphere studies, ISS was not factored into analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blot</title><p>To collect protein, confluent NPCs were dissociated, pelleted, and plated onto PDL + Fibronectin-coated plates with 1 mL 30 NEM. 1 million NPCs were plated in 35 mm dishes and incubated for 48 hr at 37°C. At 48 hr, cells were treated with vehicle or drug (SC-79 or MK-2206) for 20 or 30 min. Then, dishes were washed with ice-cold PBS two times. Cells were then lysed by adding 30 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer/dish and scraping with cell scraper. Lysate was then sonicated 2× for 1 min on ice and then samples were centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and saved while the pellet was discarded. Protein was aliquoted and stored at –80°C.</p><p>For small molecule drugs utilized (SC-79 and MK-2206), studies in other cellular systems had shown appropriate increase and reduction in p-S6, respectively, with drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Simioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Somnay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Luan et al., 2018</xref>). However, at the time of our studies, there had been no published papers showing the effects of these drugs on human NPCs. As such, our initial studies with these molecules involved confirming the effect of SC-79 and MK-2206 on p-AKT and p-S6 levels in our NPCs. We initially focused our studies on two I-ASD pairs, Family-1 in which I-ASD NPCs had reduced p-S6 levels and Family-2 in which I-ASD NPCs had increased p-S6 levels. We trialed multiple concentrations (SC-79: 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, 3, 10 µg/mL, MK-2206, 0.3, 1 3, 10, 30, 100 nM) of each small molecule drug as well as multiple time points (5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr) to arrive at the doses and 20 and 30 min stimulation paradigm applied in this manuscript (data not shown). Given thorough testing in these two families we were able to clearly establish that SC-79 increases both p-AKT and p-S6 and MK-2206 decreases both p-AKT and p-S6 in Sib-1, I-ASD-1, Sib-2, and I-ASD-2. As such, in the other NPCs (Family-3, 16pDel and NIH), we did not conduct rigorous tests with these small molecules.</p><p>Aliquoted samples were thawed and 20 μg of protein was mixed with appropriate volumes of 4× NuPAGE LDS Sample buffer and 10× NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent. All immunoblotting reagents were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Samples were boiled, cooled, and loaded into wells on a 12% SDS-PAGE poly-acrylamide gel. The samples were run at 100 V for 1.5 hr in an electrophoresis apparatus with 1× NuPAGE Mops SDS Running Buffer. Protein was then transferred to a PVDF membrane using a wet transfer apparatus with 1× NuPAGE Transfer buffer. The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with Tween 20 (0.1%) (TBS-T) and blocked with 5% powdered milk in 0.1% TBS-T. Then, membranes were probed for proteins with the following antibodies used at a 1:2000 concentration and incubated overnight at 4°C: S6 (2317, Cell Signaling), p-S6 (2211, Cell Signaling) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Genestine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yan et al., 2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mairet-Coello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mairet-Coello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tury et al., 2011</xref>). GADPH was used as a loading control and was probed with antibody (Meridian Life Sciences, H86045M) at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 hr. After incubation at 1°C, membrane was washed and appropriate HRP-conjugated 2°C antibody was applied at a 1:1000 concentration for all antibodies except GAPDH, for which 2°C antibody was at 1:5000. Then, ECL was applied to membranes for 1 min and membrane was applied to medical grade X-ray film. For most experiments, two gels were loaded with identical protein samples and then each gel was transferred to a separate membrane. For experiments requiring fewer samples, a single gel was run and then cut in half prior to transfer. Multiple wells were loaded, often with protein from different clones and different neural inductions. While each of these gels had identical samples loaded, one gel was utilized to probe for all phospho-proteins and the other for total protein to avoid stripping and to decrease background signal. Membranes were often probed with multiple antibodies. Each primary was incubated on its own for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, followed by the appropriate secondary and ECL steps. Film exposure time varied by antibody and often multiple films were exposed to chemiluminescent bands and then the films that were not over or undersaturated were selected for scanning into JPEG. After the above process was completed for one antibody of interest, the film was washed for 1 hr with TBS and then reprobed with another primary antibody. Often, the first antibody utilized was the one that had the weakest signal. For our experiments the order of antibodies was as follows: p-AKT, p-S6, and then GAPDH. Scanned films were then quantified on ImageJ. Band intensities for phospho- and total protein were normalized to signals for GAPDH. The GAPDH-normalized phospho-antibody intensity was divided by the GAPDH-normalized total antibody to get a relative protein intensity.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Generation of western blot representative images</title><p>For generation of representative images, X-ray films were scanned into PDF files. PDF files were then converted to JPEGs which were loaded into Adobe Photoshop 2022. Grayscale was applied for enhanced visibility and equivalent brightness and contrast were applied to all blots used in the same figure on the same scan. In most instances, the rectangular marquee tool was used to select either individual lanes or several lanes (depending on whether originals were appropriate contiguous or not). Then the copy function was used to make a copy of the selected area and lanes were placed together as needed for generation of representative images. In some cases, for figures where lanes were appropriately spaced, the delete function was used to remove lanes not needed in the figure and then remainder of image was cropped to make representative blots. No size alterations were made to individual bands, no brightness contrast function was applied to individual bands, and no other editing was made to individual bands other than cropping. Unedited images of the representative blots have been made available for comparison.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Phospho-proteome</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Protein collection</title><p>As described above, protein was collected from NPCs plated on 0.1 mg/mL PDL+5 μg/mL FN at a density of 1 million in 35 mm dishes for 48 hr. At least 1.5 mg of protein was collected per individual for p-proteomics. On average, 50–150 μg of protein was acquired from one dish of 1 million cells. Thus, to acquire 1.5 mg of protein, samples of protein were pooled from multiple experiments over time. For final samples, protein was collected from three to four experiments (of three to five dishes) across three different passages and two different neural inductions to ensure adequate sample and to account for variability. Samples were frozen at –80°C after each collection and then ultimately thawed, pooled, and sonicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Proteomic analysis</title><p>500 µg of each lysate from above were digested using standard FASTP protocol while 450 µg of each sample was labeled with <underline>TMT10</underline> plex reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and combined after labeling and dried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mertins et al., 2013</xref>). TMT labeled and combined sample were desalted with SPEC C18 column and solubilized in 200 µL of buffer A (20 mm ammonium formate, pH 10) and separated on an Xbridge column (Waters; C18; 3.5 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup>) using a linear gradient of 1% B min<sup>−1</sup>, then from 2% to 45% B (20 mm ammonium formate in 90% acetonitrile, pH 10) at a flow rate of 200 µL/min using Agilent HP1100. Fractions were collected at 1 min intervals and dried under vacuum. For total proteome analysis, 14 fractions (fraction from 27 to 40 min) were chosen. 5% of each fraction were desalted with stage tip and analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS. For p-proteomics, fractions were combined in concatenate style to make six fractions.</p><p>IMAC enrichment of phosphopeptides was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mertins et al., 2013</xref>, with modifications. Ion-chelated IMAC beads were prepared from Ni-NTA Superflow agarose beads (QIAGEN, MA, USA). Nickel ion was stripped with 50 mM EDTA and iron was chelated by passing the beads through aqueous solution of 200 mM FeCl<sub>3</sub> followed by three times of water wash and one time wash with binding buffer (40% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid). Combined HPH RP fractions were solubilized in binding buffer and incubated with IMAC beads for 1 hr. After three times of wash with binding buffer, the phosphopeptides were eluted with 2× beads volume of 500 mM potassium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.0, and the eluate was neutralized with 10% formic acid. The enriched phosphopeptides were further desalted by Empore 3M C18 (2215) StageTip<sup>2</sup> prior to nanoLC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>Nano-LC-MS/MS was performed using a Dionex rapid separation liquid chromatography system interfaced with a QExactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 trap column (75 µm × 2 cm, Thermo Fisher) and washed with Buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 5 min with a flow rate of 5 µL/min. The trap was brought in-line with the nano analytical column (nanoEase, MZ peptide BEH C18, 130A, 1.7 µm, 75 µm×20 cm, Waters) with flow rate of 300 nL/min with a multistep gradient. Mass spectrometry data were acquired using a data-dependent acquisition procedure with a cyclic series of a full scan acquired with a resolution of 120,000 followed by tandem mass spectrometry (<underline>MS/MS</underline>) scans (30% collision energy in the HCD cell) with resolution of 30,000 of the 20 most intense ions with dynamic exclusion duration of 20 s.</p><p>For both proteome and p-proteome studies, Maxquant identification and Perseus for quantitation were employed and an in-house R program that compounds variability at each level of the analysis (spectra to peptides, peptides to proteins, proteins per experimental group) was utilized to determine statistical significance. Specifically, significance for group comparisons used Student’s t-tests with equal variance on both sites and q-values will be calculated using a 5% false discovery rate. Volcano plots were generated to illustrate individual peptides and p-peptides that are different between ASD cases and controls. Both statistically significant differences (p-value ≤ 0.05/number of observations after Bonferroni correction) and &gt;2-fold differences peptide amounts will be denoted. As such initial data included over 9700 proteins, however, to appropriately adjust for multiple comparisons we only selected proteins which met the criteria of significance threshold greater than log p of 5 for further analyses. This analysis was performed between: I-ASD vs Sib controls, 16p-Del vs Sib controls, and I-ASD vs 16pDel NPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>G-profiler analysis</title><p>Our p-proteomic dataset, which included UniProt Identifiers and comparisons of fold changes relative to control (Sib), were submitted into the system. The specific tool utilized was g: GOSt which performs statistical enrichment analysis to interpret a user-provided gene list. The data provided users multiple sources of functional evidence including Gene Ontology (GO) terms, biological pathways, regulatory motifs of transcription factors and microRNAs, human disease annotations, and protein-protein interactions. For analysis, g:Profiler allows users to set preferences on statistical domain scope, significance threshold, and user threshold. Briefly, for the statistical domain scope, the program was tasked to look through all known genes, allowing for calculation of statistical significance considering all genes of the human genome in the Ensembl database. Next, for the significance threshold the g:SCS algorithm was used, which sets an experiment-wide threshold of p = 0.05. Finally, the user-defined p-value threshold allows for further filtering of results; this threshold was also set to p = 0.05. As a readout of the results, the program looks at GO, which is a bioinformatics initiative that defines biological functions and their relationship to one another. The three major subontologies are molecular functions, gene products functions, biological process, which describes biological processes the gene product participates in, and cellular component, describes in which part of the cell the gene product is physically located.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis</title><p>Our phospho- and total proteomic dataset, which included UniProt Identifiers, p-values, q-values, and log2 ratios of comparisons of fold changes of identified phosphorylated proteins relative to Sib, were submitted into IPA for core analysis.

The core analysis generated molecular networks according to biological as well as molecular functions including canonical pathways, disease-based functions, and upstream regulatory analysis for the discovery of strongly differential molecules in our dataset. Both direct and indirect relationship between molecules based on experimentally observed data and data sources were considered in human databases in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Right-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the probability that biological functions and/or diseases were over-represented in the protein dataset. Z-scores compiled as a statistical result of differential protein expression according to the fold changes were also compiled.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Compilation of data and statistical analyses</title><p>Data acquired from the idiopathic autism individuals were compared to data acquired from unaffected Sibs. Data was compiled and organized in several ways. Comparisons were made within Family (Sib-1 vs ASD-1), across families (Sib-1 vs ASD-2), or as an average of all Sib (three patients, all clones) compared to the average data from all idiopathic ASD (three patients, all clones). For every neurite experiment, two to three dishes were set up per condition. For every migration condition, 20–30 spheres were evaluated per condition. Dishes were kept as separate N-values. For example, when compiling data for Sib-1 in control condition, all neurite dishes from every clone were averaged together to get a mean neurite value for this individual but SEM was calculated utilizing each dish as a separate ‘N’ value. For spheres, each neurosphere was considered a separate statistical point. Migration values from each sphere derived from multiple clones were averaged together to acquire an average migration value for each patient. Spheres were also analyzed by clone. For the 16p11.2, data was compared to composite averages of the Sibs (dishes from all three Sib patients and all clones) or averages of the NIMH controls (dishes from both patients, all neural inductions). Assuming statistical normality, in comparisons that include only two groups, unpaired t-test was used to test differences in affected vs unaffected samples. Simple unpaired or paired t-tests were run in Microsoft Excel. If normality assumption was not satisfied, the non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used in GraphPad Prism 8. The presence of multiple ASD subtypes and the use of EFs lead to instances where multiple group comparison is necessary. For such cases, in normal data, analysis of variance or ANOVA (one or two way) was used to detect statistical significance. To reduce type I error, p-values for the ANOVAs were calculated using Tukey correction in GraphPad Prism 8. If normality assumption did not hold, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tabulation of neural precursor cell (NPC) N-values for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>.</title><p>In each cell, multiple different kinds of N-values are represented: # of clones (C)/Total # of neural inductions (NI)/# of experiments (E) and for neurite experiments, # of dishes (D) whereas for neurospheres experiment, # of neurospheres (NS).</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-82809-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Alternative allele genotypes in the chr16.p11.2 deletion region in three I-ASD families.</title><p>The count of the heterozygous and homozygous alternative allele genotypes and their ratio in the chr16.p11.2 deletion region (chr16: 28,500,001–35,300,000).

Our western process was generally as follows: gels were loaded with protein of interest and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. We loaded the same protein samples onto two separate gels: Gel 1 would be transferred to a PVDF membrane that would be probed with antibodies against phospho-protein (i.e. P-S6) while Gel 2 would be transferred to a PVDF membrane that would be probed with antibodies against total proteins (ie S6). For each membrane, multiple antibody probes were often used without any stripping (For example, membrane 1 would be probed sequentially for P-S6, P-AKT, and GAPDH). Once antibody incubations were completed, ECL solution was utilized so that the chemiluminescent signal could be detected utilizing X-ray films. Multiple film exposures were conducted per membrane to produce appropriately saturated bands per antibody of interest. For example, we would develop one film for P-S6 and another film for GAPDH. For representative images and quantification, films were then scanned into JPEG images. From these JPEGs, as can be seen, there are often multiple lanes with multiple clones and neural inductions loaded. As such, to make representative images, especially in cases where contiguous bands were not present, we utilized the cropping function to cut out the lanes of interest used these separate lanes to construct the figures. We have added a section on generation of these representative images in our methods section as well. We will also include all PDFs of unedited Western Blots in Dryad with and without labels and descriptions of displayed lanes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide all data points in figures.</p></disp-quote><p>With the exception of Figure 3A &amp;D as well as Figure 7 we have restructured all our graphs (specifically in Figures 5&amp;6) to now include each individual data point to match with all our other figures. What each individual point represents is clearly delineated in our supplemental table (Table 1). For Figure 3A&amp;D, proteome canonical pathway enrichments did not have multiple replicates and as such were not made as a scatter. For figure 7 we attempted to convert to a scatter model, however, given the complexity of the figure, we felt the circles could not be adequately seen and they made the figure excessively busy.

However, the focus of the current paper is on the surprising discovery of mTOR dysregulation in both idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion NPCs despite limited genetic overlap. Moreover, we found that regardless of genotype, these mTOR changes are mechanistically linked to the common developmental phenotypes we noted in these individuals as well. We are greatly interested in the PS6 and mTOR phenotype of the remaining idiopathic cohort. Indeed with our collaborator/coauthor Dr. James Millonig we will next study the presence of neurite, migration, and mTOR dysregulation as a feature of ASD, not only in the remaining 5 idiopathic lines, but also in genetically defined syndromes including FXS, TSC, 16p11.2 duplication, and 22q11.2 deletion and compare those with ASD to those without ASD, research now supported by a recent Department of Defense IDA grant funded in 2022. The NPCs currently studied were randomly selected from the larger cohort of 8 and all of these individuals had cryopreserved T-lymphocytes. Multiple iPSC clones were generated and selected for each of the 16 individuals (ASD and Sibs) and then cryopreserved. For the 3 families we selected in our studies, iPSC clones were thawed, passaged 10 times in order to ensure loss of Sendai virus and attain stability, and expanded sufficiently to obtain adequate cells for our studies. Furthermore, NPC induction, which often took several iterations to get healthy NPCs, was performed multiple times for each clone. The NPCs then also needed to be passaged and expanded, particularly for western studies to generate adequate protein to run multiple western studies. This task would likely take a year or more and given that it does not fully adhere to the scope of our paper, we will address this important next step in future work funded by the new grant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please cite the paper on Timothy Syndrome (Birey et al. 2022, Cell Stem Cell).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this citation as an example of how bimodal perturbations in signaling pathways can converge upon common deficits in cellular migration.

The separate cropping was due to how we ran our experiments and selected the lanes for presentation in the manuscript. For example, in some blots we ran several clones, or several neural inductions together and then selected the most “representative” lanes for the figures, leading to the separately cropped lanes displayed. Of course, all bands for all groups that were analyzed in multiple experiments were included for statistical analyses. To address this concern, we have re-made all the western figures such that more of the background of the blots is visible leading to a more seamless and less “disjointed” crop; we also selected lanes that were closer in proximity to each other while preserving the message we were trying to represent. Furthermore, we now also provide all the raw images of the westerns along with a PDF document “key” describing each image. Lastly, we apologize for not clearly describing how we ran and processed our western samples, which has now been addressed above. We have edited the Materials and methods section to more clearly describe this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I would caution the use of the term &quot;autism deficits&quot; and &quot;autism phenotypes&quot; as used in the first paragraph of Discussion.

We appreciate this reviewer comment ensuring rigor of data acquisition and analysis. We presume the reviewer expects to see, for example, multiples lanes of each group sample, such as I-ASD-1, in immediate sequence, so that one can compare 3 – 5 lanes of I-ASD-1 samples together to look for intragroup variability, and then compare to another similar group of samples. However, because different combinations of multiple families, clones, and neural inductions were performed in parallel over time, we performed westerns in ongoing fashion, rather than storing samples for years and processing them together in a single huge western. This was done so we could know possible outcomes and plan future clonal productions and neural inductions over time. As can be seen in the newly provided unprocessed raw westerns, blots included a mixture of experiments using small groups of different samples (Sib; ASD; NIH; 16p) that would make their complete display confusing to appreciate. But as requested, we have re-made all the western figures and provided all unedited blot images which do give some sense of replicate data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even though most plots show individual data points, a few plots do not Figure 5,6I-J.
