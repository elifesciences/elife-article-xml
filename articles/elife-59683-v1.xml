neurological diseases, but translation into tractable biological mechanisms is lagging. Larval zebrafish are an attractive model to investigate genetic contributions to neurological diseases. However, current CRISPR-Cas9 methods are difficult to apply to large genetic screens studying behavioural phenotypes. To facilitate rapid genetic screening, we developed a simple sequencing-free tool to validate gRNAs and a highly effective CRISPR-Cas9 method capable of converting &gt;90% of injected embryos directly into F0 biallelic knockouts. We demonstrate that F0 knockouts reliably recapitulate complex mutant phenotypes, such as altered molecular rhythms of the circadian clock, escape responses to irritants, and multi-parameter day-night locomotor behaviours. The technique is sufficiently robust to knockout multiple genes in the same animal, for example to create the transparent triple knockout <italic>crystal</italic> fish for imaging. Our F0 knockout method cuts the experimental time from gene to behavioural phenotype in zebrafish from months to one week.</p></abstract><kwd-group

are uncovering hundreds of gene variants associated with neurological and psychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease. To validate these associations, understand disease aetiology, and eventually inform therapeutic strategies, these genetic associations need to be understood in terms of biological mechanisms. A common approach is to mutate candidate disease genes in cultured cells or animal models. The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) is an attractive <italic>in vivo</italic> model for genetic screens in neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thyme et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, more than 75% of disease-associated genes have an orthologue in the zebrafish genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howe et al., 2013</xref>), optical translucence allows for whole brain imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>), and behavioural phenotypes can be robustly quantified early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>). However, the pace at which new genetic associations are being identified currently far outstrips our ability to build a functional understanding <italic>in vivo</italic>. In zebrafish, a key limiting factor is the time and space needed to generate animals harbouring a mutation in the gene of interest.</p><p>Genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionised our ability to generate zebrafish mutant lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>). The common strategy is to inject a Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into the single-cell embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sorlien et al., 2018</xref>). The gRNA binds to the targeted region of the genome and Cas9 produces a double-strand break. When joining the two ends, DNA repair mechanisms may introduce an indel by inserting or deleting bases in the target locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brinkman et al., 2018</xref>). Indels often disrupt protein function, either by mutating sequences that encode essential residues or by introducing a frameshift that leads to a premature stop codon and a truncated, non-functional protein. With this tool, virtually any locus in the zebrafish genome can be disrupted. However, homozygous mutants are only obtained after two generations of adult animals, which typically takes four to six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sorlien et al., 2018</xref>). This bottleneck places substantial constraints on genetic screens in terms of time, costs, and ethical limits on animal numbers.</p><p>Genetic screens would be greatly facilitated by reliably generating biallelic knockouts directly in the injected embryos, termed the F0 generation. The main hurdle is to introduce a deleterious mutation in most or all copies of the genome without causing non-specific phenotypic consequences. Since the first applications of CRISPR-Cas9 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>), meticulous optimisation of design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-Mateos et al., 2015</xref>), preparation, and delivery of the RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burger et al., 2016</xref>) has improved mutagenesis consistently enough to allow the successful use of zebrafish F0 knockouts in screens for visible developmental phenotypes, such as cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), formation of electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shah et al., 2015</xref>), or distribution of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuil et al., 2019</xref>). In these applications, disrupting a single locus may be adequate as incomplete removal of wild-type alleles does not impair detection of the phenotype. For example, mutants with an overt developmental defect can be identified even in heterogenous populations where some animals are not complete knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burger et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, certain phenotypes may be manifest in an animal in which only a subset of the cells carry mutant alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shah et al., 2015</xref>). However, incomplete conversion into null alleles is potentially problematic when studying traits that vary continuously, especially if the spread of phenotypic values is already substantial in wild-type animals, which is regularly the case for behavioural parameters. Animals in the experimental pool retaining variable levels of wild-type alleles will create overlap between the mutant and wild-type distributions of phenotypic values, reducing the likelihood of robustly distinguishing a mutant phenotype. To ensure a high proportion of null alleles, an alternative strategy is to increase the probability of a frameshift by targeting the gene at multiple loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshijima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sunagawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>). Because rounds of DNA breaks and repair usually occur across multiple cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenna et al., 2016</xref>), different F0 animals, cells, or copies of the genome can harbour different null alleles. Targeting multiple loci inflates this diversity of alleles, which is perceived as a potential obstacle for rigorously describing complex phenotypes in F0 knockouts, particularly behavioural ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teboul et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We present a simple CRISPR-Cas9 method to generate zebrafish F0 knockouts suitable for studying behaviour and other continuous traits. The protocol uses a set of three synthetic gRNAs per gene, combining multi-locus targeting with high mutagenesis at each locus. The method consistently converts &gt; 90% of injected embryos into biallelic knockouts that show fully penetrant pigmentation phenotypes and near complete absence of wild-type alleles in deep sequencing data. In parallel, we developed a quick and cheap PCR-based tool to validate gRNAs whatever the nature of the mutant alleles. The F0 knockout protocol is easily adapted to generate biallelic mutations in up to three genes in individual animals. The populations of F0 knockout animals generated by the method are suitable for quantitative analysis of complex phenotypes, as demonstrated by mutation of a circadian clock component and by meticulous replication of multi-parameter behavioural phenotypes of a genetic model of epilepsy.</p><p>Using standard genetic approaches, the gap from gene to behavioural phenotype in zebrafish often takes half a year. Our F0 knockout method enables this in a week. We believe these methodological improvements will greatly facilitate the use of zebrafish to tackle genetic questions in neuroscience, such as those addressing the contributions of disease-associated genes to nervous system development, circuit function, and behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three synthetic gRNAs per gene achieve over 90% biallelic knockouts in F0</title><p>What are the requirements for a zebrafish F0 knockout method applicable to large genetic screens studying continuous traits? First, it needs to be quick and reliable. Most techniques so far have used <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed gRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription often necessitates the substitutions of nucleotides in the 5'-end of gRNAs, and this can hamper mutagenesis by introducing mismatches with the target locus. Commercial synthetic gRNAs circumvent this limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshijima et al., 2019</xref>). Second, it needs to be readily applicable to any open-reading frame. Some protocols suggest targeting each gene with one or two synthetic gRNAs designed to target essential domains of the encoded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshijima et al., 2019</xref>). This strategy requires detailed knowledge of each target, which is likely to be lacking in large genetic screens investigating poorly annotated genes. Third, the method must consistently convert most injected embryos into F0 biallelic knockouts, leaving few or no wild-type alleles within each animal. Complete conversion into null alleles may not be a primary requirement for detection of discrete or overt phenotypes but is a priority when studying continuous traits.</p><p>To fulfil these criteria, we chose to maximise the probability of introducing a frameshift by optimising mutagenesis at multiple loci over each gene, as in theory this is a universal knockout mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a simple theoretical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) where frameshift is the sole knockout mechanism and the probability of mutation at each target locus is over 80%, targeting the gene at three to four loci is predicted to be sufficient to routinely achieve over 90% biallelic knockout probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While targeting extra loci would increase this probability further, minimising the number of unique RNPs injected reduces both costs and potential off-target effects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Three synthetic gRNAs per gene achieve over 90% biallelic knockouts in F0.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the F0 knockout strategy.

Additionally, Slc24a5 and Tyr act cell-autonomously, so any unpigmented cells within the eye carries a biallelic null mutation. To generate F0 embryos, we injected at the one-cell stage RNPs (Cas9 protein/synthetic crRNA:tracrRNA duplex) targeting one to four loci per gene. To estimate phenotypic penetrance, eye pigmentation was scored at 2 dpf on a scale from 1 (completely devoid of pigment, i.e. fully penetrant) to 5 (dark as wild types, i.e. no penetrance). The larvae were then followed until 5–6 dpf to quantify any reduced viability in the injected animals, reported as the sum of dead or dysmorphic embryos.

However, the proportion of alleles harbouring a frameshift mutation is not sufficient alone to generate the high phenotypic penetrance we observed. For example, of the larvae injected with three RNPs targeting <italic>slc24a5</italic> or <italic>tyr</italic>, 3/6 had less than 90% alleles with a frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), but phenotypic penetrance was consistently &gt; 94% (score 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). There are multiple reasons why the proportion of alleles carrying a frameshift mutation is a conservative underestimate of null alleles. First, mutations of residues at key domains of the protein can be sufficient for loss of function. Second, large indels may disrupt the sequencing PCR primers' binding sites, preventing amplification of such alleles. Third, the pooled RNPs may also lead to deletion of large sequences that span two loci being targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshijima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Zhang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-Mateos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). To test the latter possibility, we Sanger sequenced amplicons from regions that span multiple targeted loci within <italic>slc24a5</italic>. We identified clear instances where the gene underwent a large deletion between two targeted sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). As large deletions are highly likely to prevent the expression of a functional protein, they further affirm the efficacy of the three-RNP strategy.</p><p>Mutations at off-target loci are a potential concern when using Cas9. We sequenced the top three predicted off-targets in protein-coding exons for each of the three gRNAs of the <italic>slc24a5</italic> set, for a total of nine off-targets. There were essentially no mutated reads (&lt; 0.5%) at all but one off-target, for which mutated reads ranged between 15–54% (n = 4 larvae) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Importantly, 3/4 larvae had few or no reads with a frameshift mutation at this site (0%, 0%, 1.8%), while the fourth had 42% reads with a frameshift mutation. Of the 9 off-targets, the mutated off-target had the lowest number of mismatches with the gRNA binding sequence (2 mismatches vs 3–4 for the other 8 off-target loci) and the worst off-target risk (predicted score of 58 vs 59–87 for the other 8 off-target loci), indicating that mutations may be relatively predictable. These levels of mutagenesis at a single locus are unlikely to be sufficient to produce consistently high proportions of biallelic null alleles, either in individual animals or at the level of the population of F0 mutants. Hence, we do not consider mutations at off-targets to be a major concern in applications where a population of F0 knockout animals is phenotyped.</p><p>Overall, our simple protocol involving three synthetic RNPs at 1:1 Cas9 to gRNA ratio takes just a few hours to complete yet consistently achieves &gt; 90% biallelic knockouts. While the method generates a diverse mix of null alleles in the injected animals, frameshift mutations are a universal mechanism which can be deployed on virtually any gene of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Headloop PCR is a rapid sequencing-free method to validate gRNAs</title><p>Deep sequencing allows for the quantification of frameshift mutations in F0 animals, but the cost is not always justified simply to confirm sufficient mutagenic activity of gRNAs. As an inexpensive and rapid alternative, we adapted a suppression PCR method called headloop PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rand et al., 2005</xref>). We reasoned that suppressing amplification of the wild-type haplotype at a target locus would reveal the presence of mutant alleles. Suppression is achieved by adding to one of the PCR primers a 5' tag that is complementary to the wild-type sequence at the target locus. During PCR, the tag base-pairs to the target sequence in the same strand, directing elongation to form a stable hairpin, which prevents the use of the amplicon as template in the subsequent cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Any indels generated in the target locus will prevent the formation of the headloop and allow exponential amplification. To demonstrate the efficacy of this technique, we used headloop PCR for five targeted loci in <italic>slc24a5</italic> that we had also sequenced. No amplification with headloop primers was detected for any of the loci in uninjected embryos, indicating suppression of amplification of the wild-type haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, robust amplification of the targeted loci was observed from the F0 embryos injected with highly mutagenic RNPs. Amplification was absent at the locus targeted by a gRNA known to be ineffective (<italic>slc24a5</italic> gRNA C, &lt; 2% mutated reads; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Headloop PCR is a rapid, sequencing-free method to confirm design of gRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principle of headloop PCR.

Jointly inactivating evolutionary-related genes may therefore be necessary to overcome genetic robustness.</p><p>To test the feasibility of double gene knockout in F0 animals, we targeted pairs of genes that each produce a distinct developmental phenotype when mutated. To compare our method with published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), we first targeted the pigmentation gene <italic>slc24a5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lamason et al., 2005</xref>) and the T-box transcription factor encoding gene <italic>tbx5a</italic>, which is required for pectoral fin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrity et al., 2002</xref>). Double biallelic knockouts should therefore lack both pigmentation and pectoral fins. Each gene was targeted with a three-RNP set, then the two sets were injected together. Similar to previous results, single gene targeting produced high proportions of knockout animals—100% (37/37) of the <italic>slc24a5</italic> F0 larvae had completely unpigmented eyes at 2 dpf and 100% (43/43) of the <italic>tbx5a</italic> F0 larvae did not develop pectoral fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). When both genes were targeted in individual animals, 93% (26/28) displayed both phenotypes. This again precisely mirrors results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>, but mutating fewer loci in each gene. We replicated this result by targeting a second pair of genes, the pigmentation gene <italic>tyr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelsh et al., 1996</xref>), and the T-box transcription factor encoding gene <italic>ta</italic>, which is required for tail development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulte-Merker, 1995</xref>). 100% of the injected embryos exhibited both the no pigmentation and no tail phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Continuous traits, for which phenotypic values vary within a continuous range, have rarely been studied using F0 knockouts due to concerns about the incomplete removal of wild-type alleles and diversity of null alleles within and across F0 animals. Both of these issues will potentially dilute the experimental pool with unaffected or variably affected animals, reducing the measurable effect size between experimental and control groups. This would make continuous traits less likely to be reliably detected in a population of F0 knockouts than in a population of stable line mutants, which will all harbour a single characterised mutation in every cell.

As in nearly all organisms, zebrafish physiology and behaviour are regulated by an internal circadian (24-hour) clock driven by transcription-translation feedback loops. The periodicity of this clock is in part regulated by the phosphorylation of the Period proteins, which constitutes a component of the negative arm of the feedback loop. Drugs and mutations that interfere with Casein Kinases responsible for this phosphorylation alter circadian period length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lowrey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smadja Storz et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore targeted <italic>casein kinase 1 delta</italic> (<italic>csnk1db</italic>) in the <italic>Tg(per3:luc)<sup>g1</sup></italic> reporter line, which allows bioluminescence-based measurement of larval circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaneko and Cahill, 2005</xref>). The circadian period of control larvae injected with <italic>scrambled</italic> RNPs in constant dark conditions was 25.8 ± 0.9 hr, within the expected wild-type range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaneko and Cahill, 2005</xref>). In <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 knockout animals, the circadian period was extended by 84 min to 27.2 ± 0.9 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To demonstrate that this period lengthening was not due to non-specific or off-target effects, we measured the circadian period of larvae exposed to the pan-casein kinase inhibitor PF-670462. When PF-670462 was added to <italic>scrambled</italic> RNPs-injected larvae, the period increased more than 8 hr to 34.1 ± 0.9 hr. However, adding the inhibitor to the <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 larvae did not further increase the period (34.3 ± 2.7 hr). Therefore, the phenotypic consequences of the casein-kinase inhibitor and <italic>csnk1db</italic> knockout are not additive, indicating that they influence circadian period length through the same target pathway. This experiment demonstrates that a quantitative molecular phenotype that unfolds over many days and in many tissues can be accurately detected in the population of F0 knockouts generated with our protocol.</p><p>If the diversity of null alleles in F0 animals were to produce substantial phenotypic variation, quantitative differences in multi-parameter behaviours would be difficult to assess in populations of F0 knockouts.

We share here some considerations for the design of F0 genetic screens in zebrafish.</p><p>The first step is to select gRNAs for each gene that will be tested. Whenever possible, each target locus should be on a distinct exon as this might negate compensatory mechanisms such as exon skipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lalonde et al., 2017</xref>). Asymmetrical exons, i.e. of a length that is not a multiple of three, can also be prioritised, as exon skipping would cause a frameshift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tuladhar et al., 2019</xref>). If the gene has multiple annotated transcripts, one should target protein-coding exons that are common to most or all transcripts. We sequenced the mutations caused by more than 30 individual gRNAs and only one was consistently non-mutagenic. However, the likelihood of selecting non-mutagenic gRNAs may increase as more genes are tested. Hence, we suggest an approach in two rounds of injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>)—a validation round followed by a phenotyping round.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Recommendations for F0 knockout screens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Suggestion for the design of an F0 screen, based on a three-step process: (1) selection of gRNAs; (2) verification that all gRNAs are mutagenic; (3) phenotyping.

Headloop PCR is cheap, robust, and requires only a single step, which makes it easily adapted to high-throughput screening. No specialist equipment is required, as opposed to qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2014</xref>), high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samarut et al., 2016</xref>), or fluorescent PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrington et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike deep sequencing, qPCR, and HRMA, it is also flexible with respect to the size of amplicons and so is sensitive to a wide range of alleles, from small indels to large deletions between targeted loci. It can be used to assay the efficiency of any gRNA, with no restrictions on target sequence that might be imposed by the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jao et al., 2013</xref>), for example. The products of headloop PCR are also compatible with different sequencing methods, should further analysis of mutant haplotypes be required.</p><p>The second round of injections generates the F0 knockouts used for phenotyping. If phenotyping requires a transgenic line, for instance expressing <italic>GCaMP</italic> for brain imaging, the F0 approach has the additional advantage that it can be deployed directly in embryos from this line. We advise that control larvae are injected with a set of <italic>scrambled</italic> RNPs, as they control for any potential effect caused by the injection of Cas9 and exogenous RNA. This two-step approach assumes that the phenotyping requires substantial time or resources, for instance video tracking behaviour over multiple days. If phenotyping is rapid and/or largely automated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eimon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kokel et al., 2010</xref>), genotyping can be performed directly on a sample of the phenotyped animals. If a gRNA is found not to generate enough mutations, it can be replaced, and the experiment repeated.</p><p>In screening situations in which every phenotyped animal is not genotyped, the reliability of the F0 method depends on the reliability of the injections. For instance, if some eggs were missed during injections, the F0 population would include a proportion of wild-type animals, which would reduce the effect size between the control and the experimental group and make the phenotype less likely to be detected. To evaluate how resilient phenotyping would be in such conditions, we used bootstrapping to simulate distributions where a gradually larger proportion of the F0 population are in fact wild-type animals. Power calculations on simulations derived from the <italic>trpa1b</italic> and <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 knockout experimental data show that a single 96-well plate, i.e. sample sizes of 48 larvae in each group, is more than sufficient to detect mutant phenotypes at a power of 0.8 and a significance level of 0.05, even with a relatively low proportion of knockout animals in the F0 population (28 and 59%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Therefore, the high efficacy and throughput of the F0 method allows one to discover phenotypes with robust statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>F0 knockouts vs stable knockout line—diversity of null alleles</title><p>A key characteristic of the F0 knockout approach is the diversity of null alleles. The F0 mutants do not have a unique, definable genotype. This can be a shortcoming, for instance in disease modelling applications where a specific mutation needs to be reproduced. However, frequently the experimental goal is to assess the consequences of the lack of a specific protein, not the consequences of a specific allele. In this context, the diversity of null alleles in F0 knockouts may have some advantages over stable mutant lines. With CRISPR-Cas9, stable mutant lines are often generated by introducing a single frameshift mutation. However, the assumption that this leads to a complete loss of protein function is not infallible. For example, in a survey of 193 knockout lines in HAP1 cells, around one third still produced residual levels of the target protein, thanks in part to genetic compensatory mechanisms such as skipping of the mutated exon or translation from alternative start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smits et al., 2019</xref>). Such compensation can allow production of a partially functional truncated protein. Exon skipping has also been documented in stable zebrafish knockout lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lalonde et al., 2017</xref>). By creating a diverse array of mutations at three sites per gene, each on a separate exon wherever possible, such compensatory mechanisms are not likely to allow the production of a functional protein in the F0 knockouts. Furthermore, a given phenotype may differ between different null alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiavacci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schuermann et al., 2015</xref>) or between different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrity et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanders and Whitlock, 2003</xref>). The F0 knockout method generates a variety of null alleles and can be deployed directly on the progeny of wild-type animals of different backgrounds. Accordingly, we propose that a knockout phenotype detected in this genetically diverse population of animals is likely to be a robust and reproducible description of the impact caused by the absence of the protein, akin to reaching a synthesised conclusion after comparing stable knockout lines of different alleles and from different founder animals.</p><p>Nevertheless, after screening, it is likely that stable knockout lines will need to be generated for more detailed and controlled studies. Directly raising the phenotyped F0 larvae may not be optimal as multi-locus targeting will result in complex genotypes. Instead, sequencing data, if available, can be used to select a gRNA that consistently generates high numbers of frameshift mutations. Furthermore, we have successfully used headloop PCR to detect mutations in tail clips from 48 to 72 hours post-fertilisation F1 embryos and sequenced the mutant haplotypes directly by Sanger sequencing. Embryos carrying mutant alleles could be identified within a single day, then grown directly into adults, thereby reducing drastically the number of fish that need to be raised and genotyped to generate a stable mutant line.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Other technical considerations for F0 knockouts</title><p>Although unviability of injected larvae was not a limitation in our experiments, we observed some unviable embryos in the populations of F0 knockouts, similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). While unviability was highly variable, even between replicates of the same experiment (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it may broadly correlate with the number of generated double-strand breaks. Indeed, developmental defects slightly increased when adding more Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and were always more frequent when targeting more loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Moreover, unviability remained lower in <italic>scrambled</italic> RNP-injected embryos compared to F0 knockout siblings, likely excluding chemical toxicity unrelated to Cas9-induced double-strand breaks. A sound strategy to reduce the number of double-strand breaks, while maintaining high proportions of knockout alleles, would be to reduce the number of loci targeted. Machine learning tools can predict editing outcomes and indel frequencies in cell cultures based on target sequence and genomic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, it may be feasible to systematically apply the frameshift model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) directly at the gRNA design stage using predicted mutations as input. This would allow the user to select specific gRNAs that are predicted to produce a high number of frameshift mutations.</p><p>We sequenced off-target loci and found that off-target effects are unlikely to be a pervasive issue in F0 phenotypic screens. An off-target gene will typically be targeted by a single RNP. Therefore, even if off-target indels are generated sporadically, the build-up of frameshift probability and large deletions between loci cannot happen at the off-target gene, reducing the likelihood of generating a null allele. If a null allele arises at an off-target gene nevertheless, the lower mutagenesis makes it likely that this allele will neither be present biallelically nor in a large number of cells. The probability that an observed phenotype is a false positive is therefore likely to be low. Low penetrance of a given phenotype (i.e. present in only a small proportion of injected animals), despite evidence of highly mutagenic gRNAs at the targeted loci, may be an indicator of a false positive. In such cases, a solution is to replicate the finding with an independent set of gRNAs with different predicted off-targets.</p><p>While multi-locus strategies like ours achieve high proportions of null alleles in F0 knockouts, they admittedly inflate both the number of potential off-target loci and number of double-strand breaks. This cost-benefit balance may be specific to the phenotype under investigation. For example, for a phenotype whose spatial variation is visible in individual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Watson et al., 2020</xref>), the mutation of one or two loci per gene may be a valuable strategy. However, the study of continuous traits, particularly behavioural ones, likely require consistently high proportions of null alleles. In this case, the mutation of three loci with synthetic gRNAs, as we demonstrate, offers a reasonable compromise.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Building on published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshijima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), we developed a simple and rapid zebrafish F0 knockout method using CRISPR-Cas9. By combining multi-locus targeting with high mutagenesis at each locus, the method converts the vast majority of wild-type or transgenic embryos directly into biallelic knockouts for any gene(s) of interest. We demonstrate that continuous traits, such as complex behavioural phenotypes, are accurately measured in populations of F0 knockouts. Cumulatively, methods like ours and pilot screens are establishing F0 knockouts as a revolutionary approach for large genetic screens in zebrafish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

At 4 dpf, using a P1000 pipet set at 150 μL with a tip whose end was cut-off, individual larvae were transferred to a white 96-round well plate (Greiner Bio-One). No animals were added in the last two columns of wells to serve as blanks. 50 mM (100×) Beetle luciferin (Promega) in water was mixed with 0.1% DMSO in water or 0.1 mM PF-670462 (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO to obtain a 4× luciferin/4 μM PF-670462 or 4× luciferin/0.004% DMSO solution. 50 μL of this solution was added on top of each well. Blank wells were topped with the luciferin/DMSO solution. Final concentrations in the wells were: luciferin 0.5 mM; DMSO 0.001%; PF-670462 1 µM. The plate was sealed and transferred to a Packard NXT Topcount plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Recording was performed in constant dark during 123 hr, starting around 12 noon the first day, or CT3, i.e. 3 hr after the last Zeitgeber. Temperature in the room was 25–28°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Circadian data analysis</title><p>The light intensity emitted from each well was collected by the Topcount plate reader every 9.92 min in counts-per-second (cps). After formatting the raw Topcount data in R, the data were imported in BioDare2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk/">https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zielinski et al., 2014</xref>).

Six larvae (1 <italic>scrambled</italic> + DMSO, 4 <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 + DMSO, 1 <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 + PF-670462) were excluded for subsequent analysis; five upon inspection of the timeseries because their traces showed sudden changes in amplitude or dampened cycling and one because no satisfactory fit could be found during period analysis (see below).</p><p>For period analysis, the timeseries was cropped to start 24 hr after the end of the last partial LD cycle (CT48 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) to analyse the circadian rhythm in free running conditions. Period analysis was performed on the cropped timeseries using the algorithm Fast Fourier Transform Non-Linear Least Squares (FFT NLLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plautz et al., 1997</xref>) ran through BioDare2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zielinski et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The FFT NLLS algorithm fitted a cosine to the timeseries and extracted from the model the period that lies within a user-defined range of likely circadian periods. As the measure can be sensitive to this range, and as it was evident from the timeseries that the period was massively different between larvae treated with DMSO and larvae treated with PF-670462, the two groups were processed separately. The window of likely period lengths was first set to 18–32 hr (25 ± 7 hr) for all the fish treated with DMSO, that i.e. <italic>scrambled</italic> + DMSO and <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 + DMSO. It was then set to 28–42 hr (35 ± 7 hr) for all the fish treated with PF-670462. Any equivocal period length was labelled by BioDare2 and the cosine fit was manually inspected. As mentioned above, one larva was excluded upon inspection as no fit could be found. The period length for each animal were exported from BioDare2 and plotted as a stripchart in R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> bottom).</p><p>After period analysis, BioDare2’s amplification and baseline detrending and normalisation to the mean were applied to the timeseries. The detrended and normalised timeseries were exported from BioDare2 and plotted in R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> top). Traces were smoothed with a 20-data point (~ 198 min) rolling average and were artificially spread over the Y axis so they would not overlap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title><italic>scn1lab</italic> stable knockout line</title><p>The <italic>scn1lab<sup>Δ44</sup></italic> stable knockout line was generated using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs).

At 5 dpf, individual larvae were transferred to the wells of clear 96-square well plates (Whatman). To avoid any potential localisation bias during the tracking, conditions were alternated between columns of the 96-well plates. The plates were placed into two ZebraBoxes (ViewPoint Behavior Technology). From each well we recorded the number of pixels that changed intensity between successive frames. This metric, which we term Δ pixels, describes each animal’s behaviour over time as a sequence of zeros and positive values, denoting if the larva was still or moving. Tracking was performed at 25 frames per second on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle with the following ViewPoint parameters: <italic>detection sensitivity = 20</italic>, <italic>burst = 100</italic>, <italic>freezing = 3</italic>. Larvae were tracked for around 65 hr, generating sequences of roughly 5,850,000 Δ pixel values per animal. The day light level was calibrated at 125 μW with a Macam PM203 Optical Power Meter set at 555 nm. Evaporated water was replaced both mornings shortly after 9 <sc>am</sc>. At the end of the tracking, any larva unresponsive to a light touch with a P10 tip was excluded from subsequent analysis.</p><p>For the <italic>scn1lab</italic> stable knockout line experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), larvae were the progeny of a <italic>scn1lab</italic><sup>+/Δ44</sup> (heterozygous) incross. Behavioural tracking was performed as above, with the following amendments: the experiment started at 4 dpf; recording was performed at 15 frames per second; evaporated water was replaced both days around 2 <sc>pm</sc>, which created an artefactual drop followed by a peak in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Behavioural data analysis</title><p>Behavioural data were processed and analysed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh and Rihel, 2020</xref>). In brief, the <italic>raw</italic> file generated by the ZebraLab software (ViewPoint Behavior Technology) was exported into thousands of <italic>xls</italic> files each containing 50,000 rows of data. These files, together with a metadata file labelling each well with a condition, were input to the MatLab scripts <italic>Vp_Extract.m</italic> and <italic>Vp_Analyse.m</italic> (included in the GitHub and Zenodo repositories). To visualise larval activity over time, we summed Δ pixel changes into one-second bins and plotted the mean and standard error of the mean across larvae, smoothed with a 15-min rolling average. We considered the first day and night as a habituation period, and cropped these from all timeseries. For the <italic>scn1lab</italic> stable knockout line, the traces start at 9 <sc>am</sc> (lights on, ZT0) of 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). For the <italic>scn1lab</italic> F0 knockout experiments, the traces start at 9 <sc>am</sc> of 6 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To quantify differences in behaviour between genotypes, we extracted 10 day and night behavioural parameters per larva: (1) active bout length (seconds); (2) active bout mean (Δ pixels); (3) active bout standard deviation (Δ pixels); (4) active bout total (Δ pixels); (5) active bout minimum (Δ pixels); (6) active bout maximum (Δ pixels); (7) number of active bouts; (8) total time active (%); (9) total activity (Δ pixels); and (10) inactive bout length (seconds). To compare F0 and stable line <italic>scn1lab</italic> mutant behaviour, we calculated the deviation (Z-score) of each mutant from their wild-type siblings across all parameters. We term these vectors behavioural fingerprints. We compared fingerprints across groups using both Pearson correlation and the Euclidean distance between each larva and its mean wild-type sibling fingerprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The statistical test used to compare effect sizes is a <italic>Z</italic>-test used for comparing two studies in meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borenstein et al., 2009</xref>). As a control, in the stable knockout experiment, the effect size between wild types and heterozygotes (Cohen’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.28) was significantly different (p = 0.04) than the effect size between wild types and homozygotes (Cohen’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1.57).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Sample size simulations</title><p>This refers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. For <italic>trpa1b</italic>, each larva’s response to mustard oil was first summarised as the difference between the total activity (sum of Δ pixels/frame) during the first 3 min of exposure to mustard oil and the total activity during the 3 min just before switching the plates. Upon inspection of the density plots of these delta values, 3 <italic>trpa1b</italic> F0 animals that responded like <italic>scrambled</italic> controls and 1 <italic>scrambled</italic> control that did not respond to mustard oil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were excluded to fit idealised normal distributions. For <italic>csnk1db</italic>, the values were the individual period lengths of the larvae treated with DMSO (<italic>scrambled + DMSO</italic> and <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 + DMSO). The means and standard deviations of the resulting <italic>scrambled</italic> and knockout groups were used to fit normal distributions. At each simulation, 100 F0 knockout and 100 <italic>scrambled</italic> larvae were simulated. At the first simulation, the 100 values (delta activity or period lengths) of the F0 knockout group were randomly sampled from the <italic>scrambled</italic> normal distribution, simulating an experiment where all F0 eggs were missed during injections and are thus wild types (0% success rate). At the second simulation, 99 values of the F0 knockout group were randomly sampled from the <italic>scrambled</italic> normal distribution and 1 value was randomly sampled from the knockout normal distribution, simulating a 1% success rate at injections. As simulations progressed, more knockout larvae were gradually added to the F0 group, simulating improving success rates at injections. The simulations ended at the 101<sup>th</sup> iteration, where the 100 delta values of the F0 knockout group are sampled from the knockout distribution, simulating an ideal experiment where all the larvae in the F0 knockout group are biallelic knockouts (100% success rate). In all the 101 simulations, the data of the <italic>scrambled</italic> group were sampled every time from the <italic>scrambled</italic> distribution.

As simulations progressed, the F0 knockout and <italic>scrambled</italic> data gradually had less overlap, hence increasing effect size and decreasing the minimum sample size needed to detect the phenotype.

They showed that in addition to target single genes, this method could be successfully used to create double knockouts of <italic>slc24a5</italic> and <italic>tbx5a</italic> gene pair, or <italic>tyr</italic> and <italic>ta</italic> gene pair, in F0 embryos. Strikingly, they also demonstrated direct generation of triple gene knockouts of <italic>mitfa</italic>, <italic>mpv17</italic> and <italic>slc45a2</italic> in F0 larvae, which fully recapitulated the pigmentation defects of the <italic>crystal</italic> mutant. As the authors point out, their methodology is extremely likely to be adapted for candidate genes for traits which display a range of phenotypes among wild type embryos or larvae.</p><p>The manuscript points out a rather obvious but somehow underreported feature of NHEJ-based mutagenesis: assuming random size of indels, when 100% of DNA is mutated fewer than 50% (.67x.67) of cells in an embryo will contain frameshift mutations in both alleles. Thus, successful recapitulation of a mutant phenotype in an F0 embryo relies on mutagenesis of an essential part of the protein (not always as straightforward as it seems), utilization of other repair pathways such as MMEJ (not always reliable), or fortuitous help from largely unknown factors which skew the distribution of indel sizes (multiple guide would RNAs need to be tested without guarantee of success). Simultaneously designing several guide RNAs against the gene and co-injecting them, as the authors propose, seems to be an excellent and straightforward strategy.</p><p>They established a rapid sequencing-free method to evaluate the activity of Cas9 RNP by using headloop PCR, facilitating the selection of target sites. This is a new tool for the zebrafish community.</p><p>Despite the presented data on several loci, it is not clear whether and how this method is better compared to a series of prior related F0 approaches. This question is the crux of this method manuscript.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions</italic></p><p>1) The authors need a specific direct comparison with prior reports, notably Wu et al. in 2018. Several genes were tested in both work, such as <italic>slc24a5</italic>, <italic>tyr</italic>, <italic>tbx16</italic>, and <italic>tbx5a</italic>, did you use or compare the same target sites in these genes as reported by Wu et al.?</p><p>2) The second major consideration in the field is validating F0 somatic mosaic results with non-mosaic outcomes in prospective loci. Replicating known prior phenotypes is an important first step. But clearly validating new loci where the outcome is unknown is the key challenge in the field and the bar by which these methods will be judged. N=1 locus data has many questions – was this gambler's luck (i.e. they were fortunate the first locus they tried worked)? Did they try others and not have them work?</p><p><italic>Additional points</italic></p><p>1) Successful multiplex targeting has already been achieved in zebrafish, including the Figure 6 in Jao et al., 2013 reference. This needs to be acknowledged and elaborated upon (different efficiencies, etc.).</p><p>2) The statement that &quot;The common strategy is to inject ... RNP...&quot; excludes a significant number of laboratories which prefer to inject Cas9 RNA. The proposed three-guide method should work just as well with Cas9 RNA.</p><p>3) The data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 seems to show that relative concentration of functional Cas9 protein is rate-limiting, perhaps even at the highest 1:1 ratio. Statement that 1:1 ratio is &quot;optimal&quot; (page 7) implies that reduction in the amount of guide RNAs would lead to reduced penetrance of the phenotype, which may or may not be the case.</p><p>4) The observation that 41/41 adult <italic>slc24a5</italic> fish displayed golden phenotype suggests that only pigmentation-negative embryos (perhaps the 63/67) were raised to adulthood. Please clarify.</p><p>5) I am not convinced that headloop PCR is sufficiently quantitative for assessment of guide RNAs for an F0 assay. What is the minimum mutagenesis rate needed to obtain a &quot;positive&quot; PCR result and does it vary between loci? For example, if a specific gRNA produces 30% indels, would it score as positive in Headloop PCR? Assuming 67% frameshift probability, such guide RNA would only produce about 4% (0.3 x 0.67 x 0.3 x 0.67) of biallelically mutated cells and be therefore quite useless in an F0 assay. This analysis can be performed by mixing wild type and mutant DNA in different ratios.</p><p>6) Is the dosage/amount of Cas9 or RNP used in this study different or comparable with Wu et al.? Does it account for the improvement of the method described in the study?</p><p>7) The authors propose to design the three target sites in distinct exon within each gene. Is it really important and/or necessary to achieve high efficient biallelic knockouts? Any evidence?</p><p>8) According to the section of 'Materials and methods', the synthetic gRNA was made of two components, i.e., crRNA and tracrRNA. Synthesis of gRNA as a single molecule by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription is usually more popular and economic, is it really necessary to use crRNA and tracrRNA to achieve high efficient biallelic knockouts? Any evidence?</p><p>9) Could headloop PCR be used for the quantification of mutagenesis efficiency (indel-producing mutation rate) of Cas9/gRNA? How sensitive is this method? Could small indels (such as 1-bp insertion or deletion) be detected by the headloop PCR?</p><p>10) In addition to indels, deletions between two double strand breaks induced by two gRNAs are also important for the generation of biallelic knockouts of the target gene. The authors showed the analysis of mutations in each site (such as in Figure 2A), is it possible to quantify the distribution and contribution of all the different deletions?</p><p>11) Figure 1C and 1D: The authors compared the effects of the injection of 1, 2, 3, and 4 loci. How were the 1, 2, and 3 loci selected from the four target sites? Will each of the four loci give the same or different phenotypic ratio if tested individually? Will different combinations of 2 loci or 3 loci give the same or different phenotypic ratio? Or which combination of 2 loci or 3 loci will give the highest mutagenic effect? For example, in Figure 1C, the 3-loci showed comparable effect with 4-loci, while the 2-loci is less effective; is it possible to find other 2-loci combinations which could show higher mutagenic efficiency than the current 2-loci, such that the effect of the new 2-loci combination is as good as the 3-loci or 4-loci combination? Conversely, in Figure 1D, the 2-loci already showed the highest mutagenic effect, is it because of this particular 2-loci combination, or any 2-loci combination will show the same efficiency?</p><p>12) Figure 6: The phenotypes of <italic>scn1lab</italic> F0 knockouts are more severe than those of <italic>scn1lab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant. Any explanation?</p><p>13) Please provide the academic name of zebrafish in its first appearance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59683.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The authors need a specific direct comparison with prior reports, notably Wu et al., 2018.

First, we understand the metric used by Wu et al. (<italic>percentage dysmorphic</italic>) as not including embryos found dead. The metric we used, which we termed <italic>unviability</italic>, included dead embryos found any time after 1 dpf (see Materials and methods, section <italic>Unviability</italic>). Second, Wu et al. tallied the number of dysmorphic embryos at the time of phenotyping, which seemed to be 2 dpf for the experiments targeting <italic>slc24a5</italic>, <italic>tyr</italic>, <italic>tbx16</italic>, <italic>tbx5a</italic>, or <italic>slc24a5</italic> and <italic>tbx5a</italic>. We followed the larvae until 5–6 dpf. During our experiments, many unviable embryos were categorised as such because they failed to develop a swim bladder, but this can only be observed at 4–5 dpf. For both of these reasons, it is expected that the unviability levels we reported would be higher than the <italic>percentage dysmorphic</italic> reported in Wu et al., 2018, even if the experiments were identical.</p><p>Nonetheless, we can attempt a comparison by counting the number of dysmorphic embryos we found at 2 dpf during our experiments. Accordingly, it seems likely that we achieved lower percentages of dysmorphic embryos:</p><p>Wu et al., 2018 versus <bold>present work</bold>:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>slc24a5</italic>: ~ 8% vs. <bold>~ 2% (2/162)</bold></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>tyr</italic>: ~ 10% vs. <bold>~ 2% (4/215)</bold></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>tbx16</italic>: as homozygous <italic>tbx16</italic> knockouts have various trunk defects and are lethal early in development (Ho and Kane, 1990), we did not quantify unviability in the <italic>tbx16</italic> F0 knockouts</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>tbx5a</italic>: ~ 8% vs. <bold>~ 0% (0/43)</bold></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>slc24a5</italic> and <italic>tbx5a</italic>: ~ 11% vs. <bold>~ 1% (1/29)</bold>.</p></list-item></list><p>Details about these comparisons can be found in the GitHub and Zenodo repositories (<italic>wu_unviabilitycomparisons.xlsx</italic>).</p><p>We did not use or compare the same target sites as Wu et al., 2018. The gRNAs used in the present work were designed independently and by different algorithms. Wu et al. used CRISPR Design, a tool created by the Zhang Lab, which does not exist anymore (crispr.mit.edu). We used IDT’s tool, available on their website (eu.idtdna.com/site/order/designtool/index/CRISPR_CUSTOM). We searched for any fortuitous overlap. We used a total of 15 gRNAs targeting <italic>slc24a5</italic>, <italic>tyr</italic>, <italic>tbx16</italic>, or <italic>tbx5a</italic>; Wu et al. used 32. Four of the gRNAs we used (4/15) had some but incomplete overlap in their genomic binding sites with gRNAs from Wu et al. We also found that <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus D from the present work was the same as Wu et al.’s <italic>tbx5a</italic> locus 2 (Wu et al., 2018, Supplementary file 1). Details about the overlapping gRNAs are included in the GitHub and Zenodo repositories (<italic>wu_commonLoci.xlsx</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second major consideration in the field is validating F0 somatic mosaic results with non-mosaic outcomes in prospective loci.

N=1 locus data has many questions – was this gambler's luck (i.e. they were fortunate the first locus they tried worked)? Did they try others and not have them work?</p></disp-quote><p>We targeted a total of 12 genes and demonstrated the corresponding 12 phenotypes, which all reproduced published mutants. Therefore, we are slightly unclear what is meant by “N = 1 locus data”. We also note that the 12 genes/phenotypes we presented in the study are all the genes we have targeted during the development and testing of the protocol. In other words, we do not have any example where we failed to replicate a stable mutant phenotype.</p><p>We understand “N = 1” may be referring to the experiment targeting <italic>scn1lab</italic> (Figure 6) being the only direct, side-by-side comparison between F0 knockouts and stable line mutants in our study, with the others referring to known, published mutants. The majority of the phenotypes we have tested are overt morphological differences which are well described in the literature; we therefore do not believe including stable line mutants for comparison is indispensable.</p><p>Nonetheless, to address this by providing another direct comparison between F0 knockouts and a stable mutant line, we targeted the gene <italic>mab21l2</italic>, which is required for eye development, and compared the phenotype of the F0 knockouts with homozygous <italic>mab21l2<sup>u517</sup></italic> mutants (Wycliffe et al., 2020). We included these new results as Figure 1I and in the text (Results, section<italic>Three synthetic gRNAs [...]</italic>).</p><p>We believe that robustly discovering new phenotypes directly in F0 knockouts is the key application of the method, and indeed its main challenge. In fact, we present an example where the phenotype (outcome) was unknown – <italic>csnk1db</italic>. The phenotype (circadian clock period lengthening) was predicted from pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout in other species (e.g. Meng et al., 2010). The circadian period of <italic>csnk1db</italic> knockout was never measured in zebrafish to our knowledge. Therefore, it demonstrates the validation of a novel phenotype in zebrafish F0 knockouts.</p><p>It is precisely because discovering novel phenotypes is the main challenge of F0 knockout methods that an essential criterion for success was achieving high phenotypic penetrance and close to complete removal of wild-type alleles for test genes. When studying phenotypes that vary continuously in the population, such as locomotor activity (Figure 6) or circadian clock period (Figure 5B), it is not possible to readily identify animals in the F0 knockout population that display a phenotype, in contrast to situations in which animals exhibit overt morphological differences. Therefore, the majority of the animals in the F0 knockout population need to be <italic>bona fide</italic> knockouts. Continuous traits often have the added challenge that they are not phenotypes whose spatial variation is evident in individual animals (Watson et al., 2020), in contrast to developmental phenotypes like formation of electrical synapses (Shah et al., 2015) or distribution of microglia (Kuil et al., 2019). Therefore, most cells in each F0 knockout animal must carry biallelic loss-of-function mutations. With the pigmentation phenotypes <italic>golden</italic> (<italic>slc24a5</italic> knockout) and <italic>sandy</italic> (<italic>tyr</italic> knockout), and the deep sequencing data at 32 targeted sites, we demonstrate that the F0 knockouts generated by the present method show very little mosaicism, in the sense that most wild-type alleles are removed, and hence can be used to discover novel phenotypes that require most or all the cells of most F0 knockout animals to be mutated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points</p><p>1) Successful multiplex targeting has already been achieved in zebrafish, including the Figure 6 in Jao et al., 2013 reference. This needs to be acknowledged and elaborated upon (different efficiencies, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, and we note there are other important studies: Hoshijima et al., 2019; Keatinge et al., 2020; Kim and Zhang, 2020; Shah et al., 2015. Our first example (simultaneous targeting of <italic>slc24a5</italic> and <italic>tbx5a</italic>, Figure 4A) was directly inspired from Wu et al., 2018. We realise this was not acknowledged properly and have corrected it (Results, section <italic>Multiple genes […]</italic>).</p><p>What constitutes “<italic>successful</italic>” multiplex targeting depends on the applications for which the method is developed. In Figure 6 of Jao et al., 2013, five genes were targeted simultaneously: <italic>ddx19</italic>, <italic>egfp</italic> (as part of a transgene), <italic>slc24a5</italic> (<italic>golden</italic>), <italic>mitfa</italic>, and <italic>tyr</italic>, with one gRNA targeting each gene. Jao et al. concluded that multiplex targeting was successful because <italic>some</italic> embryos showed a combination of three phenotypes. The goal of the experiment was not to demonstrate high penetrance of each phenotype or close to complete removal of wild-type alleles for each gene. For example, it is not possible to tell whether eye pigmentation defects were caused by disruption of <italic>slc24a5</italic> or <italic>tyr</italic> (as acknowledged by the authors); the proportion of embryos displaying all three phenotypes together was not reported; phenotypic penetrance in individual animals is incomplete (<italic>severe</italic> pigmentation phenotype as in Jao et al., 2013, Figure 6C,D would be scored as 2 in the present work); and the proportion of mutated alleles is below 50% for both <italic>slc24a5</italic> (<italic>golden</italic>) and <italic>mitfa</italic>. As highlighted appropriately in the previous reviewer’s question, a key challenge is the application of F0 knockout methods to discover new phenotypes (“<italic>when the outcome is unknown”</italic>). If a gene which would give rise to a behavioural phenotype in a homozygous knockout is disrupted incompletely in only some of the injected F0 larvae, it is unlikely that the phenotype be discovered in F0 knockouts, as we explain through Figure 7B. For example, if <italic>trpa1b</italic> and <italic>csnk1db</italic> were targeted simultaneously in n = 48 F0 embryos, but only 40% of larvae were true <italic>csnk1db</italic> F0 knockouts, it is unlikely that one would discover the circadian clock phenotype of <italic>csnk1db</italic> (Figure 7B).</p><p>To summarise, the method we present here is specifically designed to be applied to screens studying continuous traits (like many behavioural parameters) or phenotypes whose spatial variation is not visible in individual animals. In that context, multiplex targeting is only successful if phenotype penetrance is high (i.e. the majority of injected larvae display all phenotypes completely) and most wild-type alleles of all targeted genes are removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statement that &quot;The common strategy is to inject ... RNP...&quot; excludes a significant number of laboratories which prefer to inject Cas9 RNA. The proposed three-guide method should work just as well with Cas9 RNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We think it is unlikely that the present method would work as well with Cas9 mRNA. Comparisons of Cas9 mRNA vs pre‑assembled Cas9 protein/gRNA RNP were performed by Burger et al., 2016 (Figure 2D). The authors targeted <italic>egfp</italic> present in two different transgenes by co-injecting Cas9 mRNA and an <italic>in vitro-</italic>transcribed sgRNA or a pre‑assembled RNP (Cas9 protein + <italic>in vitro-</italic>transcribed sgRNA), then quantified intensity of the EGFP signal from the F0 embryos. Using the assembled RNP led to a greater loss of the EGFP signal compared to using Cas9 mRNA (~ 28% greater loss of EGFP signal vs Cas9 mRNA for the first <italic>egfp</italic> transgene, ~ 7% for the second). Burger et al. hypothesised that the limiting factor when using Cas9 mRNA may be either the rate of Cas9 translation or degradation of the sgRNA before it is packaged in the RNP (Burger et al., 2016). Therefore, we would advise against using Cas9 mRNA, especially when studying continuous, quantitative traits where high phenotypic penetrance and close to complete removal of the wild-type alleles are crucial. We have highlighted this point in Results (section <italic>Three synthetic gRNAs […]</italic>) and in Materials and methods (section <italic>gRNA/Cas9 assembly</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 seems to show that relative concentration of functional Cas9 protein is rate-limiting, perhaps even at the highest 1:1 ratio. Statement that 1:1 ratio is &quot;optimal&quot; (page 7) implies that reduction in the amount of guide RNAs would lead to reduced penetrance of the phenotype, which may or may not be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>This may well be the case. We have edited the text to raise this possibility (Results, section <italic>Three synthetic gRNAs […]</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The observation that 41/41 adult <italic>slc24a5</italic> fish displayed golden phenotype suggests that only pigmentation-negative embryos (perhaps the 63/67) were raised to adulthood. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct—only <italic>slc24a5</italic> F0 larvae displaying the <italic>golden</italic> phenotype (scored as 1 for eye pigmentation at 2 dpf) were raised to adulthood. This is mentioned in Materials and methods (section <italic>Adult slc24a5 F0 fish</italic>), but we have edited the main text to make this clearer for the readers (Results, section <italic>Three synthetic gRNAs […]</italic>). To explain in more detail the rationale behind this experiment: Wu et al. observed that targeting <italic>s1pr2</italic> at a single locus generated a high proportion of larvae with the expected phenotype at 1 dpf, but that this proportion would then decline by 4 dpf (Wu et al., 2018, Figure 1A), suggesting the animals may ‘recover’ from the phenotype. As potential applications of the present method include the study of quantitative traits such as behavioural phenotypes (i.e. typically after 4–5 dpf), we deemed pertinent to confirm that the phenotypes we were observing persisted throughout the life of the animal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I am not convinced that headloop PCR is sufficiently quantitative for assessment of guide RNAs for an F0 assay. What is the minimum mutagenesis rate needed to obtain a &quot;positive&quot; PCR result and does it vary between loci? For example, if a specific gRNA produces 30% indels, would it score as positive in Headloop PCR? Assuming 67% frameshift probability, such guide RNA would only produce about 4% (0.3 x 0.67 x 0.3 x 0.67) of biallelically mutated cells and be therefore quite useless in an F0 assay. This analysis can be performed by mixing wild type and mutant DNA in different ratios.</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether headloop PCR can also be used to exclude ‘mediocre’ gRNAs (&lt; 60% mutated reads), we derived a score from the band intensities on agarose gel (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The headloop score is the ratio between the headloop PCR band intensity and the standard PCR band intensity. As it represents a proportion of the standard PCR band intensity, it should largely control for the variation in PCR efficiency between loci. We measured this score for the targeted loci of embryos injected with gRNAs targeting <italic>tbx16</italic> and <italic>tyr</italic>, as both sets included a mediocre gRNA. To simulate more samples from mediocre gRNAs, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and created new samples by mixing genomic DNA from injected embryos with genomic DNA from the uninjected control embryo, either 1:1 (mutated alleles diluted to ½) or 1:3 (mutated alleles diluted to ¼). We assumed the proportion of mutated reads for these samples to be ½ or ¼ of the proportion of mutated reads of the original injected sample. A headloop score threshold at 0.6 accurately excluded the two mediocre gRNAs (<italic>tbx16</italic> gRNA B and <italic>tyr</italic> gRNA A) and all the diluted samples (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). This threshold also included all the good gRNAs, with the exception of <italic>tbx16</italic> gRNA D which was mistakenly excluded by headloop PCR although it generated a high proportion of mutated reads. We therefore obtained one false negative but no false positive. We conclude that headloop PCR can be used to exclude mediocre gRNAs without the need for deep sequencing, although it may at times be overly conservative. We have added these results in the text (Results, section <italic>Headloop PCR […]</italic>).</p><p>While headloop PCR can be used quantitatively to exclude mediocre gRNAs, multi-locus targeting buffers against rare mediocre gRNAs in terms of successful mutagenesis. For instance, the three-guide set targeting <italic>tyr</italic> (<italic>tyr</italic> gRNA A, B, C) or <italic>tbx16</italic> (<italic>tbx16</italic> gRNA A, B, D) both included a mediocre gRNA (<italic>tyr</italic> locus A: ~ 58% mutated reads; <italic>tbx16</italic> locus B: ~ 41% mutated reads), yet the phenotype penetrance was high or maximal (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, based on the deep sequencing results, the likelihood of selecting more than one mediocre gRNA in the same three-guide set is low. Only three out of 32 gRNAs generated less than 60% mutated reads (Figure 2A: <italic>tyr</italic> gRNA A, <italic>tbx16</italic> gRNA B, <italic>scn1lab</italic> gRNA C). If the three-guide sets were randomly assigned from these 32 gRNAs, the probability of selecting more than one (i.e. two or three) mediocre gRNA in the same set is only 0.6%. Importantly, headloop PCR correctly excluded a gRNA that barely generated any mutation (Figure 3B).</p><p>Finally, headloop PCR being itself a novel method to detect the presence of mutations, we are still collecting data and plan to further improve the tool if possible. We have provided details of the headloop primers used in the manuscript (Supplementary file 1), as well as a link to a Python-based headloop primer design tool (Material and methods, section <italic>Headloop PCR […]</italic>) to allow the community to test, validate and adapt the method for other applications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Is the dosage/amount of Cas9 or RNP used in this study different or comparable with Wu et al.? Does it account for the improvement of the method described in the study?</p></disp-quote><p>The amount of Cas9 protein was different in our study vs Wu et al., 2018. Wu et al. injected 1000 pg (28.5 fmol) sgRNA and 800 pg (4.75 fmol) Cas9, while we injected 1000 pg (28.5 fmol) gRNA and 4700 pg (28.5 fmol) Cas9, i.e. around 6 times more Cas9 in the present study. Indeed, Wu et al. obtained better results with a 6 Cas9 to 1 sgRNA ratio (Wu et al., 2018, Figure S2D), while we obtained better results with a 1 Cas9 to 1 gRNA ratio (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This may be explained by the use of the synthetic gRNAs, as Hoshijima et al., 2019 reached a similar conclusion regarding the use of a 1 Cas9 to 1 gRNA ratio, also using synthetic gRNAs (crRNA:tracrRNA duplexes) from IDT (Hoshijima et al., 2019, Figure S1).</p><p>The injection of more Cas9 protein may have contributed to our ability to achieve similar results as Wu et al. while targeting fewer loci. Indeed, Wu et al. did not test if raising the amount of Cas9 above 800 pg (4.9 fmol; i.e. 200 pg or 1.2 fmol per locus) could raise the phenotype penetrance further, and both our experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and Hoshijima et al.’s (Figure S1) indicate that Cas9 is the limiting factor at concentrations below ~ 5 fmol (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1: 14.25 fmol Cas9, i.e. 4.75 fmol per target, was not sufficient).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors propose to design the three target sites in distinct exon within each gene. Is it really important and/or necessary to achieve high efficient biallelic knockouts? Any evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>It is not necessary for all genes. First, some genes only have a single or two exons (eg. <italic>mab21l2</italic> is a single-exon gene) so the target loci cannot always be placed on three distinct exons. For <italic>mab21l2</italic>, the three target loci were placed on the unique exon, while avoiding overlap between the protospacer sequences (the 20-nucleotide genomic sequence the gRNA binds to) and the protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Second, the gRNA design algorithm (IDT) does not always offer target sites on three distinct exons within the top scoring gRNAs. This was the case for <italic>tyr</italic>: all three gRNAs targeted the same exon (exon 1/5), which evidently did not cause an issue.</p><p>However, whenever possible, we think targeting distinct exons should be preferred. The evidence for this recommendation is exon skipping (see Discussion, <italic>Design of F0 knockout screens […]</italic>). Skipping of an exon harbouring a frameshift mutation generated by CRISPR-Cas9 has been reported in zebrafish stable knockout lines (Lalonde et al., 2017). In HAP1 cell lines, exon skipping was sometimes sufficient to allow the production of a partially functional protein (Smits et al., 2019). Therefore, if the three target sites are in the same exon, there may be cases where the whole exon is skipped by alternative splicing, and the resulting protein be partially functional, hence not leading to a complete knockout. If distinct exons are mutated, it is unlikely that exon skipping is sufficient to produce a functional protein.</p><p>An additional way to counteract genetic compensation by exon skipping is to preferentially target asymmetrical exons, i.e. of length not a multiple of three. If an asymmetrical exon is skipped, the resulting transcript after splicing is frameshifted, and is therefore likely to contain a premature termination codon (Lalonde et al., 2017; Tuladhar et al., 2019).</p><p>If possible, introducing mutations only in the first few exons may not be recommended as it may allow the production of a protein with a truncation in the N‑terminal sequence thanks to an alternative translation initiation event (Makino et al., 2016; Smits et al., 2019). Around 40% of exons 2–10 are asymmetrical in the zebrafish genome (Anderson et al., 2017). Therefore, there should often be opportunities to place target sites on asymmetric exons.</p><p>In summary, our recommendation would be to target three asymmetrical exons spread across the gene, for instance exons 2, 4, 6 of a 10-exon gene. In practice, it might be rare that there is a set of three gRNAs that satisfy all the conditions within the top gRNAs suggested by the design algorithm, but these guidelines can serve as selection criteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) According to the section of 'Materials and methods', the synthetic gRNA was made of two components, i.e., crRNA and tracrRNA. Synthesis of gRNA as a single molecule by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription is usually more popular and economic, is it really necessary to use crRNA and tracrRNA to achieve high efficient biallelic knockouts? Any evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>It is highly likely that synthetic gRNAs (i.e. not <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed) are required for the success of the present method. The synthetic gRNA can be bought as a single-guide RNA (i.e. a single molecule) or in two components as a tracrRNA (constant whatever the target) and a target-specific crRNA, which are then annealed into a synthetic gRNA before injections as we described (also see online protocol at dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bfgyjjxw). Both work well (Hoshijima et al., 2019, Figure 2), but crRNA:tracrRNA duplexes cost less.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>-transcribed gRNAs are less mutagenic (Hoshijima et al., 2019, Figure 1). During <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, RNA polymerase requires the presence of guanine nucleotides at the 5′ end of transcripts. If two guanine nucleotides are not present in the genomic sequence, it is typical to artificially add them. However, this creates one or two mismatches between the spacer (gRNA) and the target sequence (genome), which substantially affects mutagenesis (Hoshijima et al., 2019, Figure 2; Varshney et al., 2015, Supplementary Figure 7). The production of the synthetic crRNAs and tracrRNA we used (IDT) is proprietary, but likely involves solid-phase synthesis, which is not based on <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and therefore does not require the presence of the guanine nucleotides.</p><p>To complete our response to Essential Revision 1, we believe the use of the synthetic gRNAs is likely to be the main reason why we were able to reach similar results as Wu et al., 2018 but targeting three loci instead of four. In Wu et al.’s work, there was a total of 32 gRNAs designed to target <italic>slc24a5</italic>, <italic>tyr</italic>, <italic>tbx16</italic>, or <italic>tbx5a</italic>. 14 had no mismatch with the genomic binding site; 9 had one mismatch; 9 had two mismatches. Wu et al., 2018 tested two combinations of three gRNAs on <italic>slc24a5</italic>, but phenotypic penetrance (proportion of 2-dpf larvae without eye pigmentation) did not raise above ~ 55% (Wu et al., 2018, Figure 2B). The two sets included a gRNA with one mismatch (<italic>slc24a5</italic> gRNA 1). A detailed survey of Wu et al.’s gRNAs is available in the GitHub and Zenodo repositories (<italic>wu_gRNAs.xlsx</italic>). Overall, as we reached similar results of phenotypic penetrance for common genes with fewer targeted loci per gene, it seems likely that the extra target site in Wu et al., 2018 compensates for the shortcomings of the <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed sgRNAs.</p><p>The synthetic crRNAs and tracrRNA from IDT carry proprietary Alt-R modifications to improve nuclease resistance once in the cell. However, Hoshijima et al., 2019 tested in zebrafish embryos gRNAs (crRNA/tracrRNA duplexes) without these modifications and did not find strong differences with those carrying the Alt-R modifications.</p><p>As the use of synthetic gRNAs circumvents <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, including quality control checks and steps that may fail and need to be repeated, it requires substantially less laboratory work. If this is accounted for in the cost analysis, it is likely that synthetic gRNAs are not, or only slightly, more expensive than <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed gRNAs.</p><p>To conclude, synthetic gRNAs should be preferred because they are more mutagenic (Hoshijima et al., 2019), hence fewer loci need to be mutated per gene. While the decision to use synthetic or <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed gRNAs can be based on financial considerations, targeting fewer loci also reduces potential off-target effects and possibly the number of unviable embryos (see Essential Revision 1). Use of synthetic gRNAs also helps standardising injections, therefore generating results that are more predictable and more reproducible between researchers and laboratories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Could headloop PCR be used for the quantification of mutagenesis efficiency (indel-producing mutation rate) of Cas9/gRNA? How sensitive is this method? Could small indels (such as 1-bp insertion or deletion) be detected by the headloop PCR?</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether headloop PCR can be used to estimate mutagenesis, we derived a headloop score for each sample from the standard PCR and headloop PCR band intensities on an agarose gel (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The score correlated well with the percentage of mutated reads measured by deep sequencing (r = 0.66, n = 29 samples tested from n = 7 loci). The score was also a significant predictor of the proportion of mutated reads by linear regression (p &lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.44) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). A notable deviation was <italic>tbx16</italic> locus D, which repeatedly produced a low headloop PCR score (&lt; 0.5) even though the percentage of mutated reads was high (Figure 2A). We could not find a clear explanation for this. Using the line of best fit to gauge the proportion of mutated reads solely from the headloop PCR score would give an estimate in the correct range (&lt; 20% mutated reads away from the true measure) about three times out of four (18/23 samples, not including the diluted samples for which the proportion of mutated reads was not directly measured). In summary, headloop PCR can be used to approximate the proportion of mutated alleles in F0 knockout embryos. We have added a mention of these results in the text (Results, section <italic>Headloop PCR […]</italic>).</p><p>As to sensitivity towards small indels, we hypothesised that even small indels or point mutations may be sufficient to prevent formation of the hairpin as the use of a non-proofreading enzyme always gave a positive result (i.e. no headloop PCR band, Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). To confirm this, we tested whether we could detect two small indels in stable mutant lines we had previously genotyped by sequencing (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). The first is a 1-bp deletion followed by a point mutation (T&gt;A) in gene <italic>apoea</italic>; the second is a 2-bp deletion in gene <italic>cd2ap</italic>. For each line, we genotyped by headloop PCR 32 embryos produced from an outcross of heterozygous to wild-type (i.e. embryos were either heterozygous or wild-type). All genotype calls by headloop PCR were then verified by Sanger sequencing. For both alleles, headloop PCR was 100% accurate at distinguishing heterozygous from wild-type embryos. We conclude that headloop PCR is sensitive to small deletions. We have added these results in the text (Results, section <italic>Headloop PCR […]</italic>). Sensitivity to small insertions remains to be tested, although it seems likely given the present results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In addition to indels, deletions between two double strand breaks induced by two gRNAs are also important for the generation of biallelic knockouts of the target gene. The authors showed the analysis of mutations in each site (such as in Figure 2A), is it possible to quantify the distribution and contribution of all the different deletions?</p></disp-quote><p>We found by Sanger sequencing that large deletions spanning multiple targeted sites can occur (Figure 2E); it would indeed be interesting to quantify their abundance in the pool of alleles. Wu et al., 2018 made an attempt in that direction. They performed long-read sequencing (PacBio) on six embryos which had been injected with a four-RNP set targeting <italic>sox32</italic>. They found that 5.7 ± 1.8% of reads had deletions spanning multiple targeted sites (Wu et al., 2018, Figure S5A). As four sites were targeted within the gene, the average frequency for one large deletion would be 0.95% (there are six possible large deletions with four targeted sites). While it provides an estimate, we question how precise this measure is, which will also illustrate the potential hurdles to be considered for such an experiment.</p><p>Quantifying the distribution of indels around each targeted site together with the large deletions between targeted sites requires deep sequencing of a genomic region spanning all targeted sites in continuous reads. This would typically represent a region of at least multiple kilobases if each target site is on a distinct exon. Sequencing of long DNA molecules in continuous reads is not possible using Illumina MiSeq (set read length of maximum 300 bp) or Sanger sequencing (maximum read length of ~ 800 bp). It is achievable with long-read sequencing technologies, namely Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Nanopore) or Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). To increase the relative concentration of DNA molecules from the genomic region of interest and thereby achieve high sequencing coverage, deep sequencing is typically preceded by PCR amplification. To take <italic>slc24a5</italic> as an example (Figure 2E), the shortest possible wild-type amplicon spanning all three target sites is ~ 3 kb. If deletion 3 (locus B–locus A) occurred, the amplicon would now be ~ 100 bp, i.e. ~ 30× shorter. PCR would therefore be performed on a mix of long (without large deletions, ~ 3 kb) and short (with large deletion, ~ 100 bp) alleles. However, DNA polymerases preferably amplify shorter products (Dabney and Meyer, 2012), hence biasing the original relative abundance. While preparing the samples for Sanger sequencing of <italic>slc24a5</italic>, we observed that while we could amplify the B–D and D–A wild-type amplicons (respectively 1.7 kb and 1.5 kb), the band was absent for the injected samples. For these, only strong bands at lower lengths were present, which likely represent a substantial PCR length bias. Therefore, for <italic>slc24a5</italic>, the 100-bp allele (deletion 3) would be amplified disproportionately over the 3-kb allele (without deletion). Accordingly, counting the number of sequencing reads from each allele as a proxy for their original abundance in the pool is likely to over-estimate the frequency of the large deletions. Wu et al., 2018 performed amplification prior to sequencing; therefore, we think their estimate might represent an upper limit.</p><p>Long-read sequencing protocols which do not involve amplification were developed to address such limitations. The Nanopore and PacBio amplification-free sequencing protocols follow similar a logic: CRISPR-Cas9 is used to cleave the genomic region of interest. Adapters are then attached to the fragments so they are preferentially sequenced (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 2019; Tsai et al., 2017). Fragments of the original genomic DNA are sequenced, which prevents PCR bias. However, the number of DNA molecules available for sequencing is low as a result. Therefore, these protocols achieve substantially lower sequencing coverage of the region, even with longer sequencing times. This is likely to be an issue for detecting both the large deletions between targeted sites and many of the smaller indels around each site.</p><p>Sequencing coverage for an amplification-free protocol may be around 200× (eg. Hafford-Tear et al., 2019, Supplementary Figure S1; C. M. Watson et al., 2020, Table 2; Wieben et al., 2019, Table 1). In such a scenario, there would be more than 20% chance of missing a large deletion at a frequency below 1.6% in the pool of alleles. Therefore, many large deletions may be missed in such an experiment, even if their frequencies in the pool of alleles were pertinent.</p><p>In the case of the small indels around each targeted site, we discovered through deep sequencing that there was substantial diversity in alleles, including within individual animals. Most mutations at each locus are present at low frequencies in individual animals (&gt; 95% mutations detected at each locus are present at frequencies below 10% in individual animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This may be because the mutation happened later in development or in a cell that did not contribute many daughter cells. High coverage is necessary to detect and quantify this diversity. Many of these alleles would likely be missed by the lower coverage of an amplification-free experiment.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Most mutations are found at low frequencies in individual animals.</title><p>Frequency of each mutation in individual F0 knockout embryos (samples).

This would be an attempt towards quantifying the frequency of large deletions within a single targeted gene (eg. <italic>slc24a5</italic>) and generated by a single three-RNP set (eg. <italic>slc24a5</italic> gRNAs A, B, D). However, these frequencies are likely to be specific to each gene or three-RNP set. For example, a parameter which likely influences the rate at which a specific large deletion is generated is the distance between the two targeted sites (eg. Wu et al., 2018, Figure 6F). We also hypothesise that chromatin state of the genomic region may be a determinant. We would predict that two simultaneous double-strand breaks occurring in euchromatin are more likely to cause a large deletion than in heterochromatin. Incidentally, CRISPR-Cas9 activity may weakly correlate with gene expression and chromatin accessibility of the target site in zebrafish (Uusi-Mäkelä et al., 2018). Furthermore, multiple F0 knockout larvae would likely need to be pooled to gather sufficient genomic DNA. The result would thus be an average of multiple animals, while we have observed with deep sequencing that the most frequent alleles are often specific to each animal (see Figure 2B: two animals injected with the same RNP only share in average ~ 3 of their top 10 most frequent mutations).</p><p>In summary, PCR amplification followed by long-read sequencing is technically sound but would give somewhat over-estimated frequencies of large deletions. Protocols which do not rely on amplification exist, but the lower sequencing coverage they achieve is unlikely to be sufficient to detect these alleles which are presumably infrequent. The experiment is also costly, while the result it would generate is probably not generalisable to other RNP sets, genes, and animals.</p><p>While accurately quantifying the frequency of large deletions spanning multiple targeted sites remains challenging, we may be able to offer more estimates based on the literature.</p><p>Kim and Zhang, 2020 used the large deletions spanning multiple targeted sites to create stable zebrafish knockout lines where multiple exons are deleted. In a first experiment, they injected a mix of 7 sgRNAs targeting different exons of <italic>smarca2</italic>. They then grew 11 of these fish to adulthood as F0 founders and crossed them to wild types to generate 154 F1 animals, which were screened once adults for the presence of large deletions. A total of 8 animals issued from 3 F0 founders carried large deletions (Kim and Zhang, 2020, Table 1: 1/8, 4/8, 3/19). Assuming that the germline genotypes of the F0 founders was a random sampling from the F0 pool of alleles, the proportion of F1 adults with large deletions may be representative of the frequency of large deletions within each F0 parent. In the 3 positive F0 founders, this would amount to frequencies: 12.5% (1/8), 50% (4/8), and 15.8% (3/19). Of the 7 sgRNAs, one targeted exon 1, then two targeted each of exon 3, 15, 28 (Kim and Zhang, 2020, Figure 1). However, no mutations were detected in exon 3. There were therefore three possible large deletion (exon 1–exon 15, exon 1–exon 28, exon 15–exon 28). The average frequency of a site-spanning deletion within each positive F0 animal would thus be around 4.2%, 16.7%, 5.7%. However, most (3/11) F0 founders did not produce F1 embryos positive for large deletions. Assuming these F0 animals were negative for large deletions, and all 11 F0 animals were pooled together during a sequencing experiment, the average frequency of a site-spanning deletion would be around 2.4%. In a second, similar experiment, Kim and Zhang injected two pairs of sgRNAs, each targeting two exons of <italic>rnf185</italic> or <italic>rnf215</italic> (Kim and Zhang, 2020, Figure 2 and Figure 3). 9 F0 founders were grown to adulthood, then crossed to generate a total of 48 F1 adult fish that were screened for large deletions. For <italic>rnf185</italic>, 2 F1 animals generated from 2 of the F0 founders carried large deletions (Kim and Zhang, 2020, Table 2: 1/5, 1/5). This would amount to a frequency of this allele around 20% in the two F0 founders, but a probability of the large deletion occurring around 4.4% (large deletion occurred at 20% frequency in 2/9 animals). For <italic>rnf185</italic>, 3 F1 animals generated from 3 of the F0 founders carried large deletions (Kim and Zhang, 2020, Table 2: 1/5, 1/5, 1/5). This would amount to a frequency of this allele around 20% in the three F0 founders, but a probability of the large deletion occurring around 6.6% (large deletion occurred at 20% frequency in 2/9 animals).</p><p>Varshney et al., 2015 performed similar experiments. They injected embryos with a pair of sgRNAs targeting two sites within one of 15 genes. They grew F0 embryos to adulthood and crossed them to generate 769 F1 embryos. Among them, 24 had a large deletion spanning the two targeted sites. Similarly, if we assume that the germline genotype was a random sampling of the F0 pool of alleles, this would amount to an average frequency of large deletions in the F0 animals around 3% (24/769).</p><p>Overall, estimates for the probability of a large deletion to occur range between 0.95% (Wu et al., 2018) and 6.6% (Kim and Zhang, 2020), with variability between injected animals, targeted genes, and RNP sets. Importantly, the three above studies used <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed gRNAs. As mutagenesis is likely to be a strong determinant influencing the probability of large deletions, these may under-estimate what can be achieved with synthetic RNPs.</p><p>Finally, while quantifying the frequency of large deletions when using synthetic RNPs is certainly interesting for applications that specifically require them (eg. Kim and Zhang, 2020), it is important to highlight that the alleles carrying large deletions are extremely likely to represent loss-of-function mutations. Their contributions therefore add to frameshift mutations and mutations of key residues of the protein as all probable loss-of-function mutations, as we developed in the text (Results, section <italic>Sequencing of targeted loci […]</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 1C,D: The authors compared the effects of the injection of 1, 2, 3, and 4 loci. How were the 1, 2, and 3 loci selected from the four target sites? Will each of the four loci give the same or different phenotypic ratio if tested individually? Will different combinations of 2 loci or 3 loci give the same or different phenotypic ratio? Or which combination of 2 loci or 3 loci will give the highest mutagenic effect? For example, in Figure 1C, the 3-loci showed comparable effect with 4-loci, while the 2-loci is less effective; is it possible to find other 2-loci combinations which could show higher mutagenic efficiency than the current 2-loci, such that the effect of the new 2-loci combination is as good as the 3-loci or 4-loci combination? Conversely, in Figure 1D, the 2-loci already showed the highest mutagenic effect, is it because of this particular 2-loci combination, or any 2-loci combination will show the same efficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer specifically the first question raised, the order when targeting gradually more loci (Figure 1E,F) followed the IDT ranking when selecting a single crRNA per exon (see Material and methods, section <italic>RNP pooling</italic>). Therefore, when targeting a single locus, only the top predicted gRNA is injected; when targeting two loci, the top two predicted gRNAs are injected together; etc. Based on the deep sequencing data (Figure 2A), this amounts to essentially the same as picking the order randomly within the top 3 or 4 gRNAs, as the top predicted gRNA of the set is only rarely the most mutagenic one in practice. Indeed, when we sequenced 10 genes targeted by three or four-gRNA sets, there were only 3 sets in which the top predicted gRNA by IDT (gRNA A) was also the top performing gRNA (<italic>slc24a5</italic>, <italic>tbx5a</italic>, <italic>scn1lab</italic>). This is what is expected by chance alone (if the most mutagenic gRNA of each set was drawn randomly, 31% of gRNA sets would have the top predicted gRNA as most mutagenic gRNA). In other words, it is not possible to guess above chance the IDT ranking from the mutagenesis levels alone.</p><p>For many genes, it might be possible to find a better solution than the three-RNP strategy, i.e. to target only one or two loci while obtaining good phenotypic penetrance. The solution would be to test for instance ten gRNAs for the gene of interest, ideally that all target sequences coding for essential residues of the protein. Deep sequencing would then be performed to quantify the mutations they each generated and only the top one or two gRNAs that are highly mutagenic with a bias towards frameshift mutations would be selected. Examples of such ‘outstanding’ gRNAs can be found in our results. For example, the second gRNA of the <italic>tyr</italic>-targeting set (Figure 2A, <italic>tyr</italic> gRNA B) is clearly excellent: mutagenesis is high and it generates more frameshift mutations than expected by chance. This likely explains why injecting only <italic>tyr</italic> gRNA A and B was sufficient to achieve full phenotypic penetrance (Figure 1D, number of loci = 2). The disproportionate contribution of <italic>tyr</italic> gRNA B can also be seen in Figure 2F where the proportion of frameshift alleles rise sharply when <italic>tyr</italic> gRNA B is added to the mix (number of loci = 2). Another example is <italic>mpv17</italic> gRNA B (see Figure 2A,B). However, testing numerous gRNAs until these excellent gRNAs are found is not a feasible solution if tens or hundreds of genes were to be tested in a screen. Simply buying one supplementary gRNA for each gene would greatly increase the total cost. An essential criterion for success of the method we developed was that it could be readily applied to any open-reading frame during a large genetic screen (see Results, section <italic>Three synthetic gRNAs […]</italic>). This is the reason why we did not want to test different combinations of gRNAs until we found one giving optimal results, nor did we target essential residues of the protein for each tested gene, as many genes selected for screening are likely to lack annotations. Using a combination of three synthetic gRNAs as we propose is a scalable solution to this challenge: as we demonstrate, it is applicable to any gene with little or no pre-screening of the gRNAs.</p><p>However, we developed headloop PCR exactly as an attempt to provide a solution to this challenge. It is a rapid and inexpensive way to test the gRNAs. Sufficient mutagenesis can be confirmed (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1), and even broadly estimated (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). With this tool, we suggest that gRNAs could be tested during a validation round (see Discussion, <italic>Design of F0 knockout screens</italic>), which will ensure that the proposed three-gRNA solution gives high phenotypic penetrance for every gene tested.</p><p>Being able to systematically achieve high phenotypic penetrance while targeting fewer than three loci per gene would be a further improvement of the current method, as it would likely generate less unviable embryos and there would be less potential off-target effects. We offer suggestions (to be tested) on how to do this in the Discussion (section <italic>Other technical considerations […]</italic>). Meticulous design of the gRNAs, including using prediction of editing outcomes (Shen et al., 2018), followed by systematic quantification of mutagenesis by headloop PCR may allow for fewer loci to be targeted in each gene without costly and time-consuming screening of gRNAs. In any case, further improvements cannot be designed for specific genes as it would not be applicable to a large genetic screen.</p><p>Finally, we believe that this gene-specific search for an optimal combination of gRNAs may be useful in cases where 1) targeting three loci per gene seems to be too much, for instance because it generates many unviable embryos, 2) the experiment will be repeated many times. Such a case may be the F0 <italic>crystal</italic> fish (Figure 4C), if the approach was to become routine for imaging applications. Injecting three sets of three-RNP worked well but generated 50% unviable embryos. As the mutations induced by each gRNA of each set were quantified here, it may be possible to repeat the experiment but injecting only gRNAs that were highly mutagenic and generated a surplus of frameshift mutations (for instance <italic>mpv17</italic> gRNA B). An additional approach would be to study the gene structure of <italic>slc45a2</italic>, <italic>mitfa</italic>, and <italic>mpv17</italic> and select gRNAs that target essential residues of the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 6: The phenotypes of <italic>scn1lab</italic> F0 knockouts are more severe than those of <italic>scn1lab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant.

As a comparison, in the stable mutant experiment, the effect size between wild types and heterozygotes (Cohen’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.28) is significantly different (p = 0.04) from the effect size between wild types and homozygotes (Cohen’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1.57). The statistical test is a <italic>Z</italic>-test used for comparing two studies in meta-analysis (Borenstein et al., 2009). In sum, effect size comparisons demonstrate that <italic>scn1lab</italic> F0 knockout phenotypes are of similar severity to the <italic>scn1lab<sup>Δ44</sup></italic> stable mutant phenotype. We have added this analysis in the text (Results, section <italic>Continuous traits […]</italic>).</p><p>To reinforce this conclusion, we gathered and analysed data from a different <italic>scn1lab</italic> mutant line (Ellen Hoffman, unpublished), termed <italic>double indemnity</italic> (<italic>didy<sup>s552</sup></italic>) (Schoonheim et al., 2010). Unfortunately, the data was not collected in a way that allowed us to perform the same multi-parameter analysis as in Figure 6B,C. As metric for activity, we used the time the animal spent above an activity threshold (ViewPoint parameter <italic>freezing</italic> = 3) within each 1-minute epoch (eg. fish 1 was active for 3 seconds between minute 3 and 4). For each animal, these data were summed within each time window to obtain the total time spent active during that window (eg. fish 1 was active for a total of 3000 seconds during day 1 of tracking). The data for each animal were then normalised by calculating the Z-score from the mean of the wild-type or <italic>scrambled</italic>-injected siblings (eg. fish 1 was 2 standard deviations less active than its wild-type siblings during day 1 of tracking). <italic>scn1lab</italic> knockout animals, either F0 knockout larvae or stable mutant homozygotes, were consistently less active than their control siblings (wild-type or <italic>scrambled</italic>-injected) during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This effect was within the same range in F0 knockout experiments and stable mutant experiments, either <italic>scn1lab<sup>Δ44</sup></italic> or <italic>didy</italic>. During the night, <italic>scn1lab</italic> knockout animals tended to be more active than their control siblings, although this result was more variable between experiments. While the effect is clear in F0 knockout experiment 2 and the <italic>didy</italic> experiment, <italic>scn1lab<sup>Δ44</sup></italic> homozygotes and knockouts in F0 knockout experiment 1 were not more active than their control siblings when comparing data summed across the entire night. However, their hyperactivity is unambiguous during the second half of the night (Figure 6A).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title><italic>scn1lab</italic> F0 knockouts do not have consistently more severe behavioural phenotypes than stable <italic>scn1lab</italic> mutant lines.</title><p>Total time active, represented as deviation from the paired wild-type (<italic>+/+</italic>) or <italic>scrambled</italic>-injected (<italic>scr</italic>) mean (Z-score), during the day (left) or the night (right).
