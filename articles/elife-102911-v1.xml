key foundation for all subsequent auditory processing. Stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) are a potentially powerful alternative to traditional behavioral experiments for estimating cochlear tuning without invasive testing, as is necessary in humans. Which methods accurately predict cochlear tuning remains controversial due to only a single animal study comparing SFOAE-based, behavioral, and cochlear frequency tuning in the same species. The budgerigar (<italic>Melopsittacus undulatus</italic>) is a parakeet species with human-like behavioral sensitivity to many sounds and the capacity to mimic speech. Intriguingly, previous studies of critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios in budgerigars show that behavioral tuning sharpness increases dramatically with increasing frequency from 1 to 3.5 kHz, doubling once per octave with peak tuning sharpness from 3.5 to 4 kHz. The pattern contrasts with slower monotonic growth of behavioral tuning sharpness with increasing frequency in other animals, including most avian species, suggesting a possible auditory specialization in budgerigars. We measured SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning in budgerigars, for comparison to previously reported behavioral results. SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning sharpness both increased monotonically and relatively slowly for higher frequencies, in contrast to the behavioral pattern. SFOAE-based tuning in budgerigars accurately predicted cochlear frequency tuning, and both measures aligned with typical patterns of cochlear tuning in other species. Divergent behavioral tuning in budgerigars is unlikely attributable to the periphery and could reflect specializations for central processing of masked signals. Our findings highlight the value of SFOAEs for estimating cochlear tuning and caution against direct inference of peripheral tuning from behavioral critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>budgerigar</kwd><kwd>otoacoustic emission</kwd><kwd>auditory-nerve</kwd><kwd>frequency tuning</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC017519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Kenneth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC021953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Kenneth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31-DC021889</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzales</surname><given-names>Leslie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC001641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carney</surname><given-names>Laurel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Otoacoustic emissions recorded noninvasively from the ear canal accurately predict cochlear frequency tuning in an avian species, in contrast to previously tested classical behavioral methods.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cochlear frequency tuning provides the foundation for tonotopic processing by the auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourk et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schreiner and Langner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song et al., 2024</xref>). Otoacoustic emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kemp, 1978</xref>) and behavioral testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore, 1978</xref>) are two methods currently available to evaluate cochlear tuning in humans, and in other cases for which direct measurement is not feasible. Which methods accurately predict cochlear tuning remains controversial due to limited studies comparing otoacoustic, behavioral, and cochlear tuning in the same species.</p><p>Stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) are low-level acoustic signals recorded in response to tones that depend on active processes within the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kemp, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shera and Guinan, 1999</xref>). SFOAE delay is expected to vary with cochlear tuning sharpness based on filter theory, with longer delays implicating sharper tuning. Previous studies found long SFOAE delays in humans, consistent with exceptional tuning sharpness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shera et al., 2002</xref>). However, otoacoustic tuning estimation remains an indirect approach requiring validation. Behavioral experiments infer tuning from masking patterns, typically based on variation in tone thresholds across maskers differing in spectral content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore, 1978</xref>). However, behavioral tuning estimates depend on central processing of noisy signals in addition to cochlear tuning, and results vary across stimulus paradigms with debate as to which methods better approximate actual tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oxenham and Shera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruggero and Temchin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leschke et al., 2022</xref>). Whether otoacoustic or behavioral methods provide closer estimates of actual cochlear frequency tuning remains unknown.</p><p>Several reports in nonhuman species have tested the extent to which SFOAE delays predict tuning of auditory-nerve responses at the output of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergevin et al., 2015</xref>). These studies found that auditory-nerve tuning quality exceeds <italic>N</italic><sub>SFOAE</sub> (SFOAE delay in stimulus cycles) by a âtuning ratioâ that decreases from ~3 to 1 from apex to base across several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shera et al., 2010</xref>). To our knowledge, only a single study has compared SFOAE and behavioral tuning estimates to auditory-nerve recordings in the same species, ferret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sumner et al., 2018</xref>). SFOAE-based, behavioral, and auditory-nerve tuning quality in ferret all increased monotonically for higher frequencies, in broad accordance with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sumner et al., 2018</xref>). A stronger test of SFOAE vs. behavioral tuning estimates could be obtained by studying species with specialized behavioral and/or physiological frequency-resolving abilities.</p><p>The budgerigar (<italic>Melopsittacus undulatus</italic>) is a parakeet species with well-known auditory processing abilities from behavioral studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dooling et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ryals et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henry et al., 2024</xref>). Intriguingly, previous behavioral studies of critical bands and psychophysical tuning curves in budgerigars report rapidly increasing behavioral tuning sharpness with increasing frequency to a distinct peak from 3.5 to 4 kHz, beyond which tuning sharpness declines dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saunders et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saunders et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saunders and Pallone, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooling et al., 2000</xref>). The pattern is unusual compared to results from other species, including birds with highly similar audiograms, suggesting a possible specialization of the budgerigarâs auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okanoya and Dooling, 1987</xref>). Budgerigarsâ average behavioral tuning Q<sub>10</sub> increases by 2.65 dB/octave from 1 to 3.5 kHz (i.e., nearly doubling for each octave increase; slope of 10 * log<sub>10</sub>[Q<sub>10</sub>]). In contrast, slopes closer to 1 dB/octave have typically been reported in humans (e.g., 0.9 dB/octave; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oxenham and Shera, 2003</xref>) and various animal behavioral studies (ferret: 1.25 dB/octave in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sumner et al., 2018</xref>; macaque: 0.55 dB/octave in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2018</xref>; European starling: 0.95 dB/octave in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Langemann et al., 1995</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral frequency tuning in the budgerigar and comparison to other avian species.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Published behavioral studies employing multiple stimulus paradigms indicate rapidly increasing behavioral tuning sharpness to a distinct peak from 3.5 to 4 kHz.

The critical ratio is the threshold signal-to-noise ratio for tone detection in wideband noise, which scales linearly with tuning bandwidth in the power spectrum model of auditory masking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fletcher, 1940</xref>). In birds, most species have similar critical ratios to one another, increasing monotonically with higher frequencies by 2â3 dB/octave, as in humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooling et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, budgerigar critical ratios diverge markedly at mid-to-high frequencies, with ~8 dB lower (more sensitive) thresholds than other bird species from 3 to 4 kHz and intriguingly little variation in critical ratios below 4 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dooling and Saunders, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okanoya and Dooling, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farabaugh et al., 1998</xref>). Constant critical ratios indicate constant bandwidth in the power spectrum model, and consequently, increasing tuning quality by 3 dB/octave, in general agreement with budgerigarsâ behavioral critical bands and psychophysical tuning curves. Notably, divergent critical ratios in the budgerigar occur despite similar audiogram shape in budgerigars to other avian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okanoya and Dooling, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooling et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, unusual behavioral tuning in budgerigars is not simply explainable by declining audibility above 4 kHz. On the other hand, the impact of sloping audibility on behavioral tuning estimates remains poorly understood.</p><p>Because auditory-nerve tuning has not been measured in budgerigars, it remains unknown whether budgerigarsâ unusual critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios reflect specialized cochlear tuning, and if so, whether the pattern is detectable using SFOAEs. The present study compared the extent to which SFOAE and existing behavioral tuning measures predict actual cochlear tuning in budgerigars, a species that does not show slow monotonic growth of behavioral tuning sharpness with increasing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). SFOAE-based tuning, estimated with low-level swept-tone stimuli, was compared to measures of auditory-nerve tuning and to previously reported behavioral measures of frequency tuning. In budgerigars, SFOAE and auditory-nerve tuning sharpness both increased relatively slowly and monotonically with frequency, as in most other species, and in contrast to previously reported behavioral results. Thus, SFOAE delay predicted auditory-nerve tuning sharpness with greater accuracy than behavioral critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios, and we find no evidence of a peripheral specialization in budgerigars.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Budgerigar SFOAEs</title><p>SFOAEs were recorded from 22 ears in 14 animals using swept-frequency tones presented at 40 dB SPL.

Within the frequency of measurable emissions, SFOAEs in individual ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, colored lines) typically showed three or more deep spectral notches in emission level. Frequency regions near spectral notches, or for which SFOAE level was within 10 dB of the estimated noise floor, were excluded from subsequent analyses as described below (see âMaterials and methods: SFOAE processingâ).

The reasons for species differences in <italic>r</italic> are unknown, though level dependence of <italic>r</italic> in previous studies suggests that differences in hearing sensitivity could be one factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergevin et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, mammalian studies suggest an apical-basal transition point for <italic>r</italic>, basal to which <italic>r</italic> approaches ~1 and apical to which <italic>r</italic> varies inversely with frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shera and Charaziak, 2019</xref>).

Because <italic>r</italic> is such a key parameter in otoacoustic estimation of cochlear frequency tuning, further studies of its taxonomic variation, level dependence, and physiological basis are highly warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergevin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manley, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Measurements of chicken auditory-nerve tuning were drawn from two previously published studies and were limited to CFs less than 3.35 kHz due to their recording methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saunders et al., 1996</xref>). CFs likely exist up to at least 5 kHz based on the chickenâs behavioral audiogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), but were not sampled due to the scala tympani approach employed by these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saunders et al., 1996</xref>). Consequently, computing <italic>r</italic> across the full range of the chicken <italic>N</italic><sub>SFOAE</sub> function (0.5â4.6 kHz) required moderate extrapolation of the auditory-nerve Q<sub>10</sub> trendline from 3.4 to 4.6 kHz based on lower CF (1.7â3.35 kHz) data. While probably reasonable given continued increase of Q<sub>10</sub> above ~3 kHz in many other avian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sachs et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gleich and Manley, 2000</xref>), reliance in part on extrapolated chicken Q<sub>10</sub> remains a limitation of this study. It should also be noted that Q<sub>10</sub> data from a third chicken study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salvi et al., 1992</xref>) were considered but ultimately not included in our estimation of chicken <italic>r</italic> because CFs were less than 2 kHz and the reported Q<sub>10</sub> values appeared somewhat discrepant (i.e., some reported values as high as 24).</p><p>The estimates of behavioral frequency selectivity referenced in the present study were originally obtained using three simultaneous masking paradigms: psychophysical tuning curves for probe-tone detection in tonal or narrowband maskers, critical bands for tone detection in bandlimited noise, and critical ratios for tone detection in wideband noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dooling and Saunders, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saunders et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saunders et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saunders and Pallone, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuhn and Saunders, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooling et al., 2000</xref>). All three behavioral measures show that perceptual frequency selectivity in budgerigars is greatest from 3.5 to 4 kHz and declines markedly at higher and lower frequencies. Suggestive of a possible auditory specialization, this pattern differs substantially from behavioral findings in humans and other model species, which show monotonically increasing behavioral frequency selectivity for higher frequencies. Critically, the behavioral findings contrast with physiological tuning estimates of the current study, which show monotonically increasing SFOAE phase gradients with increasing frequency as well as monotonically increasing auditory-nerve Q<sub>10</sub>/Q<sub>ERB</sub> values for higher CFs. Thus, neither SFOAEs nor auditory-nerve recordings suggest the existence of a peripheral auditory specialization that could explain prior behavioral findings in this species.</p><p>While the reason for disparate behavioral and SFOAE/auditory-nerve findings in budgerigars is unknown, the mismatch highlights the need for caution in inferring cochlear frequency selectivity using behavioral critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, critical ratios, and simultaneous masking procedures. While the budgerigar behavioral studies of frequency tuning were conducted several decades ago, the methods are based on the still widely used power-spectrum model of auditory masking and remain commonly employed in animal behavioral research (e.g., critical bands and ratios: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yost and Shofner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">King et al., 2015</xref>; simultaneous masking: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2018</xref>). Forward-masking procedures are hypothesized to more accurately predict cochlear frequency tuning in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sumner et al., 2018</xref>), but evidence from nonhuman studies is mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sumner et al., 2018</xref> found that forward-masking behavioral results better predicted auditory-nerve tuning than simultaneous masking in the ferret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sumner et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruggero and Temchin, 2005</xref> argued that forward-masking behavioral paradigms can substantially overestimate cochlear frequency selectivity, highlighting several cases where simultaneous-masking procedures produce close quantitative predictions of auditory-nerve tuning (e.g., guinea pig, chinchilla, macaque; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruggero and Temchin, 2005</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joris et al., 2011</xref> for macaque auditory-nerve tuning). Interestingly in the budgerigar, psychophysical tuning curves obtained with pure-tone forward masking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuhn and Saunders, 1980</xref> have Q<sub>10</sub> values that are greater than twice simultaneous-masking values at the same frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; red triangles), while also far exceeding (by two- or threefold) the maximum auditory-nerve Q<sub>10</sub> values reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It remains untested whether notched-noise forward masking procedures would produce closer estimates of auditory-nerve frequency tuning. In summary, at least in budgerigars, it appears unlikely that any of the various previously employed forward or simultaneous masking paradigms reasonably estimate cochlear frequency selectivity.</p><p>A potential explanation for the disparity between behavioral and the other measures of frequency tuning lies in the nature of the measurements. Otoacoustic and auditory-nerve responses both reflect peripheral physiological processes originating in the cochlea. However, behavioral measures of frequency selectivity necessarily involve the entire auditory pathway and central nervous system, including neural mechanisms for processing masked signals, and are best explained by models that include both peripheral and central auditory system processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maxwell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan et al., 2023</xref>). The unique pattern observed in the budgerigarâs behavioral Q<sub>10</sub> trendline may then reflect specializations for masked processing in the central auditory pathway of this highly vocal and gregarious species. While a previous study investigated neural tone-in-noise processing in the budgerigarâs inferior colliculus, the study did not explore the impact of noise bandwidth on neural detection thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; which would be needed to estimate neural critical bands). Note that the frequency selectivity of inferior colliculus response maps obtained with single tones of varying frequency and level showed no obvious peak in tuning quality for neural CFs from 3.5 to 4 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henry et al., 2017</xref>), similar to the present auditory-nerve results. Finally, several histological studies of budgerigar cochlear morphology also revealed no obvious specializations consistent with a peripheral auditory specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, SFOAE-based and auditory-nerve measures of tuning sharpness increased for higher frequencies in the budgerigars, and quantitative SFOAE predictions based on <italic>r</italic> from a different bird species (chicken) closely approximated actual budgerigar auditory-nerve tuning. The pattern is similar to findings in other avian and mammalian species and contrasts with the unusual pattern of behavioral frequency tuning in budgerigars, which has maximum tuning quality from 3.5 to 4 kHz consistent with an auditory specialization. These results highlight the need for caution in interpreting behavioral measures of frequency tuning, which can show substantial deviation from cochlear tuning curves due to central processing mechanisms and other factors that necessarily influence behavioral detection of masked signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Budgerigars were sourced from a local breeder or our institutional breeding program.

Acoustic stimuli were generated in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA; 50 kHz sampling frequency) and processed with a digital pre-emphasis filter (5000-point FIR) that corrected for the frequency response (i.e., magnitude and phase) of the system. The frequency response of the system was measured with the probe microphone at 249 linearly spaced frequencies (1 V peak amplitude) from 0.05 to 15.1 kHz. Stimuli were converted to analog at maximum scale (10 V peak amplitude; National Instruments PCIe-6251, Austin, TX, USA), attenuated to the required levels (Tucker Davis Technologies PA5, Alachua, FL, USA), and amplified using a headphone buffer (Tucker Davis Technologies HB7).</p><p>Stimuli for measuring SFOAEs were swept tones, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalluri and Shera, 2013</xref>. Two distinct acoustic signals were presented: a probe and a suppressor. The probe consisted of a tone linearly swept at a constant rate from 500 Hz to 8 kHz over 2.05 s, presented at 40 dB SPL. The suppressor consisted of a tone swept at a constant rate from 540 Hz to 8.04 kHz over 2.05 s, presented at 55 dB SPL. Stimuli were presented in repeating sequences in which the probe was presented first, then the suppressor, and finally the probe and the suppressor simultaneously. All stimuli had 25 ms raised-cosine onset and offset ramps. Each experiment consisted of 40 repetitions of the stimulus sequence. There was a half-second silent time gap between presentations of each stimulus sequence. Response waveforms were amplified by 40 dB (Etymotic ER10B+) prior to sampling at 50 kHz and storage on a computer hard drive.</p><p>After the completion of the experiments, birds were given a subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg/kg atipamezole and placed in a heated recovery chamber until fully alert.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Auditory-nerve recordings</title><p>The surgical procedures for neurophysiological recordings in budgerigars have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Equipment is described above in the section on SFOAE recordings, except where noted. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with a weight-dependent subcutaneous injection of ketamine and dexmedetomidine, as indicated above, and a head-post was mounted to the dorsal surface of the skull with dental cement to facilitate head positioning. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic device inside a sound-attenuating chamber, with the beak projected downward. The right ear was aligned with an earphone/microphone assembly and sealed with silicone grease. Body temperature was maintained at 40Â°C using a homeothermic control unit, and breathing rate was monitored throughout experiments. Animals were maintained in an areflexic state through continuous subcutaneous infusion of additional ketamine (3â10 mg/kg/h) and dexmedetomidine (0.08â0.2 mg/kg/h), along with physiological saline, using a syringe pump. DPOAEs were recorded periodically throughout experiments to test for possible deterioration of inner-ear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Animals were euthanized at the conclusion of recordings, typically after 10â12 h.</p><p>Access to the auditory nerve was accomplished by aspirating the right third of the cerebellum to reveal stereotaxic landmarks associated with the anterior semicircular canal. Recordings were made using pulled glass microelectrodes with 10â80 Mâ¦ impedance. The tip of the electrode was positioned just anterior to a bony spur located on the medial surface of the ampulla of the anterior canal, and advanced into the brainstem using a hydraulic oil-filled remote microdrive (Drum drive; FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA). Neurophysiological activity was amplified (variable gain; Grass P511 AC amplifier and high-impedance headstage), filtered from 0.03 to 3 kHz, and broadcast to the experimenters (outside the booth) over a monitor speaker. Action potentials were detected with a custom spike-discriminator circuit, consisting of a Schmitt trigger followed by a peak detector, and timed with National Instruments hardware. A wideband-noise search stimulus was used to isolate auditory-nerve fibers as the electrode was slowly advanced. Recordings were excluded as likely originating from nucleus angularis based on bipolar action potential morphology, non-primary-like post-stimulus time histograms in response to tones (i.e., onset or chopping responses), or weak phase locking to tones.</p><p>Tuning curves were determined through an automated algorithm that tracked the threshold sound level for rate excitation across frequencies. The algorithm estimated thresholds as the minimum tone level that repeatedly produced an increase in driven discharge rate compared to the most recent silent interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chintanpalli and Heinz, 2007</xref>). Tones were 50 ms in duration with 5 ms raised-cosine onset and offset ramps, presented once every 100 ms. Thresholds were sampled with a resolution of 28 frequencies per octave near characteristic frequency (CF), starting at 6â8 kHz and proceeding downward in frequency (typical range: 6 kHz to 200 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SFOAE processing</title><p>Analyses were performed in MATLAB R2023a and R version 4.3.2. Occasional microphone-signal artifacts were rejected by thresholding. Surrounding each signal transient artifact, 20 ms of signal was removed.

Magnitude and phase spectra were extracted from the mean data for each component of the signal using the generalized least-squares fit described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Long et al., 2008</xref>. Phase gradients were extracted after phase unwrapping and conversion to cycles. Two exclusion criteria were implemented prior to phase-gradient extraction, for <italic>N</italic><sub>SFOAE</sub> estimation. Data points less than 10 dB in magnitude above the median of the estimated noise floor were rejected. Data points at the base of magnitude troughs were also rejected due to noted phase irregularities.

For each ear, first-degree robust polynomials were fit to the data in each frequency band. Magnitude and phase-gradient values were defined as the value of the polynomial fit at the center frequency in each band. Frequency was treated as a categorical variable. Ear intercepts were modeled as a random effect. The Satterthwaite approximation was used to calculate degrees of freedom for F tests.

This valuable study confirms that finding in a new species, the budgerigar, and provides convincing support for the utility of otoacoustic estimates of cochlear tuning, a methodology previously explored primarily in mammals. The study's remaining claims of a mismatch between behavioral frequency selectivity and cochlear tuning are based on old behavioral data, and collected in an extreme frequency region at the edge of the limits of hearing. Hearing abilities are hard to measure accurately on the upper frequency edge of the hearing range, and the evidence for these claims is weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the detailed summary of our paper by the editors highlighting its strengths. As described in the following responses, we added additional evidence to the Introduction supporting that budgerigars have (1) unusual behavioral frequency tuning compared to other bird species and (2) unusual behavioral tuning results in budgerigars are not readily explainable by the audiogram. This additional background information, including Fig. 1B, substantially strengthens the claim of mismatched behavioral and neural/otoacoustic frequency tuning in budgerigars. Moreover, that the behavioral data are âoldâ seems not particularly relevant considering that the same behavioral methods are still widely used in animal research, as elaborated upon in the responses below. We suggest the term âpreviously publishedâ to clarify the behavioral data used in our analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, the authors provide compelling evidence that stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emission (SFOAE) phase-gradient delays predict the sharpness (quality factors) of auditory-nerve-fiber (ANF) frequency tuning curves in budgerigars.

Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med 2019; 9:pii a033498. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a033498; in particular, the text near Eq. 2 and the value of CFa|b).</p><p>Despite this history, the manuscript makes no mention of the apical-basal transition, its possible role in birds, or why it was ignored in the present analysis. As but one result, the comparative discussion of the tuning ratio (paragraph beginning on lines 383) is incomplete and potentially misleading. Although the paragraph highlights differences in the tuning ratio across groups, perhaps these differences simply reflect differences in the value of CFa|b. For example, if the cochlea of the budgerigar is assumed to be entirely &quot;apical&quot; in character (so that CFa|b is around 7-8 kHz), then the budgerigar tuning ratios appear to align remarkably well with those previously obtained in mammals (see Shera et al 2010, Fig 9).</p></disp-quote><p>We added sections on the apical-basal transition to the Results and Discussion, including how this concept might apply in budgerigars and other birds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* For the most part, the authors take previous behavioral results in budgerigar at face value, attributing the discrepant behavioral results to hypothesized &quot;central specializations for the processing of masked signals&quot;. But before going down this easy road, the manuscript would be stronger if the authors discussed potential issues that might affect the reliability of the previous behavioral literature. For example, the ANF data show that thresholds rise rapidly above about 5 kHz. Might the apparent broadening of the behavioral filters arise as a consequence of off-frequency listening due to the need to increase signal levels at these frequencies? Or perhaps there are other issues. Inquiring readers would appreciate an informed discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, also raised by reviewer 2, that declining audibility above 4 kHz could impact behavioral tuning estimates. On the other hand, other bird species with highly similar audiograms to budgerigars show conventional behavioral tuning that increases in sharpness relatively slowly and monotonically for higher frequences. Thus, the unusual pattern of behavioral tuning in budgerigars is not fully explainable by the audiogram. We added a section to the Introduction highlighting these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes two new sets of data involving budgerigar hearing: (1) auditory-nerve tuning curves (ANTCs), which are considered the 'gold standard' measure of cochlear tuning, and (2) stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs), which are a more indirect measure (requiring some assumptions and transformations to infer cochlear tuning) but which are non-invasive, making them easier to obtain and suitable for use in all species, including humans. By using a tuning ratio (relating ANTC bandwidths and SFOAE delay) derived from another bird species (chicken), the authors show that the tuning estimates from the two methods are in reasonable agreement with each other over the range of hearing tested (280 Hz to 5.65 kHz for the ANTCs), and both show a slow monotonic increase in cochlear tuning quality over that range, as expected. These new results are then compared with (much) older existing behavioral estimates of frequency selectivity in the same species.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This topic is of interest, because there are some indications from the older behavioral literature that budgerigars have a region of best tuning, which the current authors refer to as an 'acoustic fovea', at around 4 kHz, but that beyond 5 kHz the tuning degrades. Earlier work has speculated that the source could be cochlear or higher (e.g., Okanoya and Dooling, 1987). The current study appears to rule out a cochlear source to this phenomenon.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The conclusions are rendered questionable by two major problems.</p><p>The first problem is that the study does not provide new behavioral data, but instead relies on decades-old estimates that used techniques dating back to the 1970s, which have been found to be flawed in various ways. The behavioral techniques that have been developed more recently in the human psychophysical literature have avoided these well-documented confounds, such as nonlinear suppression effects (e.g., Houtgast, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1913048">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1913048</ext-link>; Shannon, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.381007">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.381007</ext-link>; Moore, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.381752">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.381752</ext-link>), perceptual confusion between pure-tone maskers and targets (e.g., Neff, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.393678">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.393678</ext-link>), beats and distortion products produced by interactions between simultaneous maskers and targets (e.g., Patterson, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.380914">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.380914</ext-link>), unjustified assumptions and empirical difficulties associated with critical band and critical ratio measures (Patterson, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.380914">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.380914</ext-link>), and 'off-frequency listening' phenomena (O'Loughlin and Moore, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.385691">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.385691</ext-link>). More recent studies, tailored to mimic to the extent possible the techniques used in ANTCs, have provided reasonably accurate estimates of cochlear tuning, as measured with ANTCs and SFOAEs (Shera et al., 2003, 2010; Sumner et al., 2010). No such measures yet exist in budgerigars, and this study does not provide any. So the study fails to provide valid behavioral data to support the claims made.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs efforts in summarizing and critiquing our study. We feel that the budgerigar data collected by the Dooling and Saunders labs remain essentially valid today. The methods used in these behavioral studies are rigorous and remain widely used in animal research (e.g., critical bands and ratios: Yost &amp; Shofner, 2009; King et al., 2015; simultaneous masking: Burton et al., 2018). The methods are based on the same power-spectrum-model assumptions of auditory masking as even the most recent and elaborate human psychophysical procedures. We therefore believe that it remains highly relevant to test and report whether these methods can accurately predict cochlear tuning. More importantly, while forward-masking behavioral results are hypothesized to more accurately predict cochlear tuning humans (Shera et al., 2002; Joris et al., 2011; Sumner et al., 2018), evidence from nonhumans is controversial. For example, one study showed a closer match between forward-masking results and auditory-nerve tuning (ferret: Sumner et al., 2018), whereas several others showed a close match for simultaneous masking results (e.g., guinea pig, chinchilla, macaque; reviewed by Ruggero &amp; Temchin, 2005; see Joris et al., 2011 for macaque auditory-nerve tuning). Moreover, forward- and simultaneous-masking results can often be equated with a simple scaling factor (e.g., Sumner et al., 2018). Given no consensus on an optimal behavioral method, and seemingly limited potential for the âwrongâ method to fundamentally transform the shape of the behavioral tuning quality function, it seems reasonable to accept previously published behavioral tuning estimates as valid while also discussing limitations and remaining open to alternative interpretations. We added these points to the discussion and added clarification throughout as to the specific behavioral approaches used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second, and more critical, problem can be observed by considering the frequencies at which the old behavioral data indicate a worsening of tuning. From the summary shown in the present Fig. 2, the conclusion that behavioral frequency selectivity worsens again at higher frequencies is based on four data points, all with probe frequencies between 5 and 6 kHz. Comparing this frequency range with the absolute thresholds shown in Fig. 3 (as well as from older budgerigar data) shows it to be on the steep upper edge of the hearing range. Thus, we are dealing not so much with a fovea as the point where hearing starts to end. The point that anomalous tuning measures are found at the edge of hearing in the budgerigar has been made before: Saunders et al. (1978) state in the last sentence of their paper that &quot;the size of the CB rapidly increases above 4.0 kHz and this may be related to the fact that the behavioral audibility curve, above 4.0 kHz, loses sensitivity at the rate of 55 dB per octave.&quot;</p><p>Hearing abilities are hard to measure accurately on the upper frequency edge of the hearing range, in humans as well as in other species. The few attempts to measure human frequency selectivity at that upper edge have resulted in quite messy data and unclear conclusions (e.g., Buus et al., 1986, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4613-2247-4_37">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4613-2247-4_37</ext-link>). Indeed, the only study to my knowledge to have systematically tested human frequency selectivity in the extended high frequency range (&gt; 12 kHz) seems to suggest a substantial broadening, relative to the earlier estimates at lower frequencies, by as much as a factor of 2 in some individuals (Yasin and Plack, 2005; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.2035594">https://doi.org/10.1121/1.2035594</ext-link>) - in other words by a similar amount as suggested by the budgerigar data. The possible divergence of different measures at the extreme end of hearing could be due to any number of factors that are hard to control and calibrate, given the steep rate of threshold change, leading to uncontrolled off-frequency listening potential, the higher sound levels needed to exceed threshold, as well as contributions from middle-ear filtering. As a side note, in the original ANTC data presented in this study, there are actually very few tuning curves at or above 5 kHz, which are the ones critical to the argument being forwarded here. To my eye, all the estimates above 5 kHz in Fig. 3 fall below the trend line, potentially also in line with poorer selectivity going along with poorer sensitivity as hearing disappears beyond 6 kHz.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, also raised by reviewer 1, that declining audibility above 4 kHz could influence behavioral tuning measures. While we acknowledge this possibility, declining audibility cannot fully explain the unusual pattern of behavioral frequency tuning in budgerigars considering that other bird species with the same audiogram phenotype show conventional tuning patterns. We added these points to the Introduction and Fig. 1B. We also added clarification throughout that it is not just the shape of tuning function that is noteworthy in budgerigars, but also the extreme slope in the 1-3.5 kHz region. Behavioral tuning quality in budgerigars increases by 5.3 dB/octave in this range (i.e., nearly doubling each octave increase in frequency), vs. 1.8 dB/octave in humans, 2.5 dB/octave in ferret, 1.1 dB/octave in macaque, and 1.9 dB/octave in starling. This additional background information, including Fig. 1B, substantially strengthens the claim of mismatched behavioral and neural/otoacoustic frequency tuning in budgerigars.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The basic question posed in the current study title and abstract seems a little convoluted (why would you expect a behavioral measure to reflect cochlear mechanics more accurately than a cochlear-based emissions measure?). A more intuitive (and likely more interesting) way of framing the question would be &quot;What is the neural/mechanical source of a behaviorally observed acoustic fovea?&quot; Unfortunately, this question does not lend itself to being answered in the budgerigar, as that 'fovea' turns out to be just the turning point at the end of the hearing range. There is probably a reason why no other study has referred to this as an acoustic fovea in the budgerigar.</p><p>Overall, a safe interpretation of the data is that hearing starts to change (and becomes harder to measure) at the very upper frequency edge, and not just in budgerigars. Thus, it is difficult to draw any clear conclusions from the current work, other than that the relations between ANTC and SFOAEs estimates of tuning are consistent in budgerigar, as they are in most (all?) other species that have been tested so far.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the term fovea from the paper.
