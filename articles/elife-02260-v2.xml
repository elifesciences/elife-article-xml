Previous studies indicate that neural activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) represents the gradual accumulation of evidence toward a threshold level, or evidence bound, which terminates the decision process. The level of this bound is hypothesized to mediate the speed-accuracy tradeoff. To test this, we recorded from LIP while monkeys performed a motion discrimination task in two speed-accuracy regimes. Surprisingly, the terminating threshold levels of neural activity were similar in both regimes. However, neurons recorded in the faster regime exhibited stronger evidence-independent activation from the beginning of decision formation, effectively reducing the evidence-dependent neural modulation needed for choice commitment. Our results suggest that control of speed vs accuracy may be exerted through changes in decision-related neural activity itself rather than through changes in the threshold applied to such neural activity to terminate a decision.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02260.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02260.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02260.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many actions involve a trade-off between speed and accuracy, with typing being a good example: the faster you try to type a sentence, the more mistakes you are likely to make. Mathematical models have successfully reproduced the speed-accuracy trade-off, but it is not clear how the brain represents and weighs up these two factors. Now, Hanks et al. have shown how single neurons in a region of the brain called the lateral intraparietal cortex vary their firing rate to optimize the balance between speed and accuracy.</p><p>Two macaque monkeys were trained to fixate on a single dot on a screen and then move their eyes in one of two directions in response to movies of random dots on a video screen. Initially, the monkeys received a reward immediately after every correct response, whereas incorrect responses were punished with a very short time-out. Under these conditions, the optimal strategy is to respond quickly at the expense of accuracy. In a separate block of trials, the monkeys were again rewarded for correct responses, but this time their reward was delayed if they responded too quickly. The most effective strategy now is to respond accurately, but more slowly.</p><p>In both the ‘high speed’ and ‘high accuracy’ conditions, the firing of neurons in lateral intraparietal cortex increased while the dots were on the screen. As soon as the firing rate reached a threshold—representing the point at which the monkey had accumulated enough evidence to make a decision about the direction of movement—the monkey moved its eyes. Previous theories had suggested that when speed was the priority, the level of activity required to trigger a decision would be lower than when accuracy was emphasized. Surprisingly, however, the threshold did not differ between the ‘high speed’ and ‘high accuracy’ conditions. Instead, neurons displayed a higher <italic>initial</italic> firing rate whenever speed was prioritized, enabling the monkey to make a decision on the basis of less evidence.</p><p>This finding is consistent with human brain imaging studies that have shown increased baseline activity in decision-making circuitry when speed is prioritized over accuracy.

Conversely, decision accuracy often improves if temporal demands permit longer deliberation. This balance between decision time and performance is referred to as the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT). Examples of SAT are prevalent, with demonstrations for visual, auditory, olfactory, and memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Green and Luce, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reed, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wickelgren, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luce, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rinberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ings and Chittka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bogacz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Models based on the stochastic accumulation of evidence to a bound provide a unifying behavioral framework that can explain both decisions and the time taken to reach those decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stone, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laming, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Link, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ratcliff and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>). In this class of models, the decision bound establishes a policy on the amount of evidence needed for decision commitment and thus determines the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Providing confirmation of this idea, multiple studies have found that human SAT in a variety of decision tasks can be explained by changes in decision bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>While providing insight into computation, these mathematical models of behavior leave open the question of neural implementation. Neuroimaging studies suggest that SAT may be implemented by changes in baseline neural activity in decision-related areas, with higher baseline responses when speed is given precedence over accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forstmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ivanoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Veen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forstmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wenzlaff et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests the possibility that a reduction of decision bound in behavioral models is implemented in the brain by increasing the starting level of neural activity in regions that accumulate evidence rather than by reducing the bound level required to terminate a decision. The only neurophysiological study of SAT to date reported that during a visual search task with different response deadlines, SAT was associated with a variety of effects in FEF, including changes in the baseline and gain of visual neurons, the duration of perceptual processing, and the rate of ramping responses of movement neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heitz and Schall, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigate the neural processes that may underlie SAT by recording from the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the rhesus monkey during a visual motion discrimination task. We focus on LIP because numerous studies suggest that neurons in this area exhibit the signatures of both evidence accumulation and a decision bound that leads to commitment for saccadic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanks et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rorie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bollimunta et al., 2012</xref>). We found that SAT was implemented in LIP by an evidence-independent signal that was added to responses during the same period that the neurons represent the accumulating evidence leading to a choice. The addition of this time-dependent, evidence-independent signal serves to reduce the amount of evidence needed to terminate a decision in the high speed regime.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to perform a reaction time (RT) motion discrimination task in two speed-accuracy regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The stimulus consisted of a patch of dynamic random dots, with different motion strengths randomly interleaved on a trial-by-trial basis (‘Materials and methods’). The task of the subjects was to determine the direction of the coherent motion and to indicate a choice by making an eye movement to a corresponding target. Since this was a RT task, the viewing epoch was not preset, and the monkey controlled when to make a choice on each trial.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02260.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Choice-reaction time task.</title><p>Monkeys were required to identify the net direction of motion in a dynamic random dot display. Several levels of difficulty were randomly interleaved. The monkeys indicated their choice by making a saccadic eye movement to the appropriate choice target. They could do so at any time after onset of the random dot motion stimulus. Reaction time (RT) was measured from the time of motion onset until initiation of the saccade. The monkeys learned to perform the task in two different speed-accuracy regimes. For neural recordings, one choice target was placed in the response field of a single LIP neuron, as illustrated, and the other target was placed in the opposite hemifield.

To encourage speed, we simply rewarded the monkey immediately after each correct response, since, in our experience, monkeys are naturally inclined to make fast responses at the expense of accuracy. To encourage accuracy, reward was delayed relative to motion onset by 600–800 ms, so that fast responses involved a short additional wait until delivery of reward. We refer to the first regime as the ‘speed’ regime and the second as the ‘accuracy’ regime. Each speed-accuracy regime was maintained for many consecutive daily sessions. Neural data were collected when the monkey had achieved a stable set point for each regime.</p><p>We first characterize the monkeys' behavior in the two speed-accuracy regimes. We show that the change in behavior in the different speed-accuracy regimes is explained by a change in the decision criterion. Second, we turn to a neural correlate of this change. We show that LIP neurons reflect the change in the decision policy as a motion evidence-independent signal that adds to the responses throughout the period of evidence accumulation.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavior</title><p>In both regimes, stronger motion was associated with improved choice accuracy and faster RTs, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>). Behavior during the two regimes revealed a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. In the high accuracy regime, both monkeys exhibited longer RTs and improved performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This observation is important because it indicates that the monkeys did not slow down merely by delaying the motor response, but rather, they used the time to accumulate more evidence from the stimulus. Similarly, if the monkeys had failed to pay attention to the early portion of the stimulus, an improvement in accuracy should not have accompanied the longer RTs.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02260.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Decision accuracy and reaction time in two speed-accuracy regimes are explained by bounded evidence accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Data from two monkeys.

The traditional depiction of this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) would represent the accumulation of evidence as a random walk between two terminating bounds. We consider a version of this model that is more consistent with neurophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) in which one process is replaced by two competing processes that accumulate moment-by-moment sensory evidence bearing on each alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). The choice is dictated by which process first reaches the bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This two-process model explains the established neural representations of both saccadic choices in LIP for this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazurek et al., 2003</xref>). In the model, RT is determined by a combination of the time taken to reach the bound and a stimulus-independent non-decision time. As explained in ‘Materials and methods’, the models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> can be treated as mathematically equivalent. For both depictions, the distance from the starting point of evidence accumulation to the bound, termed the ‘excursion’, determines how much evidence must be accumulated in order to commit to a choice. In theory, the excursion may change as a function of decision time, for example, if the bound collapses during the course of decision formation. However, for simplicity, we first consider the restricted set of models with static excursions.</p><p>Monkeys traded off speed and accuracy by changing the amount of evidence that was needed to commit to a choice. In particular, SAT was explained by the bounded accumulation model with a change in the decision variable excursion. Overall, the excursion was reduced by 43% ± 2% in the high speed regime compared to the high accuracy regime (monkey D: 58% ± 3%; monkey E: 23% ± 4%). Thus, less accumulated evidence was needed to commit to a choice in the high speed regime compared to the high accuracy regime.</p><p>The change in SAT was not explained in a consistent way by the other model parameters. Overall, we observed a 33.4 ± 5.8 ms shorter non-decision time in the high speed regime compared to the accuracy regime, and this effect was not consistent between the two monkeys (monkey D: 3.1 ± 5.2 ms longer in high speed regime; monkey E: 63.7 ± 9.1 ms shorter in high speed regime). Importantly, the RT elongation in the high accuracy regime exceeded any changes observed in non-decision time by a large margin (mean RT elongation, monkey D: 176 ± 4 ms; monkey E: 159 ± 3 ms). Moreover, if changes in RTs were solely a result of altered non-decision time, there would be no associated changes in accuracy. In principle, changes in the SAT could be associated with changes in the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensory evidence, owing perhaps to a change in attentional state, which would lead to a change of sensitivity to motion strength (parameter <italic>k</italic> of the model). We cannot rule this out, but the model fits provided inconsistent support for such a mechanism in the two monkeys. In the high speed regime, <italic>k</italic> changed by a factor of 1.36 ± 0.12 and 0.78 ± 0.07, respectively, for monkeys D and E (1.01 ± 0.06 in combined data).</p><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that some of the behavioral change was manifested by a competing process in which the monkey simply guessed quickly, so-called ‘fast guesses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</xref>). A fast guess process could lead to faster and less accurate choices in the high speed regime. However, the level of accuracy for both monkeys at the highest motion strength in the high speed regime suggests that any such fast guess mechanism plays a relatively minor role because fast guesses would reduce accuracy for all stimulus strengths. Together, these considerations show that the change in SAT was achieved primarily via a process that alters the excursion required for the accumulating evidence to support termination.</p><p>Traditionally, bounded accumulation models implement this change in excursion by altering the bound height. However, the brain is thought to employ competing accumulator processes for decision making (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, the brain can achieve a reduction in the excursion of accumulated evidence in two ways: (1) by lowering the bounds for both processes, or (2) by adding a signal to the accumulated evidence for both processes. These can be treated as mathematically equivalent: in both cases the effect of the change in the excursion is to alter the amount of accumulated evidence necessary to terminate the process. However, they imply different neural mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neurophysiology</title><p>We recorded neural activity from 70 neurons while the monkeys performed the task (35 in the high speed regime and 35 in the high accuracy regime). In each recording session, we screened neurons based on whether they exhibited spatial selectivity during a delayed saccade task and persistent delay activity during a memory-guided saccade task. For the motion discrimination task, one of the choice targets was placed in the RF of each recorded neuron; the other choice target was placed in the opposite hemifield.</p><p>In both speed-accuracy regimes, LIP neurons exhibited signatures of evidence accumulation. These features are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and they are similar to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>). Initially, the responses were elevated in the presence of the choice targets, one of which was in the neuron's RF.

We looked for such a signal by averaging responses in each speed-accuracy regime across all stimulus strengths and both directions to extract the component of the response that was not dependent on the evidence. This evidence-independent component was significantly elevated in the high speed regime relative to the high accuracy regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In one monkey, this difference began from before motion onset and persisted throughout the period of evidence accumulation (p&lt;0.001). For the other monkey, a significant difference emerged 100 ms after motion onset (p&lt;0.01) and persisted at all time points thereafter (p&lt;0.001). Thus, for both monkeys, LIP neurons undergo a smaller excursion in firing rate from the start to the end of the decision in the high speed regime compared to the high accuracy regime. It appears that an evidence-independent signal effectively pushes the neural representation of accumulated evidence closer to a threshold.</p><p>This conclusion receives additional support from an analysis of individual neurons. Across all recorded neurons, there was a significant negative correlation between the estimated evidence-independent neural response and the mean RTs for the corresponding behavioral sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, r = −0.57, p&lt;0.01). Of course, this correlation is driven to a large extent by the changes in the mean values between the two regimes. Nonetheless, there is variation within each regime, and for neurons in each regime individually, the correlation was significant (r = −0.40 and −0.63 for high speed and high accuracy regimes, respectively; p&lt;0.05 in both cases).</p><p>Beyond correlation, these changes in the evidence-independent neural signal explained the changes observed in the behavior between the two speed-accuracy regimes. One way to appreciate this is to fit the behavior in both regimes with the bounded accumulation model such that the only difference between the two regimes is established by the measured evidence-independent neural signals. Notice that in both regimes, the evidence-independent signal increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with urgency signals reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ditterich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cisek et al., 2009</xref>). For each monkey, we approximated the evidence-independent signals in each regime with hyperbolic functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and used these neurally-derived ‘urgency functions’ to control the model's excursion for each regime. Importantly, the change in excursion between the two regimes is not fit to the behavioral data; it is measured from the neural data. In this way, the only free parameters in the model are the three that are shared between the two regimes (‘Materials and methods’).

In the high speed regime, the starting point of the bound is nearer to the origin, and the rate of collapse is more severe. In the race-like architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a change in bound height is equivalent to a change in the starting point of both accumulations, and a collapsing bound is equivalent to a time-dependent, monotonically increasing signal that is also added to both accumulators. The neural responses are consistent with the idea that both components comprise a singular, evidence-independent signal that adds to the evidence-dependent activity in LIP. Nonetheless, one might ask how well each component alone could explain the behavioral changes between the two speed-accuracy regimes. To test this, we fit the behavioral data using only the baseline or only the time-dependent component of the neurally-derived, evidence-independent signal. The model comparison, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, suggests that the time-dependent component of the signal is more important, although both components contribute to the fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, especially for monkey D.

Thus, the brain requires termination rules to end deliberation during a decision process. Just as the criterion in signal detection theory establishes a balance between false alarms and misses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>), a termination rule for a decision process can establish a balance between speed and accuracy. We found that monkeys can control their speed-accuracy policy via a process that changes the amount of accumulated evidence needed to commit to a choice. This is consistent with psychophysical studies in humans that suggest the SAT is implemented as a change in the decision bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In neurophysiology, the bound is conceived as a threshold applied to the firing rates of neurons that represent the accumulated evidence for one or the other alternatives. Although we do not know which neurons in the brain are responsible for applying this threshold, a signature of the process is the stereotyped level of firing rate of LIP neurons just preceding a <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> decision. Interestingly, we found that the level of this threshold does not change when the monkey adopts a different speed-accuracy tradeoff. Instead of changing the level of the threshold, the brain changes the level of the starting point of the accumulation and adds a time-dependent signal to the accumulated evidence. The effect is to push the accumulated evidence closer to the fixed threshold. This dynamic, evidence-independent signal has been termed urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ditterich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cisek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</xref>) because it reflects the temporal cost associated with decision formation. It is mathematically equivalent to a collapsing bound because both mechanisms would alter the excursion of accumulated evidence from start to end of the decision, thereby allowing the brain to satisfy a mixture of desiderata related to time and evidence to terminate a decision. At the extremes of the mixture lie a temporal deadline or a fixed level of evidence (e.g., flat bound).</p><p>Apart from the change in termination rule, other aspects of the decision making process were unaffected by the speed-accuracy regime. The fits to even the simplest diffusion model (with flat bounds) indicate that the conversion from motion to accumulated evidence (e.g., drift rate) did not change consistently in the two regimes. This is further supported by the neural recordings. As adduced from the slopes of the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, a change in motion coherence induces the same change in buildup rate in both regimes. The constant offset between these graphs reflects an evidence-independent component of the neural response—that is, the dynamic component of the urgency signal. This component combined with the change in baseline is mathematically equivalent to symmetrically collapsing bounds. Thus we were able to explain the difference in accuracy and RT in the two regimes by fixing all other parameters of the diffusion model to be identical between the two regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We simply introduced the urgency signals, measured physiologically, by converting from fraction of the firing rate ‘bound’ to the units of standard diffusion. The scaling itself (<italic>α</italic>; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 8</xref>) was identical in the two regimes.</p><p>Why would the brain add a signal to the accumulated evidence rather than adjusting the threshold? One possibility is that it simplifies the task of the downstream structures responsible for decision termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marshall et al., 2012</xref>), rendering it similar to operations involved in simpler motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanes and Schall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>). The neural computations involved in sensing a signal threshold crossing must be affected by the fidelity (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) of the signal, and it is well known that fidelity is greater at higher firing rates (because variance, not standard deviation, scales with mean firing rate). Indeed, it has been argued that some type of temporal smoothing is required to sense a threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazurek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heitz and Schall, 2012</xref>). By fixing the threshold to a common level, the mechanism would avoid the need to compensate for these changes.</p><p>This architecture is supported by neuroimaging studies, which show an increase in baseline activity in decision-related areas of the human brain when speed is given precedence over accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forstmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ivanoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Veen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forstmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wenzlaff et al., 2011</xref>) and with theoretical considerations that favor this implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marshall et al., 2012</xref>; but see; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>). The origin of the urgency signal is unknown, but it may be related to other stimulus-independent signals observed in monkey LIP, which have been shown to represent reward and value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rorie et al., 2010</xref>), prior probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rao et al., 2012</xref>) and elapsed time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leon and Shadlen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen and Shadlen, 2005</xref>). In addition, when faster speeds are cued in a search task, a large stimulus-independent additive signal with a time-dependent component is evident in FEF responses, along with more complex changes in decision threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heitz and Schall, 2012</xref>; their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The tradeoff between speed and accuracy illustrates the flexibility with which the brain can establish policies on decision processes. Control of these policies endows individuals with the ability to reach different choices based on the same information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shadlen and Roskies, 2012</xref>). We have revealed one potential neural mechanism by which a policy change can affect a decision process. We believe that studying how such policy control can go awry is an essential step in better understanding disorders of higher brain function, for instance by explaining what leads to more careful or more impulsive decision making when individuals are faced with the same circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Behavioral task</title><p>Two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to perform a motion discrimination task. Visual stimuli were presented on a computer monitor (75 Hz frame rate) using the Psychophysics Toolbox for Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Brainard, 1997</xref>). Trials began with the appearance of a single dot that the monkey was required to fixate. To minimize effects of anticipation on behavior and neural activity, random intervals between trial events were implemented using truncated exponential distributions, t<sub>min</sub> + exprnd(µ), where exprnd is a random sample from an exponential distribution with mean = µ. If the generated interval was longer than the maximum allowed time for the epoch (t<sub>max</sub>), the interval was resampled to ensure it was less than t<sub>max</sub>. After a variable delay (t<sub>min</sub> = 300 ms, µ = 300 ms, t<sub>max</sub> = 1 s), two bright red choice targets appeared at an equal distance from the fixation point and 180° apart. After another variable delay (t<sub>min</sub> = 300 ms, µ = 300 ms, t<sub>max</sub> = 1.5 s), the random dot motion stimulus appeared in an aperture 5° in diameter that was centered at the fixation point. The dynamic random dot stimulus consists of sets of random dots, which are shown for one video frame and then updated 40 ms later (e.g., dots in frame 1 were updated in frame 4; dots in frame 2 were updated in frame 5, and so forth). To update, each dot is either replaced at a random location, or displaced by 14.4 min arc (i.e., 6.0 deg s<sup>−1</sup>) with probability C (expressed as a percent), termed the motion coherence or motion strength. The dot density was 16.7 dots deg<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>For each trial, there were two possible directions of motion, differing by 180°. For one monkey (monkey E), the directional axis of motion corresponded to that formed by the choice targets. For the second monkey (monkey D), the directional axis of motion always corresponded to the horizontal meridian, but the choice target configuration was as described above, identical to the other monkey. Motion strength (the percentage of coherently moving dots) was chosen randomly from a set <italic>C</italic> ∈ {0%, 3.2%, 6.4%, 12.8%, 25.6%, 51.2%}. The monkey's task was to determine the direction of coherent motion, which it indicated by making a saccade to the appropriate choice target (e.g., rightward target for rightward motion, leftward target for leftward motion). The monkey received a liquid reward for all correct choices, and on a random half of the trials in which 0% coherence motion was displayed. The monkeys received no reward for the incorrect choices.</p><p>The monkeys were trained to perform a RT version of the motion discrimination task in two different speed-accuracy regimes: a faster speed (hence, lower accuracy) or higher accuracy (hence, slower speed) one. Each regime was maintained for multiple consecutive daily sessions. For both monkeys, we started with the faster speed regime first, followed by the higher accuracy regime, and then switched back to the faster speed regime, with details as follows. The monkeys were initially trained on a version of the task that used an experimenter-controlled duration for the visual stimulus. Both monkeys achieved stable psychometric thresholds in this version of the task before proceeding to the RT version. In the RT version of the task, the color of the fixation point was changed from red to blue and the monkey was allowed to respond any time after motion onset. Previous training experience revealed a natural tendency of monkeys to respond with short latencies. We exploited this tendency by providing only a small incentive for accuracy; a time out penalty for incorrect choices was added to the standard inter-trial interval to discourage fast errors:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>after</mml:mtext><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mtext>error</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>otherwise</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>ITI</italic></sub> is the inter-trial interval, <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> is a constant, typically 1 s, and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> is the RT. With this approach, the monkeys established a stable speed-accuracy regime with well-behaved psychometric and chronometric functions. We refer to this as the high speed (low accuracy) regime.</p><p>After collecting data from LIP neurons in multiple consecutive daily sessions in this regime, each monkey was switched to a higher accuracy regime. This was achieved through the conditional delay of reward. Specifically, reward was always given for correct choices, but it was delayed relative to motion onset. The duration of this delay was 600–800 ms. So, if the delay was 800 ms and the monkey responded correctly in 500 ms, it would have to wait an additional 300 ms before delivery of the reward. This eliminated any reward-based incentive to respond faster than the minimum delay to reward, encouraging longer deliberation times that would improve accuracy. After multiple daily sessions with this reward structure, the monkeys achieved a new stable speed-accuracy set point involving longer RTs and higher accuracy. Data were collected from LIP neurons in multiple consecutive daily sessions in this regime.</p><p>Finally, the monkeys were moved back to the high speed regime. We performed a variety of manipulations to bring the monkeys to a similar speed-accuracy regime as observed in the initial high speed sessions. At first, the monkeys preserved their higher accuracy set point even after removal of the conditional delay of reward for multiple daily sessions. After the additional removal of the time out penalty for incorrect choices, one monkey (monkey E) slowly reached a faster speed set point over the course of 15 sessions. The other monkey (monkey D) required an additional manipulation. For 50% of trials, the motion stimulus was extinguished after 600 ms, so no further sensory information was available. After three sessions with this design, the monkey reached a faster speed set point. The task structure then reverted back to allowing the motion stimulus to be displayed indefinitely, and the monkey maintained the faster speed set point. After stable behavior was achieved in this regime, data were collected from 12 more LIP neurons (7 for monkey D, 5 for monkey E). For both monkeys, the behavior in these final fast speed sessions was similar to the earlier fast speed sessions that were collected before the high accuracy sessions (mean RT difference &lt;35 ms and mean accuracy difference &lt;2.5%). The main effects on neural responses were similar as well, so data were combined across the two sets of high speed sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>Behavioral data were fit using a bounded evidence-accumulation model, also known as bounded drift-diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The model explains choice and decision time as an accumulation of momentary evidence to an upper bound or a lower bound, corresponding to the two direction choices. The momentary evidence gathered in each time step is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with unit variance for 1 s and mean <italic>µ</italic> determined by a linear transform of the motion strength: <italic>µ = kC</italic>, where <italic>C</italic> is the motion strength and <italic>k</italic> is a free parameter that scales the motion strength appropriately. The process terminates when the accumulated evidence, termed the decision variable, reaches ±<italic>B</italic>, the upper and lower decision bounds. The bound reached first by the accumulated evidence determines the choice, and the decision time is determined by how long it takes to reach that bound. RT is a combination of this decision time with an additional non-decision residual time, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>nd</italic></sub>, which accounts for visual and motion delays and other factors that are independent of the decision process. The basic model (fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) uses three free parameters: <italic>k</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, and the mean <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>nd</italic></sub> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><p>This model can be described in a mathematically equivalent way in which one process is replaced by two competing processes with perfectly anti-correlated accumulations of moment-by-moment sensory evidence bearing on each alternative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). In this version, the choice is dictated by which process first reaches the bound. A signal that adds an equivalent amount to both processes would be equivalent to a reduction of the bound of both processes by the same value. We refer to the distance between the bound and starting point of each process as the ‘excursion’. In a single process version of the model, the excursion is controlled entirely by the heights of the decision bounds. A symmetric reduction of the magnitude of each bound is mathematically equivalent to an equally-sized additive signal in the two-process version of the model.</p><p>To determine how the model accounts for the difference in behavior between the speed and accuracy regimes, we allowed all three parameters of the model to vary between the two regimes. As is well known, the simplified model, described above, cannot explain mean RT on error trials or the full shapes of the RT distributions for this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ditterich, 2006</xref>). We therefore maximized the likelihood of the choice proportions (binomial error) and the mean and SD of the RT from correct choices (Gaussian error). Each model's predictions for these values were derived from the analytic solutions for the boundary-crossing probability and first-passage times for a bounded drift-diffusion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Neural recordings</title><p>We recorded from 70 well isolated single neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of two monkeys while they performed the reaction time (RT) motion discrimination task. In monkey D, 17 neurons were recorded in the high speed regime and 15 in the high accuracy regime. In monkey E, 18 neurons were recorded in the high speed regime and 20 in the high accuracy regime. Standard methods were used for extracellular recording of action potentials from single neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Neurons were selected using anatomical and physiological criteria. Registration of structural MRI scans to a standard cortical atlas (Caret software; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Essen et al., 2001</xref>) was used to identify LIP and to direct the placement of recording electrodes. Registration of recording sites to structural MRI suggests that our neural recordings were obtained from the ventral subdivision of area LIP (LIPv; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis and Van Essen, 2000</xref>). Once the proper anatomic location was identified, we recorded from neurons during the motion task if they met two criteria: (1) spatially selective activity during visually-guided delayed saccade trials at both the time of visual onset and the time of the saccade, and (2) memory activity during the delay period for memory-guided saccade trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gnadt and Andersen, 1988</xref>). Both criteria were assessed qualitatively by the experimenter after finding a neuron with an isolated spike waveform.</p><p>In the visually-guided delayed saccade task, each monkey maintained its gaze at a central fixation point while a target was displayed at a peripheral location. The monkey was required to maintain fixation for a delay taken from a truncated exponential as described above (t<sub>min</sub> = 300 ms, µ = 600 ms, t<sub>max</sub> = 2 s). After this delay, the fixation point was extinguished, instructing the monkey to make a saccade to the location of the target. This task was used to find the response field (RF) of each neuron—that is, the region of space where a target would elicit an increased response for the neuron throughout this task. In the memory-guided saccade task, the peripheral target was flashed briefly (150 ms) rather than maintained. Thus, the monkey was required to remember its location during the delay period. After the delay and the instruction to go, the monkey was required to make a saccade to the remembered location of the flashed target. When collecting neural data while the monkey performed the direction discrimination task, one target was placed in the center of the recorded neuron's RF and the other target was placed in the opposite hemifield. We refer to the target in the neuron's RF and its associated motion as <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub>; we refer to the other target and its associated motion as <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub>.</p><p>All training, surgery and experimental procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Washington Animal Care Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analyses of neural data</title><p>Population responses for motion discrimination trials were calculated by combining normalized responses across all neurons. Responses for each neuron were normalized by division by the mean peri-saccadic response (0–50 ms prior to saccade initiation) measured during a block of visually-guided delayed saccade trials. The spikes from each trial were aligned with respect to two trial events. Spikes were aligned to motion onset and saccade initiation, respectively, for analyses of the beginning and end of the decision process. When aligning to motion onset, the time period within 100 ms before saccade initiation was excluded to reduce contamination of the averages with peri-saccadic activity. Similarly, when aligning to the saccade, the time period within 200 ms after motion onset was excluded to avoid contamination by the dip in firing rate that follows motion onset. Response averages (running means) were calculated after applying a symmetric (non-causal) boxcar filter to the spike trains (boxcar width = 50 ms), appropriately normalized.</p><p>For plotting purposes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), motion strengths were binned into five groups: strong <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> (51.2% coh favoring <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub>), medium <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> (25.6, 12.8, and 6.4% coh favoring <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub>), weak (0 and 3.2% coh), medium <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub> (25.6, 12.8, and 6.4% coh favoring <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub>), and strong <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub> (51.2% coh favoring <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub>). All statistical tests were performed using the actual motion strengths; they were not influenced by the groupings of the trials. When plotting responses aligned to stimulus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), trials were sorted into quintiles based on RT. This was done separately for the responses for each neuron and then combined across corresponding quintiles.</p><p>To estimate buildup rate during decision formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we applied weighted regression to the mean firing rates for each motion strength and direction. The weighting is based on the time-dependent covariance of the running mean (i.e., the sample covariance of the boxcar filtered trials, divided by the number of trials), thereby correcting for temporal correlation induced by filtering and in the LIP responses themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>). The chosen analysis window was on the initial buildup, beginning 200 ms after motion onset and ending at the point in time when 50% of the trials were still included in the averages for each motion strength in the two speed-accuracy regimes, taking into account the RTs associated with each motion strength in each regime. The value of 200 ms is based on the established latency between stimulus motion (near the fovea) and the emergence of signals in LIP neurons that represent accumulation of evidence in favor of peripheral choice targets in the RFs of the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>), and it is supported in the current study by the time of the earliest significant effects of stimulus strength on LIP responses. We chose an ending point that equated the attrition of trials from each of the averages—that is, the fraction of trials that contribute to the averages. Attrition of trials associated with the fastest RTs biases the estimate of the buildup rate toward shallower slope because the faster rise times drop out of the average. An alternative approach would be to estimate the buildup rate using identical time intervals in both regimes, but Monte Carlo simulations revealed that it would result in a larger underestimation in the high speed regime than using an approach that based the endpoint on a matched level of trial attrition (results not shown). The latter approach does not eliminate the bias entirely, but it minimizes the difference in the bias of the buildup rate estimates in the two regimes.</p><p>For the single neuron analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we derived estimates of the evidence-independent response for each neuron and the mean RT for the corresponding behavioral session. Because of the noise inherent in measurements from single neurons, we estimated the evidence-independent signal by averaging responses across all motion strengths and choices. For the same reasons as described above, for each neuron we fit a line to the responses in an interval beginning 200 ms after stimulus onset and ending at a point in time when 50% of the trials for highest motion strength contributed to the average, thereby ensuring inclusion of at least 50% of trials at all time points for all motion strengths. From the linear fits, we obtained the firing rate 300 ms after motion onset (i.e., reflecting 100 ms of processing time in LIP) and divided this by the mean response 75 ms (using 50 ms bin width) before saccades to <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub>. This yields an estimate of the urgency signal in units of ‘fraction of neural bound’ for each neuron. The scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) displays the relationship between this statistic and the mean RT for each of the 70 experiments. We report standard correlation coefficients and report significance based on the Fisher z-transformation.</p><p>Statistical comparisons of neural measures were based on regression analyses using weighted least squares, which respect the standard error for point estimates and their correlation, when applicable.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study investigates how neural activity changes when subjects make perceptual decisions (and corresponding choices) when either accuracy or speed are emphasized. The results are interesting and novel in that they provide insight about what exactly changes (in terms of underlying neuronal circuits) when speed and accuracy are traded against each other: a phenomenon that occurs under a wide variety of conditions. There are a few concerns regarding the data analysis and presentation that must be dealt with.</p><p>1) The presentation of both behavioral and neural data is rather telegraphic. In most figures (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>) lines are shown without any details about error bars and number of neurons included in the averaging. In addition to unpacking their data, the authors should also show results (both behavior and neural activity) and perform statistics separately for each animal. It would also be nice to see some example neuron responses, as well as some statistics on individual neurons.</p><p>2) One important question is whether the effect of the sensory evidence on the decision is the same in the two conditions. The authors conclude that indeed it is, based on the “similar buildup rates observed in both SA regimes”. However, from the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and 3</xref>b, it appears that the separation between in and out responses for a given coherence is much stronger in the accuracy condition. The slope calculation appears neither robust nor sensitive enough. First, it must be crucially dependent on the chosen interval (200 to 350 ms after motion onset): if the buildup rates were calculated starting from the lowest point of the dip (around 160 ms), all the results would be higher in the speed condition than in the accuracy condition. The chosen interval seems arbitrary, and an objective way must be found.</p><p>Furthermore, one reviewer was not convinced that the slope calculation is appropriate to begin with, given that (1) it will partly reflect the common 'urgency' signal, which is different in the two cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, inset), and (2) the response trajectories toward threshold are obviously not straight. It seems that the difference between in and out responses at a given point in time would provide a much more robust measure of the impact of the motion stimulus, and by that measure, there would likely be a significant difference between conditions. Here is another way to think about it: given that there is an 'urgency' signal, a component of the activity that rises independently of the sensory evidence, how strongly do the neural responses <italic>deviate</italic> from it as a function of coherence? To assess the impact of the sensory information regardless of urgency, it is those deviations that should be compared across conditions.</p><p>3) The setup for the experiment is to test the idea that a change in the bound, or response threshold, is what accounts for the speed-accuracy tradeoff. This, however, is left somewhat unresolved. The bounded accumulation model required a 43% reduction in the excursion from baseline to threshold to account for the full tradeoff. In contrast, the authors observed an increase in baseline that seems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) much smaller (maybe 10%?), but once they discuss the rising urgency signal, they do not touch again on the original mechanism. Thus, the question remains, how much of the tradeoff is explained by the observed difference in excursion? There are two components to the increasing 'urgency' signal, an offset and a time-dependent component. In the model, it is possible to fit them either independently or simultaneously (i.e., to both conditions). So, how much of the effect is captured if just the offset (r0) varies across conditions (assuming a time-dependent component that is the same across conditions), and vice versa, how much of the effect is captured if the offset remains constant and only the time-dependent component is allowed to vary across conditions? This would provide a pretty good, quantitative indication of the importance of each term, and in particular, would resolve more quantitatively the original question implied in the Introduction: how well can a pure reduction in the excursion from baseline to threshold explain the observed tradeoff? Judging from the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, the temporally varying component of the urgency signal seems much stronger than the offset, but really what matters is how well each component can account for the data.</p><p>4) Related to this, in the Discussion, the two components, offset and temporally varying, are lumped together as part of a generic 'urgency' signal. This is a bit confusing. First of all, they may correspond to different neural mechanisms. The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heitz and Schall (2012)</xref>, for instance, show both types of changes, but different neuron types reflected each one to different extents. Second, the proposal by Bogacz et al. and the first model implemented in the manuscript deal just with the offset, whereas Cisek's model considers only the temporally-varying component. So, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons for making a distinction. The authors found that both components changed in their experiment, but still, it would be a good idea to discuss them as separate entities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02260.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We are grateful to the editor and referees for many suggestions and constructive criticisms. As detailed below, we have revised the paper to incorporate nearly all of them. The major changes to the paper include (i) new analyses by monkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5 fig6">Figures 2a, 5a, and 6</xref>), (ii) a new single neuron analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), and (iii) improved and better justified analysis window for buildup rates. We believe these and other changes have improved the logical flow of the paper, hence its readability. The process was also illuminating for us because we verified that the key conclusions were robust to a variety of choices we made to perform the analyses (new and old).</p><p><italic>1) The presentation of both behavioral and neural data is rather telegraphic. In most figures (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3a,b</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4b,c</italic></xref><italic>) lines are shown without any details about error bars and number of neurons included in the averaging. In addition to unpacking their data, the authors should also show results (both behavior and neural activity) and perform statistics separately for each animal. It would also be nice to see some example neuron responses, as well as some statistics on individual neurons</italic>.</p><p>We have taken multiple steps to address these concerns. (A) We have improved the presentation of all statistics, numbers of neurons, and other critical information. We have improved the PSTHs. Instead of displaying mean responses connected by line segments, we show the running means of firing rates and enforce a more sensible rule for averaging as a function of time that we apply consistently in all graphs and analyses. The rationale for this change is explained in detail in response to item 2, below. The running means convey the variation in a direct way, and they have the virtue of replacing the line segments with actual data. (B) We now present results for each animal on the key analyses of the behavior and neural changes accompanying a change in speed-accuracy regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5 fig6">Figures 2a, 5a, and 6</xref>). (C) We have included a new analysis in the manuscript that displays the effects for individual neurons. The new scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) shows an association between variation of SAT from session to session and variation in the neural activity (the neural “urgency signal”) in the corresponding session. However, because neurons were recorded in only one or the other regime (speed or accuracy), individual example neurons would not be informative about changes between conditions.</p><p><italic>2) One important question is whether the effect of the sensory evidence on the decision is the same in the two conditions. The authors conclude that indeed it is, based on the “similar buildup rates observed in both SA regimes”. However, from the plots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3a and 3b</italic></xref><italic>, it appears that the separation between in and out responses for a given coherence is much stronger in the accuracy condition. The slope calculation appears neither robust nor sensitive enough. First, it must be crucially dependent on the chosen interval (200 to 350 ms after motion onset): if the buildup rates were calculated starting from the lowest point of the dip (around 160 ms), all the results would be higher in the speed condition than in the accuracy condition. The chosen interval seems arbitrary, and an objective way must be found</italic>.</p><p>While our choice of interval for calculating the buildup rate was not arbitrary, we agree that we failed to adequately justify it in the original submission. The starting point, 200 ms, is based on the established latency between stimulus motion (near the fovea) and decision-related activity in LIP neurons that represent the choice targets. This surprisingly long latency has been documented in several publications (e.g., Roitman et al. 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>), and it is supported in the current study by the time of the earliest significant effects of stimulus strength on LIP responses. The ending point was guided by trial attrition. At longer times, progressively fewer trials contribute to the averages. In the revised manuscript, we apply a criterion of 50% attrition for each coherence in each SA regime; that is, we stop when fewer than half of the trials would contribute to the response. This is slightly different from what we did in the original submission, and we are grateful to the reviewers for pushing us to consider this issue more carefully. As the reviewers are aware, attrition of trials associated with the fastest RT biases the estimate of the buildup rate toward shallower slope (because the faster rise times drop out of the average). We used Monte Carlo methods to explore the bias introduced by a variety of attrition rules. We had originally chosen an endpoint for the regression to match the value of 50% attrition in the high speed regime, but we discovered that this strategy biased the estimates differently in the two SA regimes, as the reviewer suspected. We now apply the same 50% attrition rule to each motion strength in each of the SA regimes. This helps to clarify the relationship between the PSTHs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref> and the buildup rates shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>. Like the original figure, the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> shows that a change in motion strength affects the buildup rate similarly in the two regimes (compare the slopes). However, the new graph better clarifies a consistent difference in the absolute magnitude of the buildup rates in the two regimes (compare the offsets), which is consistent with the presence of an urgency signal that affects all buildup rates by roughly the same amount, albeit more so in the high speed regime. We have revised the manuscript to explain this objective basis for the comparisons of buildup rates between the two conditions.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, one reviewer was not convinced that the slope calculation is appropriate to begin with, given that (1) it will partly reflect the common 'urgency' signal, which is different in the two cases (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure. 5a</italic></xref><italic>, inset), and (2) the response trajectories toward threshold are obviously not straight. It seems that the difference between in and out responses at a given point in time would provide a much more robust measure of the impact of the motion stimulus, and by that measure, there would likely be a significant difference between conditions. Here is another way to think about it: given that there is an 'urgency' signal, a component of the activity that rises independently of the sensory evidence, how strongly do the neural responses</italic> deviate <italic>from it as a function of coherence? To assess the impact of the sensory information regardless of urgency, it is those deviations that should be compared across conditions</italic>.</p><p>With regard to point (1), we agree with the reviewer that differences in urgency could affect the buildup rate calculation. Importantly, though, urgency changes that underlie the SAT should not depend on motion strength. So, it should not affect the slope of the relationship between buildup rate and motion strength, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>. We realize that we did not explain this well in the original manuscript, and we have revised the text to clarify this point. With regard to point (2), one of the main reasons that response averages are not straight is the attrition of the trials with more extreme buildup rates from the averages. Comparison of the responses at a particular point in time would suffer from the concerns described above; greater trial attrition in the high speed regime compared to the high accuracy regime at matched times. All of these concerns prompted us to improve (and clarify) the interval chosen for analyses, which is based on matched trial attrition in the two SA regimes.</p><p><italic>3) The setup for the experiment is to test the idea that a change in the bound, or response threshold, is what accounts for the speed-accuracy tradeoff. This, however, is left somewhat unresolved. The bounded accumulation model required a 43% reduction in the excursion from baseline to threshold to account for the full tradeoff. In contrast, the authors observed an increase in baseline that seems (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5a</italic></xref><italic>) much smaller (maybe 10%?), but once they discuss the rising urgency signal, they do not touch again on the original mechanism. Thus, the question remains, how much of the tradeoff is explained by the observed difference in excursion? There are two components to the increasing 'urgency' signal, an offset and a time-dependent component. In the model, it is possible to fit them either independently or simultaneously (i.e., to both conditions). So, how much of the effect is captured if just the offset (r0) varies across conditions (assuming a time-dependent component that is the same across conditions), and vice versa, how much of the effect is captured if the offset remains constant and only the time-dependent component is allowed to vary across conditions? This would provide a pretty good, quantitative indication of the importance of each term, and in particular, would resolve more quantitatively the original question implied in the Introduction: how well can a pure reduction in the excursion from baseline to threshold explain the observed tradeoff? Judging from the inset in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5a</italic></xref><italic>, the temporally-varying component of the urgency signal seems much stronger than the offset, but really what matters is how well each component can account for the data</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers correctly point out a tension between our initial presentation of the behavioral data and the neural responses. Specifically, we show that the bounded accumulation model accounts for the behavioral changes with a large static change in the excursion from baseline to threshold. In contrast, the neural responses exhibit a combination of static and time-dependent components of an evidence-independent signal. However, the reason for this tension is straightforward: in the initial presentation of the model fits to behavioral data, we opted not to include a time-dependent component for the sake of simplicity. We did not intend this to motivate a test of whether a static component alone accounts for the SAT. We view the key finding as the fact that an evidence-independent signal is added to LIP responses to implement the SAT. However, we also acknowledge that this signal can be broken down into its static and time-dependent components. Because some readers may react like the reviewers, and because we wish to retain the simplicity of the fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we now report how well either the static or dynamic components of the excursion can account for the behavioral data. We hope the additional attention given to this issue throughout the paper will help to clarify our interpretation.</p><p><italic>4) Related to this, in the Discussion, the two components, offset and temporally varying, are lumped together as part of a generic 'urgency' signal. This is a bit confusing. First of all, they may correspond to different neural mechanisms. The results of</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"><italic>Heitz and Schall (2012)</italic></xref><italic>, for instance, show both types of changes, but different neuron types reflected each one to different extents. Second, the proposal by Bogacz et al. and the first model implemented in the manuscript deal just with the offset, whereas Cisek's model considers only the temporally-varying component. So, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons for making a distinction. The authors found that both components changed in their experiment, but still, it would be a good idea to discuss them as separate entities</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewers note, we grouped both of these components together in the Discussion of the original manuscript. The reason we chose to do that is that we have little reason to believe that they are different mechanisms. If there is a mechanism to add a time-dependent signal to a response, it seems unlikely that the mechanism would not extend to t=0. Indeed, we believe that the distinction between static and dynamic components is artificial: the static component is nothing more than the value of the dynamic signal at t=0. As the reviewers recognize, there is a tradition that emphasizes only stationary (i.e., flat) bounds, but this turns out to have been a misguided application of the sequential probability ratio test to situations where it is not normative;in particular situations like ours when there are a variety of stimulus strengths that are randomly interleaved. Of course our lab has contributed to the confusion, until recently (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</xref>, and Box 2 of Shadlen and Kiani, 2013). Nevertheless, we recognize that we did not make these points clear in the original manuscript. Thus, we have elaborated on these issues in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
