lipid transport protein that is secreted and circulates in insect hemolymph. We hijacked the <italic>Anopheles coluzzii Lipophorin</italic> gene to make it co-express a single-chain version of antibody 2A10, which binds sporozoites of the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. The resulting transgenic mosquitoes show a markedly decreased ability to transmit <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> expressing the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> circumsporozoite protein to mice. To force the spread of this antimalarial transgene in a mosquito population, we designed and tested several CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drives. One of these is installed in, and disrupts, the pro-parasitic gene <italic>Saglin</italic> and also cleaves wild-type <italic>Lipophorin,</italic> causing the anti-malarial modified <italic>Lipophorin</italic> version to replace the wild type and hitch-hike together with the <italic>Saglin</italic> drive. Although generating drive-resistant alleles and showing instability in its gRNA-encoding multiplex array, the <italic>Saglin</italic>-based gene drive reached high levels in caged mosquito populations and efficiently promoted the simultaneous spread of the antimalarial <italic>Lipophorin::Sc2A10</italic> allele. This combination is expected to decrease parasite transmission via two different mechanisms. This work contributes to the design of novel strategies to spread antimalarial transgenes in mosquitoes, and illustrates some expected and unexpected outcomes encountered when establishing a population modification gene drive.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>disease control</kwd><kwd>transgenic mosquitoes</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9 gene drives</kwd><kwd>genetic engineering</kwd><kwd>Anopheles gambiae</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE35-0007-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marois</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blandin</surname><given-names>Stéphanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-EQPX-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marois</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KL 3251/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klug</surname><given-names>Dennis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Strong reduction in malaria transmission by genetically modified mosquitoes is achieved in the laboratory using a dual gene drive that simultaneously propagates an antiparasitic factor and a parasite-detrimental mosquito mutation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria-transmitting mosquitoes cause over 245 million malaria cases and about 620,000 deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">WHO, 2021</xref>). Vector control, mainly in the form of insecticide indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets, has permitted a steady decrease in malaria cases during the last decades. However, this decline is stalling as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to insecticides and as malaria parasites continue to evolve resistance to drugs. These ongoing genetic changes in vectors and parasites, under the selection pressure of two major pillars of malaria control, jeopardize the hard-won successes in the fight against malaria. To address the need for complementary malaria control approaches, intervention strategies based on intentional genetic changes in mosquitoes to decrease malaria transmission are under development. Recent advances in the field of gene drive (GD) provide a mean to push desirable transgenes to invade a target population of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carballar-Lejarazú and James, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz and Akbari, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quinn and Nolan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James and Santos, 2023</xref>).</p><p>GD interventions against malaria mosquitoes are still in the laboratory phase of their development, and can be subdivided in two classes: (a) population suppression GDs that spread either female sterility or female killing in mosquito populations with the aim to eliminate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>); (b) population modification GDs that leave mosquito populations in place, but genetically alter them to reduce their disease transmission capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2023</xref>). Both approaches raise ethical, safety and ecological concerns, and trigger controversy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Courtier-Orgogozo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Graeff et al., 2021</xref>). One concern raised by elimination approaches is their possible consequences on the food web and ecosystems, even where dozens of sympatric mosquito species are potentially available to compensate for the loss of the target species. In some regions, elimination of one species could favor the installation of competing species that could also act as vectors, as can be feared for the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> / <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquito dyad vectoring dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Modification approaches alleviate these concerns by leaving the target species in its ecological niche, but in turn, the indefinite persistence of transgenes utilized in modification drives could have long-term secondary effects, so that both approaches should be planned with utmost caution. However, the option of rejecting gene drive technologies as a complementary tool to fight mosquito-borne pathogens also raises ethical issues, by ignoring a chance to curb the immense mortality and morbidity caused by mosquito-borne infections.</p><p><italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (sensu lato), the major mosquito vector of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, is widely distributed, locally abundant during rainy seasons and its biomass might significantly contribute to the food chain, in a temporal fashion. Besides their possible negative impact on food webs, elimination approaches for this mosquito are likely to be complicated by re-colonization from residual pockets of surviving isolated populations, resulting in chasing dynamics of gene drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Champer et al., 2022</xref>). For this species in its native ecosystem, population modification to decrease vector competence and preserve ecological functions could be a meaningful gene drive approach. Here, we present the engineering of the <italic>Lipophorin</italic> (<italic>Lp</italic>) essential gene in <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic>, a prominent member of the <italic>A. gambiae</italic> species complex and a major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p><italic>Lp</italic> naturally encodes an abundant lipid transport protein secreted in mosquito hemolymph. We modified <italic>Lp</italic> to co-express a single-chain antibody (ScFv) derived from 2A10, a well-established mouse monoclonal antibody that binds the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> circumsporozoite protein (CSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zavala et al., 1983</xref>). Sporozoites are the parasite stage that mosquito females inject in vertebrate hosts while aquiring a blood meal. Once in the host, sporozoites quickly infect the liver and multiply to produce merozoites with a tropism for red blood cells. Through its binding to CSP (the major sporozoite surface antigen), 2A10 was shown to decrease sporozoite infectivity to cultured human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hollingdale et al., 1984</xref>). Transgenic expression of a 2A10 ScFv, fused to the antimicrobial peptide Cecropin A and expressed under the control of the <italic>Vitellogenin</italic> promoter, decreased the number of salivary gland sporozoites in <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isaacs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isaacs et al., 2012</xref>) and in <italic>A. gambiae</italic>/<italic>coluzzii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2023</xref>). Expression of a 2A10 ScFv directly in the salivary glands of <italic>An. stephensi</italic> reduced sporozoite infectivity to cultured hepatocytes, and transmission to mice of chimeric <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> expressing CSP from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sumitani et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, expression of a different CSP-binding ScFv in transgenic <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> decreased the sporozoite’s ability to infect cultured hepatocytes and to cause malaria in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Triller et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We inserted the 2A10 ScFv coding sequence within the endogenous open-reading frame of the essential <italic>Lp</italic> gene, preserving Lp function and exploiting a natural proteolytic cleavage site to separate the fusion protein moieties during their secretion. Using a mouse model of malaria, in which a transgenic rodent <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> strain expresses CSP from <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we show a strong decrease in the ability of the genetically engineered mosquitoes to transmit <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. In a second step, we tested different CRISPR/Cas9-based GD designs to force the spread of the <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> transgene in laboratory mosquito populations. A first, suppression GD disrupting the wild-type (WT) <italic>Lp</italic> locus revealed haploinsufficiency of the <italic>Lp</italic> gene, precluding this approach. Other GD versions were designed to home into and disrupt the <italic>Saglin</italic> pro-parasitic gene on the X chromosome. These GD also expressed guide RNAs targeting WT <italic>Lp</italic>, promoting homing of <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> on the second chromosome. This dual homing at both the <italic>Saglin</italic> and <italic>Lp</italic> loci resulted in the simultaneous spread of the two transgenes in caged mosquito populations. In modified mosquitoes, sporozoite transmission should be reduced by two distinct mechanisms, i.e., depriving <italic>Plasmodium</italic> from its Saglin agonist plus attacking sporozoites with the ScFv. Each of the <italic>Saglin</italic> and the <italic>Lp</italic> loci were targeted with multiplexes of three gRNAs, to increase the chance that failed homing events result in loss-of-function <italic>Lp</italic> mutations that would be eliminated by natural selection, and loss-of-function, GD-resistant <italic>Saglin</italic> alleles that should still contribute to decrease vector competence. One homing-refractory functional allele was however observed at the <italic>Lp</italic> locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of an engineered Lp allele encoding an anti-sporozoite factor while preserving Lp function</title><p>The two most abundant proteins secreted in <italic>Anopheles</italic> hemolymph are the nutrient transporters Lipophorin (Lp) and Vitellogenin (Vg), as illustrated by Coomassie staining of electrophoresis gels revealing both proteins as the major visible bands in hemolymph extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rono et al., 2010</xref>). While Vg is induced in mosquito females only upon blood feeding and wanes within 3 days as eggs develop, Lp is expressed constitutively, with a further spike of expression after blood feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attardo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rono et al., 2010</xref>). We reasoned that Lp protein abundance, secretion in hemolymph and persistence of expression outside gonotrophic cycles make <italic>Lp</italic> a particularly attractive host gene to co-express and secrete high levels of synthetic anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> factors. Here we tested a 2A10 scFv version without fusion to Cecropin as antimalarial effector, and hereinafter refer to this effector as Sc2A10. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we knocked-in codon-optimized <italic>Sc2A10</italic> in frame after the endogenous first <italic>Lp</italic> coding exon, which encodes the Lp secretion signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, for sequence of the plasmid used for knock-in see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). As a result, transcription of the chimeric <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> mRNA encodes the natural Lp signal peptide followed by Sc2A10 fused to the remainder of the Lp protein sequence. A natural furin proteolytic cleavage site located between the ApoLpII and ApoLpI subunits of the Lp polypeptide allows their separation during maturation in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smolenaars et al., 2005</xref>). We duplicated this motif to detach Sc2A10 from ApoLpII during protein maturation. The knock-in design also introduced silent mutations in the majority of possible Cas9 sgRNA target sites within <italic>Lp</italic> exon 1 and the beginning of intron 1, to facilitate selection of multiple sgRNAs targeting WT <italic>Lp</italic>, but not its engineered allele, when designing subsequent GDs. Finally, the 1644-bp first intron immediately following <italic>Lp</italic> exon 1 offered an ideal location to host a fluorescent selection marker to identify and track the modified gene. We placed a <italic>GFP</italic> marker gene under control of the synthetic <italic>3xP3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horn and Wimmer, 2000</xref>) and <italic>D. melanogaster Tubulin56D</italic> terminator in this intron, with care taken to preserve the intron splice junctions and in reverse orientation relative to <italic>Lp</italic> transcription so that the <italic>Tub56D</italic> terminator would not cause premature arrest of <italic>Lp</italic> mRNA transcription. The <italic>Lp</italic> promoter is active in the fat body, while the <italic>3xP3</italic> promoter is active in the nervous system. These synthetic modifications in the <italic>Lp</italic> locus are schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and annotated in the provided sequence file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization and modification of the endogenous <italic>Lipophorin</italic> gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie staining of electrophoresed hemolymph proteins.

Because the <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> gene fusion produces a single mRNA, with the endogenous Lp signal peptide addressing the entire fusion protein to the secretory pathway, the Sc2A10 protein fragment must initially be stoichiometric to the Lp subunits ApoLpI and ApoLpII. Upon proteolytic cleavage dissociating Sc2A10, ApoLpII, and ApoLpI and after their secretion into the hemolymph, each moiety possibly follows a different fate. In two mass spectrometry samples from the hemolymph of homozygous transgenic mosquitoes, for a total of 2629 peptides from the largest Lp subunit ApoLpI, we detected 672 peptides from smaller ApoLpII and 18 from Sc2A10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Corrected for size, this suggests that Sc2A10 molecules are 10- to 20-fold less abundant in the hemolymph compared to ApoLpI and ApoLpII. This observation suggests that while Sc2A10 is made and secreted into hemolymph, its disappearance by degradation, uptake in cells or stickiness to tissue, is faster than that of its sister Lp proteins. Of note, western blots using anti-ApoLpII antibodies on hemolymph samples from homozygous transgenic mosquitoes showed no size upshift for ApoLpII, confirming that Sc2A10 is properly released from ApoLpII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

This aimed to exploit the natural tendency of suppression GDs that target an essential gene to initially spread in the population only to be supplanted, over time, by GD-immune functional mutants of the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2022</xref>). Here <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> itself, lacking the gRNA target sites, would play the role of a GD-immune, functional <italic>Lp</italic> mutant allele. The advantage of this approach was that a <italic>Cas9</italic> and gRNA-carrying transgenic GD cassette inserted in <italic>Lp</italic> need not persist indefinitely in the population, being supplanted by the technologically more benign <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> transgene. To minimize the spontaneous emergence of undesirable additional GD-immune and functional <italic>Lp</italic> alleles, we used a multiplex of 4 gRNAs targeting <italic>Lp</italic>. The rationale was that in cases of failed GD homing, multiple Cas9 cuts repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) would mainly generate loss-of-function alleles in the essential <italic>Lp</italic> gene (e.g. deletions between Cas9 cut sites, frameshifts at several individual cut sites) doomed to be eliminated by natural selection. We constructed a DsRed<sub>NLS</sub>-marked <italic>Lp</italic> suppression GD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and annotated sequence in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>), in which an array of 4 gRNAs separated by tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>), targeting <italic>Lp</italic> but not <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic>, were expressed under control of a single U6 promoter. <italic>Cas9</italic> was placed under the control of <italic>zpg</italic> regulatory elements, currently considered best for use in suppression GDs due to tighter restriction of Cas9 activity to the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). Knocking-in this GD into the <italic>Lp</italic> locus was achieved by injecting this plasmid into &gt;800 mosquito eggs carrying a heterozygous copy of GFP-marked <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic>, in order to retain a protected functional copy of <italic>Lp</italic> during the disruption of wild-type <italic>Lp</italic> by Cas9.

Upon chromosome cleavage by Cas9 (shown by scissors), homologous recombination (gray shading) via 5’ and 3’ regions of homology (HR) is expected to insert the intervening elements (gRNA-encoding array, zpg-Cas9 expression cassette, DsRed<sub>NLS</sub> marker cassette) into the beginning of the Lp gene, disrupting its function.

In this cross, DsRed<sub>NLS</sub> marking the <italic>Lp-GD</italic> construct was expected to strictly segregate away from GFP marking the <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> allele. Puzzlingly however, the majority of knock-in larvae contained a compound <italic>Lp</italic> locus harboring the DsRed<sub>NLS</sub>-marked GD cassette strictly linked to the GFP-marked <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> transgene. Sequencing PCR products spanning parts of this insertion confirmed that, instead of the expected insertion of the <italic>Lp-GD</italic> cassette, a complex chromosomal rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) had repaired the Cas9-cleaved wild-type chromosome by incorporating the entire injected plasmid, and by recombining with the intact sister chromosome bearing the <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> transgene.

It showed 57.7% GFP inheritance (<italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> locus) compared to 50% expected in the absence of homing. DsRed inheritance was more difficult to assess, as the low intensity of red fluorescence did not allow accurate gating to separate red fluorescent from negative larvae on COPAS diagrams. Approximate gating completed with visual examination of a sample of 200 larvae suggested 54.1% DsRed inheritance at the <italic>Saglin</italic> locus, an even more modest inheritance bias than for GFP at the <italic>Lp</italic> locus. Mild homing could be explained by position effects affecting the activity of the <italic>zpg</italic> promoter, by a lack of recombination at the target loci, or by inefficiency of gRNAs. To distinguish among these possibilities, we generated females carrying single heterozygous copies of the three unlinked transgenes <italic>SagGD<sup>zpg</sup></italic>, <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> and a non-fluorescent (puromycin resistance-marked) <italic>vasa-Cas9</italic>.

We maintained the two populations for &gt;31 generations and, after 10 and 16 generations, derived six additional populations from the basal ones by outcrossing to WT. Populations 3 and 4 were established by mixing randomly selected transgenic mosquitoes (both males and females of generation 10) from populations 1 and 2, respectively, with wild-types, to mimic what may occur in a mixed-sex field release. Populations 5–8 were established by crossing single-sex transgenic mosquitoes to WT of the opposite sex, both to mimic a single-sex field release and to re-assess homing efficiency after 16 generations. To examine the long-term dynamics of both transgenes, we exploited GFP fluorescence from <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> and DsRed fluorescence from <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> to COPAS-analyze successive generations of all populations, with large sample sizes, over a long period of time (&gt;2 years for populations 1 and 2). COPAS analyses allowed not only to distinguish negative from transgenic larvae but also, at least partially, heterozygotes from homozygotes for each transgene. Visual examination of the successive COPAS diagrams provides an accurate sense of the temporal dynamics of both transgenes generation after generation, and an appreciation of sample sizes (see snapshots of COPAS diagrams in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> offers a graphical representation of the same data, after extracting approximate percentages of larvae of each genotype from the COPAS diagrams. In all populations, mosquitoes lacking <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> disappeared rapidly, and all young populations rapidly consisted of a majority of homozygous <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Despite the absence of physical linkage between the two transgenes, DsRed-only individuals were strikingly absent from all early populations, indicative of the lethality of the <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> transgene in the absence of a protected <italic>Lp</italic> allele. Importantly, toxicity of <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> was due to its destructive action on the <italic>Lp</italic> locus rather than to a fitness cost of its disrupted <italic>Saglin</italic> host locus, since individuals carrying both DsRed and GFP thrived in all populations, and consistent with the reported absence of obvious fitness cost of <italic>Saglin</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klug et al., 2023</xref>). Several populations (notably populations 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) rapidly seemed fixed for <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic>. A trend for reversal, with <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> progressively giving way to GFP negative individuals (presumably functional <italic>Lp</italic> mutants refractory to homing), was observed from G14 on for population 2, although GFP positive individuals still represented a large majority of the population (&gt;90% from G1 on), while GFP allele frequency reached 0.98 at G8 before decreasing and oscillating between 0.71 and 0.92 after G14. For the <italic>Saglin</italic> locus, COPAS diagram interpretation must take into account the position of this gene on the X chromosome, with male mosquitoes bearing a single copy and appearing in the same larval cloud as heterozygous females (dosage compensation of the transgene not being apparent at this locus). Drive will be slower as it can occur only in females. While the majority of mosquitoes of all populations rapidly carried at least one copy of <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic>, we observed that a substantial fraction of DsRed negative individuals (up to 30%), likely carrying GD refractory <italic>Saglin</italic> mutants, persisted in some populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Temporal dynamics of the <italic>Sag-GD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> and <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> transgenes in 8 mosquito populations.</title><p>Transgenic mosquitoes carrying both transgenes were crossed to wild-type of the other sex (populations 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8) or mixed with wild-types (populations 3, 4) as indicated above the diagrams, and the frequency of each transgene in 1000–4000 neonate larvae of successive generations was tracked by flow cytometry (COPAS) using the GFP fluorescent marker of <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> and the DsRed fluorescent marker of <italic>Sag-GD<sup>vasa</sup></italic>.

Indeed, DsRed negative mosquitoes (lacking the GD construct in <italic>Saglin</italic>) persisted at a relatively stable frequency of approximately 30% in populations 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To characterize <italic>Saglin</italic> mutants, we COPAS-extracted 750 and 150 DsRed-negative larvae from a surplus of larvae from generation 4 of population 1 and generation 3 of population 2. DsRed-negative individuals represented 18 and 31% of these populations, respectively, with the <italic>Saglin</italic> gene on their X chromosome having been exposed to between one and four rounds of Cas9 activity. We PCR amplified a <italic>Saglin</italic> fragment spanning the 3 gRNA target sites, and subjected the amplicon to high-throughput sequencing. While the majority of sequenced DsRed negative alleles still corresponded to wild-type <italic>Saglin</italic> having thus far escaped GD activity, a wide variety of <italic>Saglin</italic> mutations, different between the two sampled populations, were readily identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a and b</xref>). Interestingly, a majority of these <italic>Saglin</italic> haplotypes were mutated only at the target site of gRNA2, suggesting that this gRNA was the most active of the three and that Cas9, confronted to a pool of three <italic>Saglin</italic> and three <italic>Lp</italic> gRNAs, will not necessarily cleave all target sites in a given germ cell. However, combinations of mutations at gRNA1, gRNA2 and/or gRNA3 target sites were also identified. Several haplotypes were consistent with iterative action of Cas9 in lineages of haplotypes, a specific mutation occurring either singly, or associated to one or two additional mutations at the other gRNA target sites. Deletions spanning two gRNA target sites were rare in our samples (one instance of such a haplotype was detected, carrying a deletion between gRNA1 and gRNA2). Overall, Cas9 was not highly active at the <italic>Saglin</italic> locus, some target sites being missed at each generation and combinations of mutations accumulating iteratively as germ cells were exposed to Cas9 in successive generations. Therefore, the target locus of a multiplex gRNA GD experiencing failed homing at a given generation resulting in mutation of one target site may still undergo successful homing in later generations, as long as all gRNA targets are not yet mutated. Inexorably however, <italic>Saglin</italic> mutants fully refractory to the GD will form in mosquito populations; we recovered at least one haplotype with mutations in all three target sites after four generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Characterization of mutations in target genes.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Characterization of <italic>Saglin</italic> failed homing mutations.

While tracking the frequency of transgenes in [<italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup>; Lp::Sc2A10</italic>] mosquitoes, we noted the appearance of a few GFP negative larvae in populations 2 and 3. These amounted to 2.4% of total larvae in generation 14 of population 2.

However, these GFP negative mosquitoes developed to healthy and fertile adults.

This suggested that (i) the first of the three gRNA expressed from the gRNA array did not act; and (ii) combinations of mutations preserving the function of target essential genes can emerge despite the cumulative activity of two gRNAs, which in this case was certainly facilitated by the fact that one of them targeted an intron, more permissive to change.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Genetic instability of the gRNA array</title><p>The gRNA array in the <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> construct being a repetitive tandem of six U6-gRNA units, genetic instability may be expected and observable after several generations of mosquito breeding.

PCR primers were chosen to span the gRNA array. Resulting amplicons were examined on agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and sequenced. Interestingly, two derivative alleles of the gene drive construct dominated the four sampled mosquito populations: a longer version that still retained five of the original six gRNAs, and a shorter version that retained only two gRNAs. The original transgenesis vector used for microinjection was resequenced and verified to contain all six gRNA expression units; therefore, deletions occurred post integration in the mosquito genome. gRNA deletions probably began to occur early in the evolution of the transgenic populations, since the same deletion of the first <italic>Lp</italic> gRNA was detected in both populations 1 and 2, separated at the third generation following transgenesis and subsequently bred independently for 29 generations before sampling. The larger deletion of 4 gRNAs was not observed among the 12 sampled males from population 2, whereas it was the most frequent allele in population 1 and its two daughter populations 5 and 7. This larger deletion may have arisen from a further loss of gRNA units in the allele carrying 5 gRNAs, since <italic>Lp</italic> gRNA1 is missing in both alleles, its position occupied by <italic>Lp</italic> gRNA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

The choice of the <italic>Lp</italic> gene was motivated by its exceptionally strong expression level (Lp being the most abundant constitutively expressed protein in mosquito hemolymph) and by its endogenous signal peptide, which we could exploit to obtain concomitant secretion of Sc2A10 with Lp protein. The existence of an endogenous proteolytic cleavage site within the Lp protein, that we duplicated to detach Sc2A10 from Lp, was also advantageous, as well as the natural intron immediately following the signal peptide-encoding exon 1 that could accept a visual selection marker for easy tracking of the genetic modification. This approach is related to the integral gene drive strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoermann et al., 2021</xref>) in that anti-malarial factors are expressed together with an endogenous gene, but here the modified endogenous gene does not comprise any component of a gene drive —in the case of integral gene drives, gRNAs are inserted in a synthetic intron. The genetic modification does not disrupt expression or function of the <italic>Lp</italic> essential gene. On the contrary, Lp protein expression is intended to remain as unaffected as possible, but obligatorily proceeds through translation of the Sc2A10 antimalarial factor inserted between the Lp signal peptide and the rest of the Lp protein. This design minimizes the risk of spontaneous transgene loss by mutation, since frameshift or nonsense mutations in the <italic>Sc2A10</italic> coding sequence would prevent <italic>Lp</italic> expression, resulting in their elimination by natural selection. Furthermore, the absence of repeated motifs in the synthetic sequence decreases the risk of in-frame deletions. The possibility of a loss of the transgene’s anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> activity should therefore be limited to missense mutations or in-frame deletions arising in the <italic>Sc2A10</italic> coding sequence, or to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> evolution, notably under selection pressure imposed by the transgene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marshall et al., 2019</xref>). However, the 2A10 antibody targets a highly repeated epitope on the CSP protein (the NANP motif), that, in addition to being repetitive, is also conserved across <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. A combination of mutations leading to the complete loss of this epitope in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> therefore seems unlikely, and would probably cause a dramatic loss of parasite fitness as CSP is required in several processes in the sporozoite’s journey between two hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaban et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Hijacking Lp and its signal peptide is an approach that could be widely applicable to other possible factors acting in the hemolymph to attack various parasite stages, such as ookinetes, which represent a particularly vulnerable stage of parasite development in the mosquito. To make mosquitoes that express and combine additional secreted factors against parasites, <italic>Vitellogenin</italic> (AGAP004203) could also be engineered in the same manner, taking advantage of its own signal peptide, extremely high expression level but also transient induction following a blood meal. Blood meal inducibility would be particularly suitable for antimalarial factors specifically targeting ookinetes, as they emerge on the hemolymph-bathed side of the midgut exactly within the short time window when <italic>Vitellogenin</italic> is expressed. Mosquitoes would not be exposed during their development to a factor expressed from <italic>Vg</italic>, limiting potential fitness costs. As proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoermann et al., 2021</xref> <italic>Carboxipeptidase</italic> (<italic>Cp</italic>) represents an additional attractive host locus for antimalarial factors, sharing many of the advantages of <italic>Vg</italic>. A single GD expressing multiplexed gRNAs could stimulate the simultaneous spread of <italic>Lp, Vg and Cp</italic> modified, anti-parasitic alleles.</p><p>In spite of the high Lp protein secretion in mosquito hemolymph, we only detected less than 1/10 of this molecular amount for Sc2A10 in hemolymph by mass spectrometry. Apart from technical limitations in detection sensitity (e.g. biased trypsin digestion of some peptides) this could be explained by faster removal from the hemolymph and /or faster degradation of Sc2A10 compared to Lp. Different, more stable anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> peptides that could accumulate to higher levels may show even better efficacy as transmission-blocking agents compared to Sc2A10. This also highlights the benefit of choosing a strong promoter such as that of <italic>Lp</italic> to ensure maximal production of antimalarial effectors in the hemolymph. A single copy of the <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> transgene still showed a reduction in transmission. Of note, the rodent model of malaria used here (<italic>P. berghei</italic> expressing CSP from <italic>P. falciparum</italic>) is characterized by very high infection rates, typically producing dozens of oocysts per midgut, each of which can release hundreds of sporozoites in mosquito hemolymph. The ability of secreted Sc2A10 to decrease sporozoite transmission even in this high infection context is highly encouraging, given the much lower levels of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (typically 1 to a few oocysts) in field infections. An even greater anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> activity of Sc2A10 may be reached by fusing it to antimicrobial peptides such as CecropinA, as achieved by Isaacs et al. in conventional transgenic <italic>An. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isaacs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isaacs et al., 2012</xref>) and subsequently in the first published GD for <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies, the Sc2A10::CecropinA fusion was expressed intermittently under the control of the blood-meal inducible <italic>Vitellogenin</italic> promoter, and combined with a second scFv targeting <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> ookinete Chitinase 1 also expressed after blood meals under the control of the <italic>Cp</italic> promoter. While the insertion of <italic>Sc2A10::CecropinA</italic> within <italic>Lp</italic> coding sequences may further improve the efficiency of our approach, there is a risk that CecropinA expressed at all developmental stages, and an increased complexity of the Lp fusion protein, worsen the fitness cost already observed in <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> mosquitoes.</p><p>To force the spread of the <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> transgene in mosquito populations, we tested several gene drive (GD) designs. A same-locus suppression drive was also installed in the <italic>Lp</italic> gene, creating a loss-of-function allele. The <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> allele was intended to act as an R1-type, gene drive refractory functional allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champer et al., 2018</xref>) that would supplant the suppression gene drive and invade the population. This was unsuccessful, as <italic>Lp</italic> proved largely haplo-insufficient. In contrast, distant-locus GDs disrupting <italic>Saglin</italic>, a non-essential but pro-parasitic gene, were efficient at promoting invasion of both the <italic>Saglin,</italic> and particularly the <italic>Lipophorin,</italic> modified alleles. Unlike the first approach, this design may allow Cas9 and gRNA-coding genes to persist indefinitely within the invaded mosquito population (unless nonfunctional resistance alleles outcompete the drive allele in the long run). Although for this reason we initially preferred the same-locus approach in which <italic>Lp</italic> function disruption by the insertion of CRISPR/Cas9 components caused their gradual disappearance by natural selection, the added benefit of a GD installed in <italic>Saglin</italic> is that it should further reduce the transgenic mosquitoes’ vectorial capacity, a combination of two distinct mechanisms to decrease sporozoite transmission being more robust to combat <italic>Plasmodium</italic> durably.</p><p>Importantly, we observed that same-locus or distant-locus constructs carrying guide RNAs that target wild-type <italic>Lp</italic> are inviable, and rapidly go extinct in the absence of a recoded <italic>Lp</italic> allele such as <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> (or spontaneous <italic>Lp</italic> mutants immune to GD that may arise in GD populations). The genetic design established here can be viewed as a two-component GD in which one component (<italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic>) has no drive capacity by itself but (i) rescues the lethality, and (ii) hitchhikes on the drive capacity of the other (<italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic>) ensuring its own hyper-Mendelian spread. The two transgenic loci are, therefore, reciprocally dependent on each other: <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> depends on <italic>SagGD</italic> for its long-term persistence and spread in a population, and <italic>SagGD</italic> depends on <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> as a rescue allele of the essential <italic>Lp</italic> target for its survival. This design can be seen as a two-locus variation of rescue-type GDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>Because <italic>Saglin</italic> knockout mutants bear no fitness cost at least in laboratory conditions, GD-refractory <italic>Saglin</italic> alleles generated by failed homing events are certain to accumulate over time (all the more so as their lack of toxicity toward the WT <italic>Lp</italic> allele confers them a high selective advantage compared to <italic>Sag</italic>GD). If the demise of the <italic>Saglin</italic> GD occurs sufficiently late, <italic>Lp-Sc2A10</italic> could still reach high levels or even fixation in a mosquito population. If, however, GD refractory mutations in <italic>Saglin</italic> accumulate rapidly and no longer support <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> maintenance, the elimination of both <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> and <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> will be inexorable. Thus wild-types alleles are likely to re-establish at both loci once the frequency of active <italic>Saglin</italic> GDs drops, especially under conditions of strong mosquito immigration from regions adjacent to the initial GD spread range. Still, even as genetic resistance to the GD develops, the resulting high frequency of <italic>Saglin</italic> loss-of-function mutant alleles arising from failed homing events, with their transient selective advantage while <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> and wild <italic>Lp</italic> alleles co-exist, should decrease global vector competence.</p><p>Once a GD installed in the <italic>Saglin</italic> locus is defeated by the accumulation of GD-refractory mutations, new generations of GD installed at different loci could be launched to re-ignite the spread of the <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> allele. For instance, GDs built for the same mosquito species in the frame of other projects could also incorporate gRNAs re-igniting the spread of <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic>, promoting antimalarial approaches similar to combination therapies. In this respect, transgenic systems permitting the expression of multiplexes of many gRNAs would be instrumental. Some of the constructs presented here incorporate multiplex gRNAs combining individual U6-gRNA cassettes with a U6-gRNA::tRNA quadruple gRNA expression cassette, with the drawback of displaying many repeated motifs (U6 promoters, multiple units of tRNAglycine, gRNA invariable region). Genetic instability of these constructs, with loss of gRNA expression segments, was prominent in our experiments. This is illustrated by the high prevalence, in our tracked mosquito populations, of a GD derivative allele carrying only two residual U6-gRNA expression units, from the original tandem of six. Luckily, this deletion allele still retains driving potential for both the <italic>Saglin</italic> and <italic>Lp</italic> loci, but it would take only one additional recombination event to reduce the array to a single gRNA. This would result either in a <italic>Saglin</italic>-only, non-lethal, GD allele, which may continue to reduce vectorial capacity of the mosquito population by mutating <italic>Saglin</italic>, or in a non-driving <italic>Saglin</italic> mutant still able to promote some <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> spread by a split GD effect (but particularly able to generate <italic>Lp</italic> R1-type mutants given the intronic target of the single residual gRNA). We are currently working to improve gRNA multiplex design by increasing the number and variety of tRNA spacers, so that the 76 bp constant region of each gRNA would be the only remaining repeated element. To further optimize future GD design, modeling studies can now aid in determining the optimal number of gRNAs in a multiplex, depending on the specific GD design and purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this and to the stabilization of multiplex gRNA arrays, other paths to improvement of the system presented here include avoiding gRNAs targeting intronic sequences, and the use of promoters better restricted to the germline to control Cas9 expression and limit GD refractory mutation emergence. Interestingly, the <italic>zpg</italic> promoter that in theory possesses this advantage showed low activity once inserted in the <italic>Lp</italic> and <italic>Saglin</italic> loci, in contrast to the <italic>DSX</italic> or <italic>Nudel</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that the <italic>zpg</italic> promoter is more sensitive to the local chromatin context than the <italic>vasa2</italic> promoter, similarly to the <italic>sds3</italic> promoter in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2023</xref>), and that its usability in GD constructs may be restricted to a subset of genomic loci. The <italic>nanos</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Terradas et al., 2022</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>) may represent an interesting alternative. Finally, tighter clustering of gRNA target sites at target homing loci, especially <italic>Saglin</italic>, should improve gene drive performance by reducing the length of DNA sequences flanking the cut site that bear no homology to the repair template on the sister chromosome and need to be resected by the repair machinery to allow homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López Del Amo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A simpler design to promote the spread of antimalarial factors such as Sc2A10 in mosquito populations would be a single-locus GD (for example installed in <italic>Saglin</italic> or other pro-parasitic genes if the idea of consolidating the anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> activity via two mechanisms is retained). Few loci, however, can provide the benefits offered here by <italic>Lp</italic> that include a suitable expression pattern, high expression, an endogenous secretion signal, endogenous proteolytic cleavage, a natural intron ideally positioned to host a fluorescent marker, and the status of essential gene that a translational fusion exploits to limit spontaneous transgene loss by mutation. Besides, adding the <italic>Cas9</italic> and gRNA-coding cassettes to an intron of an essential gene chosen as GD host would add &gt;5 kb of foreign DNA sequence, thereby significantly increasing the complexity of the modification and the risk of affecting functionality of the essential gene. For example, inadvertent intron splice sites in synthetic sequences can preclude proper mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoermann et al., 2022</xref>); we also encountered this problem when inserting a different anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> ScFv in <italic>Lp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Green, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the <italic>Sag-GD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> transgene presented here constitutes a viable GD only in the presence of an engineered <italic>Lp</italic> allele, which by itself has no drive capacity but will hitchhike with <italic>Sag-GD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> to spread at hyper-Mendelian rates. In caged mosquito populations, both genetic loci initially spread together and decrease mosquito capacity to transmit <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites expressing CSP from <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Mutations at both loci, especially in <italic>Saglin</italic> that is under low selection pressure, arise due to failed homing events, have a selective advantage over the toxic <italic>SagGD<sup>vasa</sup></italic> allele, and over time should replace the GD, so that the system carries the seeds of its own removal. The anti-<italic>Plasmodium Lp::Sc2A10</italic> allele will likely slowly disappear due to its fitness cost, unless its spread is re-ignited by updated distant-locus GDs. Although such a reversibility could be seen as a safety advantage for modification GDs (and may be enhanced by intentionally releasing laboratory-selected resistance alleles), future work should focus on establishing GD constructs in <italic>Saglin</italic> that limit the emergence of GD refractory alleles to prolong their potential field lives.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>We used Golden Gate Cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engler and Marillonnet, 2014</xref>) to assemble all parts of the <italic>Lp</italic> (AGAP001826) knock-in plasmid shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> in destination vector pENTRR4-ATCC-LacZ-GCTT (Addgene# 173668).

The use of unfed neonate larvae in clean water was crucial for precise gating and sorting. For sorting, flow rate was kept under 20 larvae/second in Pure mode allowing superdrops.

For this, 150 mosquito females were allowed to blood feed on a mouse co-infected with both parental parasite strains at a ratio of 1 strongly fluorescent Δ<italic>p230p</italic>-GFP for 40 <italic>Pb-PfCSP</italic>. Sexual reproduction of <italic>P. berghei</italic> in the mosquito generates hybrid haploid sporozoites, some of which inherit both Δ<italic>p230p</italic>-GFP and <italic>Pb-PfCSP</italic>. Seventen days after their infective blood meal, live female mosquitoes were screened under 488 nm light to select those displaying visible GFP sporozoites trapped at the base of their wing veins. 20 positive females were offered a blood meal on a naïve mouse. When parasitemia reached 0.1%, 3000 strongly GFP positive blood stage parasites were sorted by flow cytometry and injected intravenously into two naïve mice, only one of which developed parasitemia 11 days after passage. Its blood was then passaged into a new mouse. When parasitemia reached 0.4%, 10 new mice were injected with a blood dilution corresponding to 1 parasite each, although this number was probably underestimated as all 10 mice developed parasitemia.

Maintaining the transgene in a heterozygous population ensured the absence of genetic divergence that otherwise may change vector competence between control and transgenic mosquitoes over time. Following COPAS sorting, transgenic and control larvae were co-cultured and adults kept in the same cage to equalize potential environmental influences (including unequal microbial communities) that could differentially affect the vector competence of the two genotypes if grown separately. Mosquitoes were infected together by blood-feeding from the same 12- to 24-week-old CD1 mouse, with a parasitemia between 2 and 4%. Male and female mice were used indiscriminately. Sixteen to 19 days after infection, and 1 day before biting new naive mice, mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized and examined under 488 nm light. <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> females were separated from negative control females based on fluorescence of the transgenesis marker in their eyes. In addition, any mosquito lacking visible GFP parasites (oocysts in the abdomen, sporozoites visible through the cuticle in wing veins or salivary glands) was discarded to ensure that mice were exposed only to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected mosquitoes. On day 17–20, naive mice were individually exposed to groups of 10 <italic>Lp::Sc2A10</italic> or negative control infected mosquitoes. The number of engorged mosquitoes was recorded after infectious feeding, only mice bitten by at least 6 mosquitoes were included in subsequent analyses with the exception of two mice bitten by 5 and 4 highly infected transgenic and control mosquitoes, respectively, as in this experiment the mouse bitten by the 4 control mosquitoes became infected. Mouse parasitemia was monitored by flow cytometry using an Accuri C6 SORP flow cytometer between day 4 and 12 after bite-back. Mice reaching &gt;1.5% parasitemia were sacrificed, and mice remaining negative 12 days post infectious feeding were considered uninfected.

The final drive itself targets and disrupts the saglin gene that is nonessential for mosquitoes, but important for the malaria parasite. The drive uses several gRNAs, and some of these target the Lp gene where an anti-malaria antibody is added, fused to the native gene (this native gene is also essential, removing nonfunctional resistance alleles at this locus). In general, the system is promising, though imperfect. Some of the gRNAs self-eliminate due to recombination of repetitive elements, and the fusion of the antimalaria gene had a modest fitness cost. Additionally, the zpg promoter was unable to operate at high efficiency, requiring use of the vasa promoter, which suffers from maternal deposition and somatic expression (the latter of which increased fitness costs at the Lp target). The manuscript has already undergone some useful revisions since its earliest iteration, so additional recommended revisions are fairly modest.</p><p>Line 43-45: The target doesn't need to be female sterility. It can be almost any haplosufficient but essential target (female sterility works best, so it has gotten the most study, but others have been studied too).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. However, this paragraph focused on previous achievements in malaria mosquitoes, for which suppression gene drives spreading lethality rather than female sterility have not been reported to our knowledge. Even the targeting of <italic>doublesex</italic>, which is a sex determination rather than female fertility gene, results in female sterility (Kyrou et al. 2018). However, we inserted the possibility of female killing by X-shredder GD (Simoni et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 69: A quick motivation for studying Anopheles coluzii should be added here (since gambiae is discussed immediately before this).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this point. We modified the sentence to:</p><p>“Here, we present the engineering of the Lipophorin (Lp) essential gene in Anopheles coluzzii, a prominent member of the A. gambiae species complex and a major malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction section: It might be helpful to break up the introduction into additional paragraphs, rather than just two.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed this suggestion and broke up the introduction into 5 paragraphs to make it more breathable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction last part: The last part of the introduction reads more like an abstract or conclusions section. Perhaps a little less detail would fit better here, so the focus can be on introducing the new drive components and targets</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed this suggestion and substantially shortened this last part of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 207-213: This material could go in the methods section. There are some other examples in the results that could be similarly shortened and rearranged to give a more concise section.</p></disp-quote><p>We moved the long description from lines 207-213 to the Methods as suggested, and summarized it simply as:</p><p>“Only mosquitoes displaying GFP parasites visible through the cuticle were used to infect mice.”</p><p>We emphasize this point because in subsequent experiments using <italic>Saglin</italic> knockout mosquitoes, this enrichment for infected mosquitoes will probably attenuate the Plasmodium-blocking phenotype caused by <italic>Saglin</italic> KO, since mosquitoes lacking <italic>Saglin</italic> tend to be less infected (Klug et al., 2023). Elsewhere in the Results, we still provide detailed descriptions of procedures because we believe they aid understanding and assessing the quality of the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 283-287: I couldn't find the data for this.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed we only summarized the data about the progeny of the [zpg-Cas9; GFP-RFP] line crossed to WT, as we didn’t judge these results worth detailing. Here is our record from one such cross:</p><p>GFP-RFP females x WT males 486 (50.7%) GFP+ and 472 (49.3%) GFP- larvae</p><p>GFP-RFP males x WT females 1836 (48.9%) GFP+ and 1925 (51.1%) GFP- larvae</p><p>This shows no significant gene drive. However in these progenies, a few GFP+ and non-RFP larvae, and a few RFP+ non-GFP larvae were noted by visual examination under the fluorescence microscope, without counting them precisely.

While possible (HDR has been shown for resistance alleles in the zygote/early embryo), this would be quite distinct from the mechanism of every other reliable gene drive that has been reported. Is the flow cytometry result definitely accurate? By this, I mean: could the result be explained by just outliers in the group heterozygous for EGFP, or perhaps some larvae that hatched a little earlier and grew faster? Perhaps larvae get stuck together here on occasion or some other artifact? Was this result confirmed by sequencing individual larvae?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your skepticism, especially given that the same is not seen in Suppl Figure 2A with a similar genotype setup, i.e., the <italic>vasa</italic> gene drive at the <italic>Lp</italic> locus, or in the G1 of populations 6 or 8 at the <italic>Saglin</italic> locus (Suppl. File 2). Unfortunately, it would take too much time at this point to re-create this line (which has been discarded) to re-examine this issue. Therefore, we acknowledge that another explanation than homing in the zygote may account for this result. Based on our empirical experience COPAS outputs are reliable: such outliers from the heterozygous population are usually not seen, and we always sort neonate larvae a few hours from hatching. Those 6% homozygous-looking larvae may come from a contamination with male pupae when female pupae were manually sorted for the cross to WT males, a human error that we cannot exclude. In this case, the true GFP inheritance would be closer to 79% than to 85%. For these reasons, we must back up from our initial statement as follows:</p><p>“The progeny of these triple-transgenic females crossed to WT males showed markedly better homing rates (&gt;79% GFP inheritance).”</p><p>And edit the figure legend of Figure 4B to account for the alternative possibility of a contamination with males:</p><p>“6% of individuals appeared to be homozygous, revealing either unexpected homing in early embryos due to maternal Cas9 deposition, or accidental contamination of the cross with a few transgenic males.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results in general: Why is there no data for crosses with male drive heterozygotes? Even if some targets are X-linked, performance at others is important (or did I miss something and they are all X-linked). I see some description near line 400, but this sort of data is figure-worthy (or at least a table).</p></disp-quote><p>For the only example of functioning split gene drive at the Lipophorin locus on chromosome III, we do show homing results from heterozygous GD males in Suppl. Figure 2A (91.2% homing in males inferred from ((40.7+53.1+1.8)-50)χ2). We added this calculation of the homing rates in the figure legend. For full drive constructs in the <italic>Saglin</italic> locus on chromosome X (our final functional design), in addition to the data described in the text near line 400, male data showing “teleguided” homing at the <italic>Lipophorin</italic> locus on chromosome II is shown in Suppl.

In this population, the genotype frequencies were not tracked at each generation but measured once after 7 generations. We rephrased (now lines 401-403) and now provide the measured values directly in the text:</p><p>“We maintained one mosquito population of Lp::Sc2A10 combined with SagGD<sup>zpg</sup> (initial allele frequencies: 25% and 33%, respectively) and measured genotype frequencies after 7 generations.

Should DsRed inheritance be 90.7%?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this. You are right, DsRed inheritance would be 90.7% if the homing rate were 81.4% as we mistakenly wrote. Actually DsRed inheritance was really 80.7% so our mistake was in calculating the homing rate: 61.4% is the correct value ((80.7-50)χ2), now corrected in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: The horizontal axis font size for population 8 is a little smaller than the others.</p></disp-quote><p>True. Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 454: In addition to drive conversion only occurring in females and the somatic fitness costs, embryo resistance from the vasa promoter would prevent the daughters of drive females from doing drive conversion. This means that drive conversion would mostly just happen with alleles that alternate between males and females.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this idea, although the impact of this phenomenon will depend on the extent of resistance allele formation in early embryos. We observed (Figure 6) that failed homing mutagenesis in Saglin is not that intense, the sequenced non-drive alleles that were exposed 1-4 times to mutagenic activity in females either being mostly wild-type, or carrying mutations that often still left one or two gRNA target sites intact and vulnerable to another round of Cas9 activity. Therefore, alleles passed on from female to female may still undergo drive conversion to a large extent, that future experiments may be able to quantify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 481: Deletions between gRNAs certainly happen, but I wouldn't necessarily expect this to be the &quot;expectation&quot;. In our 2018 PNAS paper, it happened in 1/3 of cases. There were less I think in our Sciences Advances 2020 and G3 2022 paper. All of these were from embryo resistance from maternal Cas9 (likely also the case with your drive due to the vasa promoter). When looking at &quot;germline&quot; resistance alleles, we have recently noticed more large deletions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the early embryo with maternally deposited Cas9 is probably the most prominent source of mutations at gRNA target sites. Perhaps naïvely we imagined that it would be easier for cells to repair two closely spaced DNA breaks by eliminating the intervening sequence, rather than stitching each break individually. Given that we sequenced many alleles carrying a single mutation, the lack of larger deletions may be explained by lower rates of Cas9 activity in <italic>Saglin</italic>, with mostly a single break at a time, due to limiting Cas9 amounts and their partial saturation with <italic>Lp</italic> gRNAs, and/or lesser accessibility of the <italic>Saglin</italic> locus compared to <italic>Lipophorin</italic>… We deleted the phrase “<italic>Contrarily to our expectation</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6C: It may be nice to show the wild-type and functional resistance sequence side-by-side.</p></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 642-644: This isn't necessarily the case. At saglin, the nonfunctional resistance alleles may still be able to outcompete the drive allele in the long run.

We inserted this comment in a parenthesis in the text (now lines 644-645):</p><p>“Unlike the first approach, this design may allow Cas9 and gRNA-coding genes to persist indefinitely within the invaded mosquito population (unless nonfunctional resistance alleles outcompete the drive allele in the long run).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A few comments on references to some of my studies:</p><p>Champer, Liu, et al. 2018a and 2018b citations are the same paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Duplicate in our reference library.

Additionally, it models and discusses the strategy of targeting vector genes that are essential for disease spread but not the vectors themselves (the &quot;gene disruption drive&quot;), showing that this can be a favorable strategy if gene knockout has the desired effect (nonfunctional resistance alleles contribute to drive success).</p></disp-quote><p>Your 2020 study will indeed now be useful to inform the design of multiplex gRNAs for various gene drives designs, in terms of number of gRNAs, distribution of their target sites, necessity to generate loss-of-function rather than functional resistance allele in the target gene (such as our <italic>Lp</italic> and <italic>Saglin</italic> pro-parasitic genes). The notion of Cas9 saturation with increasing gRNA numbers is also important. When we initiated this project in 2018, we only had intuitive notions that multiplex gRNAs could improve the durability of GD and increase the chances of resistance alleles to be loss-of-function. We thus arbitrarily maximized the number of gRNAs for each of the two targets: 3 for each target in one design, 3 and 4 in another, which, according to your modelling, is luckily close to the optimal numbers for each locus. We now cite your paper as a GD design tool in the discussion about pathways to optimizing our system:</p><p>“To further optimize GD design, modeling studies can now aid in determining the optimal number of gRNAs in a multiplex, depending on the specific GD design and purpose (Champer et al., 2020).</p><p>In addition to this and to the stabilization of multiplex gRNA arrays, other paths to improvement (…)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This one is less relevant, but is still a &quot;standard&quot; homing modification rescue type drive that could be mentioned (and owes its success to multiplexing): https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2004373117</p><p>The recoded rescue method was also used in mosquitoes (albeit without gRNA multiplexing) by others, so this may be a better one to mention: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19426-0</p></disp-quote><p>We added the two references on what is now Line 663:</p><p>“Lp::Sc2A10 depends on SagGD for its long-term persistence and spread in a population, and SagGD depends on Lp::Sc2A10 as a rescue allele of the essential Lp target for its survival.

One thing that I forgot to mention: for the 7-gRNA construct with tRNAs, the authors mentioned that it was harder to track, but it sounds like they obtained some data for it that showed similar performance.

Aside from being the first report for gene drive in A. coluzii, it also is the first that investigates the gene disruption strategy and is the first report of gRNA multiplexing in Anopheles. The study can thus be considered high impact. There are also other aspects of the study that are of high interest to gene drive researchers in particular (several drives were tested with some variations).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for your positive, constructive and in-depth analysis of our study!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The authors initially created a transgenic mosquito colony expressing the Sc2A10 antibody fused to the lipid transporter Lipophorin, and tested the transmission-blocking activity of this transgene. Building off of previous findings that the Sc2A10 antibody inhibits sporozoite infectivity when expressed in mosquito salivary glands, the authors showed that found it was also efficient at inhibiting sporozoite infectivity when secreted into the hemolymph expressed under the lipophorin endogenous promoter in An. coluzzii. They then designed and tested two different gene drives utilizing the Sc2A10-Lipophorin fusion protein. In the first, the authors used a recoded allele of Lp-Sc2A10 while simultaneously utilizing gRNAs that targeted endogenous Lp in an effort to select for mosquitoes that expressed transgenic Lp-Sc2A10 due to the essential nature of Lp. However, this drive was unsuccessful because recoded Lp is necessarily heterozygous while the GD is entering the population, and Lp proved to be largely haploinsufficient. Further, the zpg promoter expressing cas9 was not effective in promoting homing of the gRNAs. In the second gene drive that was tested, authors made use of the endogenous Saglin locus, which expresses a natural agonist for Plasmodium, and is thus desirable to target for disruption in a gene drive that aims to reduce vector competence for Plasmodium. This gene drive also uses recoded Lp-Sc2A10 to replace the wild-type Lp allele, thus selecting for Sc2A10 expression, however this drive is not dependent on fitness of individuals with only one functional copy of Lp.</p><p>The authors discovered that the efficacy of the zpg promoter to drive homing of cas9 is locus-dependent, limiting the success of their gene drive designs. They do show, however, that the Saglin gene drive succeeds at reaching high frequencies in mosquito populations using instead the vasa promoter to express cas9, and that these transgenic mosquitoes are able to reduce infectivity of sporozoites in a bite-back mouse model. However, they observe gene drive refractory mutations in the Lp gene, despite its highly conserved nature, showcasing the difficulty of avoiding drive resistance even in small populations of mosquitoes, and also observed deletions of gRNAs targeting both Lp and Saglin, further highlighting possible shortcomings in gene drive approaches. Together, these findings are useful to the field in walking the readers through an interesting and promising approach for a novel gene drive, and illustrating the challenges in engineering an efficacious and long-lasting drive.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>As the authors are able to observe Plasmodium within mosquitoes, it would be useful to have these data in the manuscript pertaining to the prevalence and intensity of infection in mosquitoes prior to bite-back assays. If there are data or images that the authors could include, it would be helpful to show if there is a possibility that infection intensity is a variable that contributes to whether or not mice develop an infection. It would also be interesting to note whether there is a different in infection (oocysts or sporozoites) between transgenic mosquitoes and wild type mosquitoes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable suggestion. Please note that, in order to evaluate the transmission-blocking properties of the <italic>Lp-2A10</italic> allele (acting at the sporozoite level), we discarded non-infected mosquitoes prior to bite-back experiments, so that infection prevalence was 100% in the mosquitoes retained for the bite-back. We have not systematically compared parasite loads between transgenic and control mosquitoes. In some experiments comparing Lp-2A10 mosquitoes and their control, we dissected a subset of the mosquito midguts after bite-back to visually ascertain that they showed roughly equivalent oocyst numbers between transgenic and controls. However, we have not precisely recorded these data. It is possible that slightly decreased lipid availability in <italic>Lp::2A10</italic> mosquitoes (their <italic>lipophorin</italic> allele producing slightly less Lp than the WT) negatively affects the parasite, as suggested by previous studies highlighting the role of host lipophorin-derived lipids for parasite development in the mosquito (Costa et al., <italic>Nat Commun</italic> 2018; Werling et al. Cell 2019; Kelsey et al. PLoS Path 2023).</p><p>In the case of Lp-2A10 mosquitoes additionally containing a GD in <italic>Saglin</italic>, it is expected that they should carry lower parasite numbers than their controls, an effect of the <italic>Saglin</italic> knockout mutation alone (Klug et al., PLoS Path 2023). Re-inforcing the transmission blocking effect of the 2A10 antibody by reducing parasite loads via the <italic>Saglin</italic> KO was indeed our intention. Hence, having selected the most infected mosquitoes for our bite-back experiments likely attenuated this desired effect, but we still observed a 90% transmission decrease when the two modifications were combined, compared to a 70% decrease with Lp-2A10 alone. We do not plan to perform additional infections experiments for the current manuscript on <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> expressing Pf-CSP, but we do intend to record parasite counts in a follow-up study with an optimized <italic>SagGD</italic> transgene and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections. This will be of high relevance for potential future applications in malaria control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also go into significant detail in the discussion exploring ideas of how to optimize or improve this specific gene drive design.

First, we knew from the cited Isaacs et al. papers that the 2A10 antibody was efficient against transmission when expressed in the fat body, and from unpublished work (Maria Pissarev, Elena Levashina and Eric Marois) that anti-CSP ScFvs expressed in the fat body of transgenic mosquitoes blocked sporozoite transmission as efficiently as when expressed from salivary glands. This is certainly favored by the easy sporozoite accessibility to the antibody when both are in mosquito hemolymph. Of note, the transmission blocking results suggest that the binding of ScFv to CSP withstands the crossing of the salivary gland epithelium by sporozoites. Second, we were looking for a host gene expressed as high as possible to produce high levels of Sc2A10 antibody. Third, the host gene must be essential so that resistance alleles would not be viable.</p><p>We agree that it would also be possible to use a salivary gene instead of <italic>Lp</italic> as a host for this antimalarial factor. In this case, a same-locus gene drive may have functioned, but the advantages of the host locus being an essential gene would be lost, at least partially, as genetic ablation of the salivary gland, albeit slowing blood uptake, does not prevent mosquito viability and reproduction (Yamamoto et al., PLoS Path 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 140 – Can authors give any comment on why these regions of Lp were chosen to be recoded / targeted with gRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>inserting Sc2A10 just after the cleaved Lp secretion signal, and N-terminally to the rest of the Lp protein, was the goal, so that 2A10 would be secreted together with Lp and separated from both signal peptide and Lp by naturally occurring proteolysis. This constrained the choice of the target site to be at the junction between signal peptide and the remainder of Lp protein. An alternative design could have been to insert it between the two subunits ApoLpI and ApoLpII, with duplication of the protease cleavage site, or on the C-terminal extremity of the protein, but there would have been no intron in the immediate vicinity to knock-in a selection marker at the same time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 171 – &quot;stoichiometric&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 186 – Can the authors comment or speculate on why the expression levels of the fusion protein are expected to be lower than endogenous Lp?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not expect this.

Possible explanations include: the existence of harder-to-translate mRNA sequences in the Sc2A10 moiety; the addition of seven exogenous amino acids on the N-terminal side of ApoLpII (mentioned in M&amp;M) possibly modifying the stability of the Lp protein; the modification of the intron sequence perturbing efficient intron excision and/or pre-mRNA expression due to the disruption of regulatory elements or to the new presence of the GFP gene in the antisense orientation (albeit expressed in the nervous system and not in the fat body); the presence of the exogenous <italic>Tub56D</italic> transcription terminator used to arrest <italic>GFP</italic> transcription possibly possessing bidirectional termination activity and lowering the mRNA level of the <italic>Lp</italic> allele…</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 211 – Why were 6 mosquitoes used for these assays, and 10 mosquitoes used in later assays (Line 223)?</p></disp-quote><p>Mice were always exposed to groups of 10 mosquitoes, but not all 10 mosquitoes were necessarily biting the mice.

Since this situation still leaves truncated chromosomes, another repair event can join the plasmid-bearing chromosome end to the sister chromosome. The observation that complex rearrangement occurred frequently suggests that such events can be very common, but will usually go undetected due to the absence of genetic markers.

The resulting promoter fragment harbored several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to published sequences, as typically observed when cloning genomic fragments due to high genetic diversity in Anopheles species. Such SNPs are not usually expected to affect promoter activity, but are difficult to distinguish from PCR mutations which, in turn, could decrease or abolish promoter activity if mutating an essential transcription factor binding site. For this reason, our next constructs were based on the validated zpg sequences from Kyrou et al. The first cloning strategy was described in the Results section but was missing in the material and method section. This is now corrected (lines 773-779).Figure 3: Please, correct to A, B, C order.

I can see they are targeting two different locations (Saglin and Lp). It is unclear though from the figure where the Sc2A10-GFP is coming from. I understand this represents the mosquito genome as you injected heterozygous animals already containing the Sc2A10-GFP. Maybe label the Sc2A10-GFP as mosquito genome or similar? A schematic showing mosquito embryos already carrying this and then the plasmid being injected could help.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 does not represent the injection of new transgenic constructs. Instead, it shows the conversion process of chromosomes X and II in a germ cell carrying both transgenes in the heterozygous state, to illustrate how the dual gene drive can spread in a population after WT mosquitoes mated with transgenics carrying both the SagGD and Lp-2A10 alleles. We have re-worked the graphic design of this figure and modified its title to make this more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 330-331: Do you know the transgenesis efficiency?

Therefore, we cannot precisely calculate the transgenesis efficiency. However, &gt;60 positive G1s from a pool of 36 G0 males crossed to WT females is indicative of a rather high integration efficiency.

A large fraction of sequenced reads corresponded to PCR artefacts such as primer dimers and unspecific short amplicons, potentially affecting the relative frequencies of gene-specific amplicons. However, among the sequenced gene-specific amplicons, WT alleles were the majority (lines 474-475).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5. Could the authors discuss why the observed DsRed-gene drive drop in population 1 at ~18 generation? The population gets to the point where only 50% of the population carries the Cas9-DsRed cassette. Considering that the Saglin gene drive only converts through females (inserted into the X chr.), and some indels could be generated by generation 20, how do you explain the great recovery until fully spreading into the population?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is somewhat puzzling. We don’t have a satisfactory explanation beyond stochastic effects, possibly promoted by population bottlenecks: although we strived to maintain these populations at a high number of individuals at each generation, we cannot exclude that at a given generation only a relatively small fraction of individuals contributed to the next generation, leading to fluctuations in allelic frequencies. This would be possible particularly for populations 1 and 2, which were not monitored frequently between generations 10 and 18, at which point additional populations 5-8 were established and it was decided that close monitoring of all populations was important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems to me populations 3-8 are new cage experiments by randomly picking mosquitoes from populations 1 and 2 (at a specific generation) and mixing them with WT individuals. Could the authors explain the reasoning for these experiments? I believe populations 3-8 deserves a different figure (main or supplementary) describing how they were seeded. It is confusing having everything together as these experiments were performed differently way and for a different reason compared to populations 1 and 2. Some cage schematics and drawings would help in understanding the protocol strategy for populations 3-8.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct for populations 3 and 4 that indeed originated from randomly picking mosquitoes from populations 1 and 2 at generation 10 and mixing them with WT individuals. Populations 5, 6, 7 and 8 are crosses between generation 16 transgenic partners of one sex to WT of the other sex, as indicated above the COPAS diagrams provided in Suppl. File 2. We apologize for having insufficiently described how each population was assembled and now provide more details (lines 422-429, in the figure 5 legend, and G0 crosses spelled out on top of each population diagram). In setting up these populations, we wanted to test the effects of various routes by which the transgenes may be introduced into a wild mosquito population: release of unsorted transgenic males + females, or release of one sex only (probably males in the field, but the crosses with transgenic females as with transgenic males also served to re-quantify homing in the second generation of each cross).</p><p>The modified text reads as follows:</p><p>“Populations 3 and 4 were established by mixing randomly selected transgenic mosquitoes (both males and females of generation 10) from populations 1 and 2, respectively, with wild-types, to mimic what may occur in a mixed-sex field release. Populations 5-8 were established by crossing single-sex transgenic mosquitoes to WT of the opposite sex, both to mimic a single-sex field release and to re-assess homing efficiency after 16 generations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, could you add homozygous and heterozygous labels in the figure legend to help understanding the different lines.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated on the side of the figure and in the figure legend, lines don’t represent homozygous vs. heterozygous frequency, but allele frequency (continuous lines), and frequency of mosquitoes carrying the transgene (dotted lines). In the figure legend we now provided the calculation formulas for gene frequency: [ 2 x (number of homozygotes) + (number of heterozygotes)] / 2 x (total number of larvae) for the autosomal <italic>Lp::2A10</italic> transgene, and [ 2 x (number of homozygotes) + (number of heterozygotes) ] / 1.5 x (total number of larvae) for the X-linked <italic>SagGD</italic> transgene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: The authors sequenced non-DsRed individuals from generations 3-4. The authors also mentioned they sequenced mosquitoes from generation 32 (Figure 7). Interestingly, they observed that these mosquitoes were missing a piece of the cassette (they contained 2 gRNAs instead of 7). Since the amplicons only cover the gRNA portion, a PCR covering the Zpg-Cas9 portion would be ideal to confirm that only the gRNAs are missing. Sampling DsRed+ mosquitoes from generations 3, 18 and 31 (populations 1 and 2) and carrying out these experiments is recommended. Although unlikely, I would be worried about the Cas9 being deleted due to unexpected DNA rearrangements; in that case, the cassette would contain the DsRed marker alone.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We no longer have DNA samples from the earlier generations. Thus, we genotyped 7 DsRed positive male mosquitoes from each of current populations 1, 2 and 7 (generation 41 since transgenesis) for the presence of Cas9. We detected a Cas9-specific amplicon of 1.6 kb in 21/21 sampled DsRed positive mosquitoes, in parallel to the same shortened gRNA arrays detected in earlier generations. This suggests that the Cas9 part of the transgene was not affected by the loss of gRNA units. We made a panel C in Figure 7 showing these results and mentioned them on lines 537-538. Of note, the <italic>Cas9</italic> moiety of the gene drive construct shows no repetitive sequence and should therefore not be as unstable as the gRNA multiplex array. The observed excisions of gRNA expression units were strictly due to recombinations between repeated U6 promoter sequences (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors employ 3 different gRNAs that are 43 and 310 nts apart. It has been shown that only 20 nt lack of homology produces an important reduction on gene drive performance (Lopez del Amo et al. 2020, Nat Comms). Also, it has been shown that gRNA multiplexing approaches should be kept with a low number of gRNAs, 2 being maybe the best one depending on the design (Samuel Champer 2020, Sciences Advances). This could be discussed more.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. These results were not published when this study was initiated, so that our gene drive constructs could only be designed on empirical bases. For gRNA numbers, see the new discussion point and inclusion of a reference to the study by S. Champer <italic>et al.</italic>, on line 700-702. The reduction of drive performance with longer non-homologous stretches is indeed also a very important point, that we now discuss on lines 713-717, citing your study:</p><p>“Finally, tighter clustering of gRNA target sites at target homing loci, especially Saglin, should improve gene drive performance by reducing the length of DNA sequences flanking the cut site that bear no homology to the repair template on the sister chromosome and need to be resected by the repair machinery to allow homing (López Del Amo et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>There are different novelty aspects from my point of view in this work.

While previous gene-drive works employ only one gRNA in mosquitoes, this works explores the use of different gRNAs targeting nearby locations to potentially improve HDR rates and gene drive spread. Although they observe gene drive activity, they also show DNA rearrangements due to the intrinsic nature of multiplexing gene drives that can generate multiple DNA double-strand breaks, impeding proper HDR and clean replacement of the wildtype alleles. This is important from a technical point of view as it shows this approach requires optimization. They included 3 gRNAs targeting the Saglin gene, and trying 2gRNAs instead could be interesting for future investigations.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discussed optimization with the help of modeling, in response to Reviewer 1, on lines 701-702.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work will be very useful for the CRISPR-based gene drive field, which seeks to develop genome editing tools to control mosquito populations and reduce the impact of vector-borne diseases such as malaria.</p><p>This reviewer intended to understand the work and provide constructive feedback to the best of my abilities.
