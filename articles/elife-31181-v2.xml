traditional chemotherapy; with long-term survival as low as 50–60% for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-type medulloblastoma. We have shown that the transcription factor Atonal homologue 1 (Atoh1) is required for Shh-type medulloblastoma development in mice. To determine whether reducing either Atoh1 levels or activity in tumors after their development is beneficial, we studied Atoh1 dosage and modifications in Shh-type medulloblastoma. Heterozygosity of Atoh1 reduced tumor occurrence and prolonged survival. We discovered tyrosine 78 of Atoh1 is phosphorylated by a Jak2-mediated pathway only in tumor-initiating cells and in human SHH-type medulloblastoma. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 78 stabilizes Atoh1, increases Atoh1’s transcriptional activity, and is independent of canonical Jak2 signaling. Importantly, inhibition of Jak2 impairs tyrosine 78 phosphorylation and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, inhibiting Jak2-mediated tyrosine 78 phosphorylation could provide a viable therapy for medulloblastoma.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31181.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Medulloblastoma is the most common solid brain tumor that develops in children, with more than five hundred new cases diagnosed in the United States every year. There are four broad types of medulloblastoma. One of these is called the “Sonic Hedgehog” subtype, named after the biological pathway that becomes re-activated in these tumors. Only about half of patients with this subtype survive for more than 10 years. Moreover, medulloblastoma treatment combines surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, which can cause severe side effects including psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.</p><p>Several drugs that treat medulloblastoma by targeting the Sonic Hedgehog pathway are currently being tested in clinical trials. However, these drugs are usually only effective for a limited time before the tumor evades the treatment. Therefore, there is a need to develop new treatment options for medulloblastoma, perhaps by targeting different signaling pathways in the cells.</p><p>A protein called Atoh1 is needed for proper brain development in humans, but is not normally present after the first year of life. This protein is, however, re-expressed at high levels in medulloblastoma in mice and humans and is essential for Sonic Hedgehog-type medulloblastoma to form in mice.</p><p>Klisch et al. used genetic techniques to reduce the amount of Atoh1 in mice that develop medulloblastoma. This intervention reduced the number of mice that developled tumors and increased their lifespan. Biochemical experiments showed that the tumor stem cells of the mice contain a modified version of Atoh1 where a phosphate molecule is bound to a particular region of the protein. This phosphorylation increased the amount and activity of Atoh1 in the cell, and so caused tumors to grow more quickly in mice. Phosphorylated Atoh1 was also detected in samples taken from human medulloblastoma tumors.</p><p>Klisch et al. also found that an enzyme called Jak2 phosphorylates Atoh1. Inhibiting Jak2 reduced the levels of Atoh1 in medulloblastoma cells and slowed tumor growth in mice. Future work could investigate different ways of preventing Atoh1 phosphorylation, with the hope of finding new treatments for Sonic-Hedgehog-type medulloblastomas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Math1</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP110390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klisch</surname><given-names>Tiemo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005653</institution-id><institution>Congress of Neurological Surgeons</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Christopher Getch Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Akash J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mary Alice Smith Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aberrant phosphorylation of tyrosine 78 on Atoh1 via Jak2 is responsible for sonic hedgehog type medulloblastoma growths in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dhall, 2009</xref>) and is thought to originate from rhombic lip-derived precursors that have failed to differentiate into their usual progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hatten and Roussel, 2011</xref>). Molecular studies have allowed us to classify MB into four major subtypes: WNT, sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group C, and Group D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). The cell of origin differs among the subgroups, as does the clinical prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). SHH-type tumors arise from precursors of the cerebellar granule neurons and can contain mutations in Smoothened, Patched, or other genes in this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rimkus et al., 2016</xref>). Elevated expression of Atoh1, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is crucial for the development of the cerebellar granule neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Arie et al., 1996</xref>), can also drive uncontrolled cell proliferation and formation of medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Flora et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to attempting to inhibit SHH signaling—a strategy that can be foiled by the development of secondary mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yauch et al., 2009</xref>)—we hypothesized that controlling the levels of Atoh1 protein will provide another therapeutic entry point for the treatment SHH-driven medulloblastoma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To determine the influence of Atoh1 gene dosage on MB development and prognosis, we examined the rate of tumor formation in a mouse model of Shh-dependent MB, the Nd2::SmoA1<sup>Tg</sup> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hatton et al., 2008</xref>). These mice have a constitutively active Shh pathway in all cerebellar granule cells and spontaneously develop MBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hatton et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas almost a quarter (23.1%) of Nd2::SmoA1<sup>Tg</sup> mice developed MB and succumbed to the disease within 300 days of life, fewer than one in ten (6.7%) Nd2::SmoA1<sup>Tg</sup> mice – heterozygous for <italic>Atoh1</italic> (Atoh1<sup>+/-</sup>, Nd2::SmoA1<sup>Tg</sup>) – developed signs of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> for all statistical analysis). <italic>Atoh1</italic> heterozygosity dropped the overall tumor incidence by over three-fold and never reached that of Nd2::SmoA1<sup>Tg</sup><italic>, Atoh1</italic> wildtype mice. Importantly, while both groups expressed the tumorigenic transgene (Nd2::SmoA1) at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), levels of Gli2, the primary Shh mediator in medulloblastoma and direct target of Atoh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Read et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klisch et al., 2011)</xref> were reduced in the Atoh1 heterozygous mice. Hence, a 50% reduction in Atoh1 protein level has a direct, positive, effect on survival in this medulloblastoma mouse model. This suggests that Atoh1 protein dosage is critical for the development of medulloblastoma in mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31181.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tyrosine 78 of Atoh1 protein is phosphorylated in MB-initiating cells in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Kaplan-Meier survival curve shows that Atoh1 heterozygosity markedly reduces MB tumor incidence in mice (Log Rank (Mantel-Cox)).

While this regulation is transcriptional in nature, another layer of regulation has been reported to influence Atoh1 protein levels: phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Forget et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, we asked whether Atoh1 was aberrantly phosphorylated in the tumors. Using tumors isolated from Nd2::SmoA1<sup>Tg</sup> mice, we performed IP-MS on tumor-initiating cells that express Atoh1 [marked by cell surface protein CD15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Read et al., 2009</xref>)] and CD15-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We tested the integrity of both cell populations by flank injections of sorted cells in immunosuppressed mice and found that <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression in the tumor-initiating cells is required to drive secondary tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Using Atoh1 IP-MS, we discovered that tyrosine 78 (Y78, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>) on Atoh1 is phosphorylated exclusively in tumor-initiating cells. We confirmed phosphorylation of this Atoh1 residue in MB tissue using a phospho-specific antibody (p-Atoh1-Y78, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We further confirmed these findings in tumorigenic and control tissues from mice and found that Atoh1 Y78 phosphorylation is specific to the tumor-initiating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Y78 immuno-reactivity was observed mostly in the initiating cell islets of the tumor; neither the Y78-specific phospho-antibody, nor an antibody against CD15, reacted in the normal tissue, even in the presence of strong Atoh1 expression in the external granule layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>Because Atoh1 is not endogenously expressed in neuronal cell lines, and reliable primary cultures of human SHH-type medulloblastoma cells are not established, we turned to modify and study medulloblastoma cell lines that have been used in the past. We engineered cell lines expressing either doxycycline-inducible wildtype (Y78), phospho-dead (Y78F) or phospho-mimetic (Y78D) Atoh1, using three different human-derived MB parental cell lines: DAOY (marked in blue), UW228 (orange) and ONS-76 (purple) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zanini et al., 2013</xref>). While these cell lines have been used extensively, it has been recently suggested that at least the DAOY cell line is more ‘Shh-like’ than the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Higdon et al., 2017</xref>). We found that Y78 phosphorylation status did not alter the interaction of Atoh1 with its E-protein binding partner or its nuclear-cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). However, upon doxycycline withdrawal, Y78 phosphorylation dramatically increased Atoh1 protein stability in all three parental lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>).

While these flank xenograft models lack the fully functional immune system, they provide a useful model for longitudinal tumor growth monitoring with minimal burden to the animal. The mice were fed doxycycline chow continuously to express the transgenes. Expression of wildtype or phospho-dead Atoh1 (Y78F) led to a similar average tumor weight, but overexpression of phospho-mimetic Atoh1 (Y78D) increased tumor weight by roughly 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These data suggest that tyrosine 78 phosphorylation increases Atoh1 transcriptional activity, which in turn increases cellular proliferation in vitro as well as in vivo.</p><p>To identify the tyrosine kinase responsible for the aberrant phosphorylation of Atoh1 in the malignant cells, we revisited our IP-MS data. We recovered 637 Atoh1-interacting proteins from CD15-positive cells and 278 interactors from CD15-negative cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). As would be expected, E-proteins were the strongest interactors present in all pull down assays, but interestingly only one tyrosine kinase, Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), was present exclusively in tumor-initiating cells. The Jak2 paralog Jak1 was present in the non-initiating cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). The Janus kinases typically function in the cytoplasm, downstream of cytokine signaling, and activate canonical cascades such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and/or the phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levine et al., 2007</xref>). Although one of the most common gain-of-function mutations in Jak2 (Jak2<sup>V617F</sup>) is associated with increased proliferation in human myeloproliferative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levine et al., 2007</xref>), Jak2 function in medulloblastoma has not been investigated.</p><p>We tested Jak1-3 and Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Tyk2), as well as Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Ptk2) in a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC) for an Atoh1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Neet and Hunter, 1996</xref>). Only Jak2 displayed a strong interaction with Atoh1 as indicated by the shift in GFP signal detected by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We further investigated whether these kinases were able to phosphorylate Y78 using a luciferase-based kinase assay. Once again, only Jak2 was able to phosphorylate wildtype Atoh1 (Y78) in a dose dependent manner in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This phosphorylation was specific to Y78, as the addition of phospho-mutant Atoh1 (Y78F) abolished this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Given that both Atoh1 and Jak2 are expressed during cerebellar development and both are highly overexpressed in MB tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>), we tested whether the Jak2-Atoh1 interaction occurs in vivo. We immunoprecipitated Atoh1 or Jak2 and found a strong interaction in malignant but not normal cerebellar tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To determine whether Jak2 is a critical kinase phosphorylating tyrosine 78, we isolated Shh-type MB cells and cultured them in the presence or absence of a strong and highly specific Jak2 inhibitor (AG490) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). One-hour treatment with the inhibitor was sufficient to drastically reduce Jak2 and Atoh1 Y78 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These findings demonstrate that Jak2 is activated in Shh-type MB, where it interacts with Atoh1 and phosphorylates it on tyrosine 78.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31181.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Jak2 phosphorylates Atoh1 Y78.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) IP of Jak2 or Atoh1 in tumor and P5 cerebellar tissue shows that Atoh1 and Jak2 interact in tumor tissue.

Moreover, most of the genes regulated by Jak2 do not contain the predicted STAT DNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghoreschi et al., 2009</xref>) suggesting the existence of unidentified transcriptional mediators. Overexpression of Jak2 pheno-copied the transcriptional gain-of-function phenotype of Atoh1 Y78D, increased the stability of wildtype Atoh1 (Y78) to Y78D levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and increased cellular proliferation in vitro, which was blocked by phospho-mutant Atoh1 (Y78F) and the addition of AG490 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Having identified Jak2 as a critical kinase phosphorylating tyrosine 78, we asked if inhibition of Jak2 might be a viable strategy to decrease Atoh1 levels in vivo. We isolated Shh-type medulloblastoma cells, infected them with lentiviral particles harboring Jak2 shRNAs tagged with RFP, and grafted these into mice. Control shRNA-infected tumors grew rapidly, but both Jak2 shRNA-infected tumors showed dramatically reduced tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), in accordance with their potency to inhibit Jak2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The decrease in Jak2 resulted in a concomitant decrease in Y78 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Moreover, Jak1, a close relative of Jak2, did not compensate for the inhibition of Jak2 as it was expressed at similar levels in control and Jak2 inhibited tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Sections from control shRNA-infected tumors revealed large areas of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> left panel, red) that expressed Atoh1 and had pockets of tumor-initiating cells (CD15-positive, yellow) that co-localized with phosphorylated Y78 (blue).

Our results suggest that targeting Atoh1 by inhibiting its phosphorylation on tyrosine 78 presents a viable avenue for targeting MB cells without impinging on healthy brain tissue.

Cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 137.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton-X-100, supplemented with fresh protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors), homogenized using 1 ml insulin syringes. GFP-trap beads (20 µl per IP, ChromoTek, Germany) were added to cleared supernatant and immunoprecipitation reactions were performed overnight at 4°C with gentle head-to-tail rotation. After three washes, immune-complexes were eluted with glycine, vacuum dried and dissolved in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH = 10 for MS. MS was performed by Proteomics and Metabolomics Core Labs at BCM using standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jung et al., 2017</xref>).

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Pomeroy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The report describes the role of the transcription factor Atoh1 (crucial for the normal development of cerebellar granule neurons) in the sonic hedgehog (shh)-driven subtype of medulloblastoma (MB). Using a genetic cross in mice, they initially demonstrated that heterozygous disruption of Atoh1 reduces the tumor burden resulting from shh-driven MB. They then determined that tumor-initiating cells within MB tumors demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation on Y78 of Atoh1. They also showed that this phosphorylation is mediated by the JAK2 kinase and leads to stabilization of Atoh1 protein and increased transcriptional activity in a reporter assay. As expected, based on these observations, JAK2-specific shRNAs and a pharmacologic JAK inhibitor were found to reduce the tumorigenicity of grafted MB cells in mice. Demonstration that Y78 Atoh1 could be found in human MB tumors further supports the potential clinical relevance of the findings. Overall, this is a well-executed and well-documented study that implicates phosphorylation of Atoh1 on Y78 in the shh-driven subtype of medulloblastoma. As described below, the conclusion that JAK2 is the specific mediator of this phosphorylation event is less definitive.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) A limitation of the analysis is the lack of Jak2 deletion studies to show whether Jak2 is truly required for medulloblastoma growth. AG490, the inhibitor used to test the role of Jak2 is not highly specific. Additional targets affected by AG490 include EGFR, guanylyl and adenyl cyclases, and Hif1alpha (PMID 22709000, 15209521, 1676428). This lack of specificity complicates the conclusion that Jak2 plays a critical role in medulloblastoma progression. Ideally, the authors could breed a medulloblastoma-causing mutation into a Jak2 conditional background. Conditionally deleting Jak2 in the medulloblastoma cells of origin would test whether other kinases can assume the function of Jak2 when Jak2 is not present. For example, even if Jak1 does not phosphorylate Atoh1 in the presence of Jak2, Jak1 may nevertheless be able the phosphorylate Atoh1 if Jak2 is deleted. The best way to detect this type of complementation is to knock out Jak2 in medulloblastoma-prone mice and then see tumors grow and if Atoh1 gets phosphorylated. Without such genetic data, a firm conclusion should not be drawn that Jak2 is a critical node in medulloblastoma growth. However, if analyzing Jak2 conditional knock out mice is not feasible, the authors should consider focusing instead on the finding that Atoh1 phosphorylation seems to be very important for ATOH1 protein stability, and for medulloblastoma growth. The focus could then be on targeting Atoh1 phosphorylation, which the data strongly suggest would be an effective approach to treatment. Since AG490 decreases phosphorylation of Atoh1, a study testing for decreased tumor growth and increased survival in ND2:SmoA1 mice treated with AG490 could potentially identify a new direction for therapy, even if Jak2 is not necessarily the only target disrupted by the inhibitor.</p><p>2) The characterization of the consequences of phosphorylation on Atoh1 activity is a little confusing. The authors claim that the effect of phosphorylation is to stabilize the protein; however, they go on to show in transfected cells using the various phospho-inactive, phospho-mimicking mutants that even though they are expressed at similar levels, the phosphorylation drives increased transcriptional activity in the reporter assay. So, the reader is left to wonder whether phosphorylation is specifically affecting protein levels to drive increased expression or if phosphorylation is more directly affecting Atoh1's activity as a transcription factor. This should be clarified.</p><p>3) Related to the previous point, the authors should determine whether phosphorylation affects nuclear localization of Atoh1, which is a level of regulation of transcription factors that is frequently associated with phosphorylation.</p><p>4) It would be useful to see that the JAK inhibitor affects Atoh1 half-life and/or transcriptional activity. The authors have relied largely on ectopic expression of Atoh1 mutants to support this connection, but inhibition of endogenous JAK2 to affect endogenous Atoh1 would provide a more compelling link.</p><p>5) Despite the complexities that come from understanding Atoh1 within the context of multiple developmental molecular mechanisms, the authors provide minimal data to show Atoh1 expression and activation within the SHH subtype, essentially limited to 2 SHH tumors and 2 Wnt tumors.

To insure the specificity of Jak2 effects, we opted to use viral knock down of Jak2 in primary Shh-derived medulloblastoma tumors. Using xenografts, we show that downregulation of Jak2 indeed impedes tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, by western blot analysis we show that Y78 phosphorylation of Atoh1 is absent in the tumors with the most effective Jak2 knock down. Together with the chemical inhibition of Jak2 in cell culture, the notion that Y78 phosphorylation itself increases tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the epistatic experiments in which Jak2 alone is sufficient to increase Atoh1 half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), we hope that the reviewers will agree that the data do support the conclusion that Jak2 increases tumor growth in vivo through Y78 phosphorylation of Atoh1.</p><p>A second point raised pertains to whether another Jak family member, namely Jak1, could take over the role of Jak2 in its absence. While the in vitro kinase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the BiFC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) do not suggest such a possibility, the situation may differ in vivo. We addressed this question in two ways. If Jak1 compensates for the loss of function of Jak2, we predict to detect a difference in Atoh1 transcriptional activity in cell lines after Jak2 knock down. Because the chemical inhibitor might not be selective enough and could also inhibit Jak1, we performed a combined genetic and chemical inhibition experiment to address this question. We inhibited Jak2 using AG490 while virally knocking down the protein at the same time, to see if we get an additive effect. To this end, we repeated the luciferase assay in DOAY cells that co-expressed Atoh1 and Jak2 (which resulted in a similar induction as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and inhibited Jak2 either via AG490 treatment, via introduction of Jak2 shRNAs (#61 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, which has the highest knock down efficiency), or by using a combination of AG490 inhibition and Jak2 shRNA knock-down. The figure below shows that while either inhibition of Jak2 (chemical or genetic) results in a substantial reduction in Atoh1-induced transcriptional activity, the combination does not have an additional effect. These data support the conclusion that the effect of AG490 treatment is mediated by Jak2 inhibition and that Jak1 is not compensating for the lack of Jak2 function when it comes to phosphorylating Y78 on Atoh1 which, in turn, mediates its enhanced transcriptional activity. We are happy to add this experiment to the paper as a supplemental piece of data if the reviewer and editor believe it would be helpful.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31181.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Jak2 inhibition either by AG490 or knock down using shRNA (#61) similarly prevents the increase in transcriptional activity of an Atoh1-specific reporter in DAOY cells.</title><p>Combining the inhibitor with genetic knock down does not result in any further inhibition of Atoh1 activity, consistent with Jak2 being the major component responsible for the modulation of Atoh1 (n=36 in duplicates, One-way ANOVA compared to Y78, Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. ****p&lt;0.0001, ns=not significant).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31181-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>In addition, we analyzed the Jak1 levels in our in vivo knock down of Jak2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

In addition – although Jak1 is present in these tumors the Y78 phosphorylation is nonetheless dramatically decreased.

We do not believe that these two effects are in a linear cascade where higher stability leads to higher transcriptional activity as the steady state levels in the cell lines are comparable. It will be interesting to investigate whether phosphorylation effects the On- or Off-rates of Atoh1 on DNA, thereby leading to a longer promoter occupancy, however these experiments are beyond the scope of this paper. We edited the text to make it clear that these two effects are not connected in a linear manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the previous point, the authors should determine whether phosphorylation affects nuclear localization of Atoh1, which is a level of regulation of transcription factors that is frequently associated with phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we agree that this information strengthens the paper. In response, we evaluated the nuclear localization of the wildtype, phospho-mutant and phospho-mimetic Atoh1 constructs and saw no differences.

To identify a neuronal cell line that expresses endogenous Atoh1 we interrogated the Swedish Human Protein Atlas with 56 cell lines catalogued (HPA, https://www.proteinatlas.org/cell) as well as the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia with 1457 cell lines catalogued (CCLE, https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle), but sadly failed to identify any. This is the primary reason for using the inducible expression system, which gives us the advantage of studying the effects of different mutants without the interference of the endogenous protein.</p><p>While not ideal, we wanted to address the reviewer’s comment to evaluate the effects on <italic>endogenous</italic> Atoh1 by using mouse primary Shh-derived medulloblastoma cells, which express endogenous Atoh1. We have already used a short culture experiment to show a dramatic reduction in Y78 levels within one hour of AG490 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We repeated this experiment (n=3) with and without the Jak2 inhibitor while blocking translation (using addition of cycloheximide) at the same time. As shown below, while Atoh1 is stable over at least 8 hours after plating, addition of the Jak2 inhibitor rapidly leads to the loss of Jak2 as well as tyrosine 78 phosphorylation. At the same time, Atoh1 protein stability decreases only in the AG490-treated cells but not in those that were untreated. These data support the conclusion that our cell line data reflect the endogenous state of Atoh1 in SHH-type medulloblastoma cells. We are happy to add this experiment to the paper as a supplemental piece of data if the reviewer and editor believe it would be helpful.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31181.019</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of Jak2 by AG490 results in the destabilization of Atoh1 in primary Shh-type medulloblastoma cells.</title><p>Isolated primary mouse Shh-type medulloblastoma cell were plated in a 24-well format and treated with Cyclohexamide (CHX) three hours after plating for the indicated durations.

Accordingly, we re-reviewed existing expression studies and found Atoh1 to be expressed in SHH-type tumors but no other subtypes. To illustrate the exclusivity of Atoh1 expression in SHH-type medulloblastoma, we included a box plot of Atoh1 expression using the publicly available data from Dr. Pfister and colleagues (Kool et al., 2012). While our aim is to test Atoh1 protein levels in human medulloblastoma, we have yet to develop or identify an antibody that reliably detects Atoh1. We and others have tried for years to develop a reliable and specific antibody to no avail, for this reason we created the Atoh1-GFP fusion knock-in allele in the mice. While we acknowledge the limitations of our human data due to the mentioned antibody and sample availability, we believe that our in vivo mouse work is solid in supporting a Jak2-Atoh1 signaling axis in Shh-type medulloblastoma and our human data sufficiently support the notion that Atoh1 is phosphorylated on Y78 in human SHH-type medulloblastoma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The cell lines used in this project have been shown to not be representative of primary medulloblastomas, especially of the SHH subtype.

While Dr. Xiao-Nan Li and colleagues established patient tumor-derived orthotopic xenograft models for childhood brain tumors, there is a consensus that newly isolated medulloblastoma cell lines do not grow in culture (Neumann et al., 2017).</p><p>Moreover, while there is considerable discussion in the field about the origins and subtype of the different medulloblastoma cell lines used in this study, we would like to highlight for the reviewer a study by Dr. Fanayan and colleagues from earlier this year. This study provides a convincing argument that DAOY cells do have a SHH-type proteomic signature, whereas the UW228 cells display a signature more similar to the WNT subtype (Higdon et al., 2017). This classification differs somewhat from earlier attempts to classify existing cell lines (reviewed in Neumann et al., 2017). It is noteworthy that DAOY cells originated from a desmoplastic cerebellar medulloblastoma, which is a hallmark of SHH-type medulloblastoma.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Atoh1 is not expressed in any of these cell lines probably due to its role in cellular differentiation (Klisch et al., 2011). Therefore, our doxycycline-inducible system provides an opportunity to better study Atoh1 function. While we agree that these medulloblastoma cell lines do not fully recapitulate the tumor biology of medulloblastoma, it is noteworthy that this is an inherent flaw of all in vitro systems. Acknowledging this limitation, we opted to use three rather than just one cell line as well as in vivo studies to provide further support for our conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
