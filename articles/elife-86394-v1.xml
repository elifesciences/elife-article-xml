We used these five assays to compare EV separation from lipoproteins using size exclusion chromatography with resins containing different pore sizes. We also developed improved methods for EV isolation based on combining several types of chromatography resins in the same column. We present a simple approach to quantitatively measure the main impurities of EV isolation in plasma and apply this approach to develop novel methods for enriching EVs from human plasma.

EVs contain RNA and protein cargo from their cell of origin and are a promising class of biomarkers in biofluids such as plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). Since EVs are much less abundant than free proteins and lipoproteins in plasma, enriching them without the co-isolation of these impurities remains highly challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sódar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Smolarz et al., 2019</xref>). This is particularly the case for separating EVs and lipoproteins, as these two classes of particles have overlapping size ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Simonsen, 2017</xref>). Developing EV isolation methods is also particularly challenging due to the inability of most methods, such as the commonly used Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) to differentiate between EVs and similarly sized lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Johnsen et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to compare EV isolation methods without suitable techniques to quantify both EV yield and lipoprotein content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hartjes et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have previously developed a framework for comparing EV isolation methods by measuring three tetraspanin transmembrane proteins present on EVs (CD9, CD63, and CD81) and albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ter-Ovanesyan et al., 2021</xref>). We used the tetraspanins as a way to compare EV yields across different isolation methods and albumin (the most abundant free protein in plasma) as a way to measure protein contamination. To measure these proteins, we used Single Molecule Array (Simoa) technology, a digital ELISA method that results in high sensitivity and a wide dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Rissin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we developed a Simoa assay for ApoB-100, the major protein component of several lipoproteins. ApoB-100 is present on low-density lipoproteins (LDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">German et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sniderman et al., 2019</xref>). By combining the new ApoB-100 assay with our previously developed CD9, CD63, CD81, and albumin assays, we could quantify EVs, lipoproteins, and free proteins for each sample on the same platform. We then used these assays to further improve EV isolation methods from plasma, enabling us to separate EVs from lipoproteins and free proteins at purity levels beyond those of previously described methods. We envision these methods to enable applications requiring high EV purity, such as EV proteomics for biomarker discovery from human biofluids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To measure lipoproteins, we developed a Simoa assay against ApoB-100, the protein component of lipoproteins LDL, IDL, and VLDL. Simoa is a digital ELISA method where individual immuno-complexes are trapped on magnetic beads that are loaded into microwells that fit, at most, one bead per well. Counting the ‘on wells’ thus translates to counting individual protein molecules, providing much higher sensitivity than traditional ELISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Rissin et al., 2010</xref>). First, we compared a variety of capture and detector antibodies using calibration curves of the purified ApoB-100 protein standard. We then chose the antibody pair with the highest signal-to-background ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and validated this assay with dilution linearity experiments in three individual plasma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also performed spike and recovery experiments using a purified protein standard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We then combined this Simoa assay for ApoB-100 with our previously developed CD9, CD63, CD81, and albumin assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ter-Ovanesyan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Norman et al., 2021</xref>) to simultaneously measure EVs, free proteins, and lipoproteins on the same platform.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Validation of ApoB-100 Simoa assay.</title><p>Simoa ApoB-100 assay was validated using: (<bold>A</bold>) Calibration curve using purified ApoB-100 protein.

We tested EV separation based on size using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns with three different resins (Sepharose CL-2B, CL-4B, and CL-6B). We collected 0.5 ml fractions after performing SEC and used Simoa to measure CD9, CD63, CD81, albumin, and ApoB-100 in each fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ter-Ovanesyan et al., 2021</xref>), we calculated relative EV yields between different EV isolation methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To calculate EV yield, we first determined the ratio of each tetraspanin between conditions and then took the average of the three tetraspanin ratios. To then calculate EV purity, we calculated the ratio of EV yield relative to albumin or ApoB-100 levels. We found that although the ratio of EVs relative to ApoB-100 was higher in the resin with the largest pore size, Sepharose CL-2B, this was at the expense of EV yield relative to the other two resins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of plasma using different resins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Levels of CD9, CD63, CD81, ApoB-100, and albumin were measured by Simoa after SEC of 1 ml plasma in each fraction using either Sepharose CL-2B, Sepharose CL-4B, or Sepharose CL-6B resin.

We first investigated the separation of EVs from lipoproteins and albumin using density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGC). We loaded 1 ml of plasma on an iodixanol gradient and performed ultracentrifugation for 16 hr. We then collected 1 ml fractions and used Simoa to measure tetraspanins, albumin, and ApoB-100 in each fraction. We found that we could readily separate EVs from ApoB-100-containing lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) using DGC, although the EV yield was lower than in SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As DGC is time-consuming and low throughput, we explored other EV isolation methods that would be more suitable for processing clinical samples.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Separation of extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipoproteins, and free proteins from plasma using density gradient centrifugation.</title><p>Levels of CD9, CD63, CD81, albumin, and ApoB-100 were measured by Simoa in individual 1 ml fractions (collected from the top) after density gradient centrifugation of plasma using an iodixanol gradient.

First, we wanted to assess the absolute recovery of EVs by SEC using Sepharose CL-6B, the resin with the highest EV yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We took advantage of Simoa’s wide dynamic range and specificity to measure tetraspanin levels in diluted plasma and compared these levels after EV purification from the same batch of plasma by SEC. We also evaluated how various other parameters affected EV recovery by SEC. We found that performing at least one 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) wash in-column, instead of simply washing the resin in bulk before making the column, increased the EV yield significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). One potential reason for this result could be that in-column washes are more effective at removing the ethanol in which the resin is supplied. After performing an in-column wash, we were able to achieve &gt;50% EV yield using SEC with Sepharose CL-6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as measured by comparing tetraspanin levels in SEC fractions 7–10 relative to diluted plasma.</p><p>We then decided to take advantage of the property that ApoB-100 is positively charged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Olsson et al., 1991</xref>), while EVs are generally negatively charged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brownlee et al., 2014</xref>) to separate EVs from lipoproteins. It has previously been demonstrated that dual-mode chromatography (DMC) columns with a bottom layer of cation exchange resin below Sepharose CL-4B can be used to isolate EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Van Deun et al., 2020</xref>). Since Sepharose CL-6B yields more EVs than Sepharose CL-4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we constructed DMC columns with a 2-ml cation exchange resin bottom layer and a top layer of 10 ml Sepharose CL-6B. Inspired by the DMC approach of combining different resins in the same column, we also developed a new type of column, Tri-Mode mixed-mode Chromatography (TMC), where we further added Capto Core 700 to the cation exchange resin in the bottom layer. Capto Core 700 is a multimodal chromatography resin that contains porous beads with an inner core layer functionalized with octylamine groups that bind and trap proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blom et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that having this resin in the bottom layer would ‘catch’ free proteins that co-isolate with EVs during SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By changing the volumes and ratios of the two resins, the depletion of both albumin and ApoB-100 could be tuned to increase purity, although at the cost of EV yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To balance EV yield and purity, we settled on a 2:1 ratio of solid cation exchange resin to multimodal resin in the 2 ml bottom layer.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of novel columns for extracellular vesicle (EV) isolation from plasma using electron microscopy and Simoa.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the columns being compared: size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column comprised of 10 ml Sepharose CL-6B, dual-mode chromatography (DMC) columns comprised of 10 ml Sepharose CL-6B SEC resin atop 2 ml Fractogel cation exchange resin, Tri-Mode Chromatography (TMC) columns comprised of 10 ml Sepharose CL-6B SEC resin atop 2 ml 2:1 ratio of 2 ml Fractogel cation exchange resin to Capto Core 700 multimodal chromatography resin.

We first used electron microscopy to image EVs from each column. We found that, although lipoproteins were still present, DMC and TMC led to a higher purity of EVs relative to lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then used Simoa to quantify the relative levels of EVs, lipoproteins, and free proteins using SEC, DMC, and TMC columns. We collected fractions 9–12 (instead of fractions 7–10 as for SEC) for DMC and TMC to account for the extra 2 ml of resin in the column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that DMC and TMC columns significantly depleted ApoB-100, but also led to some loss in EV yield, particularly CD9, compared to SEC columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Calculating the relative yields of each tetraspanin and averaging the three tetraspanin ratios to calculate EV yield, we found that DMC and TMC columns had a lower EV yield than SEC but significantly higher EV/ApoB-100 ratios. Although DMC columns had higher ratios of EVs to ApoB-100 compared to SEC, the ratio of EVs to albumin remained the same. The TMC column, on the other hand, had a higher ratio of both EVs to ApoB-100 and EVs to albumin compared to the SEC column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>).</p><p>To assess the utility of highly pure EVs isolated with TMC, we performed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Performing mass spectrometry on EVs from plasma is challenging because levels of both free proteins and lipoproteins are several orders of magnitude higher than those of EV proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Smolarz et al., 2019</xref>). Using TMC, we were able to detect 780 proteins from EVs isolated from only 1 ml of plasma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results demonstrate the advantage of using TMC for deep proteomics analysis using a small sample volume.</p><p>Single-use chromatography columns, whether SEC to maximize EV yield or TMC to maximize EV purity, represent an attractive platform for isolating EVs from clinical samples as they are inexpensive and take a short time to run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Monguió-Tortajada et al., 2019</xref>). The throughput of columns, however, is limited. Columns are usually run one at a time, and although it is possible to run more than one column at the same time, this becomes challenging if done manually. To increase the throughput and reproducibility of column-based EV isolation, we built a semi-automated stand for running eight columns in parallel. Using a syringe pump run by a Raspberry Pi, we were able to dispense liquid to all columns in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). We tested the reproducibility of our device using Simoa and found high concordance between eight SEC columns run by the device and eight SEC columns run manually for EV isolation from plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Although this device was built as a proof of principle to run eight columns in parallel, we envision building a similar device that could run many more columns simultaneously in the future.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Development and validation of automated device for running size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns in parallel.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CAD image of semi-automated SEC stand designed to hold eight columns at once with sliding collection tube holder that allows liquid to drip either into 2 ml collection tubes, or to waste.

First, we developed and validated a Simoa assay for ApoB-100. We then combined this assay with previously developed Simoa assays for the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81, as well as albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ter-Ovanesyan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Norman et al., 2021</xref>). With these assays in place, we were able to quantify EVs, free proteins, and lipoproteins from the same sample on one experimental platform. Using this approach, we assessed different ways of separating EVs from lipoproteins with the aim of developing improved EV isolation methods.</p><p>Plasma contains several types of lipoproteins with varying protein and lipid compositions. Although there is not a single present on all lipoproteins, we chose to measure ApoB-100, as it is a protein component of several lipoproteins (such as LDL, IDL, and VLDL) that overlap in size with EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Simonsen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Johnsen et al., 2019</xref>). We evaluated the possibility that SEC using resins with three different pore sizes might separate EVs from ApoB-100-containing lipoproteins using our platform. We previously used our tetraspanin and albumin Simoa assays to directly compare EV yield and free protein contamination for different SEC resins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ter-Ovanesyan et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we used a similar approach to compare EV yield and lipoprotein contamination by including the ApoB-100 assay and found that we were unable to effectively separate tetraspanins from ApoB-100 by SEC. We also used our Simoa assays to evaluate DGC and showed that this technique enables good separation of tetraspanins from ApoB-100 and albumin; however, since DGC requires an ultracentrifuge, is low throughput, and time-intensive, it is not suitable for clinical samples.</p><p>We used our assays to develop novel methods for separating EVs from lipoproteins. A previous study described DMC columns that deplete lipoproteins by combining SEC using Sepharose CL-4B with a second bottom layer of cation exchange resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Van Deun et al., 2020</xref>). We modified DMC to include the higher yield Sepharose CL-6B resin and demonstrated depletion of most of the ApoB-100, although at the cost of some EV depletion. To improve the ratio of EVs to ApoB-100 and albumin, we developed a new method that combines a top layer of Sepharose CL-6B with a bottom layer of both cation exchange resin and a multimodal chromatography resin called Capto Core 700. These ‘Tri-Mode mixed-mode Chromatography’, or TMC columns, produced EV preparations of higher purity relative to SEC columns in terms of both their lower albumin and lipoprotein content. As the multimodal chromatography resin binds free proteins but not EVs, the TMC columns reduce the co-elution of free protein with EVs.</p><p>This work presents a framework for quantitatively comparing EV isolation methods. There is not a single optimal way to isolate EVs because the purification method must be matched to the application; therefore, it is crucial to have effective ways of comparing both the yield and purity of different isolation methods. We developed TMC columns for applications where EVs of very high purity are needed and optimized these columns for EV purification from plasma using our Simoa assays. We envision these columns will be particularly useful for EV biomarker discovery using proteomics, where EV contamination with lipoproteins and free proteins prevents deep coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Smolarz et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study using a three-step protocol (polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by iohexol gradient fractionation and SEC) to enrich EVs from 1 ml plasma reported the detection of 250 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Another study reported the detection of 1187 proteins from plasma using ultracentrifugation, density gradient, and then SEC; the starting volume in that study was 40–80 ml plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Karimi et al., 2018</xref>). Using TMC columns, we were able to measure the plasma EV proteome using an easy, single-step isolation protocol and detect 780 proteins using a 1-ml sample. By also building an automated device for running columns in parallel, we demonstrate a path toward using column-based methods for clinical samples. Future iterations of the device will further increase the sample throughput. Taken together, the methods we developed will contribute to the realization of EV profiling in molecular diagnostics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap

For ApoB-100, mab4124 (R&amp;D Systems) was used as the capture antibody, mab41242 (R&amp;D Systems) was used as the detector antibody, and purified ApoB-100 BA1030 (Origene) was used as a standard. For SEC, onboard dilution was performed with 4× dilution for each of the assays, with an additional 4× off-board dilution for CD9 and 10× off-board dilution for ApoB-100. For measuring protein levels in total plasma, each protein was measured with 4× onboard dilution and three additional off-board dilutions: for CD9 – 40×, 80×, and 160×; for CD63 and CD81 – 3×, 9×, and 27×; for albumin – 100×, 3000×, and 9000×; and for ApoB-100 – 100×, 300×, and 900× dilution.

Relative EV yield for comparing multiple conditions was calculated by dividing the EV yield of each condition by the highest EV yield of all the conditions.

Samples were imaged on a JEOL 1200EX – 80 kV transmission electron microscope with an AMT 2k CCD camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>EVs were isolated from 1 ml plasma using TMC columns with a 2-ml bed volume bottom layer of 2:1 of Fractogel EMD SO3- (M) (MilliporeSigma) to Capto Core 700 (Cytiva) and 10-ml bed volume top layer of Sepharose CL-6B (Cytiva). EVs were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-2 centrifugal 10 kD filter (MilliporeSigma). After concentration, EV protein was precipitated by adding 9 volumes of 100% ethanol to 1 volume of EVs, vortexing and leaving at −20°C for 30 min. Sample was then centrifuged at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatant was removed and pellet was left to air dry for 10 min. Sample was then sent to Bruker for proteomics analysis. Sample was resuspended in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and digested for 2 hr at 50°C using Trypsin Platinum (Promega) using 1:50 Trypsin to sample ratio by mass. After evaporating solution in a Vacufuge (Eppendorf) ar 45°C, sample was resolubilized in 10 μl 0.1% formic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, 1.5 μl of sample was injected into C18 tips (Evosep) and eluted into a 25-cm length 150 μm internal diameter PepSep analytical column packed with 1.5 μm C18 beads (Dr. Maisch). Sample was eluted into a Bruker timsTOF HT. A gradient from 3% of to 28% of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile at 63 min was then increased to 85% until 80 min. Data were analyzed using Spectronaut 17 (Biognosys) software for data-independent acquisition (DIA). A false discovery rate of 1% was used at both the peptide and protein levels. Keratin proteins (likely contaminants) were manually removed from the list.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>SEC stand and automated device</title><p>Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> were performed using the automated SEC stand connected to a Cavro XLP 6000 syringe pump (Tecan) controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4 model B.

We initially chose ApoB-100 as it was the main protein we detected by mass spectrometry after isolating EVs from plasma using SEC. This makes sense, as ApoB-100 is present in several lipoproteins that overlap in size with EVs (1). Regarding the question of whether ApoB-100 can be depleted based on cation exchange, it was not clear that this would work just based on the knowledge that there are positively charged peptides in ApoB-100, but we were inspired by previous work reporting the development of the dual mode chromatography columns (2). We were able to confirm the ability of cation exchange resin to deplete lipoproteins containing ApoB-100 with our ApoB-100 Simoa assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, the TEM demonstrates that there is an increase in purity of EVs relative to lipoproteins for TMC/DMC compared to SEC using a technique other than Simoa. Despite the significant reduction of ApoB-100 in TMC, there is still ApoB-100 present. The ApoB-100 can be further reduced by increasing the amount of cation-exchange resin in the TMC column. We provide additional data in Figure 4-supplemental figure 1 showing how varying the volumes of the Fractogel cation exchange resin and the Capto Core 700 resin changes the levels of tetraspanins, albumin, and ApoB-100. Increasing the amount of cation-exchange resin reduces ApoB-100, but also leads to a decrease in tetraspanins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We think it is likely impossible to fully separate EVs from lipoproteins and free proteins, but by increasing the ratio of EVs to lipoproteins and free proteins, as we have done with the TMC column, the depth of coverage for proteomics can be greatly increased. Our focus here was to provide a framework for quantitatively comparing EV isolation method yield and purity (with respect to both lipoproteins and free proteins); mass spectrometry is one application where having high purity EVs is important. The optimal EV isolation method will vary for different applications and will be highly dependent on the amount of starting material necessary for the technique being used. In mass spectrometry, different instruments have different requirements for the amount of input protein material necessary, so the optimal isolation technique will be instrument-dependent. We provide additional data in Figure 4-supplemental figure 1 (discussed above) showing how increasing the amount of cation-exchange resin allows for further depletion of ApoB-100. We did not, however, test all the different TMC variations using mass spectrometry. We are currently working on optimizing mass spectrometry for EVs from plasma, but this work is beyond the scope of this paper, as it also depends on many parameters downstream of EV isolation. Nonetheless, 780 proteins is high for a single-step technique from a starting volume of only 1 mL. For comparison, one study used a three step protocol (PEG precipitation followed by iohexol gradient fractionation and SEC) to enrich EVs from 1 mL plasma and reported detecting 250 proteins (3). Another group reported detecting 1187 proteins from plasma using ultracentrifugation, density gradient, and then SEC, but started with 40-80 mL plasma (4). We’ve added this information to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We modified the wording of this sentence and replaced “separate” with “enrich.” We did not specifically analyze cholymicrons or HDL in this study. As mentioned in the Discussion section, Simoa assays for protein components of lipoproteins other than ApoB-100 (such as Apo-A1 for HDL) could be developed and an identical analysis framework could be employed. In this study, we decided to focus on the most abundant protein component of lipoproteins found in our mass spectrometry analysis, ApoB-100.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few suggestions for the authors' consideration:</p><p>It may be more accurate to describe the free proteins and lipoproteins as impurities (i.e., present at the outset, but not intended to be present in the final preparation), rather than contaminants (i.e., introduced inadvertently)</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve changed “contaminants” to “impurities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction could be more laser-focused on plasma since that's the focus of the work, and the lipoprotein issue may be greatly magnified compared to in e..g, urine</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added this clarification to the last paragraph of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A few more words about the principle of the Simoa assay could be useful to the reader</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added two sentences about Simoa to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;These results demonstrate the advantage of using TMC for deep proteomics analysis using a small sample volume.&quot; Some comparison to the prior state of the art would bolster this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these comparisons (as mentioned in response to one of the comments from Reviewer #1) to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Beyond the relative yields, can synthetic EV spike-ins be used to calculate the absolute yields?</p></disp-quote><p>EV spike-ins from cell lines can be used, but we don’t think this is a way to provide absolute quantification since existing EV analysis techniques are unable to provide absolute quantification of these cell-culture derived EVs (as there are non-EV particles in cell culture media as well).

One way to approach this challenge is with proteinase protection assays, but significant optimization is required to ensure both sufficient proteinase activity and full inactivation of proteinase before analyzing the protected EV contents. Although comparing the proteomes of total plasma and plasma EVs was beyond the scope of this study, such a comparison (using data from several published studies) has been performed before (5). In that comparison, fewer than half of the proteins detected between total plasma and plasma EVs were shared, and for those proteins that were shared, the correlation of protein abundances was relatively poor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have shared all the relevant data, as well as additional resources that will be useful to the scientific community.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The &quot;relative EV yields&quot; was used to quantify the amount of EVs across different methods.

We decided that taking four 0.5 mL fractions for each column would be best for directly comparing them.

The TMC column has improved performance relative to SEC in terms of lipoprotein depletion for the same reason as the DMC column. The cation exchange resin binds and retains positively charged ApoB-100-containing lipoproteins. We have expanded the explanation of why TMC provides EVs of higher purity than SEC in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
