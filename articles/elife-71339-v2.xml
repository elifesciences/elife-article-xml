It is catalyzed by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Whereas PFOR reduces ferredoxin, the PDH complex utilizes NAD<sup>+</sup>. Anaerobes rely on PFOR, which was replaced during evolution by the PDH complex found in aerobes. Cyanobacteria possess both enzyme systems. Our data challenge the view that PFOR is exclusively utilized for fermentation. Instead, we show, that the cyanobacterial PFOR is stable in the presence of oxygen in vitro and is required for optimal photomixotrophic growth under aerobic and highly reducing conditions while the PDH complex is inactivated. We found that cells rely on a general shift from utilizing NAD(H)- to ferredoxin-dependent enzymes under these conditions. The utilization of ferredoxins instead of NAD(H) saves a greater share of the Gibbs-free energy, instead of wasting it as heat. This obviously simultaneously decelerates metabolic reactions as they operate closer to their thermodynamic equilibrium. It is common thought that during evolution, ferredoxins were replaced by NAD(P)H due to their higher stability in an oxidizing atmosphere. However, the utilization of NAD(P)H could also have been favored due to a higher competitiveness because of an accelerated metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Later on, hydrogen escape to space irreversibly oxidized Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zahnle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catling et al., 2001</xref>). Prebiotic redox reactions that took place on the surfaces of FeS minerals, are at present mimicked by catalytic FeS clusters in a plethora of enzymes and redox carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Russell and Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">WÃ¤chtershÃ¤user, 1990</xref>). One example are ferredoxins, that are small, soluble proteins containing 4Fe4S, 3Fe4S, or 2Fe2S clusters and shuttle electrons between redox reactions. They display a wide range of redox potentials between â240 to â680 mV and are involved in a variety of metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Ferredoxins are among the earliest proteins on Earth and are accordingly present in all three kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). FeS enzymes are especially widespread in anaerobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The advent of oxygenic photosynthesis necessitated adaptations, as especially 4Fe4S clusters are oxidized and degraded to 3Fe4S in the presence of oxygen resulting in inactivated enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imlay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jagannathan et al., 2012</xref>). In aerobes, FeS enzymes are commonly replaced by FeS cluster-free isoenzymes or alternative metabolic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imlay, 2006</xref>). One well-known example is the replacement of the FeS cluster containing pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), which catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate during fermentation in anaerobes, by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex for respiration in aerobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould et al., 2019</xref>). Both enzymes catalyze the same reaction, however, PFOR uses ferredoxin as redox partner and the PDH complex reduces NAD<sup>+</sup>. PFORs are old enzymes from an evolutionary point of view. They are widespread in autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria, in archaea, amitochondriate eukaryotic protists, hydrogenosomes as well as in cyanobacteria and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>). Depending on organism, metabolism and conditions, PFOR can be involved in the oxidation of pyruvate for heterotrophy or alternatively catalyze the reverse reaction by fixing CO<sub>2</sub> and forming pyruvate from acetyl CoA for an autotrophic lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 1966</xref>). The enzyme might have played a central role for the evolution of both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes from the very beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gutekunst, 2018</xref>). PFOR indeed participates as CO<sub>2</sub> fixing enzyme in four out of seven currently known and most ancient autotrophic pathways (reverse tricarboxylic acid [rTCA] cycle, reversed oxidative tricarboxylic acid [roTCA] cycle, reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, and dicarboxylate/hydroxybutyrate [DC/HB] cycle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuchs, 2011</xref>). PFORs contain one to three 4Fe4S clusters and in general get inactivated readily by oxygen upon purification. So far, there are only three reported exceptions to this rule: the PFORs of <italic>Halobacterium halobium</italic>, <italic>Desulvovibrio africanus</italic>, and <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pieulle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pieulle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerscher and Oesterhelt, 1981</xref>). Even though all three enzymes are stable upon purification in the presence of oxygen, anaerobic conditions are required for in vitro maintenance of enzyme activities with the PFORs of <italic>D. africanus</italic> and <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>. The enzyme of <italic>H. halobium</italic> is the only PFOR reported so far, which is active under aerobic conditions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerscher and Oesterhelt, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kerscher and Oesterhelt, 1977</xref>). In vivo studies on these PFORs under aerobic conditions are missing. Recently it was shown in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, that PFOR plays an important role in aerobic cultures of a mutant in which glucose-6P dehydrogenase (ZWF) was downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2021</xref>). PFOR is probably involved in redox control during stationary phase in this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2021</xref>). This finding is highly surprising, as PFOR activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> crude extracts is only detectable under anaerobic conditions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakayama et al., 2013</xref>). There are several reports on the aerobic expression of enzymes that are assigned to anaerobic metabolism in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and therefore challenge the simplistic distinction between aerobic versus anaerobic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gutekunst et al., 2005</xref>). Their physiological significance and regulation are only partly understood.</p><p>Ferredoxins that contain 4Fe4S clusters are likewise vulnerable to oxidative degradation. In the evolution from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis, the soluble 4Fe4S ferredoxin, which transfers electrons from FeS-type photosystems PSI (photosystem I) to other enzymes in anoxygenic photosynthesis was replaced by an oxygen-tolerant 2Fe2S ferredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jagannathan et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, NAD(P)H has gained importance as alternative, oxygen-insensitive reducing agent in aerobes and thereby complemented or replaced oxygensensitive ferredoxins, that are useful for anaerobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>The PDH complex</title><p>The PDH complex, which utilizes NAD<sup>+</sup> is composed of the three subunits: PDH (E1), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). It catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of pyruvate. The PDH complex is active under oxic conditions but gets inactivated under anaerobic conditions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, albeit via distinct mechanisms. In the absence of oxygen NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios rise as respiration no longer oxidizes the NADH coming from the PDH complex and the subsequent reactions of the TCA cycle. In prokaryotes, as for example <italic>E. coli</italic>, NADH interacts with the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) subunit and thereby inhibits the PDH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). In eukaryotes, the PDH complex gets inactivated at high NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios via phosphorylation of highly conserved serine residues in the PDH (E1) subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolobova et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p><italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 is a cyanobacterium that performs oxygenic photosynthesis and lives photoautotrophically by fixing CO<sub>2</sub> via the CalvinâBensonâBassham (CBB) cycle. In the presence of external carbohydrates these are metabolized additionally, resulting in a photomixotrophic lifestyle. In darkness <italic>Synechocystis</italic> switches to a heterotrophic or under anaerobic conditions to a fermentative lifestyle. As in many cyanobacteria, pyruvate can be either decarboxylated via PFOR or alternatively via the PDH complex in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. PFOR is assumed to be involved in fermentation under anoxic conditions and the PDH complex in aerobic respiration. The observation that <italic>pfor</italic> is transcribed under photoautotrophic conditions in the presence of oxygen in the cyanobacteria <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. PCC 7942 and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> was therefore surprising but is well in line with the observation that other enzymes assigned to anaerobic metabolism in eukaryotes are expressed in the presence of oxygen as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmitz et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Synechoystis</italic> possesses a network of up to 11 ferredoxins containing 2Fe2S, 3Fe4S, and 4Fe4S clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cassier-Chauvat and Chauvat, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artz et al., 2020</xref>). The 2Fe2S ferredoxin 1 (Ssl0020) is essential and by far the most abundant ferredoxin in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and is the principal acceptor of photosynthetic electrons at PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bottin and Lagoutte, 1992</xref>). Structures, redox potentials and distinct functions have been resolved for some of the alternative low abundant ferredoxins, however, the metabolic significance of the complete network is still far from being understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cassier-Chauvat and Chauvat, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gutekunst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schorsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Motomura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mustila et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that PFOR and low abundant ferredoxins are required for optimal photomixotrophic growth under oxic conditions. In line with this we found that the cyanobacterial PFOR is stable in the presence of oxygen in vitro. PFOR and ferredoxins can functionally replace the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PDH complex, which we found is inactivated at high NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios. Likewise, the ferredoxin-dependent F-GOGAT (<underline>g</underline>lutamine <underline>o</underline>xo<underline>g</underline>lutarate <underline>a</underline>mino<underline>t</underline>ransferase) is essential for photomixotrophic growth as well and cannot be functionally replaced by the NADH-dependent N-GOGAT. The cells obviously switch in their utilization of isoenzymes and redox pools. However, the key factor for this switch is not oxygen but are the highly reducing conditions within the cells. Our data suggest that the pool of ferredoxins in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> functions as an overflow basin to shuttle electrons, when the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> pool is highly reduced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The roles of PDH complex and PFOR were studied in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> under different growth conditions. PDH could not be deleted from the genome indicating that this enzyme complex is essential, whereas <italic>pfor</italic> was knocked out in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gutekunst et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this, we found that all fully sequenced diazotrophic and nondiazotrophic cyanobacteria with photosystem II (PSII contain genes coding for a PDH complex and that 56% of these cyanobacteria possess a PFOR as well). If we subtract from this group all diazotrophic cyanobacteria that contain a nitrogenase and might therefore utilize PFOR in the process of nitrogen fixation, 130 nondiazotrophic cyanobacteria remain. Within the group of nondiazotrophic cyanobacteria 42% possess a PFOR in addition to the PDH complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This clearly shows that the property of holding both a PDH complex and a PFOR in cyanobacteria that live predominantly under oxic conditions is truly widespread. The analysis furthermore confirms our observation, that the PDH complex is preferred over the utilization of PFOR in cyanobacteria.We unexpectedly found that the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> Î<italic>pfor</italic> deletion mutant was impaired in its photomixotrophic growth under oxic conditions in continuous light. Growth impairment was typically visible starting around days 3â6 of the growth experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and 3A). In addition, maintenance in the stationary growth phase was affected in Î<italic>pfor</italic>.

These data indicate that cells indeed rely on a general switch from utilizing NAD(H) to utilizing ferredoxins for optimal photomixotrophic growth. It was recently shown that photosynthetic complex I (NDH1) exclusively accepts electrons from reduced ferredoxin instead of NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuller et al., 2019</xref>). Under photomixotrophic conditions photosynthesis operates in parallel to carbon oxidation. In addition to water oxidation at PSII, electrons from glucose oxidation can as well enter the respiratory/photosynthetic electron transport chain and eventually arrive at PSI. Photosynthesis based on PSI thus uses electrons from glucose oxidation that enter the respiratory/photosynthetic electron transport chain and are excited at PSI.</p><p>Three entry points exist that can feed electrons from glucose oxidation into the plastoquinone (PQ) pool in the thylakoid membrane: the succinate dehydrogenase, which accepts electrons from the conversion of succinate to fumarate; NDH-2, which accepts electrons from NADH and photosynthetic complex I (NDH-1), which accepts electrons from reduced ferredoxin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Based on the observed shift from utilizing ferredoxin instead of NAD(P)H, we thus wondered if photosynthetic complex I (NDH-1) might be required for photosynthesis (involving only PSI) under photomixotrophic conditions as an entry point for electrons coming from glucose oxidation. Cells were incubated with DCMU that blocks the electron transfer from PSII to the PQ pool. Thereby, electron transfer from glycogen or glucose oxidation to PSI could be measured based on a recently developed protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theune et al., 2021</xref>). According to this protocol electrons were counted that flow through PSI via DIRK<sub>PSI</sub> measurements by the KLAS/NIR instrument. The electron transport at PSI was then measured in the absence and in the presence of glucose. In addition to the WT, several mutants were analyzed with deletions in entry points as well as glucose metabolizing enzymes. The mutant with a deleted photosynthetic complex I (Î<italic>ndhD1</italic>Î<italic>ndhD2</italic>) should no longer be able to feed electrons from reduced ferredoxin into the respiratory/photosynthetic electron transport chain, while the hexokinase mutant (Î<italic>hk</italic>) should no longer be able to metabolize external glucose. The glycogen phosphorylase mutant (Î<italic>glgP1</italic>Î<italic>glgP2</italic>) is unable to break down its internal glycogen reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makowka et al., 2020</xref>).

This could facilitate the transfer of electrons from NADH to ferredoxins.

Photosynthetic complex I (NDHI) which accepts electrons from reduced ferredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuller et al., 2019</xref>), is furthermore required to feed electrons from glucose oxidation into the photosynthetic electron chain and to thereby enhance electron flow at PSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>PFORs are with a few reported exceptions highly oxygen-sensitive enzymes that work under strictly anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pieulle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerscher and Oesterhelt, 1981</xref>). We found that PFOR of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is stable in the presence of oxygen, however, in vitro we could only measure the decarboxylation of pyruvate in the absence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, our data strongly indicate that this enzyme is active in vivo under aerobic and highly reducing conditions.</p><p>Similar results were recently reported for <italic>E. coli. E. coli</italic> possesses three enzyme systems to convert pyruvate to acetyl CoA: the PDH complex, PFOR, and pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blaschkowski et al., 2005</xref>). The PDH complex and PFL are the principle enzyme systems to convert pyruvate to acetylCoA in <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas PFOR is expressed at very low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blaschkowski et al., 2005</xref>). Transcription of PFOR was shown to be enhanced under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakayama et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> decarboxylates pyruvate via the PDH complex in the presence of oxygen. Under anaerobic conditions NADH levels rise and inhibit the PDH complex. PFL gets activated and the cells switch to fermentation. PFL activation requires reduced flavodoxin which is provided by PFOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blaschkowski et al., 2005</xref>). The regulation at the pyruvate node in <italic>E. coli</italic> is thus mainly regulated via the availability of oxygen and its concomitant requirement for redox control and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). By downregulation of glucose-6P dehydrogenase (ZWF), less NADPH was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which activated the expression of PFOR and ferredoxin reductase (FPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2021</xref>). PFOR and FPR were shown to contribute to stationary-phase metabolism in aerobic cultures in this mutant probably by converting reduced ferredoxin to NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2021</xref>). PFOR is thus obviously involved in redox control in these mutants in the presence of oxygen. This finding was highly unexpected, as PFOR activity in crude extracts from aerobically grown <italic>E. coli</italic> cells is only detectable in the absence of oxygen in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakayama et al., 2013</xref>). There are several reports in prokaryotes and eukaryotes on the expression of enzymes under oxic conditions that are assigned to anaerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gutekunst et al., 2005</xref>). One example is the production of hydrogen by the oxygen-sensitive FeFe-hydrogenase in air-grown <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> algae in a fully aerobic environment, which is enabled by microoxic niches within the thylakoid stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liran et al., 2016</xref>). Another example is the constitutive expression of PFOR and the oxygen-sensitive NiFe-hydrogenase under oxic conditions in cyanobacteria. By itself, the widespread presence of these enzymes in organisms that either live predominantly aerobically as for example cyanobacteria or are even obligate aerobes as for example <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic>, which possesses a PFOR, indicates a misconception and lack of understanding. The PFOR of <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> could be isolated as stable enzyme in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, however, enzyme activity measurements required the consumption of oxygen in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witt et al., 2019</xref>). Does this mean, that anaerobic microniches are required within this obligate aerobe to activate an enzyme of its central carbon metabolism? It might alternatively be that living cells have the ability to maintain reducing conditions in the presence of oxygen by yet unknown mechanisms that for example consume oxygen, which is a challenge in enzymatic in vitro assays. Conclusions on in vivo enzyme activities based on in vitro experiments therefore should be made with caution. Even though we could measure decarboxylation of pyruvate via PFOR only in the absence of oxygen in vitro, our data strongly indicate that this enzyme is active in vivo under aerobic and highly reducing conditions. We assume that either anaerobic microniches or alternatively mechanisms within the cell that are not understood yet, keep the enzyme active in an aerobic environment.</p><p>Low abundant ferredoxins are required for optimal photomixotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is surprising when looking at glycolytic routes for glucose oxidation. Glucose is alternatively oxidized via different glycolytic routes in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Flux analyses have shown that glycolytic intermediates enter the CBB cycle, eventually reach lower glycolysis, and finally provide pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakajima et al., 2014</xref>). Depending on the precise route taken, glucose oxidation yields distinct forms of reducing equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makowka et al., 2020</xref>). Three enzymes are involved in oxidation steps: Glc6P dehydrogenase (Zwf) and 6 PG dehydrogenase (Gnd) yield NADPH, whereas GAP dehydrogenase (GAPDH) yields NADH. NAD(P)H is furthermore provided downstream in the TCA cycle. PFOR is thus the only known direct source for reduced ferredoxin in glucose oxidation beside PSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The wide network of low abundant ferredoxins in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and the importance of these ferredoxins under photomixotrophic conditions on the one hand and the low number of known enzymes that directly reduce ferredoxins on the other hand unveils that our conception is not yet inherently consistent. An additional potential source of reduced ferredoxin could be the transfer of electrons from NAD(P)H. The transhydrogenase (PntAB), which is located in the thylakoid membrane utilizes proton translocation to transfer electrons from NADH to NADP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen et al., 2017</xref>). Electrons from NADPH could be further transferred to ferredoxin via ferredoxin-NADPH-oxidoreductase (FNR). Another potential turntable for the exchange of electrons is the diaphorase part of the NiFe-hydrogenase in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, which was recently shown to shuttle electrons between NAD(P)H, flavodoxin and several ferredoxins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In order to get a complete picture of the ferredoxin network and potential interaction partners, it would be essential to know the redox potentials of all low abundant ferredoxins in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. Currently, they have been determined for Fx1 (â412 mV), Fx2 (â243 mV), and Fx4 (â440 mV), whereas the value for Fx4 is based on measurements of a homologue in <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bottin and Lagoutte, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schorsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Motomura et al., 2019</xref>). Fx1âFx6 in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> possess 2Fe2S clusters for which redox potentials between â240 and â440 mV are typical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). For 3Fe4S clusters as present in Fx8 (containing one 3Fe4S and one 4Fe4S cluster) redox potentials between â120 and â430 mV were determined and for 4Fe4S clusters as present in Fx7 (4FeFS) and Fx9 (containing two 4Fe4S clusters) redox potentials between â300 and â680 mV were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Our data show that Fx9 is of importance under photomixotrophic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The redox potential of Fx9 in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> has been assumed to be around â420 mV based on its interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cassier-Chauvat and Chauvat, 2014</xref>). However, this value requires experimental validation. Without yet knowing the exact values for all ferredoxins in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, it is obvious that they span a wide range of redox potentials. Our data indicate that cells perform a general shift from utilizing NAD(H)- to ferredoxin-dependent enzymes under highly reducing photomixotrophic conditions.</p><p>The following lines include theoretical reflections based on this observation. However, as these conclusions are not entirely supported by the data, they should be regarded as hypothetical and are meant as thought-provoking impulses.</p><p>The replacement of FeS enzymes and ferredoxins by FeS-free alternatives and NADPH in the course of evolution is in general discussed with regard to the oxygen sensitivity of FeS clusters in connection with the shift from anoxic to oxic conditions on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imlay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould et al., 2019</xref>). Oxygen is without any doubt one important factor. However, the shift from anoxic to oxic conditions went along with a shift from reducing to more oxidizing conditions. This shift was among others achieved by the escape of hydrogen into space, which irreversibly withdrew electrons from Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catling et al., 2001</xref>). The withdrawal of electrons and the establishment of oxidizing conditions might have been an additional important factor (independent of oxygen and the oxygen sensitivity of FeS clusters) that triggered these evolutionary changes by enabling reactions with higher driving forces. The idea is thus that PFOR and ferredoxins might have been replaced by the PDH complex and NADH due to their potential to release larger amounts of Gibbs-free energy (Î<italic>G</italic> &lt; 0). When competing with other organisms for resources an accelerated metabolism can be highly beneficial.</p><p>The decision to either utilize the PDH complex or alternatively PFOR and along this line, the replacement of PFOR by the PDH complex in the course of evolution might have been determined by the prioritization for high chemical driving forces.</p><p>On that note, we were unable to delete the PDH complex in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, which points to its essential role. PFOR is in contrast dispensable under photoautotrophic conditions and cells obviously prefer to decarboxylate pyruvate via the PDH complex under these conditions. By transferring electrons to NAD<sup>+</sup> instead of ferredoxin less Gibbs-free energy is stored. However, this comes along with a higher driving force that is visible when regarding the reaction Gibbs energies of Î<sub>r</sub><italic>G</italic>â²<sup>m</sup> â39 kJ/mol for the reaction catalyzed by the PDH complex versus Î<sub>r</sub><italic>G</italic>â²<sup>m</sup> â23 kJ/mol for the reaction catalyzed by PFOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The idea is thus that the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> pool gets reduced first prioritizing high driving forces. However, as the redox potential of the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> pool turns slowly more negative, it might reach levels that are characteristic for ferredoxin couples. This might provoke a metabolic shift to transfer electrons to oxidized ferredoxin instead of NAD<sup>+</sup> which should come along with lower metabolic rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This idea fits well with the observation, that PFOR and low abundant ferredoxins gain importance in the stationary growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>), which is characterized by a slowing down of metabolic reactions. The shift can be regulated on several levels. Among others, as shown in this study, high NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios can inactivate enzymes that rely on this couple and thereby support the action of isoenzymes that interact with the Fx<sub>red</sub>/Fx<sub>ox</sub> couple instead. In addition, a shift to more reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>), will alter the thermodynamic driving force of many redox reactions, and may in itself necessitate a shift in pathways. In addition, electron turntables as the transhydrogenase, FNR, and the diaphorase can support this shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>By shifting their pools of reducing equivalents, cells are thus able to finetune their metabolism. They either liberate or save Gibbs-free energy and thereby either accelerate or slow down metabolic reactions, as required.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> encounters highly reducing conditions under photomixotrophy in the presence of oxygen. The PDH complex gets inactivated under these conditions at high NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios and is functionally most likely replaced by PFOR. PFOR is stable in the presence of oxygen in vitro and reduces ferredoxin instead of NAD<sup>+</sup>. PFOR, low abundant ferredoxins, and the ferredoxin-dependent GOGAT are required for optimal photomixotrophic growth and performance. Electrons from the oxidation of external glucose furthermore rely upon the presence of photosynthetic complex I (which accepts electrons from ferredoxin) in order to reach PSI.

For large-scale purification cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH = 7.0; 250 mM NaCl; one tablet complete protease inhibitor EDTA free (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) per 50 ml) and broken by passing them through a French Press cell at 1250 p.s.i. twice. Unbroken cells and membranes were pelleted in a Beckman ultracentrifuge using a 70 Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 45 min at 4Â°C. The decanted soluble extract was adjusted to a volume of 90 ml with lysis buffer and incubated with 10 ml TALON cobalt resin (Takara, Shiga, Japan) for 1 hr at 4Â°C. The resin was then washed extensively with 200 ml lysis buffer and subsequently with 100 ml lysis buffer containing 5 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 20 ml elution buffer (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH = 7.0; 250 mM NaCl; 500 mM imidazole). The protein was concentrated overnight to a volume of 2 mL in a Vivaspin 20 Ultrafiltration Unit (5 kDa MWCO)(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and then loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex TM 75 prep grade (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) using 25 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH=7.0; 50 mM NaCl; 5% (v/v) glycerol as the running buffer. The run was monitored at 280 nm and fractions were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Acitivity measurement of PFOR</title><p>The specific activity of the PFOR was measured essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witt et al., 2019</xref>). The activity assay contained in 1 ml 100 mM TrisâHCl (pH 8), 0.5 mM Coenzyme A, 10 mM pyruvate, 5 mM thiamine pyrophosphate, 40 mM glucose, 40 U glucose oxidase, 50 U catalase, and 10 mM methyl viologen. The reduction of methylviologen was followed at 604 nm and an extinction coefficient of 13.6 mM/cm was used. The reaction was started by adding 8.9 Ã 10<sup>â5</sup> M isolated PFOR.</p><p>We also tested ferredoxin reduction by the PFOR by a mixture containing the same substances as above except methyl viologen. To this mixture 1.6 mM ferredoxin 1 and 1.3 mM ferredoxin:NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase and 1 mM NADP<sup>+</sup> were added. In this case, the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> was followed at 340 nm. The same mixture without glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase were used to test if the enzyme also works in the presence of oxygen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>In vivo electron flow through PSI</title><p>The electron flux through PSI was measured by the Dual-KLAS/NIR (Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) by a newly developed method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theune et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, cell suspensions were adjusted to 20 Âµg/ml chlorophyll and 20 ÂµM DCMU was added. Electron flow through PSI was determined by dark-interval relaxation kinetics (DIRK) measurements at a light intensity of 168 ÂµE/m<sup>2</sup>/s in the absence and presence of 10 mM glucose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Determination of reaction Gibbs energies</title><p>Î<sub>r</sub><italic>G</italic>â²<sup>m</sup> for the reaction catalyzed by the PDH complex and by PFOR was calculated using eQuilibrator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eauilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/">http://eauilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/</ext-link>) according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noor et al., 2013</xref>. CO<sub>2</sub> (total) was considered as hydrated and dehydrated forms of CO<sub>2</sub> are considered to be in equilibrium in biochemical reactions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel C Ducat (Reviewer #1); Robert Burnap (Reviewer #2); Wolfgang Nitschke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work demonstrates that PFOR-mediated decarboxylation of pyruvate replaces the (more canonical) PDH-based pathway cells of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 are shifted from photoautotrophic to photomixotrophic growth conditions. The reviewers recognized the novelty and potential importance of the work, in particular on the implications for the evolution of different enzymes and metabolic pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.</p><p>1. On the other hand, all of the reviewers had similar criticisms that the text was greatly over-interpreted the results, while ignoring some possible alternative interpretations, and needs to be extensively rewritten. There needs to be a complete overhaul of both the Introduction and Discussion to address the points made by the reviewers.</p><p>2. Multiple reviewers specifically cited problems with the data in Figure S4, which appeared unconvincing or even contradictory to the stated interpretation. At the very least, this issue needs to be addressed in the text, if not in the data itself.</p><p>3. Most of the results are based on growth data, but was interpretated in the context of cellular redox states. It was disappointing that the efforts to probe cellular redox states were not very strong, as described by Reviewer 1, weakening the arguments (see below).</p><p>4. The consensus of the reviewers was that such measurements would greatly strengthen the paper. Alternatively, it may be possible to modify the text to reflect the alternative models and potential ambiguities inherent in the approach.</p><p>5. A major component of the proposed model is that PFOR is specifically active highly aerobic conditions, but this claim is never directly tested, and evidence from simple deletion mutant without tested for redox states activity does not fully test this possibility, see comments by Reviewer 2.</p><p>6. Further, the data was interpreted in the context of redox state, but as Reviewer 3 points out, the available thermodynamic driving force should be very different under the different growth conditions, and may in itself necessitate a shift in pathway, Thus, the results can be reasonably interpreted without the need to involve &quot;inactivation&quot; of enzymes. This, or course, could be settled by enzymatic assays and redox probes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Most of my comments are already present in the public review. However, the authors should seriously consider making measurements of cells in vivo where they're tracking pyridine nucleotide (blue-green) fluorescence. Such measurements are primarily tracking and NADPH rather than NADH, nevertheless it could prove very informative regarding the ability for the cells to assimilate photosynthetic reductant as the light comes on. Such measurements can be performed using a PAM fluorometer, for example, with the appropriate attachments. Also, contemporaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence can provide valuable information on linear and cyclic photosynthetic electron flow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I very much like the performed experiments and find that they are well-planned, professionally performed and that they provide solid evidence for the discussed switch of pathways. However, I feel that the discussion is unconvincing in certain places and tries to convey concepts which I would consider doubtful at the least. I will be happy if the authors can prove me wrong.</p><p>â Overly affirmative preconception: on line 46 and also subsequently in the manuscript, you claim that ferredoxins are older than NAD. You base your statement on the observation that ferredoxins are present in all three domains (I think that we have moved on from Woose's royalist kingdoms to the term &quot;domains&quot;;-) of life. Isn't this also true for NAD? You may well be right that FeS-clusters preceeded NAD during life's emergence but so far I don't think that we have any evidence for LUCA lacking NAD. In your scenario NAD would even come in only much later when the environment became more oxidizing.</p><p>Reducing and oxidizing conditions:</p><p>â eg. l 289 ll: it is difficult for me to see how you imagine maintaining reducing conditions in the presence of oxygen (in any setting, cells or in vitro or whatever). Of course, it all depends on what you call reducing â¦ However, in your manuscript, reducing is always connoted with NADH or ferredoxin, so well below the O2/superoxide transition. If you have O2 under such &quot;reducing&quot; conditions and some undefined one-electron compound (e.g. ferredoxins) floating around, they have no choice but reduce O2 to O2.-. It then all depends on who is dominant (in abundancy), the reductant or O2. If it is O2, then you will loose your reducing conditions, if it is the reductant, you will turn anaerobic. So I honestly don't understand what you mean by &quot;reducing conditions in the presence of oxygen&quot;. By contrast, spatial separation (your first alternative) is of course an option.</p><p>â l303 ll: You claim that loss of hydrogen to space will &quot;withdraw electrons and â¦[thereby] â¦ establish oxidizing conditions&quot;. You have reducing conditions if there is an abundance of reductant and oxidizing conditions if you have an abundance of oxidant. Reducing the amount of reductant therefore doesn't take you to oxidizing conditions! On an O2-free planet, the reductants may have been H2, Fe2+, CH4, formate etc and the oxidants CO2, SO42-, Fe3+ and the likes. On line 305 you say that the loss of H2 would lead to higher driving forces. How? You don't add any new (more positive) oxidant, you only take out reductant. Therefore the driving force for any individual electron transfer reaction will stay put while the deltaG of the bulk reaction will even decrease (since you now have lower amounts of reductant).</p><p>â l366 ll: I can see what you want to say on these lines and you are basically correct. However, this is how you would explain the situation to a colleague from the humanities (no condescension intended!). I would hold that in a life science article you can assume that the reader is able to digest the Nernst equation and therefore comprehend that there is a mathematical relationship between the standard (or midpoint) potential at equal amount of oxidized and reduced form of a redox couple and the effective potential at given ratios of ox to red.</p><p>â 370 ll: &quot;slow down the back reaction and speed up the forward reaction&quot;. Ambiguous and potentially wrong. The reaction ks are of course unaffected but mass-action results in shifted equilibrium concentrations of donor and acceptor when deltaE changes.</p><p>â 372 ll: (my main concern regarding the entire manuscript!) You go on the conclude that upon increasing NADH over NAD+ you shift the effective potential more negative. Perfectly correct! Now here is my question: On lines 183 â 198 of the Results section, you hypothesize on an inactivation of PDH via binding of NAD to the E3 subunit. Isn't it enough that you have increasing levels of NADH? (they call this product inhibition) To my mind, the switch from PDH (using NAD+) to PFOR (using Fd) is a thermodynamic necessity since PDH would cease to operate at very high NADH/NAD+ ratios anyway. Oxygenic photosynthesis in general has a problem of redox equilibration: There is an essentially infinite pool of electron donor (water) and a very limited pool of electron acceptor (CO2 to generate biomass). Hence all the regulation and cyclic transfer and overflow valves and what have you. Of course the situation is aggravated when the beasts go photomixotrophic since they are flooded with viciously reducing electrons (without having seen a single photon). Their intracellular redox poise will rapidly go to red alert reducing (NB: life needs electron transfer from red to ox to make ATP on the way; when all gets reduced through, doom looms!). Which brings me to my final question: Have you checked that your photomixotrophic cultures don't produced H2 by any chance? Channeling electrons through PFOR into the Fd pool would potentially open up the way to hydrogenase and thereby help getting rid of excess reducing equivalents via the emergency valve &quot;proton reduction&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71339.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work demonstrates that PFOR-mediated decarboxylation of pyruvate replaces the (more canonical) PDH-based pathway cells of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Multiple reviewers specifically cited problems with the data in Figure S4, which appeared unconvincing or even contradictory to the stated interpretation. At the very least, this issue needs to be addressed in the text, if not in the data itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that data from Figure S4 (kinase mutants) as well as data concerning the phosphorylation of the PDH complex are not convincing. We were uncertain from the very beginning if it would be a good idea to include these data sets and having this in mind discussed the data very cautiously. However, these data are not really required for the statement of our manuscript, as the enzymatic tests on the E3 subunit of the PDH complex at different NADH concentration convincingly show, that the PDH complex gets inhibited at high NADH levels. Therefore, we now decided to take these data sets (kinase mutants Figure S4 and phosphorylation of the PDH complex) out of the manuscript. We thank the reviewers for their criticism as we feel that the manuscript improved and is more focused now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Thank you very much. We agree with this criticism and now addressed it by including in vivo measurements of the redox state of NAD(P) and ferredoxin. The presented results strongly support our original interpretation that the redox state is more reduced under photomixotrophic conditions compared to photoautotrophic conditions (see new Figure 1 âfigure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

A major component of the proposed model is that PFOR is specifically active highly aerobic conditions, but this claim is never directly tested, and evidence from simple deletion mutant without tested for redox states activity does not fully test this possibility, see comments by Reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree that direct testing of the PFOR under different conditions and oxygen concentrations would be much more convincing. Such tests have been unsuccessful in our hands for the cyanobacterial enzyme until now. It can be very difficult to detect activity in the presence of oxygen in vitro for redox enzymes, as there might be mechanisms inside the cell that continuously reactivate the enzyme upon inactivation. This is e.g. known for FeFe-hydrogenases that are irreversibly inactivated by oxygen in vitro but stay active or can be reactivated in vivo. The mimic of such reactivation was not accomplished in vitro, yet. Therefore, for the time being we are unfortunately unable to provide further evidence. However, we think that our collected data strongly indicates that PFOR is an important enzyme also under aerobic conditions and discuss the presented evidence with appropriate caution. In addition, animated by suggestions of the reviewers we found a recent report on an <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant, in which PFOR contributes to the metabolic stationary phase of aerobic cultures even though the enzyme requires anaerobic conditions in the in vitro test (1, 2). This report is now mentioned in the introduction and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

This, or course, could be settled by enzymatic assays and redox probes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the point raised by Reviewer 3. Our data show that high NADH levels inactivate the PDH complex. However, this does not rule out that the general shift to more reducing conditions as shown by our new measurements (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 4), which will change the thermodynamic driving force of redox reactions, in itself necessitates shifts in pathways and might be e.g. valid for the shift between the importance of N-GOGAT relative to F-GOGAT. Both mechanisms might be of importance. This point was added in line 363 of the discussion.</p><p>âIn addition, a shift to more reducing conditions (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 4), will alter the thermodynamic driving force of many redox reactions, and may in itself necessitate a shift in pathways.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Most of my comments are already present in the public review.

As already stated, the NAD(P)H-module of the PAM does not distinguish NADPH and NADH. However, using this device we now show that NAD(P)H is more strongly reduced under photomixotrophy.

The point we wanted to make was rather, that NAD gained importance over oxygen sensitive ferredoxins during the evolution from an anaerobic to an aerobic metabolism as also stated by Gould et al., 2019 (6). In order to be more precise, we now stressed that NAD(P)H gained importance to make sure that it was as well present already.</p><p>Accordingly, we changed the former sentence âIn addition, ferredoxins have in general been complemented or replaced by NAD(P)H as alternative, oxygen-insensitive reducing agents in aerobesâ in line 80 to: âIn addition, NAD(P)H has gained importance as alternative, oxygen-insensitive reducing agent in aerobes and thereby complemented or replaced oxygen sensitive ferredoxins, that are useful for anaerobes.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reducing and oxidizing conditions:</p><p>â eg. l 289 ll: it is difficult for me to see how you imagine maintaining reducing conditions in the presence of oxygen (in any setting, cells or in vitro or whatever).

On line 305 you say that the loss of H2 would lead to higher driving forces. How? You don't add any new (more positive) oxidant, you only take out reductant. Therefore the driving force for any individual electron transfer reaction will stay put while the deltaG of the bulk reaction will even decrease (since you now have lower amounts of reductant).</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed think that the loss of hydrogen established oxidizing conditions. The oxidant was present by water splitting at PSII and the evolution of oxygen. However, the accumulation of oxygen was only possible due to the loss of reductant (H2 into space on the one hand and burial of reduced carbon on the other hand). Without this loss of reductant, respiration would have consumed all the oxygen quickly and nothing would have changed. However, by the withdrawal of H2 and reduced carbon from the equation, oxygen could accumulate. Which means that the high abundance of oxidant (O2) indeed required the removal of reductant (H2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â l366 ll: I can see what you want to say on these lines and you are basically correct. However, this is how you would explain the situation to a colleague from the humanities (no condescension intended!). I would hold that in a life science article you can assume that the reader is able to digest the Nernst equation and therefore comprehend that there is a mathematical relationship between the standard (or midpoint) potential at equal amount of oxidized and reduced form of a redox couple and the effective potential at given ratios of ox to red.</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted this paragraph as suggested, when we rewrote and overhauled the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â 370 ll: &quot;slow down the back reaction and speed up the forward reaction&quot;. Ambiguous and potentially wrong. The reaction ks are of course unaffected but mass-action results in shifted equilibrium concentrations of donor and acceptor when deltaE changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this statement. However, we think that our text was not clear enough as there might to be a misunderstanding. The point we wanted to make is related to a shift from using ferredoxin instead of NAD<sup>+</sup> as a redox acceptor. In this case reaction ks are affected and deltaE decreases. This might not have been clear enough. However, as we rewrote and completely overhauled the discussion as suggested, these sentences were deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â 372 ll: (my main concern regarding the entire manuscript!) You go on the conclude that upon increasing NADH over NAD+ you shift the effective potential more negative. Perfectly correct! Now here is my question: On lines 183 â 198 of the Results section, you hypothesize on an inactivation of PDH via binding of NAD to the E3 subunit. Isn't it enough that you have increasing levels of NADH? (they call this product inhibition) To my mind, the switch from PDH (using NAD+) to PFOR (using Fd) is a thermodynamic necessity since PDH would cease to operate at very high NADH/NAD+ ratios anyway.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic> an alteration in a single amino acid of the E3 subunit of the PDH complex reduced the sensitivity of the PDH complex to inhibition via NADH and allowed decarboxylation of pyruvate at high NADH levels (9). The respective amino acid was not part of the binding pocket for NAD<sup>+</sup>. The mechanisms is thus not a simple product inhibition. NADH seems to have a regulatory function here and seems to bind as a regulator at a site that does not belong to the active site of the enzyme. The enzyme activity measurements that we did with the E3 subunit of Synechocystis at different NADH concentration does not allow to determine if NADH inhibited the enzyme in a regulatory manner or in the manner of classical product inhibition. We therefore left this point open.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Oxygenic photosynthesis in general has a problem of redox equilibration: There is an essentially infinite pool of electron donor (water) and a very limited pool of electron acceptor (CO2 to generate biomass). Hence all the regulation and cyclic transfer and overflow valves and what have you. Of course the situation is aggravated when the beasts go photomixotrophic since they are flooded with viciously reducing electrons (without having seen a single photon). Their intracellular redox poise will rapidly go to red alert reducing (NB: life needs electron transfer from red to ox to make ATP on the way; when all gets reduced through, doom looms!). Which brings me to my final question: Have you checked that your photomixotrophic cultures don't produced H2 by any chance? Channeling electrons through PFOR into the Fd pool would potentially open up the way to hydrogenase and thereby help getting rid of excess reducing equivalents via the emergency valve &quot;proton reduction&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we checked the cultures for hydrogen production, but we could not detect any. The hydrogenase is very likely not able to produce hydrogen due to the presence of oxygen. A valve to get rid of excess reducing equivalents that the cells use under photomixotrophic conditions is e.g. to enhance their glycogen levels.</p><p>References</p><p>1. S.
