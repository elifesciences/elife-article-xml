Acetyl-CoA stimulates cell growth under nutrient-limiting conditions, but how cells generate acetyl-CoA under starvation stress is less understood. Here, we show that general stress response factors, Msn2 and Msn4, function as master transcriptional regulators of yeast glycolysis via directly binding and activating genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. Yeast cells lacking Msn2 and Msn4 exhibit prevalent repression of glycolytic genes and a significant delay of acetyl-CoA accumulation and reentry into growth from quiescence. Thus Msn2/4 exhibit a dual role in activating carbohydrate metabolism genes and stress response genes. These results suggest a possible mechanism by which starvation-induced stress response factors may prime quiescent cells to reenter growth through glycolysis when nutrients are limited.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Msn2</kwd><kwd>Msn4</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>stress response transcription factor</kwd><kwd>quiescence to growth</kwd><kwd>acetyl-CoA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54GM103520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Boeke</surname><given-names>Jef D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG006841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Hongkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG006282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Hongkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>General stress response factors Msn2 and Msn4 activate glycolytic genes and promote acetyl-CoA accumulation to stimulate growth and proliferation of yeast cells under a nutrient-limiting condition, suggesting the unexpected interrelationship between carbohydrate metabolism and stress response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell growth and proliferation are actively coordinated with extrinsic nutrient availability and intrinsic metabolic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Broach, 2012</xref>). When nutrients are limited, cells enter into quiescent states to enhance survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 2004</xref>). Repletion of nutrients stimulates quiescent cells back into growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dechant and Peter, 2008</xref>). Gene expression and metabolite profiles are dramatically remodeled during the transitions between quiescence and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klosinska et al., 2011</xref>). Many transcription factors (TFs), enzymes and metabolites have been shown to regulate the transitions. However, gaps remain in understanding the crosstalk between transcriptional and metabolic activities during the transitions and the mechanisms by which cells make the decision.</p><p>Here, we exploited the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) to study how transcriptionally regulated metabolism impacts cell growth program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tu et al., 2007</xref>). In the YMC, cells are synchronized and exhibit respiratory oscillations under continuous, glucose-limited condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thousands of transcripts and hundreds of metabolites are cycling as a function of the oxygen consumption oscillations, which divides the YMC into three phases: oxidative (OX), reductive building (RB) and reductive charging (RC). In the OX phase, respiration peaks and growth genes including ribosomal and amino acid biosynthetic genes are activated. Cell division occurs in the RB phase and cell cycle genes and mitochondrion genes are expressed. The RC phase is associated with minimal respiration and genes associated with stress/survival responses, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation are up-regulated. OX and RB phases can be likened to the growth and proliferation phases based on the burst of respiration and protein synthesis, visualized cell division and the transcriptional and metabolic signatures. RC phase cells exhibit stationary and quiescent characteristics including increased cell density, accumulation of storage carbohydrates glycogen and trehalose and expression of stationary specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shi et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the YMC can be viewed as consecutive alternations of growth, proliferation and quiescent phases. By exploring the oscillations of transcription and metabolites, we may understand the mechanisms through which the cells switch the growth programs. Acetyl-CoA has been shown to drive the transition from RC/quiescence to OX/growth and RB/proliferation phase via the acetylation of histones at growth genes and G1 cyclin CLN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shi and Tu, 2013</xref>). The role of promoting growth and proliferation by acetyl-CoA has further been shown in various mammalian systems including embryonic stem cells and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comerford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moussaieff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sutendra et al., 2014</xref>). However, how yeast cells accumulate acetyl-CoA in the quiescent phase to reach the critical level for growth is unclear.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29938.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DynaMO analysis in YMC identifies key TFs driving YMC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Respiratory oscillations (dissolved O2 concentration) of prototrophic yeast strain under continuous nutrient limited condition with a period of 4 ~ 5 hr.

Briefly, we grouped predicted binding sites for all TFs with similar dynamic binding patterns and for each pair of TF and binding pattern, we examined whether binding sites of the TF are enriched in the cluster/phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We identified 41 TFs that were specifically linked to each of the three phases in the YMC. We focused on two homologous TFs linked to the RC/quiescent phase, Msn2 and Msn4. They are known to regulate the general stress response in budding yeast, including starvation, thermal, osmotic and oxidative stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Estruch and Carlson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estruch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmitt and McEntee, 1996</xref>). Deleting the two TFs caused a striking delay of transition from RC/quiescence to OX/growth phase in the YMC and slow accumulation of acetyl-CoA. Transcriptomic and cistromic analyses revealed that Msn2/4 control the expression of glycolytic pathway, which may promote the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and re-entry into growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DynaMO identifies TFs associated with specific phases of the YMC</title><p>Histone modification marks transcription regulatory regions and the intensity and dynamic nature of some modifications, such as H3K9ac correlates strongly with transcription activity. Therefore, we can predict TF binding sites by ‘foraging’ for TF consensus sequences associated with histone modification peaks and then predict the temporal activities at these binding sites in a highly dynamic process like the YMC. We can also identify important TFs associated with specific dynamic programs by enrichment analysis. The functionality has been incorporated in a computational tool, DynaMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>). We used the previously generated 16 time point H3K9ac ChIP-seq data across one round of the YMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuang et al., 2014</xref>) to predict the binding activities of 175 yeast TFs. Three temporal binding patterns were captured, consistent with the three metabolic phases of the YMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). 41 TFs were identified with their binding sites specifically enriched in one of the three phases, which were thus considered to be candidate regulators of those specific phases. Target genes of each TF were predicted and TFs were clustered by the similarity of targets between pairs of TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). GO term analysis of predicted targets genes of the 41 TFs reveals similar target specificities among TFs from the same clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In general, the functions of these candidate TFs were consistent with the transcriptional diagram in each phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>), such as ribosome biogenesis TFs Rap1 and Sfp1 enriched in cluster 1 (OX/growth), cell cycle TFs Mbp1 and Swi6 enriched in cluster 2 (RB/proliferation), and stress response TFs Msn2 and Msn4 enriched in cluster 3 (RC/quiescence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Validation experiments performed by mutating individual TFs also show a significantly higher frequency of disrupted YMC oscillation (as measured by O<sub>2</sub> consumption) in the candidate TFs (Arg80, Gcr1, Xbp1, Msn2, Msn4) than in control randomly selected TFs (Skn7, Arg81, Oaf1, Cin5, Ume6). (Various phenotypic defects were observed; the details can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>) This indicates that we have a list of candidate TFs that help drive the YMC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Msn2/4 function in the RC phase to control the transition from the RC/quiescent state to the OX/growth state</title><p>From the validation experiments, we observed a very unusual and specific ‘lengthened RC phase’ phenotype in the <italic>msn2Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The RC phase is longer than that in the WT strain and it gets longer after each cycle. <italic>msn2Δmsn4Δ</italic> showed a more severe defect than <italic>msn2Δ</italic> whereas <italic>msn4Δ</italic> was relatively normal, in support of partial functional redundancy in this instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estruch, 2000</xref>). This may be consistent with previous observations that some genes are completely turned off in the <italic>msn2Δ</italic> single mutant while other genes show reduced expression in the <italic>msn2Δ</italic> single mutant and are completely eliminated in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estruch, 2000</xref>). The timing of the OX/growth and RB/proliferation phases is normal in the mutants but the RC/quiescence phase is seemingly ever-lengthening, as though the cells await an ever-diminishing signal to proceed. Thus, the prolonged RC phase phenotype observed for <italic>MSN2</italic> and <italic>MSN4</italic> mutants can also be viewed as a delayed transition from RC to OX.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29938.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Msn2 and Msn4 regulate the length of RC/quiescence phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Oscillation defects in msn2Δ, msn4Δ and msn2Δmsn4Δ mutants.

First, many stress response genes known to be the targets of Msn2/4 are activated in the RC phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmitt and McEntee, 1996</xref>). Second, Msn2/Msn4 motif sites were enriched in the predicted RC phase binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, cluster 3). To test this hypothesis, we examined gene expression data for the YMC from the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuang et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>MSN4</italic> mRNA level is increased in the RC phase while <italic>MSN2</italic> mRNA level is relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is in line with previous findings that <italic>MSN4</italic> expression is activated by stress but <italic>MSN2</italic> is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). TFs function by binding to the promoters and enhancers of target genes so we performed time-course ChIP-seq of Msn2 and Msn4 across one YMC. Both TFs showed increased binding to the genome in the RC/quiescence phase regionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Msn2 and Msn4 shared a significant proportion of binding sites and target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">2</xref>), supporting their largely redundant functions. Among the targets of Msn2 and Msn4, we observed a substantial proportion of genes expressed in the RC phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), further supporting the hypothesis that Msn2/4 function in RC phase. Additionally, Msn2/4 target genes are enriched in classes of carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that Msn2/4 may function through remodeling the metabolic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Msn2/4 regulate expression of the glycolytic pathway and accumulation of acetyl-CoA</title><p>Next we investigated how Msn2 and Msn4 control the transition from RC/quiescent state to OX/growth state. We hypothesized that two types of signals may regulate this transition, stimulating signals such as nutrient and inhibitory signals such as stress and damage. Cai <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2011</xref>) showed that adding acetate in the RC phase can directly induce an OX phase and they found that acetyl-CoA is the key metabolite that initiates cell growth and proliferation by promoting histone acetylation at growth genes. Acetyl-CoA is low at the beginning of RC phase and it is accumulated during the RC phase. When it reaches a threshold, it initiates the cell growth program. We asked whether acetate could induce an OX/growth phase in the RC/quiescence phase of a <italic>msn2Δ</italic> mutant. Although the RC phase is much longer in the mutant than that in the WT, acetate still stimulated the OX phase efficiently no matter when in the RC phase acetate was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with the possibility that acetate or acetyl-CoA represented the limiting factor. Similar results were observed in the <italic>msn2Δmsn4Δ</italic> double mutant. The observations suggested that Msn2 and Msn4 might be involved in nutrient signaling, perhaps based on the accumulating intracellular acetyl-CoA level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29938.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Msn2 and Msn4 regulate accumulation of acetyl-CoA through glycolysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Acetate addition immediately induces OX phase.

DynaMO prediction analysis indicated that 20 of the 33 genes encoding glycolytic enzymes were predicted to be bound by Msn2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and the number of predicted binding sites was significantly higher than the number of sites from random sets of genes (p&lt;1×10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

The coding regions of glycolytic genes are more conserved than the coding regions of other genes and the promoter regions of glycolytic genes in <italic>Saccaromyces</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

On the other hand, only 2 of 11 genes encoding enzymes in fatty acid oxidation were bound by Msn2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To further challenge the hypothesis that Msn2/4 regulate the level of acetyl-CoA through glycolysis, we examined the dynamics of mRNA levels of glycolytic genes in WT and <italic>msn2Δmsn4Δ</italic> double mutant by RT-qPCR. These genes were highly induced in the WT cells during the RC phase but were surprisingly dramatically reduced in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Collectively, the results suggest that Msn2 and Msn4 control the transition from RC/quiescent state to OX/growth state by regulating the intracellular level of acetyl-CoA through glycolysis. Although we lack direct evidence for which intracellular pool of acetyl-CoA is regulated by Msn2/4, the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which functions in mitochondria, was not targeted by Msn2/4, whereas multiple cytosolic enzymes were targeted by Msn2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the nucleo-cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA might be specifically regulated. It is also consistent with two other lines of previously obtained evidence: (1) that acetate, ethanol and acetaldehyde can induce the transition from RC to OX and (2) that histone acetylation is dramatically increased during such transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2011</xref>).

The three clusters of gene expression patterns were still observed in the mutant cells. However, many RC genes were clearly down-regulated. Next, we identified 366 genes up-regulated and 426 genes down-regulated in mutant compared to WT cells at comparable time points. Whereas the 366 up-regulated genes were relatively equally distributed among OX, RB, RC and non-cycling groups, the majority (62.2%) of the 426 down-regulated genes were RC phase genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). For both up-regulated and down-regulated genes, the changes were primarily observed in the RC phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the subsequent analyses, we focused on the down-regulated genes. Among these genes, we found significant enrichment of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and response to various stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and the GO terms were very similar to those detected by ChIP-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). <italic>FAA1</italic> and <italic>POX1</italic>, which are directly involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and bound by Msn2/4, did not show significant changes of mRNA level in the mutant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).

The timing of Msn2/4 binding is consistent with their activating function for target RC phase genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Carbohydrate metabolism genes and stress response genes are the two major classes in the core Msn2/4 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As shown previously, many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, such as <italic>HXK1, GLK1, ENO1, ENO2, PGK1, GPM1, TDH1</italic> and <italic>TDH3</italic> are core Msn2/4 targets. Heat-shock protein genes such as <italic>HSP12, HSP26, HSP78 and HSP82</italic>, oxidative stress response genes including <italic>CTT1, PRX1, SOD1, SOD2</italic> are also core Msn2/4 targets. Certain metabolic genes are also already annotated as stress response genes. For example, <italic>TPS2</italic> and <italic>GAC1</italic>, which are involved in the synthesis of trehalose and glycogen, two storage carbohydrates, are important for stress response. Interestingly, trehalose and glycogen have also been shown to be metabolized during the exit of quiescence to fuel the regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Silljé et al., 1999</xref>). Msn2/4 may also facilitate these processes by activating <italic>NTH1</italic>, <italic>ATH1</italic>, <italic>GPH1</italic>, <italic>PGM1</italic> and <italic>PGM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, the regulatory network for Msn2/4 suggests parallel mechanisms for how yeast responds to limited nutrients. Stress response genes are activated to maintain survival by removing detrimental factors like mis-folded proteins and oxygen radicals and improving defenses. Carbohydrate metabolism genes are also activated so that cells can utilize the very limited nutrients in the environment for growth, as may often be the case in recovery from quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Systematic comparison between YMC and distinct quiescent states</title><p>Given that Msn2/4 are involved in the transition from quiescence to growth, we next attempted to characterize the quiescent (RC) state of YMC by comparing it with multiple previously defined quiescent states, including starvation and limitation of one of the three essential nutrients, glucose, nitrogen or phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klosinska et al., 2011</xref>). We examined the transcription of cycling genes in the YMC and nutrient-scarce conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The majority of the OX/growth genes, which function in biomass synthesis, are turned off when nutrients are scarce, as are the cell cycle genes which peak in the RB/proliferation phase. Interestingly, mitochondrial genes, which also peak in the RB phase, are relatively elevated upon nutrient scarcity. Genes encoding mitochondrial ribosome components are induced temporally at the beginning of glucose starvation or phosphate limitation but not under other conditions while genes encoding translation factors are activated modestly across all nutrient scarce conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It will be interesting to explore the function of mitochondrial genes when nutrients are scarce. Not surprisingly, most RC genes are induced under nutrient scarce conditions too, reflecting the similarity between the RC phase and other quiescent states. We specifically examined genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, most of which are expressed in the RC phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The majority of these genes are also turned on under nutrient starvation or limitation conditions, suggesting a signal importance of in quiescent states. Details of the comparison are in the supplemental information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we applied DynaMO analysis to the YMC, which led us to explore the function of two TFs, Msn2 and Msn4, in regulating the transition from a RC/quiescent state to an OX/growth state. Most previous studies on Msn2/4 were performed under various stress conditions such as starvation, heat shock, osmotic and oxidative stresses and used cell viability as readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Estruch and Carlson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estruch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmitt and McEntee, 1996</xref>). Although colony formation can be seen as a single round of regrowth, many details such as regrowth dynamics were ignored in such assays. In the YMC, in which nutrient is continuously limited, growth, proliferation and quiescence are temporally separated, providing a platform for mechanistic exploration of transitions between distinct cellular states. The unusual ‘lengthened RC phase’ phenotype in <italic>MSN2</italic> and <italic>MSN4</italic> mutants is consistent with a transcriptional program in the quiescent phase which could be critical for subsequent cell proliferation. Our analyses suggest that Msn2/4 modulate the cellular programs by changing the intracellular acetyl-CoA levels, probably by promoting glycolysis. Metabolism has strong effects on cell growth and proliferation. Metabolites such as acetyl-CoA have been shown to function not only as building blocks for the synthesis of fatty acids, amino acids and nucleotides, but also as signals for gene expression and enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lyssiotis and Cantley, 2014</xref>). Acetyl-CoA has been proposed as a central metabolite that regulates cellular growth program from yeast to cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comerford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mashimo et al., 2014</xref>). Does a transcriptional program exist to control the acetyl-CoA level? Our analyses offer evidence that in budding yeast, transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, well known as stress response factors, function as key transcription factors that activate genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. By controlling expression of these enzymes, Msn2/4 may support the generation of acetyl-CoA in preparation for cell growth and proliferation. This regulatory mode is not obvious when cells are grown in rich medium, probably because acetyl-CoA level is high enough to support continuous growth. But it becomes extremely important when cells are under nutrient-limited condition. Supposedly, nutrient limitation is sensed by TOR signaling and inhibition of TORC1 leads to nuclear translocation and activation of Msn2/4 and other stress response TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck and Hall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). That probably explains why many stress response TFs, such as Gis1, Mig1/2/3, and Msn2/4, that target metabolic enzymes were identified in the RC/quiescent phase of YMC by DynaMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, this study seemingly uncover a critically important secondary mechanism for stress response – in the quiescent state, remodeling metabolic activities and activating stress responses and defenses pathways to maintain survival, and then enabling rapidly regrowth once nutrients are replenished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ho and Gasch, 2015</xref>). It will be interesting to examine whether deletion of any of these TFs show similar effects on YMC and whether and how these TFs collaborate with each other in regulating the key metabolic genes and metabolites for recovery from quiescence.</p><p>Msn2/4-dependent glycolysis potentially provides fuels supporting cell growth under continuous nutrient limited conditions, similar to the situation in cancers, which are also associated with robust glycolysis and survive under nutrient limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comerford et al., 2014</xref>). One speculative hypothesis is that a functional equivalent of Msn2/4 in mammalian cancer is <italic>MYC</italic>, which similarly targets all glycolytic enzymes and fosters tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dang, 2012</xref>).

Antibodies are as following: Msn2 (y-300, sc-33631, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_672215">AB_672215</ext-link>), Msn4 (yE-19, sc-15550, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_672217">AB_672217</ext-link>). Validation is provided on the manufacturer’s website and the antibodies were further tested by western blots of <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>msn2Δ</italic> and <italic>msn4Δ</italic> lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). 2.5 µg primary antibody was used per ChIP experiment. Briefly, cells were first fixed in 1% formaldehyde at 25°C for 15 min and quenched in 125 mM glycine at 25°C for 10 min. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with TBS buffer before freezing. The frozen pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES•KOH pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate (DOC), 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 5 µM pepstatin A, Roche protease inhibitor cocktail) and split into two tubes and lysed by bead beating. Lysate were combined and expanded into 1 ml and sonicated for 16 cycles (30 s on, 1 min off, high output) using a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville, NJ). The supernatant of the sonicated lysate was pre-cleared and incubated with 2.5 µg primary antibodies. After incubation overnight, 50 µl protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, 10003D) were added and incubated for 1.5 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed twice with ChIP lysis buffer, twice with DOC buffer (10 mM Tris•Cl pH 8.0, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA) and twice with TE. 100 µl of TES buffer (TE pH8.0 with 1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol) was added to resuspend the beads at 65°C for 20 min. Reverse crosslinking was performed by incubation for 6 hr at 65°C. An equal volume of TE containing 1.25 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.4 mg/ml glycogen was added to the samples after reverse crosslinking and samples were incubated for 3 hr at 37°C. DNA samples were purified using ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator (ZYMO RESEARCH, D5205, Irvine, CA). Library construction and sequencing were performed using KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPABIOSYSTEMS, KK8502, Wilmington, MA). Briefly, DNA was end repaired and A-tailed. Barcoded adaptors were ligated and DNA was purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880, Indianapolis, IN) and amplified by 12–16 cycles. PCR products were gel-extracted and quantified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq platform. Raw reads were mapped to the reference genome (sacCer2) by bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) and peaks were visualized by the CisGenome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ji et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Acetyl-CoA measurement</title><p>Acetyl-CoA was extracted with two methods. For the first method, Na azide was added (10 mM) and 5 OD cells were spun down and lysed in 200 µl of 10% perchloric acid by bead beating. The lysate was spun down and the supernatant was neutralized to pH 6–8 with 3 M K bicarbonate, with vortexing and cooling on ice for 5 min. K bicarbonate was spun down and supernatants were used. For the second method, 5 OD cells were resuspended in 4 mL Quenching Solution M (60% methanol, 10 mM Tricine pH7.4) and incubated at −40°C for 5 min. The cells were spin at 1000 g for 3 min at −10°C and washed once with Quenching Solution M. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL Extraction Buffer M (75% ethanol, 0.5 mM Tricine pH 7.4) and incubated at 80°C for 3 min. Mix was cooled on ice for 5 min and spun down. Supernatants were dried down in speedvac and dissolved in 30 µl water.

We then counted the numbers of overlapping Msn2 and Msn4 total or time-specific peaks and displayed in venn diagrams. To identify Msn2 and Msn4 target genes, we took the region of a gene from 700 bp upstream of the start codon to the stop codon and examined if the gene region overlapped a Msn2 or Msn4 peak. These genes were candidate targets. Candidate targets that are differentially expressed between WT and msn2msn4 mutant are declared as core target genes (see below). Gene ontology analysis was performed based on the SGD (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004694">SCR_004694</ext-link>) annotation file (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org">http://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>/download-data/curation#.UQFqKhyLFXY) with Fisher exact test.

Read counts per gene was measured in R using the ‘CountOverlaps’ function. Differential expressed genes were identified using DESeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) package. We first compared pairs of WT mutant samples as follows: WT1-Mut1, WT2-Mut2, WT3-Mut3, WT4-Mut4, WT5-Mut5, WT6-Mut6, WT7-Mut7, WT4-Mut8, WT5-Mut9, WT6-Mut10, WT7-Mut11. In the first seven comparisons, we matched samples at the same absolute time in YMC. In the next four comparisons, we matched samples at the same relative time in the RC phase of YMC. For each pair, genes with adjusted p value less than 0.01 were identified as differentially expressed genes. We then compared the 5 WT samples in RC phase to the nine mutant samples in RC phase. Differentiated expressed genes from all above comparisons were grouped together as up- and down- regulated genes. Genes that were bound by Msn2/4 and showed differential expression in mutant cells were defined as ‘core’ targets. GO analysis was performed same as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Motif site enrichment analysis</title><p>To examine the enrichment of Msn2 and Msn4 motif sites in different processes, yeast genes were extended by 1000 bp upstream from the start codon. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and galactose metabolism genes were selected based on SGD annotation and previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tu et al., 2005</xref>). We examined total motif sites (T), predicted binding sites (Predicted) and motif sites overlapping TF ChIP-seq binding peaks. Numbers of total motif sites, predicted and ChIP-seq identified TF-bound motif sites were calculated in the gene regions of interested pathways and scrambled gene sets. To get scrambled gene sets, we randomly chose the same number of genes from the genome 100 times and examined if motif sites were located within the regions of these genes. To evaluate the distribution of Msn2 and Msn4 motif sites in human glycolytic genes, we first detected motif sites in hg19 genome using the yeast Msn2/4 motif sequences with CisGenome. We then identified the human homologs of yeast glycolysis genes using the BioMart tool from Ensembl and extended the gene regions by 20,000 bp upstream from the transcription start sites. Similarly, total motif sites or those overlapping with DNase I hypersensitive regions were examined in these genes and random selected genes. The human DNase-seq data for 57 cell types were downloaded from the ENCODE project through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase.">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase.</ext-link> Then, the whole genome (chromosome Y excluded) was separated by 200 base pair bins (i.e. genomic loci). Bins with read counts larger than 10,000 in one or more cell types (abnormal loci) and bins with read counts smaller than 10 in all cell types (noisy loci) were excluded. After filtering, 1,108,603 genomic loci with unambiguous DNase-seq signal in at least one cell type were retained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Conservation analysis</title><p>PhastCons scores for multiple alignments of the yeast strains to the Saccaromyces cerevisiae genome are downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer2/phastCons7way/.">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer2/phastCons7way/.</ext-link> Six strains were used for alignment, <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces castelli</italic>, and <italic>Saccharomyces kluyveri</italic>.

Gene expression data in nutrient quiescence conditions and YMC were merged and displayed in a heat map. Mitochondrial genes in the RB phase were selected by intersecting RB phase genes and gene annotated as ‘Mitochondrion’ by SGD. Numbers of nutrient-specific genes and genes required for nutrient starvation intersected with OX, RB and RC phase genes were counted and enrichment levels were evaluated by Fisher exact tests. Adjusted p values were displayed in heatmap. Expression levels of nutrient-specific genes in YMC were examined by evaluating the max FPKMs across 16 time points of YMC.

Your submission has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>This paper analyzes the role of the general stress-response master regulators, MSN2 and MSN4 in controlling the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). Based on the results, the authors conclude that the two factors regulate key transition in this cycle by regulating the accumulation of acetyl-CoA.</p><p>As you will see below, all three reviewers appreciated your study in providing interesting new data concerning the regulation of the metabolic cycle. However, there was also a serious concern about your claim of direct relationship between Msn2/4 regulation and acetyl-CoA pool levels (and production of this metabolite). Two of the reviewers were more supportive of this conjecture, yet even these reviewers requested that you will further validate your claims by analyzing the consequences of MSN2,4 over-expression, either transiently or by using a constitutive system</p><p>The third reviewer, who is a metabolic expert, maintained that you should focus your study on the role of Msn2/4 in the shift between fermentation and respiration, and remove the claim about direct relationship between Msn2/4 regulation and acetyl-CoA pools. I would like to emphasize that since this reviewer is an expert in metabolism, we will not be accept the paper unless he/she accepts the arguments and claims presented.</p><p>In addition, all three reviewers requested that you better discuss previous studies, and in particular refer to previous work on carbohydrate metabolism during nutrient deprivation.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Kuang and co-authors showed that the general stress responsive factors Msn2 and Msn4 play an important role in driving yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). They further revealed that it is through controlling the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and the same mechanism might generally contribute to cell growth regulation under prolonged nutrient limiting conditions.</p><p>I find this paper interesting in that (1) the effect of <italic>msn2/4</italic> deletion to the progression of YMC is striking! (2) the proposed mechanism is based on careful genome-wide analysis and is convincing. (3) the potential relevance to cell growth regulation in general is intriguing. Therefore, I recommend the acceptance of this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> provided the authors are able to address the major points below.</p><p>1) The conclusions are based primarily on loss of function mutant phenotypes (<italic>msn2/4</italic> deletion) and the correlation analysis between metabolic enzyme expression or Msn2/4 genomic occupancy with YMC phases. It would significantly strengthen the paper if the authors can show some gain-of-function effects. For example, how does Msn2/4 overexpression affect YMC and the growth transition in general? This is especially important because most people in the field believe that activated Msn2/4 slow down cell growth.</p><p>2) Msn2 and Msn4 are activated by dephosphorylation and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, therefore nuclear localization can serve as a reporter for Msn2/4 activity. In the paper, the authors only monitored the expression changes during YMC. It would serve as the direct supportive evidence for Msn2/4 activation if the authors can observe nuclear localization of Msn2/4 specifically during the RC phase. And if so, what would be the authors' speculation on the mechanisms of Msn2/4 activation? This will provide some clues on why Msn2/4 are activated specifically during the RC phase.</p><p>3) The authors claim that Msn2/4 have a dual role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism genes and stress resistance genes. Under the conditions that they are focusing on (prolonged nutrient-limited condition), do the stress resistance genes also contribute to cell growth or they are unrelated by-products? An analysis or at least a discussion on this would be helpful.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper describes analysis of how the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 regulates expression of genes encoding enzymes of the central carbon metabolism in yeast, with focus on regulation during the metabolic cycle of yeast. These TFs are known to play a central role in stress regulation, and they regulate expression of a very large number of genes in yeast (&gt;100). The authors claim that based on their findings it can be suggested that Msn2/4 control the transition from reductive charging phase to oxidative phase by regulating the accumulation of AcCoA. Regulation of shifts in yeasts metabolism is highly complex, and it tends to the naive to suggest such a statement, and it is by no means supported by the data. Thus, the authors focus their discussion on how Msn2/4 binds (and control expression) to genes of the glycolysis, but these genes are controlled by a large number of other TFs. Furthermore, Msn2/4 themselves control a large number of other genes, including several other TFs, which is not considered in their analysis. A main line of argument is measurements of AcCoA, but this metabolite is present in several cellular compartments – mitochondria, cytosol, peroxisomes and the nucleus (probably equilibrated with the cytosolic pool), and there is no free transport of AcCoA between these compartments. Measuring the total level and linking this to enzymes that are operating in different compartments is not correct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is wrong as ACS1 is forming acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and PDA1 is forming it in the mitochondria). The paper is interesting as the authors present a lot of data, but the biological conclusion they are trying to extract from these data is not supported by the data, and is likely wrong.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In Kuang et al., 2014 the authors examine the role of Msn2 and 4 to regulate glycolytic metabolism in order to promote acetyl-CoA and cell cycle entry. The authors utilize the very elegant YMC system to carefully monitor transitions between reductive and oxidative phases. They first introduce the DynaMO algorithm that identifies transcription factor motifs that influence periodic gene expression in the YMC. Using this method they identify Msn2 and 4, among others, as being involved in the reductive charging phase of the YMC. The authors perform ChIP experiments to demonstrate that Msn2 and 4 chromatin occupancy increases in the RC phase. They further demonstrate that deletion of Msn2/4 causes disruption of the respiration cycles in the YMC to one in which the reductive phase is dramatically lengthened. The authors reason that this lengthened cycle is due to a reduction in acetyl-CoA production. Indeed, ectopic addition of acetyl-CoA can rapidly induce OX phase transition (as has been previously shown by the Tu lab). Moreover, the authors show that RC phase gene expression closely resembles that of nutrient deprivation performed by other labs. Thus, data observed in the YMC is largely applicable to nutrient stress environments in general.</p><p>The findings presented in the manuscript are of high significance and broaden the knowledge of factors and mechanisms that influence cell survival. In particular, recent publications on acetyl-CoA demonstrate that this a key metabolite in promoting cell growth and proliferation. This data demonstrates that well-established transcription factors support the metabolism of this critical metabolite. The data in this manuscript is clear and the writing is concise. In general, the conclusions support the main findings of the paper.</p><p>The following are specific comments that can improve the manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors could do a better job in integrating current literature on the importance of carbohydrate stores, particularly trehalose and glycogen, in survival in nutrient stress conditions and re-entry into the cell cycle from quiescence.</p><p>2) Why did the authors focus on H3K9 acetylation, rather than gene expression, in the DynaMO prediction transcription factors that drive the YMC? (This may be detailed in the accompanying manuscript. However, some more details in this manuscript would be helpful to understand the outcome of the results.) Does the focus on H3K9ac provide a better assessment of gene expression that is responsive to acetyl-CoA?</p><p>3) The Introduction states that TFs were deleted to validate their role in the YMC. This is a bit vague. Can the authors state which ones? Is Msn2 and 4 unique in terms of its YMC disruption?</p><p>4) In the Introduction, the authors state that Msn2 and 4 are known to regulate stress genes. This statement should include relevant references, such as Gasch et al., 2000; Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996; Schmitt and McEntee, 1996).</p><p>5) The authors may also want to discuss upstream factors that regulate Msn2 function. In particular Tor signaling, which is influence by nutrient availability.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Stress-response factors Msn2/4 control re-entry of quiescent cells into growth through glycolysis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nan Hao (Reviewer #1); Ashby J Morrison (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We found the data on Msn2/4 regulating glycolysis convincing and believe it can be published as is. For <italic>eLife</italic>, however, we would have expected more solid insight into how one goes from altered glycolysis to changes in the regulatory molecule acetyl-CoA. This link, unfortunately, is not yet convincing enough and the revision did not help in solidifying this result.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In the revision, the authors did not examine the YMC progression or acetyl-CoA level (which are where the major debates centered on) in the overexpression strain, because &quot;the YMC requires coordination of various parameters&quot;(?). Instead, they just checked the regrowth rate and got a variety of inconsistent results. This is not surprising given that they transformed yeast with a 2 micro plasmid (pRS425) expressing Msn2 or Msn4. The variability of plasmid copy numbers is huge, and therefore the kind of colony variability is expected no matter which output phenotypes (growth rate or others) you will be looking at.

They attribute a key role of the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, well known for their role in the yeast stress response, to regulate the mRNA expression of glycolytic enzymes, during the metabolic cycle in the laboratory yeast strain CenPK (a popular model to synchronize yeast cells in their metabolic cycle).

The first is the one in which the study authors identify Msn2 and Msn4 as transcriptional regulators of glycolysis during the recovery phase of the metabolic cycle.

The data overall look pretty solid to me. It is not well-known that the stress response transcription factors Msn2/Msn4 also regulate glycolytic enzymes, and the evidence looks good that such genes may be induced by Msn2/4 to &quot;prime&quot; cells for rapid sugar utilization and re-entry into growth upon return to favorable nutrient conditions. I believe using the YMC system has enabled them to see this unanticipated relationship between Msn2/4 and glycolytic/carbohydrate metabolic enzymes, which may be obscured in traditional batch culture experiments. I also believe the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq could be high-quality datasets and will be of interest to those investigating both the overlapping and distinct roles for Msn2 and Msn4 in the regulation of stress-responsive gene transcription.</p><p>I would ask them to improve <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, the legends/labels on the left side of the ChIP-seq views are hard to read, and also comment on the fact that there seems to be binding of these transcription factors throughout the entire coding region for some of these glycolytic genes, in addition to the promoter regions, which could be potentially interesting? Or artifactual? Also, they appear to use commercial antibodies from Santa Cruz for ChIP of Msn2/4, some of their own validation should be included to help demonstrate the specificity of these antibodies (e.g., a Western of WT vs. <italic>msn2∆, msn4∆</italic> lysates).</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>I am sorry about the delay. I had to read this a couple times to appreciate what I think is the importance of this work, but let me emphasize that I have not been up to speed on Ben Tu's most recent work or that of Linda Breeden who has also worked in this area. Hence, there may be things that are more broadly known that were new to me here.</p><p>The importance of this paper to my mind is to broaden the appreciation of the roles of Msn2 and Msn4 from general stress resistance transcription factors to regulators of the metabolic cycle that have special roles in metabolism of cells that are coming out of quiescence that are not evident in standard growth conditions.

It would significantly strengthen the paper if the authors can show some gain-of-function effects. For example, how does Msn2/4 overexpression affect YMC and the growth transition in general? This is especially important because most people in the field believe that activated Msn2/4 slow down cell growth.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the YMC requires coordination of various parameters, it is not ideal for overexpression tests. Instead, we used inoculation of a stationary culture (similar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) to examine effects of overexpression. We overexpressed MSN2 or MSN4 from 2u plasmid pRS425 in a WT CEN.PK strain and inoculate 6-day stationary cells in YP+0.1% glucose or YP+2% glucose fresh medium. We observed a variety of colony sizes and regrowth phenotypes probably due to the different levels of overexpression and the diverse functions of Msn2/4 target genes (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Many Msn2/4 target genes show decreased growth rates in both deletion and over-expression mutants, for example HSP12. A medium size colony overexpressing MSN2 shows advanced and faster regrowth compared to a strain with empty vector. But a big size colony shows no changed regrowth and a small size colony shows delayed and decreased regrowth. We think the overexpression experiment is not directly relevant to the main conclusion in the manuscript, and very difficult to interpret. Given the potential artifacts and the diversity of outputs, we didn’t include these results in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Growth curves of strains overexpressing Msn2 and Msn4.</title><p>Msn2 and Msn4 were cloned onto a 2 micron plasmid and transferred into a leu2Δ CEN.PK strain.

In the paper, the authors only monitored the expression changes during YMC. It would serve as the direct supportive evidence for Msn2/4 activation if the authors can observe nuclear localization of Msn2/4 specifically during the RC phase. And if so, what would be the authors' speculation on the mechanisms of Msn2/4 activation? This will provide some clues on why Msn2/4 are activated specifically during the RC phase.</p></disp-quote><p>Besides the expression changes during YMC, we also observed the increase of ChIP-seq signals in the RC phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because Msn2/4 needs to move into the nucleus and bind to the genome to be active, we think the ChIP-seq results serve as direct evidence of Msn2/4 activation. We didn’t examine the mechanisms of Msn2/4 activation in this manuscript. Given that YMC is a nutrient limited condition, we speculate that TOR signaling may be involved in the activation, since TORC1 can sense nutrient availability and inhibition of TORC1 leads to nuclear translocation and activation of Msn2/4 (Beck and Hall, 1999; Loewith and Hall, 2011). We added a discussion of these points in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that Msn2/4 have a dual role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism genes and stress resistance genes. Under the conditions that they are focusing on (prolonged nutrient-limited condition), do the stress resistance genes also contribute to cell growth or they are unrelated by-products? An analysis or at least a discussion on this would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the stress resistance genes are primarily activated to improve survivability. However, we think some of the genes may also contribute to cell growth. For example, TPS2 and GAC1 are involved in synthesis of trehalose and glycogen. They are storage carbohydrates and important for stress resistance. They have also been shown to be metabolized during the exit of quiescence to fuel growth (Shi et al., 2010; Sillje et al., 1999). We add discussions of these points in subsection “Regulatory network for Msn2/4 in YMC” and subsection “Systematic comparison between YMC and distinct quiescent states”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper describes analysis of how the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 regulates expression of genes encoding enzymes of the central carbon metabolism in yeast, with focus on regulation during the metabolic cycle of yeast. These TFs are known to play a central role in stress regulation, and they regulate expression of a very large number of genes in yeast (&gt;100). The authors claim that based on their findings it can be suggested that Msn2/4 control the transition from reductive charging phase to oxidative phase by regulating the accumulation of AcCoA. Regulation of shifts in yeasts metabolism is highly complex, and it tends to the naive to suggest such a statement, and it is by no means supported by the data. Thus, the authors focus their discussion on how Msn2/4 binds (and control expression) to genes of the glycolysis, but these genes are controlled by a large number of other TFs. Furthermore, Msn2/4 themselves control a large number of other genes, including several other TFs, which is not considered in their analysis. A main line of argument is measurements of AcCoA, but this metabolite is present in several cellular compartments – mitochondria, cytosol, peroxisomes and the nucleus (probably equilibrated with the cytosolic pool), and there is no free transport of AcCoA between these compartments. Measuring the total level and linking this to enzymes that are operating in different compartments is not correct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is wrong as ACS1 is forming acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and PDA1 is forming it in the mitochondria). The paper is interesting as the authors present a lot of data, but the biological conclusion they are trying to extract from these data is not supported by the data, and is likely wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer of the insightful comments. However, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s conclusion.</p><p>1) We agree with the reviewer that regulation of shifts in yeast metabolism is highly complex, and that is one reason that our study focuses on a single metabolite, acetyl-CoA. The concept that acetyl-CoA stimulates cell growth and proliferation has been reported in many systems such as yeast (Takahashi et al., 2006), embryonic stem cells (Moussaieff et al., 2015) and cancer cells (Donohoe et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Wellen et al., 2009; Shan et al., 2014; Comerford et al., 2014) and the role of acetyl-CoA is specifically in YMC to activate growth-promoting genes (Cai et al., 2011) and cell cycle genes (Shi et al., 2013). Based on these works, our study provides a mechanistic advance about the source of acetyl-CoA in the RC of YMC. We believe this is a critical extension to help understand the exact role of acetyl-CoA in YMC and general cell growth. We did not claim that acetyl-CoA accumulation is the only route by which Msn2/4 drives the transition. We discuss the role of Msn2/4 in activating stress-response genes to maintain survival and the storage carbohydrates (trehalose and glycogen) in stress resistance and regrowth (subsections “Regulatory network for Msn2/4 in YMC” and “Systematic comparison between YMC and distinct quiescent states” and in the Discussion section.).</p><p>2) We agree with the reviewer that glycolysis genes are controlled by other TFs and Msn2/4 controls other TFs that in turn regulate glycolysis genes. We also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to analyze the targets of these TFs. However, our ChIP-seq and RNAseq data suggests that Msn2/4 directly target these genes and regulate their expression. This doesn’t contradict the fact that other TFs may also regulate glycolysis genes. The prevalent and dramatic reduction of glycolysis transcripts in the msn2/4 mutant indicates that Msn2/4 has a significant effect on glycolysis. As the reviewer stated, other TFs that regulate glycolysis genes are also controlled by Msn2/4. We think the upstream role of Msn2/4 further support Msn2/4 as the master regulator of glycolysis.</p><p>3) We agree with the reviewer that the total level of acetyl-CoA doesn’t reflect the levels in each compartment and it may change the interpretation. We updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the text and cited references to clarify the confusing aspects. (A) Although the PDH complex can generate acetyl-CoA in mitochondria, the expression level is not regulated by Msn2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). On the other side, the cytosolic enzymes, Pdc1, Adh2 and Acs1 are all targeted by Msn2/4. The expression level of ALD2 is also dramatically reduced in the <italic>msn2msn4</italic> mutant. (B) The expression level of ACS1 is significantly induced in the RC phase but not PDA1 (PDH complex), suggesting an enhancement of the cytosolic pathway. (C) Cai et al., (2011) have shown that adding different components of the cytocolic route, like acetate, ethanol, acetaldehyde, can immediately induce the transition from RC to OX. It is unlikely that these molecules can all be transported into the mitochondria and converted to acetyl-CoA there. (D) Cai et al., (2011) have shown that during the transition, histone acetylations are strongly increased and a gcn5 (histone acetyltransferase) mutant shows a similar YMC defect, suggesting the role of the nucleo-cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA in driving regrowth. Our transcriptional analysis is consistent with the hypothesis of a key nucleocytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA. (E) Finally, we would like to clarify that our study focuses on the mechanism of acetyl-CoA generation and not the mechanism of how acetyl-CoA stimulates growth and we agree that it will be very important to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of how acetyl-CoA stimulates growth, including the roles of each pool of acetyl-CoA, but this is beyond the scope of this paper. And we would like to emphasize that the majority of the glycolytic pathway, from glucose transportation to pyruvate, occur in the cytosol and are all controlled by Msn2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29938-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The authors could do a better job in integrating current literature on the importance of carbohydrate stores, particularly trehalose and glycogen, in survival in nutrient stress conditions and re-entry into the cell cycle from quiescence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good suggestion. We have expanded the discussion and added references to emphasize their important roles in regrowth (subsection “Regulatory network for Msn2/4 in YMC”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why did the authors focus on H3K9 acetylation, rather than gene expression, in the DynaMO prediction transcription factors that drive the YMC? (This may be detailed in the accompanying manuscript. However, some more details in this manuscript would be helpful to understand the outcome of the results.) Does the focus on H3K9ac provide a better assessment of gene expression that is responsive to acetyl-CoA?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. We added a description in the Results section to explain how the prediction works. H3K9ac not only marks the actively transcribed genes but also marks the transcription regulatory regions (promoters and enhancers). Based on the assumption that TFs bind to promoters and enhancers to function, a combination of spatial information of H3K9ac and TF motifs increases the prediction accuracy of TFBSs.</p><p>We didn’t find a special advantage of H3K9ac in predicting genes that is responsive to acetyl-CoA. We used H3K9ac because it shows the highest dynamics across YMC. Other histone acetylations show similar trends, but are a lot less dynamic and thus the signal is not as strong.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Introduction states that TFs were deleted to validate their role in the YMC. This is a bit vague. Can the authors state which ones? Is Msn2 and 4 unique in terms of its YMC disruption?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the names of the TFs we examined in subsection “DynaMO identifies TFs associated with specific phases of YMC”. Different defects were observed in different TF mutants. Among the examined TFs, the elongated RC phase was only observed in the Msn2 and Msn4 mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Introduction, the authors state that Msn2 and 4 are known to regulate stress genes. This statement should include relevant references, such as Gasch et al., 2000; Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996; Schmitt and McEntee, 1996).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the corresponding references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors may also want to discuss upstream factors that regulate Msn2 function.

This is not surprising given that they transformed yeast with a 2 micro plasmid (pRS425) expressing Msn2 or Msn4.
