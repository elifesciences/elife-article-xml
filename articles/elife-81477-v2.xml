worldwide priority. CoronaVac is an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine approved for emergency use with robust efficacy and immunogenicity data reported in trials in China, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Chile.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study is a randomized, multicenter, and controlled phase 3 trial in healthy Chilean adults aged ≥18 years. Volunteers received two doses of CoronaVac separated by 2 (0–14 schedule) or 4 weeks (0–28 schedule); 2302 volunteers were enrolled, 440 were part of the immunogenicity arm, and blood samples were obtained at different times. Samples from a single center are reported. Humoral immune responses were evaluated by measuring the neutralizing capacities of circulating antibodies. Cellular immune responses were assessed by ELISPOT and flow cytometry. Correlation matrixes were performed to evaluate correlations in the data measured.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Both schedules exhibited robust neutralizing capacities with the response induced by the 0–28 schedule being better. No differences were found in the concentration of antibodies against the virus and different variants of concern (VOCs) between schedules.

SARS-CoV-2 is already responsible for more than 530 million cases of infection and over 6 million deaths during the past 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). Worldwide efforts to develop effective vaccines against this virus have led to 10 vaccine prototypes approved for emergency use by the WHO, and over 8 billion vaccines administered to humans to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). Most approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines rely on a single viral component, namely the spike (S) protein or its receptor-binding domain (RBD), which could negatively impact the neutralizing capacities of antibodies induced if circulating VOCs, such as the Delta and Omicron, mutate those sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). Whole virus-inactivated platforms have been widely used throughout history to prevent diseases against other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kyriakidis et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these vaccines contain a broader diversity of antigens than just the S protein. Therefore, they might be more suited to protect against emerging circulating variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kyriakidis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Melo-González et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>CoronaVac is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approved by the WHO for emergency administration to humans and developed by Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd.

The study protocol adhered to the current Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practices, the Declaration of Helsinki, and local regulations and was approved by the Institutional Scientific Ethical Committee of Health Sciences of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (#200708006). The execution was approved by the Chilean Public Health Institute (#24204/20).</p><p>Recruited volunteers were adults aged ≥18 years, and informed consent was obtained upon enrollment. Volunteers received two doses of CoronaVac at day 0 and 2 (0–14) or 4 (0–28) weeks after the first immunization. Volunteers did not receive any payment for their participation. Study nurses oversaw the immunization and did not participate in any other study procedure. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bueno et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, inclusion criteria considered being aged 18 and over, being able to understand and sign the informed consent form, and compliances with all study procedures and visits. Exclusion criteria considered mainly history of confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnancy, allergy to vaccine components, and immunocompromised conditions. Well-controlled medical conditions were allowed.</p><p>Randomization was performed with a sealed enveloped system integrated with an electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) in the OpenClinica platform; 2302 volunteers were enrolled in this phase 3 clinical trial by April 9, 2021. Four-hundred and forty volunteers were part of the immunogenicity arm; 199 of these were part of the 0–14 schedule; and 241 were part of the 0–28 schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mean age of the recruited volunteers was 40.4±11.8 for the 0–14 schedule and 39.2±10.3 for the 0–28 schedule. A total of 52.9% volunteers were female and 47.1% were male.</p><p>CoronaVac consists of 3 µg or 600SU of β-propiolactone-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (strain CZ02) with aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant in 0.5 mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Sodium chloride, monosodium hydrogen phosphate, and disodium hydrogen phosphate are excipients, and water for injection is included as solvent. A study nurse administered ready-to-use syringes with 0.5 mL of CoronaVac intramuscularly in the deltoid area. Sera and PBMCs were isolated from blood obtained before administration of the first and the second dose and 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose for both immunization schedules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Procedures</title><p>For the isolation of sera, 20 mL of blood were collected in anticoagulant tubes and distributed in two tubes of 10 mL per volunteer (BD Vacutainer Clot Activator tubes #367896). Blood was allowed to clot for at least 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Samples were then centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge with a horizontal rotor at 1300× <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 22°C. Serum was collected and stored at –80°C until use. Hemolyzed samples were rejected. For the isolation of PBMCs, blood was collected in three heparinized tubes (BD Vacutainer #367874, 10 mL) and stored at RT until processing. Samples were diluted with PBS (1:1) and centrifuged for 10 min at 1200× <italic>g</italic> (RT) in SepMate tubes (StemCell Technologies) with density-gradient medium (Lymphoprep). The plasma was then discarded and PBMCs were isolated by pouring them into a clean tube. Isolated PBMCs were washed twice with sterile PBS, counted, and cryopreserved in FBS (Industrial Biologicals) and 10% DMSO (Chem Cruz). All PBMC samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until use.</p><p>To assess the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, blood samples obtained before the first dose (preimmune), before the second dose, 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose were analyzed. The quantitative measurement of human IgG antibodies against the RBD domain of the S1 protein (S1-RBD) was determined using the RayBio COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Human Antibody Detection Kit (Indirect ELISA method) (Cat #IEQ-CoVS1RBD-IgG) and through meso-scale discovery (MSD) immunoassays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, these kits consist of 96-well plates coated with the S1-RBD protein segment SARS-CoV-2. Sera samples were serially diluted starting at a 200-fold dilution until a 6400-fold dilution. After 1 hr of incubation at RT, the plates were washed, and a biotinylated anti-human IgG antibody provided in the kit was added and incubated for 30 min at RT. Plates were washed, and then a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin was added and incubated for 30 min at RT. Plates were rewashed, and the TMB substrate solution supplied in the kit was added. Finally, a stop solution provided in the kit was added, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Biotek, 1506021). As controls, dilutions of the First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human – NIBSC code: 20/13), and positive control provided by each kit were included. Additional controls included samples of volunteers seropositive or seronegative at recruitment or inoculated with placebo. To calculate the end titers, the cut-off value for each test was determined as ≥2.1 times the average OD<sub>450nm</sub> value of a panel of 8 serum samples from volunteers who received placebo and 12 seronegative serum samples. These serum samples were obtained before vaccination from seronegative volunteers. Seropositivity was determined as the highest dilution that reached &gt;2.1 times the OD<sub>450nm</sub> cut-off value. Seroconversion was defined as an increase of at least four times the titer at baseline.</p><p>For the surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), the SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies Test (BSNAT) Kit from BioHermes (COV-S41) was used to detect neutralizing antibodies in serum against SARS-CoV-2. This kit is a blocking assay which simulates the neutralization process, based on the ELISA platform. The main components of the kit are an ELISA plate pre-coated with the human ACE2 (hACE2) protein and the SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD fragment conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP-RBD). Briefly, the first step consisted in preparing serial dilutions from serum samples with the sample dilutor provided in the kit. Then, samples and controls were incubated with the HRP-RBD for 10 min at 37°C to allow the binding of neutralizing antibodies to RBD. Sera and controls previously incubated with HRP-RBD were added to ELISA plates (pre-coated with hACE2) and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. After incubation, samples were discarded, and all the wells were washed five times. Finally, TMB solution was added and quenched after 15 min of incubation at RT. Plates were read at 450 nm in a microplate reader (EPOCH, Biotek 1506021). The neutralizing antibody titer was determined as the last fold dilution with a cut-off value over 30% of inhibition. The inhibition rate was calculated based on the negative control absorbances (negative control – sample/negative control*100), and 10% was considered as the cut-off value. A similar methodology was performed to evaluate the neutralizing antibodies in sera against different VOCs, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Melo-González et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>For the conventional virus neutralization test (cVNT), Vero E6 cells were infected with a SARS-CoV-2 strain obtained by viral isolation in tissue cultures (33782CL-SARS-CoV-2 strain). Neutralization assays were carried out by the reduction of cytopathic effect (CPE) in Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586, confirmed to be <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> free). The titer of neutralizing antibodies was defined as the highest serum dilution that neutralized virus infection, at which the CPE was absent compared with the virus control wells (cells with CPE). Vero E6 cells (4×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates. For neutralization assays, 100 µL of 33782CL-SARS-CoV-2 (at a dose of 100 TCID<sub>50</sub>) were incubated with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera samples (dilutions of 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128, 1:256, and 1:512) from volunteers for 1 hr at 37°C. Then, the mix was added to the 96-well plates with the Vero E6 cells. CPE on Vero E6 cells was analyzed 7 days after infection. For each test, a serum sample from uninfected patients (negative control) and a neutralizing COVID-19 patient serum sample (positive control) were used.</p><p>For the pseudotyped virus neutralization test (pVNT), anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were measured using an HIV-1 backbone expressing firefly luciferase as a reporter gene and pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (HIV-1-SΔ19) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beltrán-Pavez et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, serum samples were initially diluted 1:4 in DMEM, serially diluted 1:3 up to 1:8748, and then mixed with approximately 4.5 ng of p24 equivalents of HIV-1-SΔ19 in white 96-well plate. Plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C, and then 100 mL of DMEM containing 1×10<sup>4</sup> HEK-ACE2 (transformed from CRL-3216 ATCC, confirmed to be <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> free) cells was added to each well. Firefly luciferase activity was measured 48 hr later, using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) in a Glomax-96 microplate luminometer (Promega). Estimation of the ID50 was obtained using a four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fit measured as the percent of neutralization determined by the difference in average relative light units between test samples and pseudotyped virus controls as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beltrán-Pavez et al., 2021</xref>). Data analyses and statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism v.9.</p><p>To assess the cellular immune response, ELISPOT and flow cytometry assays were performed using PBMCs from volunteers at the different times indicated above. Upon thawing, cells were resuspended in fresh media in a 1:10 dilution to remove DMSO remnants from the freezing media. Then, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in fresh media, and counted in an automated cell counter (Logos Biosystems #L40001). Cells were adjusted to 6×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and kept at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 15 min until use in the corresponding assay. ELISPOT plates containing a PVDF membrane were activated with 15 µL of 70% ethanol (Merck), washed three times with sterile ×1 PBS, and then coated with human IFN-γ and IL-4 capture antibodies (1:250 and 1:125, respectively, CTL). After 3 hr of activation at RT, plates were washed two times with PBS and two times with PBS-Tween 20 0.05%. The stimulus included in these assays considers the use of Mega Pools (MPs) of peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 proteins, previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). Two MPs composed of peptides from the S protein (MP-S) and the remaining proteins of the viral particle (MP-R) were used, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). These peptides were determined in silico to stimulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells optimally. Also, two MPs composed of peptides from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 (CD8-A and CD8-B) were used, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). These peptides were determined in silico to optimally stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell. As positive controls, an independent stimulation performed with 5 mg/mL of Concanavalin A (ConA) (Sigma Life Science #C5275-5MG), and with an MP of peptides derived from cytomegalovirus proteins (MP-CMV) for the stimulation of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). As a vehicle control, DMSO 1% (Merck #317275) was included. A total of 3×10<sup>5</sup> cells in 50 µL of media were added to each well containing 50 µL of media with the corresponding stimulus. The final concentration of each stimulus per well was 1 µg/mL (except for ConA and DMSO). Positive controls for ELISPOT assays considered 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well instead of 3×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well. For ELISPOT assays, cells were incubated for 48 hr at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After incubation, plates were washed one time with PBS, and three times with PBS-Tween 20. Then, anti-human IFN-γ (FITC) and anti-human IL-4 (Biotin) antibodies (1:1000 and 1:1000, respectively) were added, and plates were incubated for 2 hr, RT. Plates were washed three more times with PBS-Tween 20 and then FITC-HRP and Streptavidin-AP (1:1000) were added and plates were incubated for 1 hr, RT. After incubation, plates were washed three more times with PBS-Tween 20. Then, plates were treated with the blue (15 min), and red (15 min) developer solution individually following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Plates were washed with tap water after each developer solution and allowed to dry for 24 hr prior to reading. To evaluate the number of T cells secreting IFN-γ, IL-4, or both, ELISPOT assays were performed with ImmunoSpot technology (ImmnunoSpot #hIFNgIL4-1M-10). Spot forming cells (SFCs) were counted on an ImmunoSpot S6 Micro Analyzer.</p><p>To characterize the expression of activation-induced markers (AIM) by T cells, flow cytometry assays were performed. 3×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well were stimulated as described for the ELISPOT assays, and after 24 hr of incubation with the stimulus, samples were stained. Staining was performed by incubation for 45 min at 4°C using the following reagents: a mix of BD Horizon Fixable Viability Stain 510 (BD Biosciences – CAT 564406–1 µL per 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells); anti-CD14 V500 (BD Biosciences – clone M5E2); anti-CD19 V500 (BD Biosciences – clone HIB19); anti-CD3 AF-700 (Biolegend – clone OKT3); anti-CD69 PE (BD Biosciences – clone FN50); anti-CD8a BV-650 (BD Biosciences – clone RPA-T8); anti-CD4 BV-605 (BD Biosciences – clone RPA-T4); anti-CD137 (BioLegend, Clone 4-1BB); and anti-OX40 (BioLegend, Clone BER-ACT35). Cells were washed twice with 200 µL of PEB buffer, fixed, and then handed to the Flow Cytometry core facility, for their acquisition in an LSRFortessa X-20 flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size determination was already reported for this trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bueno et al., 2022</xref>).

These values, as well as the 95% confidence bands of the correlation, are shown in each graph.</p><p>Other comparisons assessed were analyzed via two-tailed unpaired t tests, two-tailed non-parametric unpaired t tests (Mann-Whitney tests), two-tailed non-parametric paired t tests (Wilcoxon tests), ANOVA followed by Tukey tests, or two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, as indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A 0–28 day immunization schedule with CoronaVac promotes higher seropositivity rates and GMT values of neutralizing antibodies than a 0–14 schedule</title><p>To evaluate the humoral immune response elicited after vaccination with two doses of CoronaVac, separated by 2 or 4 weeks (0–14 and 0–28 days schedules, respectively), the neutralizing capacities of circulating antibodies were evaluated. This was performed independently through an sVNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>) and cVNT for the Ancestral strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>), as well as a pseudotyped virus neutralization test (pVNT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For both immunization schedules, samples from 130 volunteers were tested for sVNT, 372 volunteers for cVNT with the Ancestral strain, and 94 for pVNT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These techniques show a robust increase in arbitrary WHO international units (IU), geometric mean titer (GMT) values, and seropositivity rates 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose for both immunization schedules.

We also evaluated differences in the neutralizing capacities of circulating antibodies between the two age groups indicated for all four techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both age groups had significantly increased GMT values at all times compared to preimmune samples, irrespective of the immunization schedule and the technique evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). However, we observed significantly higher titers of circulating neutralizing antibodies in the 18–59 years age group compared to the &gt;60 years age group, 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose, irrespective of the vaccination schedule, as determined by cVNT and pVNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that CoronaVac induces the production of circulating antibodies with varying neutralizing capacities after immunization with either a 0–14 or a 0–28 schedule.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 88 volunteers were evaluated for both immunization schedules and techniques. To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific secretion of IFN-γ and expression of AIM by T cells, PBMCs were stimulated independently with four MPs of peptides comprising the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. One MP contains peptides from the S protein (MP-S, 15-mer peptides), and another one considers the remaining viral proteome (MP-R, 15-mer peptides). The two other MPs comprise the whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2. These MPs were split in two as they were too many to be used as a single stimulus (MP-CD8A and MP-CD8B, 9- to 11-mer peptides). Stimulation of PBMCs with MP-S and MP-R induced a statistically significant increase in the secretion of IFN-γ and the expression of AIM in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (defined as OX40<sup>+</sup> and CD137<sup>+</sup>), compared to preimmune samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, tables on top of each panel).

Studies from phase 1/2 clinical trials in China suggested that a 0–28 schedule may better induce a protective response against SARS-CoV-2 with CoronaVac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bueno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, here we compared the immune response elicited by both schedules. Recent reports show that antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 correlate with the protective capacities of COVID-19 vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Earle et al., 2021</xref>). Immunization with CoronaVac induced significantly increased levels of circulating neutralizing antibodies for both immunization schedules at all times after the first and second dose, irrespective of the age group evaluated. This is an expected response for vaccines that promote a protective response against SARS-CoV-2 and has also been reported for other vaccines such as BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tarke et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The previous phase 1/2 trials held in China showed that a 0–28 immunization schedule is better at inducing anti-S1 and neutralizing antibodies in healthy adults, while in children and adolescents, it causes higher seroconversion rates before the second dose, compared to the 0–14 schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show similar data regarding the neutralizing capacities of circulating antibodies, as arbitrary IU and GMT values were mainly increased 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose for the 0–28 schedule compared to the 0–14 schedule. It is important to note that the inactivated virus used in CoronaVac is the strain CZ02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2020</xref>), while the cVNT, sVNT, and pVNT use either the circulating Ancestral and D614G strain, the S1-RBD, or the S protein from the original wild-type L strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beltrán-Pavez et al., 2021</xref>), respectively. This could explain differences in neutralizing capacities reported among these techniques. Remarkably, no differences were found between schedules for the concentration of antibodies against the S protein and the RBD, at 4 weeks after the second dose. However, reduced breadth indexes were seen for the different VOC evaluated, with increased values against Beta and Omicron, but decreased values against the other variants in the 0–28 schedule, suggesting that a booster dose may be required to promote a more robust protective humoral immune responses against these emerging viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schultz et al., 2022</xref>). Remarkably, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, although similar levels of antibodies against the S and the RBD of the Ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 were found, there were still differences in the neutralization capacities of these antibodies for each schedule, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. These differences may be significant if assuming that the presence of total antibodies is protective against an infection, as suggested for other respiratory viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Polack et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Polack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Winarski et al., 2019</xref>). However, the use of rapid tests for the evaluation of antibodies in humans should not be used as a proxy of actual protection against disease since neutralization will be overlooked in this context.</p><p>We also performed assays to evaluate the neutralizing capacity of antibodies against VOCs. Overall, we did not observe significant differences in the neutralizing antibody titers against VOCs when comparing both immunization schedules, except for the Gamma strain, where the 0–14 schedule showed higher values than those of the 0–28 schedule. Interestingly, the breath indexes determined for these assays suggests an enhanced affinity across VOCs in the 0–14 schedule. Further studies that address the spatial antibody structure elicited in both vaccination schedules will be needed to understand the structural bases that could explain these observed differences, as the RBD-antibody interface affects the breadth of each antibody to viral escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Starr et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, these results should also be interpreted with caution, as larger sample sizes for each vaccination schedule are needed for a more definitive conclusion.</p><p>Remarkably, it was recently shown that two doses of CoronaVac induce a steady cellular immune response against circulating VOCs of SARS-CoV-2, while the neutralizing capacities of circulating antibodies were different among different strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Melo-González et al., 2021</xref>). This robust cellular response may be related to the presence of viral antigens other than the S protein of this virus and could be key when choosing vaccines to face this pandemic. The T cell immune responses elicited upon natural infection and vaccination are fundamental in modulating the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Canedo-Marroquín et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duarte et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, several of the currently WHO-approved vaccine platforms have been shown to induce potent cellular immune responses, including those composed of recombinant proteins, mRNA, and viral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ewer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Keech et al., 2020</xref>). As reported previously, MP-S and MP-R were generated in silico to stimulate mainly CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., peptides with 15-mer length in these MPs), while MP-CD8A and MP-CD8B were generated to stimulate mainly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., peptides with 9- to 11-mer length in these MPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). Since both T cell responses are relevant during a viral infection, both sets of MPs were tested to evaluate the elicited immune response. The expression of AIM by T cells was mostly similar for both schedules at 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose, with no statistical differences. However, stimulation with MPs of 15-mer peptides induced an increased expression of AIM by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells relative to preimmune samples, 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose. The responses measured here indicate that a cellular response can be detected upon stimulation with these MPs initially selected in silico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). A Th1 response commonly associated with IFN-γ secretion is optimal for the clearance of intracellular pathogens, while Th2-related cytokines such as IL-4 may inhibit the polarization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward this antiviral profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bueno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Although statistically higher than those detected for preimmune samples when stimulating with MPs of 15-mer peptides, numbers of IL-4<sup>+</sup> SFC were remarkably lower than those seen for IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> SFC. This is in line with the data previously reported for the 0–14 immunization schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bueno et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our correlation matrixes showed that both immunization schedules could promote concerted humoral and cellular immune responses. Specifically, circulating neutralizing antibodies measured by different techniques were highly correlated 2 and 4 weeks after administration of the second dose. Positive and statistically significant correlations were found between neutralizing antibody titers determined by cVNT against the D614G variant 2 and 4 weeks after the second dose and the expression of AIM by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells 4 weeks after the second dose for both immunization schedules. This is especially important as both humoral and cellular immunity contribute to viral clearance, and vaccines should aim to develop both arms of the adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choudhary et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>This study also has caveats and limitations. Although the robust immunogenicity described here is encouraging, efficacy, hospitalization, and death prevention analysis are required to guide the use of this vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Other limitations of this study are the lack of evaluation of long-term immunity (i.e., 6 or 12 months after the first dose), the partially homogeneous ethnicity of the evaluated population (healthy adults), a more exhaustive evaluation of cellular responses, and the immune response elicited against circulating variants of this virus.</p><p>Considering all the data presented in this article, we can conclude that immunization with CoronaVac in either a 0–14 or 0–28 vaccination schedule induces robust humoral and cellular responses in healthy adults from Chile. Further studies related to this phase 3 trial will be focused on the response elicited at later times after vaccination (i.e., 6 and 12 months after the first dose), the protection of CoronaVac toward circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the capacity of a third dose to induce a robust immune response.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has received funding from ANID - ICM, ICN 2021_045.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide data for the emerging variants of concern with at least one of the three neutralization antibody assays that the authors use for the 2020 strain in Figure 1. This will help identify the most important differences between the two immunization schedules with regards to the immunization schedule which I feel is somewhat unclear from the data on overall anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies.</p><p>2) Please correct the issues identified by reviewers 1, 2, and 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this is a nice manuscript with ample data. There are some typos (such as point one below). The major weakness in significance was the lack of a mRNA comparison arm to understand the magnitude of the responses and dosing schedule.

Order of presentation of results: For Figures 3 and S4, S5, as well as Figures 4 and S9; the text presents the data in the supplementary figures first before discussing the main figures. The supplementary figures show pairwise comparisons between the pre-immune and post-vaccination states, whereas the main text provides the comparison between each immunization state. While I agree that the latter is more interesting, I think the presentation could be much simplified by including all the comparisons directly in the main figures. That way, the obvious point (i.e., the vaccine works) can be more efficient compared with the point of interest to the authors (i.e., the differences between the schedules).</p><p>4. Data on MPs: I am somewhat confused why the second set of MPs (CD8A and CD8B), which the text identifies as two parts of the whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 gave different results from MP-R which also contains the non-spike components of the proteome. Is this because of the difference in length of the peptides?
