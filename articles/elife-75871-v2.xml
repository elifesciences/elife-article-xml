Disruption of bicarbonate entry into airway lumen, as has been observed in cystic fibrosis, produces several defects in lung function due to thick mucus accumulation. Bicarbonate is critical for correct mucin deployment and there is increasing interest in understanding its role in airway physiology, particularly in the initiation of lung disease in children affected by cystic fibrosis, in the absence of detectable bacterial infection. The current model of anion secretion in mammalian airways consists of CFTR and TMEM16A as apical anion exit channels, with limited capacity for bicarbonate transport compared to chloride. However, both channels can couple to SLC26A4 anion exchanger to maximise bicarbonate secretion. Nevertheless, current models lack any details about the identity of the basolateral protein(s) responsible for bicarbonate uptake into airway epithelial cells. We report herein that the electrogenic, sodium-dependent, bicarbonate cotransporter, SLC4A4, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of human and mouse airways, and that it’s pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing reduces bicarbonate secretion. In fully differentiated primary human airway cells cultures, SLC4A4 inhibition induced an acidification of the airways surface liquid and markedly reduced the capacity of cells to recover from an acid load. Studies in the <italic>Slc4a4</italic>-null mice revealed a previously unreported lung phenotype, characterized by mucus accumulation and reduced mucociliary clearance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the reduction of SLC4A4 function induced a CF-like phenotype, even when chloride secretion remained intact, highlighting the important role SLC4A4 plays in bicarbonate secretion and mammalian airway function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>airways</kwd><kwd>Slc4a4</kwd><kwd>mucus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000292</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRC003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000292</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRC013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_PC_15030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1221257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flores</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The reduction of bicarbonate secretion into the airways reproduces cystic fibrosis-like features, independently of chloride secretion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) are actively secreted into the lumen of airways by the lining epithelial cells. Even though, the pathophysiological consequences of decreased secretion of these anions has been extensively documented in cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common, autosomal recessive, disease in humans, there is still much discussion whether HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion per se affects airway homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zajac et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morrison et al., 2022</xref>). Impaired Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion reduces the volume of the fluid that covers the airway epithelium, the airway surface liquid (ASL), leading to ciliary dysfunction and promoting mucus stasis and airway obstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saint-Criq and Gray, 2017</xref>). Deficient HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion reduces ASL pH which compromises post-secretory mucin maturation and clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoegger et al., 2014</xref>), impairs the antimicrobial function of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pezzulo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shah et al., 2016</xref>) and increases fluid absorption, further decreasing ASL hydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garland et al., 2013</xref>). Whilst direct measurement of pH in the distal airways of CF children showed no acidification of the ASL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schultz et al., 2017</xref>), it has been demonstrated that the addition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> induced an increase in ASL height in human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) cultures and restored the normal properties of mucus from CF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stigliani et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the use of aerosolized HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> into CF-pig airways increased bacterial killing, clearly indicating that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supplementation can correct inherent defects of CF in the airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pezzulo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Even though, impaired HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion is recognised as a detrimental component of CF airway disease, a full mechanistic understanding of the process and players involved in transcellular HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport in the airways is lacking. In normal airways, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is secreted by CFTR and TMEM16A channels, but after inflammatory signalling, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion is augmented through increased expression of the Cl<sup>-</sup> /HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger Pendrin (SLC26A4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poulsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rehman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garnett et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the mechanism of basolateral HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport/uptake in native pulmonary tissues is still lacking. We reasoned that the identification and functional inhibition of such basolateral membrane proteins could be used as a proof-of-concept to better understand the role of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in airway homeostasis without altering Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion. Here using in vitro fully differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells, we identified the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> electrogenic cotransporter (NBCe1), SLC4A4, as the basolateral protein responsible for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> influx, which couples to apical CFTR for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion into the ASL. Importantly, SLC4A4 inhibition induced acidification of the ASL, revealing the pivotal role of this cotransporter in airway pH homeostasis. These observations were further tested in murine models, and revealed that SLC4A4 is involved in both basal and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in mice airways. Strikingly, an <italic>Slc4a4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse model showed significant pathological signs of muco-obstructive disease and reduced mucociliary clearance, confirming that inhibition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion alters airway homeostasis, mimicking what has been observed in human CF, and identifying a critical role played by SLC4A4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary human airway epithelial cells express bicarbonate transporters of the SLC4A family</title><p>We first investigated, by PCR, whether primary hAECs expressed different members of the SLC4A family of Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters (NCBT) and isolated RNA from kidney and the Calu-3 cell line, which was derived from a metastatic site of a lung adenocarcinoma, as positive controls.

Data extraction from previously published RNA-seq results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saint-Criq et al., 2020</xref>) (GEO series accession number GSE154905) confirmed the pattern of expression of these isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and revealed that <italic>SLC4A4</italic> is the most expressed member, closely followed by <italic>SLC4A7</italic>, <italic>SLC4A8,</italic> and <italic>SLC4A5</italic>.

The cell cultures were mounted in Ussing chambers in buffers containing either HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (but no Cl<sup>-</sup>) or HEPES (no HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), and treated basolaterally with the inhibitor S0859 (30 μM) followed by Forskolin (Fsk; 10 µM). Results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> confirmed that, in the absence of stimulants, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion was inhibited by S0859 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and that this pharmacological inhibitor did not have any effect on short-circuit current (Isc) in the absence of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Interestingly, S0859 did not reduce Fsk-stimulated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) under these conditions. These results show that there is an electrogenic HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter at the basolateral membrane of hAECs, which is consistent with SLC4A4, since SLC4A7 and SLC4A8 are electroneutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parker and Boron, 2013</xref>), and SLC4A5 has been shown to be localized to the apical membrane of renal epithelial cells and cholangiocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gildea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuladze et al., 1998</xref>). Next, we used intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) measurements to functionally investigate NBCe1 activity using a CO<sub>2</sub>-induced acidification protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Theparambil et al., 2015</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, exposing cells bilaterally to a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/CO<sub>2</sub>-gassed KRB solution induced a transient acidification. On the other hand, an apical-only CO<sub>2</sub> exposure, in the absence of basolateral HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, induced a sustained acidification (of the same amplitude as with bilateral HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/CO<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>), that recovered when HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was re-introduced basolaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,I</xref>). This pH<sub>i</sub> recovery depended on the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> in the basolateral solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) consistent with a Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter, which was confirmed using S0859 which blocked the pH<sub>i</sub> recovery from the CO<sub>2</sub>-induced acidification. In order to isolate NBCe1-dependent changes in pH<sub>i</sub>, the contribution of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE was inhibited using 100 μM Dimethyl amiloride (DMA).

NBCe1 inhibition significantly decreased ASL pH under resting conditions with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 46 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), and partially prevented the Fsk-induced increase in ASL pH which we have previously shown was via CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delpiano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saint-Criq et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), increasing the half-time response to Fsk from 25 to 31 min. Moreover, when S0859 was added after Fsk, it significantly reduced the Fsk-induced, CFTR-dependent, increase in ASL pH with a half-time of 14 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) confirming the central role of SLC4A4 cotransporter in ASL pH homeostasis under both resting and stimulated conditions. It is worth noting that the changes in ASL pH were much slower than in the pH<sub>i</sub> experiments, which can be explained by the differences in technical (non-perfused ASL pH versus bilaterally perfused pH<sub>i</sub>) and experimental conditions set-ups (chemical induced versus.

As the specificity of S0859 for SLC4A4 has been discussed and is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heidtmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwab et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ch’en et al., 2008</xref>), it is uncertain from our data whether SLC4A4 is the main and only actor regulating bicarbonate uptake in primary hAECs. However its importance in airway pH homeostasis is supported by strong evidence from the use of knock-out animals. Early characterization in canine and human airway epithelium indicated that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion occurs via CFTR, is activated by cAMP and dependent on basolateral Na<sup>+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith and Welsh, 1992</xref>, similar features were observed in the Calu-3 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Devor et al., 1999</xref>). Our experiments in hAECs corroborated the cAMP-activation and Na<sup>+</sup>-dependence, that has also been observed by others in the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gorrieri et al., 2016</xref>) or other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurtz, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, and in contrast to human airway epithelium, our present data shows that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in the mouse airways is mostly Ca<sup>+2</sup>- rather than cAMP-activated, but both human and mouse share a basal secretory component for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> previously observed in human bronchioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shamsuddin and Quinton, 2019</xref>), and that we now show is dependent on SLC4A4 activity.</p><p>Basolateral localization of SLC4A4 was previously demonstrated in the Calu-3 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kreindler et al., 2006</xref>) but up to the date there has been no other studies investigating SLC4A4 localization in native airway tissues. Here, we demonstrate that human airways express SLC4A4 in ciliated cells preferentially, and that the observed basolateral localization correlates with the functional evidence provided, reinforcing the role SLC4A4 in basolateral HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport into the cells. Nevertheless, it must be considered that the sole expression of SLC4A4 does not assure HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion as compelling evidence has demonstrated that apical CFTR is also necessary. While the calcium-activated TMEM16A channel has been shown to be expressed in goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scudieri et al., 2012</xref>), both HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters, CFTR and pendrin, have been localized in the apical membrane of ciliated hAECs cells supporting our observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kreda et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that SLC4A4-B, that we detected in human and mouse, and not the isoform A, is functionally coupled to CFTR through the IRBIT protein in pancreatic ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirakabe et al., 2006</xref>), further supporting the idea that a functional coupling in the same cell type is necessary for efficient HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion. Even though, CFTR and Pendrin expression increases in secretory cells after cytokine stimulation, SLC4A4 remained unaltered, suggesting that other basolateral HCO3- transporter support HCO3- secretion in human secretory cells during the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rehman et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, CFTR distribution in airway epithelium has been under renewed scrutiny after the recent discovery of the pulmonary ionocyte, a rare airway epithelial cell type that contains the highest amount of <italic>CFTR</italic>/<italic>Cftr</italic> transcripts in human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>).

Polystyrene black dyed microspheres (diameter 6 µm, 2.6% solid-latex, Polybead, Polyscience Inc) were washed and resuspended in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or HEPES solution and 4 µl of particle solution with 0.3% latex were added onto the mucosal surface of the trachea. Particle transport was visualized every 5 s for 15 min using a ZEISS SteREO Discovery.V12, with digital camera Motic (Moticam 5.0). Particle speed was calculated with NIH ImageJ software and speed of MCC was expressed in µm/s. To inhibit HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> solution was substituted for the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-free solution (HEPES) of the following composition (in mM): 145 NaCl, 1.6 K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub> throughout the experiments. In these experiments, the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> free solution (HEPES) was gassed with 100% O<sub>2</sub> gas to maintain solution pH close to 7.4. Beads tracked on each tissue were averaged and were used as corresponding to one tissue sample.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Experiments in human cells were analysed using GraphPad Prism v9. Statistical analysis was performed taking into account the number n of independent repetitions (done in different days) of the experiments (stated in the Figure legends) using cells at different passage numbers from 3 different donors. Thus n numbers given in the figure legends are considered as biological replicates. Statistical tests used are indicated in the figure legends and p-values are shown in the figures. Experiments using animals were analysed using the Sigmaplot 12 software. Statistical analysis was performed considering as n the number of animals used as source for tissues. These n numbers given on figure legends are considered biological replicates. For pH<sub>i</sub> experiments isolated cells were from at least 3 different animals per group and statistical analysis was performed using values from individual cells. ANOVA on Ranks was used for comparisons of more than 2 data sets while Rank Sum test for comparison of data with two data sets. For survival analysis Log Rank test was used. p-Value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Sample size for experiments in human cells were calculated using Cohen’s d, a power analysis showed that the sample size of five independent experiments has a 90% power to detect a difference, assuming a 5% significance level and a two-sided test. Calculations were based in previously published data for intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turner et al., 2016</xref>), ASL pH measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saint-Criq et al., 2019</xref>) and unpublished data set for short-circuit currents. Sample size for animal experiments was calculated using previous published data for Ussing chamber experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vega et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gianotti et al., 2016</xref>), intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theparambil and Deitmer, 2015</xref>) and mucociliary clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vega et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were performed after mice were deeply anesthetized via i.p. injection of 120 mg/kg ketamine and 16 mg/kg xylazine followed by exsanguination.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including László Csanády as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hugo de Jonge (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. SLC4A4, A5 and A8 are the major NCBTs expressed in the primary hAECs (Figure S1A). The arguments used to exclude A5 and A8 as candidate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> importers (l. 298-301) are weak because (i) the fact that transepithelial HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport generates a Isc does not prove that the importer is electrogenic (cf. Cl<sup>-</sup> secretory currents mediated through the electroneutral NKCC1 importer), and (ii) the localization of SLC4A5 in the apical membrane of renal epithelial cells does not rule out a basolateral localization in airway cells (cf. the opposite polarization of AE2 in intestinal vs. bile duct cells and of CA12 in salivary duct vs. airway surface cells). Does the SLC4A4 inhibitor S0859, at 30 μm concentration, also inhibit A5 or A8? Please comment. Furthermore, the authors report that both SLC4A7 and SLC4A10 had very low expression levels, although in Figure S1A it looks as if the expression of SLC4A7 could be quite reasonable. How did the authors determine relative mRNA abundance and, along similar lines, were the amplified bands digested to confirm their identity? Finally, are other candidate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters or channels, e.g. Bestrophins, expressed too in primary hAECs?</p><p>2. Figure 1A-D: The size of the S0859-inhibitable Isc (representing a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretory current) in the hAECs is very small (~1 uAmp/cm2) in comparison with anion current measurements in similar cell models reported previously (e.g. refs. 14, 27: ~20 uAmp/cm2). This is remarkable because the conditions used (Cl<sup>-</sup> free buffer) is optimal for de-inhibition of NBCe1-B activity that is known to act as a Cli sensor through its 2 GXXXP motifs (Shcheynikov et al. 2015 PNAS 112: E329-37). To judge better about the quality of the hAEC monolayers in culture, one would like to know how the inclusion of Cl<sup>-</sup>, or CFTR activation by forskolin in the perfusion medium (affecting the ASL pH; Figure 2) affects Isc measurements in the Ussing chamber, and to what extent S0859 inhibits forskolin-stimulated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> currents.</p><p>3. Figure 2, G-J: In the hAEC monolayers SLC4A4 seems to be co-expressed with acetylated tubulin in ciliated cells. However it is unclear how many other cell types (CC10-positive Club cells; ionocytes; goblet cells) are retrieved in these human airway cell cultures. In both mouse bronchi and bronchioles (Suppl. Figure 4C) and in differentiated hAECs in the Welsh lab (ref. 15) CFTR (and pendrin) are expressed mainly in CC10+-secretory (Club) cells, not in ciliated cells. This raises the question whether SLC4A4 is also expressed in human Club cells and whether Club cells rather than ciliated cells are the major sources of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secreted into the ASL.</p><p>4. Figure 3 A-C: Can the authors explain why the IBMX/forskolin/cAMP-induced anion current, in contrast to the UTP/ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced current, is not reduced in bicarbonate-free buffer, i.e. does not seem to have a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> component? In mouse trachea, most if not all Fsk/cAMP-induced anion secretory current is CaCC-mediated, so there is a priori no reason why forskolin-induced currents would not be reduced (at least in part) in a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> free buffer.</p><p>5. Figure S3D-F: Assuming that the CaCC inhibitor AO1 completely blocks CaCCs and the IBMX/Fsk-induced Isc, how do the authors explain that subsequent addition of S0859 further inhibits a &quot;basal&quot; HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretory current? Does HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exit the cell at the apical side through tonically active CFTR, or through an electrogenic HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> exchanger (but pendrin is electroneutral)?</p><p>6. Figure 3, D-E, Figure S3A and D, and l. 350: The cause of the transient negative change in Isc elicited by S0859 remains to be identified. Could it be that the compound has transient off-target effects on the intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> level, or activates basolateral K<sup>+</sup> channels? It is remarkable that similar deflections are not seen in human AECs (Figure 1C).</p><p>7. How close do the hAECs used in this study recapitulate the airways in situ? For example, are CA12 (cf. ref. 11) or ATP12A (cf. ref. 7) highly expressed in these cultures? This could either be addressed using Q-PCR of markers, e.g. CA12 and ATP12A, or by immunostaining of SLC4A4 in CC10+ cells.</p><p>8. The systemic Slc4a4 null-mouse model used in this study is known to suffer from many abnormalities, including severe metabolic acidosis due to pRTA (l. 471-480). Whether the reduced level of plasma HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> contributes to the lack of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion and reduced ASL pH in the trachea of the Slc4a4-/- mouse (l. 475) depends on the affinity of the NBCe1 transporter for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions. Therefore it is of interest to learn whether the transporter is already saturated at 5 mM HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, or needs higher serosal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels, e.g. 24 mM. This could be addressed experimentally or at least discussed.</p><p>9. L. 496: I agree that an airway-specific Slc4a4 null mouse model created by Cre-Lox technology would be of further help in studying the pathogenesis of muco-obstructive diseases of the lungs. In particular a comparison of Club cell-specific vs. ciliated cell-specific Slc4a4-/- mouse models would be useful to study the functional importance of SLC4A4 in each cell type in vivo.</p><p>10. The authors show changes in ASL pH in hAEC cultures. Could the authors include in their Methods a statement about the time point at which the pH was considered to have settled, i.e. at what time were the Figure 2B data points collected following the addition of S0859 or Fsk? Could the authors also comment on the difference in timescale between the effects on intracellular acidification (Figure 1) vs the effect on ASL pH which seems to take ~2hrs (Figure 2)?</p><p>11. It looks as if some effects are not fully reversible (Figure S3G)? Could the authors comment on this?</p><p>12. In relation to the central thesis that pH is central in the development of the CF mucus phenotype, is there any evidence of changes to mucus rheology in the hAEC cultures accompanying the changes in pH?</p><p>13. The authors pursue an experiment to determine whether there is &quot;an active NCBT under resting conditions&quot;. But surely Isc measurements are not really made under resting conditions as the ASL is essentially flooded and the ionic composition on the apical side is not likely to match that of a normal ASL. This will affect ion driving forces etc. Could the authors consider this point?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1A vs. C: Why did the authors change two parameters at the same time, by switching from Cl<sup>-</sup> free HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> containing (in A) to Cl<sup>-</sup> containing HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> free solution (in C)? Wouldn't a Cl<sup>-</sup> free HEPES-buffered solution be a better control for the experiment in A? Also, please indicate the timepoint of basolateral drug addition in panels A, C.</p><p>2. Figure 2C: In the cells pretreated with S0859 Fsk exposure seems to induce a transient small acidification. When compared to that acidified value, the ensuing pH recovery seems comparable to that observed for cells not pretreated with S0859. Can the authors comment on the likely mechanism of this phenomenon?</p><p>3. Figure 2B, D, F: Please define what the symbols represent. Is it pH at a given (which?) timepoint following drug addition? Or mean pH observed over a given (which?) time interval following drug addition?</p><p>4. Figure 2B, D, F: The plotted significance values are confusing. If the error bars on the black and blue dot represent S.E.M., than the difference is unlikely to be significant in either panel. Was the significance calculated for the δ-pH values? If so, it would be helpful to also provide mean+/-S.E.M. δ-pH, and indicate the significance value there.</p><p>5. Figure 3C: mean+/-S.E.M. bars are hidden behind the individual data points.</p><p>6. Figure 3L-M: in panel L please show the data also for the third bar in panel M.</p><p>7. Suppl. Figure 3C, F: It is unclear what the bars represent. E.g., in panel C the two bars seem identical (negative), although in panels A-B S0859 induces a positive current change when added after Fsk (i.e., δ-Isc should be positive for S0859). The same applies for the 2nd and 3rd bars in panel F.</p><p>8. Suppl. Figure 3G: Several clarifications are needed here:</p><p>(i) The legend says &quot;UTP-induced intracellular acidification&quot; but the trace seems to show S0859-induced acidification.</p><p>(ii) The legend says &quot;in bicarbonate buffer or HEPES&quot;, but in the trace it is not indicated where the buffer change has occurred.</p><p>(iii) Please calibrate the ordinate into pH units for a better comparison with panel H.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

Cl<sup>-</sup> secretory currents mediated through the electroneutral NKCC1 importer), and (ii) the localization of SLC4A5 in the apical membrane of renal epithelial cells does not rule out a basolateral localization in airway cells (cf. the opposite polarization of AE2 in intestinal vs. bile duct cells and of CA12 in salivary duct vs. airway surface cells). Does the SLC4A4 inhibitor S0859, at 30 μm concentration, also inhibit A5 or A8? Are other candidate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters or channels , e.g. Bestrophins, expressed too in primary hAECs?</p><p>2. Figure 1A-D: The size of the S0859-inhibitable Isc (representing a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretory current) in the hAECs is very small (~1 uAmp/cm2) in comparison with anion current measurements in similar cell models reported previously (e.g. refs. 14, 27: ~20 uAmp/cm2). This is remarkable because the conditions used (Cl<sup>-</sup> free buffer) is optimal for de-inhibition of NBCe1-B activity that is known to act as a Cli sensor through its 2 GXXXP motifs (Shcheynikov et al. 2015 PNAS 112: E329-37). To judge better about the quality of the hAEC monolayers in culture, one would like to know how the inclusion of Cl<sup>-</sup>, or CFTR activation by forskolin (affecting the ASL pH; Figure 2) in the perfusion medium affects Isc measurements in the Ussing chamber, and to what extent S0859 inhibits forskolin-stimulated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> currents.</p><p>3. Figure 2, G-J: In the hAEC monolayers SLC4A4 seems to be co-expressed with acetylated tubulin in ciliated cells. However it is unclear how many other cell types (CC10-positive Club cells; ionocytes; goblet cells) are retrieved in these human airway cell cultures. In both mouse bronchi and bronchioles (Suppl. Figure 4C) and in differentiated hAECs in the Welsh lab (ref. 15) CFTR (and pendrin) are expressed mainly in CC10+-secretory (Club) cells, not in ciliated cells. This raises the question whether SLC4A4 is also expressed in human Club cells and whether Club cells rather than ciliated cells are the major sources of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secreted into the ASL.</p><p>4. Figure 3 A-C: Can the authors explain why the IBMX/forskolin/cAMP-induced anion current, in contrast to the UTP/ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced current, is not reduced in bicarbonate-free buffer, i.e. does not seem to have a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> component? In mouse trachea, most if not all Fsk/cAMP-induced anion secretory current is CaCC-mediated, so there is a priori no reason why forskolin-induced currents would not be reduced (at least in part) in a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> free buffer.</p><p>5. Figure S3D-F: Assuming that the CaCC inhibitor AO1 completely blocks CaCCs and the IBMX/Fsk-induced Isc, how do the authors explain that subsequent addition of S0859 further inhibits a &quot;basal&quot; HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretory current?

After a careful literature review we could not find any decisive evidence whether S0859 specifically inhibits SLC4A4 and not the other SLC4A bicarbonate co transporters (Ch’en et al. Br J Pharmacol. 2008; Schwab et al. J Physiol. 2005). Moreover, although we did not perform qPCR experiments to measure the levels of mRNA of each SLC4A member, RNA-seq data from another study using epithelial cells from the same donors, grown in the same conditions, revealed that SLC4A4 is the most expressed member, closely followed by SLC4A7, SLC4A8 and SLC4A5 (see Figure 1—figure supplement1). No counts were found for SLCA10. Data from this project are reported in the following publication (Saint-Criq et al. Cells. 2020 doi: 10.3390/cells9092137.

Bestrophins mRNA levels were 1 to 2 log lower than SLC4A4, A7 and A8. Taken together, we believe there is not strong enough evidence that allows us to rule out other members of the SLC4A family, especially SLC4A7 and SLC4A8. Thus, in the manuscript we have added these data as Figure 1—figure supplement1G, edited the main text, and discussed these results further in the Discussion section (lines 228-231).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In this setting, S0859 did not affect the Fsk-induced change in I<sub>sc</sub>. This result suggests that there may be other mechanisms that the epithelium uses to accumulate bicarbonate intracellularly in order to maintain Fsk-induced bicarbonate secretion. There are a number of possibilities, including, other NBCs that may not be inhibited by S0859 (see point 1 above), as well as the generation of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> via intracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA), when the NBC is inhibited.

This is why we studied the effect of NBC inhibition in a more physiologically relevant condition, i.e. under thin film condition using normal physiological solutions (ASL pH measurements) and a murine model.

Recent work from Kim et al.,2021 (REF 11), compared relative CA12 mRNA expression between freshly isolated cells from CF bronchus to cultured CF and non-CF ALI grown bronchial cells. They showed that CA12 levels were ~ 2-fold higher in freshly isolated CF cells compared to CF cultured cells, but similar to non-CF cultured cells.

We have now added the following statement to the Methods section: Lane: 386-391;</p><p>“Changes in ASL pH (ΔASLpH) were calculated by averaging five time points (average pH over 25 min) before and 2hrs after the addition of the chemicals (Fsk/S0859).”</p><p>However, we would like to point out that the time taken to reach steady-state was actually less than 2hrs after the addition of Fsk. For comparison purposes, a better representation of the time taken to reach steady-state is to calculate the t<sub>1/2</sub> and we have presented these values in Figure 2. The t<sub>1/2</sub> for the effect of S0859 on resting and Fsk-stimulated ASL pH was 46 mins and 14 mins, respectively, whereas the t<sub>1/2</sub> for the effect of Fsk on resting and S0859inhibited ASL pH was 25 mins and 31 mins, respectively.</p><p>With regard to the different time scales between the pH<sub>i</sub> and ASL pH experiments, we would like to point out that making a ‘direct’ comparison is complicated for a number of reasons. (1) The experimental technique and conditions used to assess pH changes differed between the two measurements. For ASL pH, the cell cultures were maintained at the air-liquid interface with differentiation medium only on the basolateral side of the cultures, which was not perfused. Small aliquots of stock solutions of chemicals were manually added to the basolateral solution. For the pH<sub>i</sub> experiments, the cell cultures were submerged in buffer and continuously perfused apically and basolaterally. Exchange times for solution changes in these pHi expts were ~ 1 min. (2) For the pH<sub>i</sub> experiments, intracellular acidification was induced by increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, whereas for the ASL pH expts, changes in ASL pH were induced by adding agonists/inhibitors to the nonperfused basolateral compartment. In separate (new) experiments, when CO<sub>2</sub> levels were acutely increased from 0.1 % to 5.0 %, ASL acidified with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 6.7 mins (n=3 – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>), considerably faster than the agonist-induced changes. (3) For the ASL pH experiments, although the apical surface was washed 24hr before experiments started, these epithelial cells produce mucus, which accumulates in the ASL over the 24 hr period, and very likely increases the buffering capacity of the luminal surface, thereby slowing pH changes. Indeed, Kim et al., (JEM, 2021) recently showed that adding purified mucin to washed ALI cultures significantly slowed ASL pH changes induced by CO<sub>2</sub> removal by ~ 80%. (4) The cultured cells also express multiple carbonic anhydrases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> – Results from the RNA-seq study), and other transporters that will also impact the kinetics of responses. We are not aware of any reports which have directly compared the activity of cytosolic carbonic anhydrases versus extracellular CAs, but this is also an important factor to consider, as CA activity has pronounced effects on pH kinetics (Kim et al., JEM. 2021; REF 11). Overall, both technically, and experimentally ASL pH changes would be expected to take longer to elicit a response.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>A.

It looks as if some effects are not fully reversible (Figure S3G)?

However we found reversibility to be variable between experiments. We have changed the figure for a different trace where it is possible to observe that the effect of S0859 is more reversible than in the original trace.

In relation to the central thesis that pH is central in the development of the CF mucus phenotype, is there any evidence of changes to mucus rheology in the hAEC cultures accompanying the changes in pH?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not measured mucus rheology in hAECs after treatment with S0859. However, Tang et al. 2016 (JCI 126(3); 879-891; REF 49). They observed increased viscosity of the ASL (including mucins) obtained from cell cultures of human AECs and pig AECs affected by CF (FIGURE 2). The increased viscosity parallels with a lower pH compared with cultured cells isolated from non-CF pigs (FIGURE 4). We have added this evidence and corresponding reference in the Discussion at Lane 283-284</p><p>“For example, hAEC from CF patients produce acidic ASL and mucus that is more viscous than in cells from non-CF donors (49).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The authors pursue an experiment to determine whether there is &quot;an active NCBT under resting conditions&quot;. But surely Isc measurements are not really made under resting conditions as the ASL is essentially flooded and the ionic composition on the apical side is not likely to match that of a normal ASL. This will affect ion driving forces etc. Could the authors consider this point?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these conditions did not represent resting conditions.

Figure 2C: In the cells pretreated with S0859 Fsk exposure seems to induce a transient small acidification. When compared to that acidified value, the ensuing pH recovery seems comparable to that observed for cells not pretreated with S0859. Can the authors comment on the likely mechanism of this phenomenon?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the transient acidification seen in the S0859 treated cell was an artefact, as this did not occur in all experiments, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>. This figure shows individual ASL pH recordings in S0859-treated hAECs obtained from 9 independent experiments. We can see that only two experiments (panels D and E) showed a transient acidification following forskolin addition to the basolateral medium. Note that the peaks observed at the time of addition of forskolin are due to the drop in CO<sub>2</sub> (from 5% to air) when the plates were removed from the plate-reader in order to treat the cells.</p><p>If it isn’t an artefact, this acidification could be due to concurrent Fsk-stimulated H<sup>+</sup> secretion (as shown by Shah et al., (2016) in pig and human airway epithelial cells in the absence of HCO3/CO<sub>2</sub>). In DMSO treated cells, this would be masked by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion (driven by accumulated intracellular HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). In S0859-treated cells, cytoplasmic HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulation is decreased, and thus H<sup>+</sup> secretion into the ASL would be transiently visible.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Individual ASL pH measurements in S0859-treated primary hAECs show that forskolin (FSK) only induced a transient acidification, before the subsequent alkalinisation, in 2 out of 9 independent experiments (panels D and E).</title><p>Note that the peaks observed at the time of addition of the forskolin are due to the drop in CO<sub>2</sub> when the plates were removed from the plate-reader in order to treat the cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75871-sa2-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

SLC4A4, A5 and A8 are the major NCBTs expressed in the primary hAECs (Figure S1A). In my view the arguments used to exclude A5 and A8 as candidate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> importers (l. 298-301) are weak because (i) the fact that transepithelial HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport generates a Isc does not prove that the importer is electrogenic (cf. Cl<sup>-</sup> secretory currents mediated through the electroneutral NKCC1 importer), and (ii) the localization of SLC4A5 in the apical membrane of renal epithelial cells does not rule out a basolateral localization in airway cells (cf. the opposite polarization of AE2 in intestinal vs. bile duct cells and of CA12 in salivary duct vs. airway surface cells). Does the SLC4A4 inhibitor S0859, at 30 μm concentration, also inhibit A5 or A8? Are other candidate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters or channels , e.g. Bestrophins, expressed too in primary hAECs?</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1A-D: The size of the S0859-inhibitable Isc (representing a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretory current) in the hAECs is very small (~1 uAmp/cm2) in comparison with anion current measurements in similar cell models reported previously (e.g. refs. 14, 27: ~20 uAmp/cm2). This is remarkable because the conditions used (Cl<sup>-</sup> free buffer) is optimal for de-inhibition of NBCe1-B activity that is known to act as a Cli sensor through its 2 GXXXP motifs (Shcheynikov et al. 2015 PNAS 112: E329-37). To judge better about the quality of the hAEC monolayers in culture, one would like to know how the inclusion of Cl<sup>-</sup>, or CFTR activation by forskolin (affecting the ASL pH; Figure 2) in the perfusion medium affects Isc measurements in the Ussing chamber, and to what extent S0859 inhibits forskolin-stimulated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> currents.</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2, G-J: In the hAEC monolayers SLC4A4 seems to be co-expressed with acetylated tubulin in ciliated cells. However it is unclear how many other cell types (CC10-positive Club cells; ionocytes; goblet cells) are retrieved in these human airway cell cultures. In both mouse bronchi and bronchioles (Suppl. Figure 4C) and in differentiated hAECs in the Welsh lab (ref. 15) CFTR (and pendrin) are expressed mainly in CC10+-secretory (Club) cells, not in ciliated cells. This raises the question whether SLC4A4 is also expressed in human Club cells and whether Club cells rather than ciliated cells are the major sources of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secreted into the ASL.</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3 A-C: Can the authors explain why the IBMX/forskolin/cAMP-induced anion current, in contrast to the UTP/ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced current, is not reduced in bicarbonate-free buffer, i.e. does not seem to have a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> component? In mouse trachea, most if not all Fsk/cAMP-induced anion secretory current is CaCC-mediated, so there is a priori no reason why forskolin-induced currents would not be reduced (at least in part) in a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> free buffer.</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure S3D-F: Assuming that the CaCC inhibitor AO1 completely blocks CaCCs and the IBMX/Fsk-induced Isc, how do the authors explain that subsequent addition of S0859 further inhibits a &quot;basal&quot; HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretory current? Does HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exits the cell at the apical side through tonically active CFTR, or through an electrogenic HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> exchanger (but pendrin is electroneutral)?</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3, D-E, Figure S3A and D, and l. 350: The cause of the transient negative change in Isc elicited by S0859 remains to be identified. Could it be that the compound has transient off-target effects on the intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> level, or activates basolateral K<sup>+</sup> channels? It is remarkable that similar deflections are not seen in human AECs (Figure 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. How close do the hAECs used in this study recapitulate the airways in situ? For example, are CA12 (cf. ref. 11) or ATP12A (cf. ref. 7) highly expressed in these cultures?</p><p>8. The systemic Slc4a4 null-mouse model used in this study is known to suffer from many abnormalities, including severe metabolic acidosis due to pRTA (l. 471-480). Whether the reduced level of plasma HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> contributes to the lack of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion and reduced ASL pH in the trachea of the Slc4a4-/- mouse (l. 475) depends on the affinity of the NBCe1 transporter for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions. Therefore it is of interest to learn whether the transporter is already saturated at 5 mM HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, or needs higher serosal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels, e.g. 24 mM.</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. L. 496: I agree that an airway-specific Slc4a4 null mouse model created by Cre-Lox technology would be of further help in studying the pathogenesis of muco-obstructive diseases of the lungs. In particular a comparison of Club cell-specific vs. ciliated cell-specific Slc4a4-/- mouse models would be useful to study the functional importance of SLC4A4 in each cell type in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Answered in the essential revisions section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors show some nice amplification of SLC4A bands and report that both SLC4A7 and SLC4A10 had very low expression levels, referring the reader to Figure S1A. However, it looks as if the expression of SLC4A7 could be quite reasonable in this figure.

The authors provide evidence supporting the expression of several members of the SLC4A family of transporters in human airway epithelial cells. Although S0859 is a blocker of SLC4A4, is it selective for SLC4A4 or is it possible other members of the SLC4A family might be blocked by this drug and contributing to some of the observed effects e.g. ASL pH changes?
