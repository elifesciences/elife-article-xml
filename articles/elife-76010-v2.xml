characterization of key processes involved in stem cell and tissue homeostasis. However, these organ culture techniques have been limited to imaging sessions of <underline>&lt;</underline>16 hours, an interval too short to track dynamic processes such as damage responses and regeneration, which can unfold over several days. Therefore, we developed an organ explant culture protocol capable of sustaining midguts ex vivo for up to 3 days. This was made possible by the formulation of a culture medium specifically designed for adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues with an increased Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio and trehalose concentration, and by placing midguts at an air-liquid interface for enhanced oxygenation. We show that midgut progenitor cells can respond to gut epithelial damage ex vivo, proliferating and differentiating to replace lost cells, but are quiescent in healthy intestines. Using ex vivo gene induction to promote stem cell proliferation using <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> or <italic>string</italic> and <italic>Cyclin E</italic> overexpression, we demonstrate that progenitor cell lineages can be traced through multiple cell divisions using live imaging. We show that the same culture set-up is useful for imaging adult renal tubules and ovaries for up to 3 days and hearts for up to 10 days. By enabling both long-term imaging and real-time ex vivo gene manipulation, our simple culture protocol provides a powerful tool for studies of epithelial biology and cell lineage behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut</kwd><kwd>organ culture</kwd><kwd>live-imaging</kwd><kwd>tissue regeneration</kwd><kwd>cell lineage</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 140900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edgar</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM124434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edgar</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA042014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edgar</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An improved culture method for explanted adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> organs allows the live-imaging of damage response, cell differentiation, and tracing of progenitor cell lineages through multiple rounds of division.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endo- and ectodermal epithelia comprise essential interfaces between an organism and its environment. As such, they form a first line of defense that is frequently subjected to diverse types of insult. This situation requires that epithelia be able to mount appropriate responses. This is possible in part due to the action of resident stem cells which, through their ability to self-renew and produce differentiated progeny, allow epithelia to regenerate both structurally and functionally. The adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> midgut is a prime example of this as its population of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are able to interpret signals from their surrounding environment such as cytokines released by neighboring damaged enterocytes (EC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beebe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). When this interaction occurs, normally quiescent stem cells rapidly respond to the needs of the tissue, proliferating and stimulating the differentiation of their progeny to replace lost cells, thus repairing the damaged epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The understanding of epithelial biology has been greatly advanced by protocols for the ex vivo culture and imaging of tissues and organs. For example, mammalian intestinal organoids have advanced the field by easily allowing the direct observation of stem cell behavior, without the need for intravital imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato et al., 2009</xref>). Several protocols have been developed for the live-imaging of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues and organs such as imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robb, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zartman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Handke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Strassburger et al., 2017</xref>), larval brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Siller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rabinovich et al., 2015</xref>), ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fichelson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morris and Spradling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reilein et al., 2018</xref>), testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng and Hunt, 2009</xref>) and, more recently, adult midguts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>). The small size of fruit flies makes it possible to culture whole intact organs.</p><p>However, in contrast to mammalian tissues, many of which are easily cultured for long periods, most <italic>Drosophila</italic> organ cultures are limited in time to less than a day. This reflects an incomplete understanding of the culture conditions required to fully sustain explanted <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. Current approaches for the live-imaging of the fly midgut are limited to 16 hr of imaging due to the poor survival of explanted tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>). Moreover, temperature-sensitive gene expression, knock-down, and knock outs, some of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics strongest assets, cannot currently be implemented in combination with extended live-imaging because the elevated temperature further limits tissue viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To address these limitations, we developed an improved ex vivo culture system for the live-imaging of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts. Our culture system employs a novel tissue culture medium tailored to the needs of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and organs, and culture at an air-media interface to ensure optimal oxygenation. The technique has a straightforward design, allowing multiple samples to be prepared quickly and reproducibly. The setup allows the researcher to image up to 12 midguts simultaneously during live-imaging sessions of 48â72 hr. As the guts are fully explanted from the animal, every region of the organ is clearly available for imaging, thus expanding the number of questions that can be addressed. We show that, while in healthy explanted intestines progenitor cells are quiescent, midguts can still respond to damage ex vivo, with progenitors proliferating and differentiating in response to tissue damage. Our protocol can also be used in conjunction with temperature-sensitive gene expression or knock-down. We demonstrate this by genetically driving progenitor cell proliferation. Moreover, due to the extended live-imaging window our protocol allows, we were able to follow cells undergoing multiple rounds of mitosis. By combining a long 48â72 hr imaging window and the possibility to use advanced <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic tools, we provide a useful tool to probe and understand the biology of epithelial tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A system for the long-term culture of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts</title><p>Current live-imaging protocols for the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut are limited to 16 hr imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>). To extend the survival of midguts ex vivo we developed a novel culture setup. The method is based on common available techniques for the culture of adult organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Handke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reilein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>) but it includes a refinement of several steps: (1) the dissection procedure was optimized to reduce tissue damage; (2) explanted organs are cultured in a sandwiched structure of agarose, rather than in a dome; (3) midguts are placed at a liquid-air interface for improved oxygenation; (4) the culture media has been adjusted to better approximate adult hemolymph. Please see the Materials and methods section step-by-step descriptions of the procedure.</p><p>We found that the dissection technique is a key parameter in extending the viability of explanted midguts. Indeed, any stress (e.g. pulling and thus stretching the gut, pinching, etc...) introduced during dissection results in structural damage which lead to breaks of the epithelium during prolonged culture. Hence, we have optimized the dissection procedure to limit the handling of the midgut and thus the risk of damaging it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâN</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sample preparation for live-imaging.</title><p>(<bold>AâN</bold>) Minimal handling dissection used to gently explant adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts, limiting the risk of damaging the intestines.

Immobilization in gels is a common solution for ex vivo culture of organs and tissues, and is especially important to provide stability for live-imaging applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Handke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reilein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>). For the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut specifically, an agarose gel also minimizes the effects of peristaltic movements, which, if uncontrolled, will impair imaging and can lead to epithelial tearing. Our approach is a slight departure from previously published techniques for <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Handke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reilein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>) in that explanted midguts are transferred to evenly spaced thin agarose pads and then covered with an additional layer of agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). This sandwiched structure allows the guts to be held in place for imaging, while also protecting them from damage that can result from their contact with the culture chamber walls if left freely floating. The agarose pads can be reproducibly cast and are thin enough (~100 Âµm) not to interfere with imaging. Moreover, each agarose pad can comfortably house up to 3 midguts, allowing the multiple imaging of several explanted intestines. The agarose pads have the additional function of elevating the midguts from the bottom of the imaging chamber so that the surface of the agarose structure is directly exposed to air, creating an air-liquid interface. This is a key design element of the setup, as proper oxygenation was found to be essential for the long-term survival of explanted midguts (data not shown), similarly to what had been previously observed for the culture of wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Strassburger et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, during dissection the trachea surrounding the intestine are severed and can no longer oxygenate the intestinal epithelium.</p><p>To increase the stability of the setup, agarose bridges connect each agarose sandwich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>, middle panel), allowing the sample to endure 3 days of continuous imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>). Moreover, using a microscope equipped with an incubation chamber to control evaporation removes the need to replenish the imaging vessel with fresh culture medium. As such, the culture system, despite its simple design, is highly efficient and well suited for long-term imaging experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A custom culture medium sustains the midgut ex vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Incorporation of the cell-impermeable dye NucGreen shows the levels of midgut cell death ex vivo in midguts cultured in: standard Schneiderâs medium (SM), modified Schneiderâs medium (MSM), MSM with 10% added fetal calf serum (FCS), MSM including co-culture with fat bodies and ovaries (FbO), culture in fly extract prepared in MSM (FeMSM), and the combination of all these conditions (Complete).

Our tests showed that supplementing the culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) did not have a significant beneficial effect on the midgut epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but we did notice that FBS addition resulted in the visceral muscle remaining intact and capable of peristalsis for longer (data not shown). Not surprisingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and Shearn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>), co-culturing explanted midguts with ovaries and abdomens lined with fat body (adipocytes) could also decrease cell death ex vivo. This effect was not due to the sequestration of NucGreen by ovaries and adipocytes as the dye was supplemented at a saturating concentration and its incorporation in these organs/tissues was mostly limited to areas mechanically damaged during dissection. As ovaries and fat bodies may enhance the survival of explanted midguts by secreting growth factors and/or nutrients, we reasoned that fly extract might have a similar effect. Indeed, midguts cultured in 100% fly extract prepared using modified Schneiderâs medium had greatly reduced rates of cell death over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The calcium blocker isradipine was also added to the medium to reduce peristaltic movements, improving midgut survival and imaging. This drug did not have a noticeable long-term effect on visceral muscle viability. Indeed, its effect appeared to wear off after 48â72 hr, at which point the visceral muscle resumed regular peristalsis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Lastly, as we designed the medium for the purpose of extended live-imaging, we also added N-acetyl cysteine and sodium citrate as antioxidant agents to reduce phototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Icha et al., 2017</xref>). The former is an antioxidant widely used in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">EzeriÅa et al., 2018</xref>). Citrate is also known to have antioxidant properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) and to be present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemolymph at detectable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Echalier et al., 2018</xref>). Combining all the findings mentioned above resulted in culture conditions (see Materials and methods) that minimized cell death and allowed the live-imaging of explanted midguts for up to 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>), a significant improvement over previously published culture protocols for the

We did not notice signs of phototoxicity with any of these microscope types in samples imaged for 48 hr, but acquisition parameters had to be chosen with care. For example, by optimizing laser power and dwell time, single intestines could be imaged at high frame-rates (15 min) without noticeable phototoxicity for at least 48 hr even with a confocal microscope (Video 5). However, we found confocal imaging to be less optimal than widefield microscopy for high frame-rate imaging due to the longer acquisition time required for multiple midguts in a single sample.</p><p>In examining cultured midguts, we observed the accumulation of luminal contents (<italic>i.e</italic>. previously ingested food) in the posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, white arrows). This appeared to be caused by peristaltic movements of the visceral muscle which persisted despite the use of the calcium blocker isradipine, although this drug suppressed them significantly. These areas were found to darken and expand over the course of culture, an effect we attribute to the growth of enteric bacteria, which eventually caused cell death and tissue damage. We found that feeding flies fresh food in the days prior to an experiment and a short (~3â6 hr) starvation prior to dissection reduced the negative effect of food accumulation and growth of enteric bacteria. Supplementing the culture medium with antibiotics also enhanced explanted midgut survival. Lastly, it is reasonable to assume that axenically reared flies should be immune to the issue of growing enteric bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transgenic gene expression in midgut explant culture</title><p>One of the most striking features of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a research model is the wide range of readily available genetic tools, allowing the cell-type-specific and temporally-controlled activation or suppression of expression of genes of interest. The possibility to use such genetic tools in a live-imaging setup is highly advantageous, but so far the temporal control of gene expression ex vivo has proven unfeasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). To further assay the behavior of midgut cells in explanted organs, we tested the induction of UAS-GFP by cell type-specific, temperature-sensitive Gal4 drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâE</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brand and Perrimon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>). As expected, midguts explanted from flies grown at the restrictive temperature (18 Â°C) did not show any GFP expression (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, left panels). However, when incubated at the permissive temperature (29 Â°C) at 0 hr after explant (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, right panels), they started expressing the UAS-GFP transgene. Moreover, GFP expression could also be induced in intestines cultured at 18 Â°C for 24 hr and then shifted to the permissive temperature (29 Â°C), indicating that the epithelium remains viable and genetically functional long-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, the GFP intensity in midguts cultured at 29 Â°C for 24 hr from the time of dissection was similar between in vivo and ex vivo conditions for both progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) using the <italic>escargot</italic>- (<italic>esg</italic>) and <italic>mex</italic>-Gal4 Gal80<sup>TS</sup> driver lines, respectively. This indicates that transcription and protein synthesis are maintained at normal levels in our culture system and shows that this system can be used to assay the effects of transgene induction in real time. Interestingly, progenitor cells were found to be asynchronous in their expression of the reporter GFP (Figure 4Aand <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>). Usually, the first GFP + cells were detected at 8â10 hr after temperature shift, though some cells achieved detectable GFP levels only 20 hr after that. Overall, if the shift to 29 Â°C coincided with the start of imaging, all progenitor cells usually expressed detectable levels of GFP by the 36 hr time-point. This could be explained by variations in the activity of the <italic>esg</italic> promoter or by different global rates of transcription and translation, which in turn could be indicative of different cell states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Progenitor cells require stimulation to proliferate and differentiate</title><p>When imaging explanted adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts we observed <italic>esg</italic>-expressing progenitor cells (ISCs and EBS) to be quiescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3âvideo 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3âvideo 4</xref>).

Via cell tracking we also observed that GFP-labeled progenitor cells did not divide in healthy explanted intestines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is important to note that in said healthy intestines we did not observe cell death or enterocyte (EC) extrusion events until after 48â72 hr of culture. As healthy enterocytes are known to suppress ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2017</xref>), this may explain the lack of cell division in our explants.

To confirm that this capability is maintained ex vivo, we fed female flies Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mixed with solid fly food at a final concentration of 0.2% (v/w) for 18 hr. Following this treatment, the flies were fed 0.05% sucrose in aqueous solution on a cotton pad for an additional 4â6 hr prior to dissection, in order to flush the SDS from the gut. This protocol caused only mild initial tissue damage, and was advantageous as it did not result in the retention of high levels of SDS in explanted guts. However, by mixing the SDS-laced food with a blue food-safe dye, we found that some low amounts of SDS-laced food do persist in the lumen of intestines at the time of dissection. The transient exposure to SDS and the low amounts retained in the lumen resulted in gradual EC death and/or extrusion, allowing the live-imaging of damage response. When imaged, intestines from SDS-fed flies showed progenitor cells that become highly motile, similar to what was recently observed in similarly damaged intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2021</xref>) . ISC proliferation events could also be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, ISC mitoses could generally be observed only in cases where tissue damage was extensive, as evidenced by the appearance of pyknotic or fragmented nuclei and the extrusion of multiple (&gt;3) contiguous ECs. As this tended to happen towards late time-points after dissection, only a few (1-2) mitotic events per imaged field could be observed with this damage protocol. In addition to ISC divisions, many progenitor cells could be observed growing in nuclear size while simultaneously losing GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and EâG</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3âvideo 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3âvideo 4</xref>) indicative of differentiation events towards the EC identity. Indeed, differentiating progenitor cells could be seen replacing dying enterocytes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3âvideo 3</xref>).</p><p>We then tested whether these observations could be made in an in vivo condition. Before dissection, flies were fed either a control diet or SDS-laced food as described above. Flies dissected at later time-points (i.e. 24 and 48 h after the initial SDS feeding) where kept on fresh food, thus allowing the intestine to clear any trace of SDS and recover. This is different to the ex vivo condition, where a small amount of SDS is retained in the lumen and continues to damage the intestine during imaging. Although we found it impossible and impractical to perfectly match the luminal SDS content in vivo and ex vivo, the in vivo condition did confirm our ex vivo observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). After SDS feeding, we observed several esg + cells with larger nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-B</xref>). At later time-points many differentiating cells with large nuclei and low GFP expression were also present, similarl to what was observed ex vivo. Moreover, similarly to explanted midguts, proliferative cells could be found almost exclusively at 48 hr after the end of the SDS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of the SDS-feeding protocol described above is that midguts were damaged prior to imaging. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the observed differentiation events were EBs that were poised to differentiate prior to SDS feeding, and then differentiated due to the damage stimulus. To confirm that, at the time of damage, pre-existing EBs were indeed capable of responding to tissue stress, we used a thin tungsten needle to create a small lesion in explanted intestines. The lesions perforated both visceral muscle and epithelial layers, but left the peritrophic matrix intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Intestines were then enveloped in agarose and imaged within 20â of the time of damage. Similarly to the SDS damage protocol, we were able to record progenitor cells both dividing and differentiating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video5">Figure 3âvideo 5</xref>). Moreover, wounding stimulated the robust expression of the cytokine Unpaired 3 (Upd3), whose function in midgut damage response is well documented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video6">Figure 3âvideo 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video7">Figure 3âvideo 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>All in all, our observations suggest that both ISCs and EBs are quiescent in undamaged intestines. While previous studies did show varying rates of ISC proliferation in healthy midguts in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reiff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de NavascuÃ©s et al., 2012</xref>), this may be attributed to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2017</xref>) as well as the passage of food through the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>), both of which do not occur in our midgut cultures until later time-points (i.e. after 48â72 hr). Moreover, several previous studies used lineage-tracing tools requiring a 37 Â°C heat shock for their activation, a treatment known to induce ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beebe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de NavascuÃ©s et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shaw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>). Indeed, in the presence of tissue damage, progenitor cells could be robustly activated in explanted intestines, indicating that both ISCs and EBs are capable of responding to their environment after organ explant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of <italic>Notch</italic> drives tumorigenesis ex vivo</title><p>A key pathway necessary for progenitor cell differentiation is the <italic>Delta</italic>/Notch signaling that occurs between ISCs and adjacent EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). The depletion of <italic>Notch</italic> (N) by RNA interference (<italic>N<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) in esg<sup>+</sup> cells has been shown to promote the formation of undifferentiated tumor-like masses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>).

Consistent with this, when we explanted midguts from flies expressing N<sup>RNAi</sup> in progenitor cells for 24 h prior to dissection and cultured them for 48 hr, we did not observe tumorigenesis in the absence of tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video8">Figure 3âvideo 8</xref>). However, when guts were accidentally damaged during dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>, yellow ellipses), esg<sup>+</sup> cells started to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>, yellow squares, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video9">Figure 3âvideo 9</xref>).

When explanted midguts were shifted to the permissive temperature (29 Â°C) at the start of imaging, progenitor cells, marked by GFP co-expressed with <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>, started to rapidly proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). About 20% of progenitor cells tracked from the moment they expressed visible amounts of GFP till the end of the imaging session, were seen proliferating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The progeny of observed mitoses were not counted for this analysis. However, since many cells were not trackable for the duration of the imaging session due to major tissue rearrangements, we may be underscoring the percentage of proliferative GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. As GFP<sup>+</sup> cells accumulated in the tissue, enterocytes were displaced and extruded from the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, yellow arrowhead, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4âvideo 2</xref>). Interestingly, some GFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells did not proliferate, but their nuclei rapidly grew in size, which aligns with the previously reported role of EGFR signaling in promoting EB growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, these rapidly growing progenitors also lost GFP expression during the course of imaging, which suggests their differentiation towards the EC lineage.</p><p>The extended live-imaging that our protocol allows also permitted us to follow cells through multiple rounds of mitosis. Using manual 3-dimensional (3D) cell tracking, we reconstructed the lineages of 17 dividing cells that expressed <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5âvideo 1</xref> for an example). As ISCs are the only cell type in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine that normally divide multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), the founding cells in these lineages were most likely ISCs. However, a recent work suggested that Ras<sup>G12V</sup> can push a small number of EBs to de-differentiate to an ISC state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). We directly measured the duration of progenitorsâ cell cycle in these lineages to be 8Â±2.76 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, of 17 <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>-expressing ISC lineages characterized, one had divisions where both daughter cells from the first recorded division were seen dividing further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). For simplicity, pairs of dividing daughter cells will be henceforth be referred to as âco-dividing siblingsâ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâB</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6âvideo 1</xref> for an example). These are most likely symmetric divisions that give rise to two new ISCs. However, since we did not track differentiation markers in our lineages, other possibilities cannot be excluded. For example, after being generated from an ISC division, enteroendocrine (EE) progenitors are also known to divide once to give rise to two mature EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we cannot exclude that cells that were not observed to divide during our imaging session would not divide again, given enough time.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Example of a reconstructed ISC lineage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-lapse of a single Ras<sup>G12V</sup>-expressing ISC undergoing multiple rounds of mitoses.

For this we used the <italic>esg<sup>TS</sup></italic> driver to co-express <italic>string</italic> (<italic>stg</italic>), a <italic>Cdc25C</italic> homolog, and <italic>Cyclin E</italic> (<italic>CycE</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>). String directly activates Cdk1 to promote mitosis, whereas CycE directly activates Cdk2 to promote DNA replication and S-phase progression. The combined expression of these two gene products is sufficient to strongly induce ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kohlmaier et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, Stg and CycE have also been shown to promote EB mitoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kohlmaier et al., 2015</xref>), although much less strongly than in ISCs. The fraction of progenitor cells that divided in response to <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> co-expression (~25%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) was not significantly different from that observed after forced expression of Ras<sup>G12V</sup>, suggesting that all receptive progenitors are activated in both cases. However, co-dividing siblings appeared in 6 of 12 ISC lineages that overexpressed <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), a significantly higher frequency to the 1 of 17 observed after <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> overexpression (p=0.0106, Fisherâs exact test).

For seven of these, sibling cells divided within 2 hr of each other, while for one pair the interval was 5 hr. Based on this, we looked for divisions where one sibling cell was seen dividing further, while the other remained quiescent for the remainder of the experiment, which had to last at least 6 hr after the sisterâs mitotic event (i.e. the second division in the lineage). For simplicity, pairs of siblings with this behavior will be henceforth be referred to as ânon-co-dividing siblingsâ. These are most likely asymmetric divisions that give rise to an ISC/EB pair. However, since specific cell fate markers were not assayed in our experiments, this cannot be verified. Moreover, we cannot exclude that both cells would not eventually divide, given enough time. Regardless, the behavior of these daughter pairs was indeed distinct from that of co-dividing siblings described above. Following this definition, we classified 17 sibling pairs as non-co-dividing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6âvideo 2</xref> for an example), 9 from <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>- and 8 from <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic>-expressing guts. Interestingly, for 8 of these 17 pairs, the non-dividing cells displayed increases in nuclear size over time, and also lost GFP expression, which is indicative of differentiation towards the EC cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and GâH</xref>). This behavior was not observed for co-dividing siblings, where both cells increased their nuclear size before dividing further, but maintained GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and EâF</xref>). Hence, future studies using our culture and imaging techniques in conjunction with differentiation markers should be able to discern new details about ISC differentiation.</p><p>It was previously reported that spindle orientation is indicative of whether an ISC mitosis is asymmetric or symmetric, with symmetric divisions being planar relative to the visceral muscle layer, and asymmetric divisions displacing one daughter cell apically, away from the visceral muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>). As we restricted the interval between subsequent imaging frames to 1 h to reduce phototoxicity, we were not able to measure spindle orientations. However, it has been proposed that the orientation of the mitotic spindle results in daughter cells residing at different levels within the pseudostratified intestinal epithelium, with new-born EBs being more apical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). We therefore selected mitotic events that occurred in regions of epithelium that were flat with reference to the imaging plane (based on cell nuclei positions). The 3D profile of sister cells after mitosis was then reconstructed and we measured the angles between sister cells. Measured angles were found to be &lt;15Â° in 29/33 cases for <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>- and in 30/32 cases for <italic>stg +CycE</italic>-induced mitoses. Moreover, no significant differences in sister cell angles were observed between co-dividing and non-co-dividing siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâC</xref>). These observations do not support that view that apical displacement of daughter cells is associated with EB fate specification. However, as we did not image the mitotic spindle during mitosis, it is possible that spindles were oriented differently in divisions giving rise to the two sibling pair types, but that this difference in orientation was lost after cytokinesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Analysis of non-co-dividing and co-dividing siblings in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Angle between daughter cells after mitosis as referenced to the imaging plane.

Due to some cells having cell cycles lasting less than 8 hr, we only considered the first six 1 hr time-points following the appearance of a sister pair (defined as time-point 0). Measuring the distance between sister cells at each time interval, we found that cells in non-co-dividing pairs remained close to one another until the following mitotic event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, red line). Cells in co-dividing pairs, however, moved apart from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, green line). These behaviors could be observed even when considering unequal and co-dividing siblings in the same lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7EâF</xref>). If co-division and non-co-division are indeed indicative of symmetric and asymmetric division, respectively, this observation suggests that commitment to differentiation, as occurs after asymmetric divisions, requires that sister cells remain in contact for ~3â5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>, red line). This is in line with previous measurements of <italic>Notch</italic> activation dynamics in differentiating EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, rapid separation of sister cells following a division may be necessary to generate a symmetric division that duplicates ISCs.</p><p>Differences in the motility of co-dividing and non-co-dividing siblings could explain these observed effects. We therefore measured cell motility as the distance in 3D space that a cell travelled between one time-point and the next. We found that the genotype used to induce proliferation did not have an effect on the cell motility of either sibling type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Likewise, no difference in cell motility was found when considering the effect of time on cell movement of non-co-dividing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>) or co-dividing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) siblings. Therefore, we directly compared the motility of both pair types irrespective of genotype or time-point analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), but also found no significant difference. This indicates that cells of both pair types migrate within the epithelium at similar speeds. Since non-co-dividing siblings tend to remain close to one another over time, their movement is most likely random. On the other hand, since the distance between co-dividing siblings increases over time, their movement is likely more directional, such that cells in a sibling pair move away from each other. It would therefore be expected that, when considering co-dividing pairs, the relative movement of one cell to its sister should be greater than that observed for non-co-dividing pairs. We therefore considered the motion of sister pairs, decomposing their movement in X- and Y-axis components and summed the resulting vectors, thus calculating the movement of a cell relative to its sister along the X- and Y-axis. As expected, the magnitudes of the reconstructed relative movements between co-dividing pairs was significantly greater than that for non-co-dividing pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). This confirms that the movement of co-dividing cell pairs was directional, with the two cells moving away from one another right after division.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Ex vivo culture of other adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> organs</title><p>To test the feasibility of our culture setup to sustain other adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> organs, we first focused on the Malpighian (renal) tubules.

In recent years this system has been enriched by the development of advanced live-imaging approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>) that allow the observation of adult midguts for up to 16 hr. However, many biologically interesting processes, for instance regeneration, occur over longer time-spans, and so methods for extended culture and live-imaging should prove advantageous.</p><p>Several factors could cause the limited survival of midguts ex vivo. Firstly, currently available <italic>Drosophila</italic> culture media are based on larval hemolymph composition. We have shown here that minimal modifications to Schneiderâs medium are sufficient to reduce cell death ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Midguts may also receive nutrients and signaling molecules from other organs such as ovaries and fat body, which are in close proximity to the intestine. Indeed, using fly extract as a culture medium and co-culturing intestines with ovaries and fly abdomens resulted in dramatic decreases in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Proper oxygenation is also a concern as it had been found to be essential for other <italic>Drosophila</italic> organ ex vivo cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Strassburger et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, trachea ramify throughout the flyâs internal organs, and in the intestine they even reach through the visceral muscle to contact epithelial cells directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we designed our culture setup to keep guts elevated and close to the surface of the culture medium at a liquid-air interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which we found to be important for proper tissue oxygenation. Moreover, the sample setup was designed to be efficient and simple to construct for ease of reproducibility, allowing up to 12 explanted midguts to be imaged in parallel in a single dish. Lastly, prolonged live-imaging sessions can be hampered by phototoxicity. This can be resolved by reducing the intensity of the excitation light and exposure times, albeit at the cost of reduced signal/noise ratios and frame rates. Controlling each of these factors has allowed us to culture healthy explanted midguts for up to 3 days ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>), and other organs for even longer periods.</p><p>Using our system, we observed that, while midguts maintain their ability to respond to tissue stress ex vivo, progenitor cells in undamaged intestines are quiescent. Previous estimates of mitotic rates based on immunostaining for the mitotic marker phospho-Ser 10-Histone 3 generally showed a wide range of baseline values, with numbers as low as 1â3 mitoses per midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, even considering a low mitotic rate and using an estimate of mitosis duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>) and ISCs numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâBrien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2017</xref>), we expected to see several mitoses even in undamaged intestines (e.g. &gt;5 for fields with 50 or more <italic>esg</italic><sup>+</sup> cells). As ISC proliferation could be stimulated by tissue damage ex vivo, this suggests that, in homeostatic conditions, stem cells may only proliferate when the need to replace damaged or dying cells arises. Given the lack of cell death in undamaged midguts ex vivo, the previously reported proliferation-suppressive effect of enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2017</xref>) may be responsible for the lack of observed mitotic events. Interestingly, we also did not observed differentiation events in undamaged intestines, which suggest that enteroblasts are a stable cell type, rather than being transient progenitors that are present only during periods of rapid ISC division, and are rapidly lost via differentiation or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reiff et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, a previous analysis of the EB gene expression profile showed the existence of EB-specific genes, consistent with EBs being a distinct cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hung, 2020</xref>). As a consequence, the enteroblast pool may constitute a first line of response to tissue damage, that rapidly differentiate to generate new ECs, while buying time for stem cells to progress through the cell cycle.</p><p>Our culture system can also be used in combination with temperature-sensitive gene induction or knock-down tools, thus expanding its applications. When genetically stimulated by the expression of constitutively active <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>, ISCs proliferated rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4âvideo 2</xref>). Similarly, co-overexpression of <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> also resulted in ISC proliferation. These are strong genetic manipulations known to promote ISC proliferation. Glycine 12 mutations in KRAS, which result in the constitutive activation of the small GTPase, are among the most frequent mutations in colorectal and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prior et al., 2020</xref>). In the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine, this same mutation (G12V) has been shown to drive ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>), and EB growth and endoreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, a recent study suggested that a small subset of EBs could also be induced to proliferate by <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). Co-overexpression of <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> can also promote ISC proliferation by directly stimulating cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kohlmaier et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly to Ras<sup>G12V</sup>, this genetic stimulation could also drive EB proliferation, albeit not as strongly as in ISC. Itâs reasonable to assume that the EBs responsive to either <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> or <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> co-expression may be immature and still close to a stem cell state. When reconstructing cell lineages induced by these genetic manipulations, we observed divisions that gave rise to daughter cells with two distinct behaviors: (1) âco-dividingâ pairs in which both daughter cells divided again, like the progeny of symmetric divisions; and (2) ânon-co-dividingâ pairs in which only one daughter cell divided while the other did not for the remainder of the imaging session (&gt;6 h), as would be the case for the progeny of asymmetric divisions. By analyzing the reconstructed lineages, we found that upon <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> stimulation most lineages did not present co-dividing siblings. Interestingly, if co-dividing siblings were the result of symmetric divisions, this would be in accordance to the previously described prevalence of asymmetric division events in normal intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de NavascuÃ©s et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâBrien et al., 2011</xref>). This could suggest that the EGFR-Ras-Erk pathway may have a role in differentiation. Indeed, several progenitor cells, when stimulated by <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic>, did not divide, but rapidly grew in nuclear size and lost <italic>esg</italic> expression, which is indicative of EB to EC differentiation and a similar phenotype to what previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, Stg and CycE overexpression may suppress differentiation, resulting in the increased number of symmetric-like divisions we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>One major difference that we did observe between co-dividing and non-co-dividing siblings was in the behavior of sister cells. Non-co-dividing siblings remained close to one another for several hours after mitosis. This is significant as it is known that cell-cell contacts between progenitor cells are required for promoting differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>). Indeed, interactions between Notch on the surface of the EB and Delta expressed on the ISC surface is a strong promoter of EB to EC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). It was previously shown that EB differentiation via N activation requires several hours to resolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). This time frame matches our observations, which show non-co-dividing sister pairs remaining in contact for at least ~3â5 hr after division. Adherens junctions may be affecting these cell contacts as strong levels of shotgun (e-cadherin) and armadillo (Î²-catenin) are found in between ISC and EB pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). As EGFR signaling is known to impact adherens junctions remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">OâKeefe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robertson et al., 2012</xref>), this could help explain the prevalence of non-co-dividing siblings in cell lineages stimulated by <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> expression. Co-dividing pairs had the opposite behavior, and moved apart right after division. If co-dividing siblings were the result of symmetric division expanding the ISC pool, this would result in the dispersion of stem cells through the midgut. As symmetric divisions are known to occur during adaptive growth of the intestine, especially in the days after eclosion, this behavior could help explain how ISCs space themselves uniformly in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâBrien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite these successful applications, the system we developed still has limitations. The optimized dissection procedure limits midgut damage, but does not completely eliminate the risk. The agarose pads, albeit thin, can interfere with high powered objectives with short working distances (e.g. 40 X and above). Using thinner agarose pads could help to reduce the required working distance, but may result in hypoxia. This in turn could be solved by increasing the oxygen concentration using microscope incubation chambers equipped with an atmosphere control unit. Midgut survival ex vivo also seems to be limited by the growth of enteric bacteria, especially since, once dissected, midguts cannot properly move food through the intestine and defecate. Indeed, we observed that the visceral muscle, which is not in direct contact with luminal contents, could survive and contract regularly for up to a week in optimal conditions, despite the death of the adjacent epithelium. Generating axenic flies may help to further extend the survival of the midgut epithelium ex vivo. Newer, gentler imaging technologies such as light-sheet microscopy could also improve survival during live-imaging sessions by reducing phototoxicity. It s also possible that different organs may have specific requirements in terms of media composition and additives, in which case tailoring culture media to a specific organ may be beneficial. Indeed, even the same organ can have different requirements in male and female flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hudry et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, to limit mechanical damage to the intestines and to more easily image them, we used the calcium blocker isradipine to inhibit visceral muscle peristalsis. The lack of peristaltic contraction may have negative effect on midgut biology, aside from the retention of food and proliferating bacteria in the lumen. Indeed, it was previously reported that ISCs are sensitive to mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2018</xref>). If food passage itself can stimulate ISC proliferation, its inhibition could partially help to explain the lack of mitosis in healthy midguts ex vivo.</p><p>Nonetheless, the increased survival ex vivo our protocol allows is significant and we believe it can enable experiments that will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate epithelial homeostasis, such as the regulation of asymmetric and symmetric ISC division events. Our protocol may also provide a platform to dissect inter-organ interactions, given the positive effect that co-culture with ovaries and fat bodies had on midgut survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, Malpighian tubules, hearts, and ovaries did show increased survival when cultured with our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6âvideo 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6âvideo 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Finally, we believe that the possibility to visualize the effects of gene induction or silencing in real-time using fluorescent markers will be very useful for dissecting the roles of specific signaling pathway components and in modeling human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center 3605)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>esg-Gal4 tubGal80ts UAS-GFP / CyO; UAS-flp Act &gt;CD2&gt;Gal4/TM6</italic> B (PMID: 19563763)</p></list-item><list-item><p>esg-Gal4 Tub-Gal80<sup>TS</sup> UAS-nlsGFP / CyO</p></list-item><list-item><p>mex-Gal4 Tub-Gal80<sup>TS</sup> UAS-GFP / CyO</p></list-item><list-item><p>esg-Gal4 UAS-GFP</p></list-item><list-item><p>esg-Gal4 Tub-Gal80<sup>TS</sup> UAS-nlsGFP / CyO; His2Av-mRFP / TM6B</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>His2Av-mRFP</italic> (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center 23650)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>UAS-N<sup>RNAi</sup> / TM6B</italic> (PMID: 26237646)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>UAS-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> / CyO</italic> (PMID: 21167805)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>UAS-stg, UAS-CycE</italic> (PMID: 24975577)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>PCNA-GFP</italic> (Stefano Di Talia, Duke University Medical Center, USA)</p></list-item><list-item><p>His2Av-mRFP; PCNA-GFP</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fly rearing</title><p>Flies were raised on standard cornmeal and molasses fly food.

Freeing the midgut from ovaries and the abdominal cuticle is important for ease of handling and imaging and for proper oxygenation.

All possible permutations between f and f+1 coordinates are computed and the total distance between cell positions in frame f and their newly assigned positions in f+1 is calculated. The permutation for which this distance is minimum is then kept. If lineages are too complex (e.g. cells are moving and rearranging themselves), then the user can add two additional field to the input &quot;.tsv&quot; file (&quot;CellID&quot; and &quot;MotherID&quot; columns) indicating each cells ID (for each cell position) and its mother cell ID (can be stated once).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lucy O'Brien as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K Vijay Raghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Karen Bellec (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Either substantiate or revise interpretations of symmetric/asymmetric fate outcomes.</p><p>Because the movies use guts without markers for terminal fates, distinguishing asymmetric and symmetric outcomes is particularly challenging. Reviewers 1 and 3 felt that the criteria used to classify fate outcomes as symmetric or asymmetric were not sufficient to justify exclusion of the other outcome. Can the authors justify their interpretations, for instance by using midguts that express enteroblast- and enteroendocrine-specific markers? Alternately, if supporting evidence would not be available in a reasonable time frame, the authors are instead asked to describe the data in a manner that does not assign fate outcomes to division events that are ambiguous.</p><p>2) Clarify the use of nuclear size as a measure of enteroblast differentiation.</p><p>Reviewers 1 and 2 had questions about how nuclear size was used as a measure of enteroblast differentiation. For Figure 3 and Figure 4 movies, can the authors split the esg&gt;GFP and his::RFP channels so that the nuclei are visible? This is critical to see nuclear size. For Figures 5-7 movies, only esg&gt;GFP(nls?) is shown; can the his::RFP channel also be included? This is critical to evaluate that loss of GFP signal is not due to the trivial reason that the cell moved out of view. Can the authors provide data about the frequency of cell differentiation in the SDS movies? Can they provide additional examples of nuclear measurements for Figure 6E-H and Figure 7D-E (only one example of each type is shown)?</p><p>3) Provide additional information about organ viability in general and about ex vivo vs in vivo damage response.</p><p>Reviewers 1 and 2 raised some questions about organ viability. Can the authors provide data for the typical viability of midguts subjected to confocal imaging at frame rates more frequent than 1 hour? Can they comment on how trachea and muscle may be altered by ex vivo culture conditions? The authors develop an ingenious SDS pulse-chase injury protocol; can the authors compare the ex vivo damage response shown in Figure 4 to an in vivo response to the same pulse-chase treatment?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â The terms motility and cell contact are used to discuss the data in Figure 7. However, since non-esg+ cells in the tissue are not visible, it is unclear whether the analyzed cells are autonomously motile or whether they are passively moving with or displaced by other cells. Similarly, since only cell nuclei are visible, cell-cell contact cannot be ascertained (e.g. lines 417-418). Can the authors replace &quot;motility&quot; and &quot;cell contact&quot; with terms that encompass these ambiguities, or else provide information that substantiates these interpretations?</p><p>â The text states that the dissection technique used by the authors (which is nicely illustrated in Video 1) is an improvement over the standard technique. Can the authors revise the text to clarify this comparison, for instance by describing what the standard technique is?</p><p>â In Figures 4-7, I'm confused why GFP fluorescence appears to localize to cell nuclei, not the cytoplasm, given that the genotype in the figure caption does not indicate a GFP:nls. Why is GFP used to measure nuclear size rather than the (presumably more accurate) His::RFP? Why is the RFP channel not shown?</p><p>â Which asymmetric divisions were analyzed in Figure 7 (all 25 asymmetric divisions, or a subset)? Can the authors revise Figure 7D to show individual data points rather than averages?</p><p>â Peristaltic contractions: Do guts remain viable if isradipine is not included in the media? Is the digestive tract still able to 'defecate' ex vivo?</p><p>â A reference for the use of N-acetyl cysteine and sodium citrate as anti-phototoxicity agents would be helpful.</p><p>â Video 20 caption states that egg chamber rotation starts at Stage 5. My understanding is that rotation starts at Stage 1 (Cetara, 2014).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Authors presented the different steps of the dissection procedure in Figure 1 and Video 1 where they removed the abdomen, the Malpighian tubules, the ovaries, and the crop. What is the argument for not keeping them attached or near the intestine?</p><p>Keeping these tissues would limit the handling of the gut and induce less stress to the tissue. In addition, communication between the gut and the ovaries could be preserved. This is further relevant as the coculture with ovaries presented in Figure 2A shows a decrease cell death in explanted intestines. Authors could explain these additional steps.</p><p>2) Authors explained the negative effects of peristaltic movements on the intestine upon live-imaging to justify the use of the peristalsis inhibitor isradipine.</p><p>Authors could comment the impact of peristalsis inhibition on the normal gut functions.</p><p>3) To test the GFP expression in explanted intestines in progenitors (Figure 2D-E), authors used 5 to 15 days old flies. Did you use the same protocol for in vivo experiments? Did you see any impact of the age on the GFP expression in explanted intestines?</p><p>The n could be increased to further validate the use of this system.</p><p>4) Figure 3: Nuclei seem bigger upon SDS treatment (Figure 3B) compared to control (Figure 3A) at the T0 and also after. This difference is not seen in the graphs presented in Figure 3D-E. By looking the figure 3B, it is difficult to see the increase the size of the nuclei of cell losing the GFP signal.</p><p>Figure 3D-E present only few progenitor cells examples. What is the proportion of cells differentiating upon SDS treatment? By looking at figure 3B 48h, it seems that all of them are differentiating.</p><p>Is cell differentiation could be directly assessed with specific markers?</p><p>Did the authors check the cell death in explanted intestines after SDS treatment? and compared with in vivo conditions? Is it possible that SDS treatment can have a negative impact on extended culture of intestines?</p><p>Did the authors check the cell death in other genetic conditions used in the paper? In figure 3-supplement 2B? and others?</p><p>These experiments could be a good control to make sure that the different treatments applied have no effect on the extended culture of the intestines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In the paper, the authors have used esgTs to drive expression of RasG12V or stg and CycE and examined the ISC proliferation and analyzed asymmetric verse symmetric divisions. However, esg-Gal4 is expressed in both ISCs and EBs. Overexpression of stg and CycE in EBs can drive EBs to divide, so using the division of progeny to define the symmetric or asymmetric divisions is not very precise here and the symmetric division rate is exaggerated (Figure 4). In addition, it might be the reason that the authors observed the similar speed of the migration in the progeny of both symmetric and asymmetric divisions (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1). Therefore, the ISC specific Gal4 should be used to drive expression of stg and CycE in ISCs and the division of their progenies will be examined.</p><p>2. Loss of N induces accumulation of ISCs or ee cells, but these phenotypes are not observed in these explanted midguts (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 2). Is it possible that this protocol for culturing explanted midguts affects stem cell's identity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76010.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Either substantiate or revise interpretations of symmetric/asymmetric fate outcomes.</p><p>Because the movies use guts without markers for terminal fates, distinguishing asymmetric and symmetric outcomes is particularly challenging.

The suggestion to use enteroblast and enteroendocrine reporters (cell fate markers) along with the <italic>esg<sup>TS</sup></italic> driver and <italic>UAS-Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> or <italic>UAS-stg UAS-CycE</italic>, is not feasible within a reasonable time, as it would require us to develop and combine several new reporter lines.</p><p>As an alternative, we therefore tested an ISC-specific driver (<italic>esg-Gal4 UAS-2XEYFP; Su(H)GBE-Gal80 tub-Gal80<sup>TS</sup></italic>) combined with UAS-YFP and the <italic>His2Av.mRFP</italic> nuclear marker to allow us to directly identify daughter cells as ISCs or EBs. Unfortunately, the combination of this ISC-specific driver and the <italic>His2Av.mRFP</italic> nuclear marker resulted in flies whose intestines were extremely prone to breaking during explant culture. These flies were also susceptible to infection, often leading to ex vivo culture contamination. These problems were observed in 6 separate live-imaging sessions with flies from 3 separate crosses. We did not observe these issues with any other genotype we tested, including the original ISC-specific driver and the <italic>His2Av.mRFP</italic> parent lines. Thus, unfortunately, we were not able to gather additional data to substantiate our assignments of symmetric vs. asymmetric fate outcomes. Given this, we have taken the alternative approach and modified our description of the lineages using the more general, conservative terms âco-dividingâ and ânon-co-dividingâ instead of âsymmetricâ and âasymmetricâ respectively (lines 277-283 and 301-307). Essentially, we have now classified cell divisions in the lineages based on their observed behavior, rather than their presumed fate outcomes. We do mention our expectation that âco-dividingâ cells represent ISC duplications, but this is clearly presented as a likely possibility, not a definitive result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarify the use of nuclear size as a measure of enteroblast differentiation.</p><p>Reviewers 1 and 2 had questions about how nuclear size was used as a measure of enteroblast differentiation.

In this video, both individual channels (<italic>nlsGFP</italic> and <italic>His2Av.mRFP</italic>) and their merge are shown.</p><p>Regarding Video 18 (previously Video 16), to show that the non-dividing daughter of the first division event is differentiating (losing nlsGFP expression and growing in size), please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, which shows in more detail the cells of the lineage at 46h after imaging start.

We have added a new movie (Video 23, described at lines 951-953) captured using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope to show this possibility. There are, however, some limitations: (1) acquisition with scanning confocal microscopes is slow and when imaging several intestines at the same time this can limit the framerate; (2) the file size of 48h movies captured at high frame rates is substantial and requires a powerful data storage infrastructure for storage and analysis. These considerations have been added to the Results section, lines 139-145.</p><p>Trachea are severed when the intestine is detached from the abdomen and ovaries (line 96). The cell death marker, NucGreen, can be seen incorporated in tracheal nuclei (line 112). The visceral muscle, on the other hand, is healthy after explant and resumes contracting with regular peristalsis after the isradipine wears off. This is common in 48-72 hour cultures. A new video has been included to show regular peristaltic movements after 3 days ex vivo (Video 3, described at lines 894-896).</p><p>We have added a new supplementary figure showing the effect of our SDS protocol in vivo (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1). The data supports our ex vivo observations. It must be noted, however, that the in vivo and ex vivo conditions are not perfectly matched: the explanted intestines still contain low amounts of SDS, which continues to damage the epithelium while imaging, while in vivo flies were fed clean food after the SDS treatment. Nonetheless, after SDS feeding, intestines in vivo also show a large number of differentiating cells and late onset cell proliferation. These results are now discussed in greater detail in the main text, lines 210-220 and 842-852.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>â The terms motility and cell contact are used to discuss the data in Figure 7.

It can be expected that any one individual researcher may dissect intestines in their own unique way.

However, undamaged areas (<italic>i.e.</italic> distant several hundred microns from the break site) remain viable, with regular muscle movements and normally behaving epithelial cells.</p><p>It must be noted that isradipine has no negative impact on muscle viability. After ~3 days of culture, the effect of isradipine usually wears off. When this occurs, the visceral muscle resumes regular peristaltic movements (Video 3 and lines 130-132). In the absence of isradipine, or when its effect wears off, midguts can indeed be seen âdefecatingâ. However, this is undesirable as it results in the culture medium being contaminated by enteric bacteria, which quickly grow and result in the death of the cultured intestines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â A reference for the use of N-acetyl cysteine and sodium citrate as anti-phototoxicity agents would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the main causes of phototoxicity is the generation of reactive oxygen species (see Icha et al., 2017). Adding antioxidants to the culture medium is therefore a viable strategy to reduce the risk of phototoxicity. N-acetyl cysteine is an antioxidant widely used in cell culture (see Ezerina et al., 2018). Citrate is also known to have antioxidant properties (see Wu et al. 2019) and to be present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemolymph at detectable levels (see Echalier, â<italic>Drosophila</italic> Cells in Cultureâ).

When midguts are separated from neighboring organs and the abdominal cuticle, handling is easier and any region of the intestine is readily accessible. Consequently, imaging is also significantly clearer as ovaries and other organs could easily overlap with the midguts. Malpighian tubules also frequently wrap around midguts and stick to forceps during transfer from dissection dishes to imaging chambers. The crop and hindgut are also removed as they are easily damaged, which results in the release of enteric bacteria. We have expanded the relevant Material and Methods section (lines 604-608) to better explain these reasons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors explained the negative effects of peristaltic movements on the intestine upon live-imaging to justify the use of the peristalsis inhibitor isradipine.</p><p>Authors could comment the impact of peristalsis inhibition on the normal gut functions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added comments on the possible impact of peristalsis inhibition in the Discussion section (lines 480-486).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To test the GFP expression in explanted intestines in progenitors (Figure 2D-E), authors used 5 to 15 days old flies.

However, we did observe that the strong cell proliferation induced by either <italic>Ras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> or <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> results in extrusion of enterocytes in regions were cell crowding is high, as it is known to occur also in vivo (see Patel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In the paper, the authors have used esgTs to drive expression of RasG12V or stg and CycE and examined the ISC proliferation and analyzed asymmetric verse symmetric divisions. However, esg-Gal4 is expressed in both ISCs and EBs. Overexpression of stg and CycE in EBs can drive EBs to divide, so using the division of progeny to define the symmetric or asymmetric divisions is not very precise here and the symmetric division rate is exaggerated (Figure 4). In addition, it might be the reason that the authors observed the similar speed of the migration in the progeny of both symmetric and asymmetric divisions (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1). Therefore, the ISC specific Gal4 should be used to drive expression of stg and CycE in ISCs and the division of their progenies will be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>Overexpression of <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> can indeed force some EBs to divide (see Kohlmaier et al. Oncogene 2015). We agree with the reviewer that our definition of symmetric and asymmetric divisions was not precise since cell identity cannot be assessed with certainty in these experiments. To address this issue, we did a number of live imaging trials using a stem cell specific Gal4 driver (see answers to editor above for details). However, these trials failed because those midguts were to fragile to image successfully. Therefore, we have changed our discussion in the text by using the more precise terms âco-dividingâ and ânon-co-dividingâ cells to describe the divisions we previously called âsymmetricâ and âasymmetricâ (see lines 277-283 and 301-307). These more conservative terms are accurate operational definitions, and make convey the same information without presuming unknown cell fate outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Loss of N induces accumulation of ISCs or ee cells, but these phenotypes are not observed in these explanted midguts (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 2). Is it possible that this protocol for culturing explanted midguts affects stem cell's identity?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact we did observe the accumulation of small-sized GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in damaged <italic>N<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-expressing intestines (please see Figure 3 âfigure supplement 2B). These cells were proliferative and remained small in size, similar to what has been described in the literature using fixed samples. However, itâs possible that the 48h time-frame may not have been sufficient to observe the formation of large ISC/EE tumor masses in our experiments. In our previous work (see Patel et al., Nat Cell Biol. 2015) we noted a great deal of variability in the N- phenotype, which was dependent upon not only timing, but also background genotype, microbiota, and the specific genetic elements used to suppress Notch signaling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
