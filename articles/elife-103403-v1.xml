but the lack of well-defined substrates has hindered elucidation of the mechanisms involved. We previously demonstrated that the Phactr1 PIP confers sequence specificity on the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. Phactr1 defines a group of ‘RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W’ PIPs that all interact with PP1 in a similar fashion. Here, we use a PP1-PIP fusion approach to address sequence specificity and identify substrates of the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W family PIPs. We show that the four Phactr proteins confer identical sequence specificities on their holoenzymes. We identify the 4E-BP and p70 S6K translational regulators as substrates for the Neurabin/Spinophilin PIPs, implicated in neuronal plasticity, pointing to a role for their holoenzymes in mTORC1-dependent translational control. Biochemical and structural experiments show that in contrast to the Phactrs, substrate recruitment and catalytic efficiency of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions is primarily determined by substrate interaction with the PDZ domain adjoining their RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W motifs, rather than by recognition of the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove. Thus, even PIPs that interact with PP1 in a similar manner use different mechanisms to ensure substrate selectivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>Neurabin</kwd><kwd>4E-BP1</kwd><kwd>Phactr</kwd><kwd>PIP</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treisman</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treisman</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treisman</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The three PP1 isoforms possess a central metal-binding active centre from which radiate three putative substrate-binding grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egloff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldberg et al., 1995</xref>), but have little intrinsic sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoermann et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, PP1 substrate specificity and activity are controlled by over 200 PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs), which use a number of short linear motifs (SLIMs) to dock with distinct regions of the PP1 surface, including the substrate-binding grooves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casamayor and Ariño, 2020</xref>). PIPs can target PP1 to specific subcellular locations and can control substrate specificity through autonomous substrate-binding domains, occupation or extension of the substrate grooves, or modification of PP1 surface electrostatics (for references, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Only a few PIP-PP1-substrate interactions are understood in molecular detail, however, and the question of whether PIP interaction imposes sequence specificity on PP1, as opposed to simply bringing enzyme and substrate into close apposition, has remained largely unexplored.</p><p>The Phactr family of actin-regulated PP1 cofactors are the only PIPs known to directly impose substrate sequence specificity at the dephosphorylation site itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Like many PIPs, they interact with PP1 using the previously defined ‘RVxF’, ‘, and ‘R’ motifs (for overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choy et al., 2014</xref>). Structural alignment showed that the Phactrs belong to a small subset of RVxF-ΦΦ-R PIPs whose shared trajectory across the PP1 surface continues to the edge of the hydrophobic groove, making an additional PP1 contact through an additional motif that we termed the ‘W’ SLIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the Phactr1-PP1 holoenzyme, Phactr1 sequences C-terminal to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string interact with the PP1 hydrophobic groove to form a composite hydrophobic pocket, topped by a basic rim. This imposes strong sequence selectivity on substrates, favouring hydrophobic residues at positions +4/+5 relative to the phosphorylated residue, within an acidic context (consensus pS/T-x<sub>(2-3)</sub>-Φ-L, the ‘LLD motif’). Strikingly, this specificity is maintained in a PP1-Phactr1 fusion protein comprising PP1(1–304) linked to Phactr1 sequences from residue 526, just C-terminal to its RVxF motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PP1-PIP fusion proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of fusion proteins.

Unlike the Phactr1 substrate chimera, no interactions were seen with the remodelled PP1-Neurabin hydrophobic groove; and no virtual enzyme-product complex and solvent phosphate were detected at the active site, perhaps reflecting the absence of stabilising hydrophobic groove interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To gain insight into potential interactions at the PP1 catalytic site, we therefore used AlphaFold3 to model the PP1-4E-BP1 substrate chimera in its phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">1B</xref>). While the 4E-BP1/PDZ interaction was correctly predicted regardless of phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>), only the phosphorylated substrate was predicted to interact directly with the PP1 active site. The 4E-BP1 substrate sequence <sup>68</sup>TK(pT70)PPR<sup>73</sup>, predicted with high confidence, docks at the catalytic site, with K69 interacting with D220<sup>PP1</sup>, pT70 interacting with the metal ions, H125<sup>PP1</sup> and R221<sup>PP1</sup>, and P71 interacting with Y134<sup>PP1</sup>, but the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove remains unoccupied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In contrast, AlphaFold3 gives only a low confidence prediction for the unphosphorylated substrate site D74 and L75 interacting with H125<sup>PP1</sup> and Y134<sup>PP1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These results are consistent with the biochemical studies and support the notion that interaction with the remodelled hydrophobic groove plays no part in recognition of 4E-BP1 by the Neurabin/PP1 holoenzyme.</p><p>Finally, we used AlphaFold3 to predict interactions between Neurabin/PP1 and full-length 4E-BP1 phosphorylated on T37, T46, S65, T70, or S101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). All the predictions placed the C-terminus of 4E-BP1 in the ligand-binding groove of the PDZ domain, docking the phosphorylated T70 site in the PP1 active site in a similar manner to that seen in the substrate chimera predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Taken together with the crystallography and biochemical data, our observations support the view that the primary determinant of substrate specificity for Neurabin/PP1 is interaction with the PDZ domain adjacent to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The PP1 catalytic subunit possesses little intrinsic sequence specificity. Instead, it recognises specific substrates by forming holoenzymes in which it partners with a variety of PIPs to direct dephosphorylation to specific substrates. We previously showed that the interaction of the Phactr1 PIP with PP1 remodels the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove in such a way as to allow specific recognition of substrate sequences C-terminal to the dephosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). Phactr1 belongs to a group of PIPs that recognise PP1 using a common RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string, all of which potentially remodel the hydrophobic groove; indeed, structural studies confirm that Neurabin and Spinophilin (PPP1R9A, PPP1R9B) do this differently from the Phactrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). We identified potential substrates for the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs and elucidated mechanisms of substrate recognition, focussing on the Neurabin and Spinophilin PIPs.</p><p>Our previous study showed that a fusion protein comprising PP1 joined to Phactr1 sequences C-terminal to the RVxF motif maintains both the structure and the sequence specificity of the intact Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>). We used this fusion approach, in conjunction with MS phosphoproteomics in 293 cells, to compare the specificities of the different Phactr family members and to identify potential substrates for other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs. All four PP1-Phactr fusions exhibited virtually identical substrate specificities, which were substantially similar to that of the authentic Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme, giving confidence that findings made with the fusions are also applicable to other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP/PP1 holoenzymes. It is likely that differential intracellular targeting and/or tissue-specific expression of the four different Phactr/PP1 holoenzymes allows further refinement of substrate specificity.</p><p>Expression of the other PP1-(RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIP) fusions revealed potential substrates for PNUTS and PP1-Neurabin/Spinophilin. Unlike the PP1-Phactr substrates, however, these exhibited no obvious sequence similarities in the substrate sequences adjacent to the targeted dephosphorylation remodelled hydrophobic groove. For PNUTS, we identified only the SET1A/B-COMPASS complex components CXXC1/CFP1 and SETD1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>). These may be recruited to PNUTS by interaction with its binding partner WDR82, which is also present in SET1A/B-COMPASS complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>), but further work will be necessary to confirm this. We did not recover potential substrates for PP1-PPP1R15A/B. It is possible that the use of the PP1 fusion approach for these PIPs is confounded by interaction of these PIPs with G-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Expression of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions identified nine potential substrates with eighteen candidate dephosphorylation sites, of which eight represented conserved mTORC1-dependent phosphorylations of the translational regulators 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Using immunoblotting, we found that the p70 S6K activating phosphorylation at T389 also appears to be a substrate for PP1-Neurabin. The 4E-BPs and p70 S6K are critical targets of the mTORC1 pathway, which links translational control to cell nutrient status and extracellular signals in multiple settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoeffer and Klann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that overexpression of PP1-Neurabin can suppress translation when expressed in 293 cells. It is therefore likely that Neurabin and Spinophilin can negatively regulate both arms of the mTORC1 protein synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The presence of multiple dephosphorylation sites on the 4E-BPs with no obvious primary sequence homology raised the question of how these targets are recognised. We found that dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by PP1-Neurabin requires its C-terminal sequences, which constitute a classical PBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tonikian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Subbaiah et al., 2011</xref>). The micromolar affinity of this interaction, which is stronger than that previously reported for p70 S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burnett et al., 1998</xref>), may reflect the necessity for effective competition with the mTORC1 kinase complex, which binds the 4E-BPs using a C-terminal TOS motif that overlaps the PBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schalm and Blenis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Although we recovered a number of other potential Neurabin and Spinophilin substrates in the proteomics screen, none contains an obvious potential C-terminal PBM; further work will be necessary to establish whether they are bona fide substrates. We found that other reported ligands, such as the glutamatergic and dopaminergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelker et al., 2007</xref>), bind the Neurabin/Spinophilin PDZ domains with much lower affinity than 4E-BP1 or even p70 S6K. In neurons, the association of these receptors with Neurabin and PP1 correlates with channel activity and dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 1999</xref>, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foley et al., 2021</xref>). It may be that Neurabin/Spinophilin oligomerisation and/or F-actin binding, and membrane localisation, effectively increases the avidity of such weak PBM-PDZ interactions, but more work is required to establish whether these channels are direct Neurabin/PP1 substrates.</p><p>We used synthetic peptide substrates derived from 4E-BP1, or the Phactr1/PP1 substrate IRSp53, to investigate how the substrate recognition mechanisms differ between the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Phactr fusions. In the context of the PP1-PIP fusions, and by extension in that of the PIP/PP1 holoenzyme, the PIP sequences play a critical role in directing substrate specificity and potentiating catalytic efficiency. In the PP1-Neurabin fusion, interaction with the PDZ domain is the critical determinant of both catalytic efficiency and specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). It increases catalytic efficiency 100-fold above that seen with PP1 alone or the PP1-Phactr1 fusion. Moreover, the PP1-Neurabin fusion was inactive with the Phactr1/PP1 substrate IRSp53 unless the latter was made competent to bind the Neurabin PDZ domain. Our observations suggest a model in which 4E-BPs are recruited to Neurabin/PP1 via high-affinity PBM-PDZ interaction, with the relatively low affinity of active site interaction allowing dephosphorylation of the multiple sites during one round of PDZ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, dephosphorylation of the Phactr1/PP1 target IRSp53 pS455 by the PP1-Phactr1 fusion protein was critically dependent on interaction with the remodelled hydrophobic groove, consistent with our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedoryshchak et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the view that interaction with the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove plays no role in PP1-Neurabin substrate recognition. First, the PP1-Neurabin substrates we identified have no obvious sequence similarity at positions +3 to +6, the sequences that potentially interact with the remodelled hydrophobic groove, and alanine substitutions at these positions do not influence PP1-Neurabin catalytic activity. Structural analysis of a PP1-4E-BP1 substrate fusion complexed with Neurabin also revealed no substrate contacts with PP1, although the PDZ-4E-BP1 interaction was well resolved. Finally, AlphaFold modelling of complexes formed between 4E-BP1 substrates and the Spinophilin/PP1 holoenzyme predicted phosphorylation-specific interactions with the PP1 catalytic site, but no interactions with the remodelled hydrophobic groove. We were intrigued to note, however, that alanine substitutions at +1 and +2 in relative to 4E-BP1 pT70 increased reactivity with both PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Phactr1. We speculate that this ‘suboptimal’ reactivity may reflect a requirement to balance dephosphorylation rates between the multiple 4E-BP1 phosphorylation sites, especially if multiple rounds of dephosphorylation occur for each PBM-PDZ interaction.</p><p>Although the remodelled hydrophobic groove does not play a role in 4E-BP recognition by Neurabin/PP1, this does not necessarily mean that sequence-specific dephosphorylation by other PIP/PP1 complexes and substrate recruitment by protein interactions are inherently mutually exclusive: in principle, a PIP could recruit substrates through protein interactions and remodel the PP1 substrate binding grooves to allow discrimination between different phosphorylated sites on the target protein. That said, we think it likely that the other RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W PIPs will also recruit substrates by interaction with other PIP domains or proteins bound to them. Such interactions might involve WDR82 for PNUTS and G-actin for PPP1R15A/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erickson et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Our findings establish Neurabin/PP1 and Spinophilin/PP1 holoenzymes as new candidate regulators of the mTORC1 pathway. Many studies have focussed on mTORC1 regulation of translation on the control of cell growth, particularly in cancer settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>), and previous work has shown that endogenous PP2Cγ/ PPM1G contributes to 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation in 293 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Localised translational regulation is also important in other settings, however, including neuronal development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holt et al., 2019</xref>). Here, mTORC1 signalling plays an important role in neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoeffer and Klann, 2010</xref>), as do both Neurabin and Spinophilin, which are largely neuron-specific and enriched in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2008</xref>, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foley et al., 2021</xref>), and the 4E-BPs, particularly 4E-BP2 (for references, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar-Valles et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that 4E-BPs are Neurabin/PP1 substrates potentially establishes a direct link between Neurabin and neuronal mTORC1 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which will be an interesting topic for future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit and NEB Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit were used according to the manufacturer’s protocols for plasmid assembly and mutagenesis.

In prior work the authors showed that the PIP Phactrs confers specificity by remodelling a hydrophobic groove immediately adjacent to the PP1 catalytic site through residues within the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string of Phactrs. Specifically, the residues proximal and including the 'W' of the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string remodel the hydrophobic groove. Other residues the of the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string (i.e. the RVxF- ø ø -R) are not involved in this remodelling.</p><p>The authors suggest that the RVxF- ø ø -R-W string is a conserved feature of many PIPs including PNUTS, Neurabin/spinophilin and R15A. However from a sequence and structural perspective only the RVxF- ø ø -R- is conserved. The W is not conserved in most and in the R15A structure (PDB:7NZM) the Trp side chain points away from the hydrophobic channel - this could be a questionable interpretation due to model building into the low resolution cryo-EM map (4 A).</p><p>In this paper the authors convincingly show that Neurabin confers substrate specificity through interactions of its PDZ domain with the PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) of 4E-BP. They show the PBM motif is required for Neurabin to increase PP1 activity towards 4E-BP and a synthetic peptide modelled on 4E-BP and also a synthetic peptide based on IRSp53 with a PBM added. The PBM of 4E-BP1 confers high affinity binding to the Neurabin PDZ domain. A crystal structure of a PP1-4E-BP1 fusion with Neurabin shows that the PBM of 4E-BP interacts with the PDZ domain of Neurabin. No interactions of 4E-BP and the catalytic site of PP1 are observed. Cell biology work showed that Neurabin-PP1 regulates the TOR signalling pathway by dephosphorylating 4E-BPs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work demonstrates convincingly using a variety of cell biology, proteomics, biophysics and structural biology that the PP1 interacting protein Neurabin confers specificity on PP1 through an interaction of its PDZ domain with a PDZ-binding motif of 4E-BP1 proteins. Remodelling of the hydrophobic groove of the PP1 catalytic subunit is not involved in Neurabin-dependent substrate specificity, in contrast to how Phactrs confers specificity on PP1. The active site of the Neurabin/PP1 complex does not recognise residues in the vicinity of the phospho-residue, thus allowing for multiple phospho-sites on 4E-BP to be dephosphorylated by Neurabin/PP1. This contrasts with substrate specificity conferred by the Phactrs PIP that confers specificity of Phactrs/PP1 towards its substrates in a sequence-specific context by remodelling the hydrophobic groove immediately adjacent to the catalytic. The structural and biochemical insights are used to explore the role of Neurabin/PP1 in dephosphorylation 4E-BPs in vivo, showing that Neurabin/PP1 regulates the TOR signalling pathway, specifically mTORC1-dependent translational control.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The only weakness is the suggestion that a conserved RVxF- ø ø -R-W string exists in PIPs. The 'W' is not conserved in sequence and 3-dimensions in most of the PIPs discussed in this manuscript. The lack of conservation of the W would be consistent with the finding based on multiple PP1-PIP structures that apart from Phactrs, no other PIP appears to remodel the PP1 hydrophobic channel.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed my comments.</p><p>One aspect of the manuscript and response to reviewers is misleading regarding the statement: 'Like many PIPs, they interact with PP1 using the previously defined &quot;RVxF&quot;, &quot;ΦΦ&quot;, and &quot;R&quot; motifs (Choy et al, 2014).' This statement, and similar in the authors' response, implies that Choy et al discovered the &quot;RVxF&quot; and &quot;ΦΦ&quot; motifs. The Choy et al, 2014 paper reports the discovery of the &quot;R&quot; motif. The &quot;RVxF&quot; and &quot;ΦΦ&quot; motifs were discovered and reported in earlier papers not cited in the authors' manuscript. Perhaps the authors can correct this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103403.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript explores the molecular mechanisms that are involved in substrate recognition by the PP1 phosphatase. The authors previously showed that the PP1 interacting protein (PPI), PhactrI, conferred substrate specificity by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. In this work, the authors aimed to understand the key determinant of how other PIPs, Neurabin and Spinophilin, mediate substrate recognition.</p><p>The authors generated a few PP1-PIP fusion constructs, undertook TMT phosphoproteomics and validated their method using PP1-Phactr1/2/3/4 fusion constructs. Using this method, the authors identified phsophorylation sites controlled by PP1-Neurabin and focussed their work on 4E-BP1, thereby linking PP1-Neurabin to mTORC1 signalling. Upon validating that PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylates 4E-BP1, they determined that 4E-BP1 PBM binds to the PDZ domain of Neurabin with an affinity that was greater than 30 fold as compared to other substrates. PP1-Neurabin dephosphorylated 4E-BP1WT and IRSp53WT with a catalytic efficiency much greater than PP1 alone. However, PP1-Neurabin bound to 4E-BP1 and IRSp53 mutants lacking the Neurabin PDZ domain with a catalytic efficiency lesser than that observed with 4E-BP1WT. These results indicate the involvement of the PDZ domain in facilitating substrate recruitment by PP1-Neurabin. Interestingly, PP1-Phactr1 dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 phenocopies PP1 alone, while PP1-Phactr1 dephosphorylates IRSp53 to a much higher extent than PP1 alone. These results highlights the importance of the PDZ domain and also shed light on how different PP1-PIP holoenzymes mediate substrate recognition using distinct mechanisms. The authors also show that the remodelling of the hydrophobic PP1 substrate groove which is essential for substrate recognition by PP1-Phactr1, was not required by PP1-Neurabin. Additionally, the authors also resolved the structure of a PP1-4E-BP1 fusion with the PDZ-containing C-terminal of Neurabin and observed that the Neurabin/PP1-4E-BP1 complex structure was oriented at 21{degree sign} to that in the unliganded Spinophilin/PP1 complex (resolved by Ragusa et al., 2010) owing to a slight bend in the C-terminal section that connects it to the RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string. Since, no interaction was observed with the remodelled PP1-Neurabin hydrophobic groove, the authors utilised AlphaFold3 to further answer this. They observed a high confidence of interaction between the groove and phosphorylated substrate and a low confidence of interaction between the groove and unphosphorylated substrate, thereby suggesting that the hydrophobic groove remodelling is not involved in PP1-Neurabin recognition and dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1.</p><p>In this work, the authors provide novel insights into how Neurabin depends on the interaction between its PDZ domain and PBM domains of potential substrates to mediate its recruitment by PP1. Additionally, they uncover a novel PP1-Neurabin substrate, 4E-BP1. They systematically employ phosphoproteomics, biochemical and structural methods to investigate substrate specifity in a robust fashion. Furthermore, the authors also compares the interactions between PP1-Neurabin to 4E-BP1 and IRSp53 (PP1-Phactr1 substrate) with PP1-Phactr1, to showcase the specificity of the mode of action employed by these complexes in mediating substrate specificity. The authors do employ an innovative PP1-PIP fusion strategy previously explored by Oberoi et al., 2016 and the authors themselves in Fedoryshchak et al., 2020. This method, allows for a more controlled investigation of the interactions between PP1-PIPs and its substrates. Furthermore, the authors have substantially characterised the importance of the PDZ domain using their fusion constructs, however, I believe that a further exploration into either structural or AlphaFold3 modelling of PBM domain substrate mutants, or a Neurabin PDZ-domain mutant might further strengthen this claim. Overall, the paper makes a substantial contribution to understanding substrate recognition and specificity in PP1-PIP complexes. The study's innovative methods, biological relevance, and mechanistic insights are strengths, but whether this mechanism occurs in a physiological context is unclear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103403.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), a vital member of the PPP superfamily, drives most cellular serine/threonine dephosphorylation. Despite PP1's low intrinsic sequence preference, its substrate specificity is finely tuned by over 200 PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs), which employ short linear motifs (SLIMs) to bind specific PP1 surface regions. By targeting PP1 to cellular sites, modifying substrate grooves, or altering surface electrostatics, PIPs influence substrate specificity. Although many PIP-PP1-substrate interactions remain uncharacterized, the Phactr family of PIPs uniquely imposes sequence specificity at dephosphorylation sites through a conserved &quot;RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W&quot; motif. In Phactr1-PP1, this motif forms a hydrophobic pocket that favors substrates with hydrophobic residues at +4/+5 in acidic contexts (the &quot;LLD motif&quot;), a specificity that endures even in PP1-Phactr1 fusions. Neurabin/Spinophilin remodel PP1's hydrophobic groove in distinct ways, creating unique holoenzyme surfaces, though the impact on substrate specificity remains underexplored. This study investigates Neurabin/Spinophilin specificity via PDZ domain-driven interactions, showing that Neurabin/PP1 specificity is governed more by PDZ domain interactions than by substrate sequence, unlike Phactr1/PP1.</p><p>A significant strength of this work is the use of PP1-PIP fusion proteins to effectively model intact PP1•PIP holoenzymes by replicating the interactions that remodel the PP1 interface and confer site-specific substrate specificity. When combined with proteomic analyses to assess phospho-site depletion in mammalian cells, these fusions offer critical insights into holoenzyme specificity, revealing new candidate substrates for Neurabin and Spinophilin. The studies present compelling evidence that the PDZ domain of PP1-Neurabin directs its specificity, with the remodeled PP1 hydrophobic groove interactions having minimal impact. This mechanism is supported by structural analysis of the PP1-4E-BP1 substrate fusion bound to a Neurabin construct, highlighting the 4E-BP1/PDZ interaction. This work delivers crucial insights into PP1-PIP holoenzyme function, combining biochemical, proteomic, and structural approaches. It validates the PP1-PIP fusion protein model as a powerful tool, suggesting it may extend to studying additional holoenzymes. While an extremely useful model, it must be considered unlikely the PP1-PIP fusions fully recapitulate the specificity and regulation of the holoenzyme.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103403.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fedoryshchak</surname><given-names>Roman O</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>El-Bouri</surname><given-names>Karim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>Dhira</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mouilleron</surname><given-names>Stephane</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Treisman</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><p>Response to the public reviews:</p><p>We are very pleased to see these positive reviews of our preprint.</p><p>Reviewers 1 and 3 raise issues around PIP-PP1 interactions.</p><p>(1) Role of the “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string”</p><p>Most PIPs interact with the globular PP1 catalytic core through short linear interaction motifs (SLiMs) and Choy et al (PNAS 2014) previously showed that many PIPs interact with PP1 through conserved trio of SLiMs, RVxF-ΦΦ-R, which is also present in the Phactrs.</p><p>Previous structural analysis showed the trajectory of the PPP1R15A/B, Neurabin/Spinphilin (PPP1R9A/B), and PNUTS (PPP1R10) PIPs across the PP1 surface encompasses not only the RVxF-ΦΦ-R trio, but also additional sequences C-terminal to it (Chen et al, eLife, 2015). This extended trajectory is maintained in the Phactr1-PP1 complex (Fedoryshchak et al, eLife 2020). Based on structural alignment we proposed the existence of an additional hydrophobic “W” SLiM that interacts with the PP1 residues I133 and Y134.</p><p>The extended “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W” interaction brings sequences C-terminal to the “W” SLiM into the vicinity of the hydrophobic groove that adjoins the PP1 catalytic centre. In the Phactr1/PP1 complex, these sequences remodel the groove, generating a novel pocket that facilitates sequence-specific substrate recognition.</p><p>This raises the possibility that sequences C-terminal to the extended “RVxF-ΦΦ-R-W string” in the other complexes also confer sequence-specific substrate recognition, and our study aims to test this hypothesis. Indeed, the hydrophobic groove structures of the Neurabin/Spinophilin/PP1 and Phactr1/PP1 complexes differ significantly (Ragusa et al, 2010; see Fedoryshchak et al 2020, Fig2 FigSupp1).</p><p>(2) Orientation of the W side chain</p><p>Reviewer 1 points out that in the substrate-bound PP1/PPP1R15A/Actin/eIF2 pre-dephosphorylation complex the W sidechain is inverted with respect to its orientation in PP1-PPP1R15B complex (Yan et al, NSMB 2021). The authors proposed that this may reflect the role of actin in assembly of the quaternary complex. This does not necessarily invalidate the notion that sequences C-terminal to the “W” motif might play a role in actin-independent substrate recognition, and we therefore consider our inclusion of the R15A/B fusions in our analysis to be reasonable.</p><p>(3) Conservation of W</p><p>The motif ‘W’ does not mandate tryptophan - Phactrs and PPP1R15A/B indeed have W at this position but Neurabin/spinophilin contain VDP, which makes similar interactions.

Does 4EBP1 (118+A) actually prevent interaction between PP1-Neurabin? This interaction needs to be validated, especially since spinophilin was shown to bind to multiple regions of PP1.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not clear what the referee is asking for here. The biochemical analysis in Figure 4C shows that the C-terminus of 4E-BP1 constitutes a classical PBM. The X-ray crystallography in Figure 6 confirms this, demonstrating H-bond interactions between the 4E-BP1 C-terminal carboxylate and main chain amides of L514, G515 and I516.</p><p>We consider the possibility that the 4E-BP1(118+A) mutant inhibits the activity of PP1-neurabin via a mechanism other than direct blocking 4E-BP1 / PDZ interaction to be unlikely for the following reasons:</p><p>(1) Addition of a C-terminal alanine will disrupt the PBM interaction because the extra residue sterically blocks access to the PBM-binding groove. This is the most parsimonious explanation, and is based on our solid structural and biochemical evidence that the 4E-BP1 C-terminus is a classical PBM.</p><p>(2) Alphafold3 modelling predicts Neurabin PDZ / 4E-BP1 PBM interaction with high confidence (shown in Figure 6-S2E), but it does not predict any PDZ interaction with 4E-BP1(118+A). Note added in Figure 6-S2 legend.</p><p>(3) Recognition of the 4E-BP1(118+A) mutation without loss of binding affinity would require that the mutant becapable of binding formally equivalent to recognition of an “internal” PDZ-binding peptide. Recognition of such “internal peptides” is dependent on their adopting a specifically constrained conformation, which typically requires reorganisation of the PDZ carboxylate-binding GLGF loop. Such “internal site” recognition typically involves more than one residue C-terminal to the conventional PDZ “0” position (see Penkert et al NSMB 2004, doi:10.1038/nsmb839; Gee et al JBC 1998, DOI: 10.1074/jbc.273.34.21980; Hillier et al 1999, Science PMID: 10221915).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is nice to see that the various PP1-Phactr fusions have around 60% substrate overlap between them. Would it be possible to compare these results with previously published mass spec data of Phactr1XXX from the group? There is mention of some substrates being picked up, but a comparison much like in Figure 2E would be more informative about the extent to which the described method captures relevant information.</p></disp-quote><p>This is difficult to do directly as the PP1-Phactr fusion data are from human cells while that in Fedoryshchak et al 2020 is from mouse.</p><p>However, manual curation shows that of the 28 top hits seen in our previous analysis of Phactr1XXX in NIH3T3 cells, 18 were also detectable in the HEK293 system; of these, 13 were also detected as as PP1-Phactr fusion hits.

It is also weird that given total protein is so low, why are the pS65/101 levels high compared to the rest?</p></disp-quote><p>We think it likely these phenomena reflect a low level expression of PP1-Neurabin expression in uninduced cells. Now noted in Figure 3D legend, basal PP1-Neurabin expression shown in new Figure 3-S1C. This alters the relative levels of the different species detected by the total 4E-BP1 antibody in favour of the faster migrating forms, which are less phosphorylated than the slower ones, and the total amount increases about 2-fold (Figure 3D, compare 0nM Tet lanes).</p><p>The altered p65/101-pT70 ratio is also likely to reflect the leaky PP1-Neurabin expression, since the relative intensities of the various phosphorylated species are dependent on both the relative rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Expression of a phosphatase would therefore be expected to differentially affect the phosphorlyation levels of different sites according to their reactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 3E: Does inhibiting mTORC further reduce translation when PP1-Neurabin is expressed?

Is there evidence that PP1-Neurabin remodels the hydrophobic groove?

If this is not the case, it should be explained in a bit more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Comparison of the Neurabin/PP1 and Phactr1/PP1 structures shows that the hydrophobic groove is remodelled differently in the two complexes.
