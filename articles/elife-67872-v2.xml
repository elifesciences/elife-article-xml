However, there remains a lack of models that investigate the critical cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during human embryogenesis. Here, we reported a novel stepwise strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via temporal specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (μTs), and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage μT effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. We expect that our multilineage differentiation model will offer an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Organs begin developing during the first few months of pregnancy, while the baby is still an embryo.

As the two main organs within the chest cavity, the mesoderm-derived heart and endoderm-derived lung partake in have extensive mutual interaction that are essential for their proper morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle, 2018</xref>). During mouse embryonic development, WNT derived from the second heart field induces specification of pulmonary endoderm, which in turn secretes SHH that signals back to the heart and regulates proper atrial septation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>). This inter-lineage crosstalk is partly mediated by the multipotent mesodermal progenitors located between the developing heart and lung, which have the potential for lineage contribution to pulmonary endothelium, pulmonary smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2013</xref>). However, the extent of translation of findings derived from rodent models to the understanding of developmental interplay between human cardio-pulmonary systems remains unclear. There is, therefore, a critical need for experimentally tractable systems for investigating human cardio-pulmonary co-development during organogenesis.</p><p>Much work has been done for directed differentiation of hiPSCs into either cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mummery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>), or pulmonary epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gotoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2012</xref>), both of which often utilize stepwise differentiation strategies that recapitulate key developmental signaling events. To recapitulate cardiogenesis, hiPSCs were sequentially specified into mesoderm, cardiac mesoderm, and then NKX2.5<sup>+</sup> cardiac progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mummery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laflamme et al., 2007</xref>). For pulmonary induction, hiPSCs went through stages corresponding to definitive endoderm and anterior foregut endoderm, and then became NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> lung epithelial progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gotoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Longmire et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the significant contributions of these models make to the mechanistic understanding of human heart and lung organogenesis, they generally focus on one organ parenchyma at a time. It remains challenging to model and investigate multi-organ co-development within a single differentiation of hiPSCs, especially when the organs of interest are derived from different germ layers, as is the case for the heart and lung.</p><p>Comparison of existing protocols for single-lineage cardiac and pulmonary differentiation from hiPSCs indicates shared regulators despite their distinct germ-layer origin. Firstly, both endodermal and mesodermal specification is facilitated by the inhibition of insulin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mou et al., 2012</xref>), and can be induced by a similar set of paracrine factors, including WNT, BMP, and TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loh, 2014</xref>). It is the quantitative combination of these signaling that determines endoderm versus mesoderm bifurcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim, 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the shared primitive streak origin of both germ layers during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levak-Svajger and Svajger, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tam and Beddington, 1987</xref>). Secondly, WNT inhibition not only facilitates the transition from definitive endoderm to anterior foregut endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spence et al., 2011</xref>), but it also promotes cardiac mesoderm emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Willems et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tran, 2009</xref>). Lastly, retinoic acid (RA) signaling is required for the induction and maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCauley et al., 2017</xref>). These common paracrine regulation of paralleled cardiac and pulmonary specification is consistent with their close spatial coordinates within the embryonic body planning, as demonstrated by shared HOX genes expression and functional requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lufkin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makki and Capecchi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chisaka and Capecchi, 1991</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we described a stepwise, growth-factor-free protocol for simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary progenitors from a single culture of hiPSCs. This is accomplished by initial co-induction of mesoderm and definitive endoderm mixture, followed by their concurrent specification into cardiac (NKX2.5<sup>+</sup>) and lung (NKX2.1<sup>+</sup>) progenitors, respectively, using the same sets of small molecule cocktails modulating WNT, nodal and TGF-β signaling in a temporal specific manner. Using 3D suspension culture with continuing WNT activation, we engineered pulmonary-centered, cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (μTs), and demonstrated the accompanying cardiac lineage as an essential cellular niche that promoted effective alveolar maturation. Finally, following the withdrawal of WNT agonist, each concentric cardio-pulmonary μT reorganized and ultimately segregated into cardiac-only and pulmonary-only μTs. This work therefore offers an effective hiPSC-based model for investigating cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue segregation during human embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary progenitors</title><p>Building on existing protocols on cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mummery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laflamme et al., 2007</xref>), and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gotoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 2011</xref>) differentiation from hiPSCs, a stepwise differentiation strategy was developed to enable simultaneous specification of both lineages within a single culture of hiPSCs. Firstly, a balanced mesodermal and endodermal induction was achieved via fine-tuning of WNT activation in the absence of insulin, activin A, and BMP4 supplementation (Stage-1). Then, a combined inhibition of WNT and TGF-β signaling initiated the specification of the co-induced mesoderm and endoderm towards cardiac and pulmonary specification, respectively (Stage-2). Lastly, reactivation of WNT signaling in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) led to concurrent emergence of NKX2.5<sup>+</sup> cardiac and NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> lung progenitors (Stage-3), which was our main focus in this study.</p><p>WNT signaling is required for mesodermal and endodermal specification in dose-dependent manner during embryogenesis as well as hiPSC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paige, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ng et al., 2008</xref>). Using a hiPSC line, BU3 NKX2.1<sup>GFP</sup>; SFTPC<sup>tdTomato</sup> (BU3-NGST), we examined the possibility of co-inducing mesodermal and definitive endodermal specification by exclusively modulating WNT signaling using a GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR99021, hereafter abbreviated as CHIR) and without the addition of exogenous growth factors (e.g. Activin A and BMP4). BU3-NGST were trypsinized and plated at 150,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in mTESR1 medium for 24 hr. BU3-NGST were then treated with different concentrations of CHIR at 4, 7, and 10 μM for 48 hr in mTESR1 medium, followed by incubation in growth factor-free differentiation medium (based on RPMI1640 and B-27 minus insulin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Toward the end of germ layer induction (Stage-1), we detected co-existence of both definitive endodermal (SOX17<sup>+</sup>) and mesodermal progenitors (MIXL1<sup>+</sup> and NCAM1<sup>+</sup>), as well as the wide-spread expression of pan-mesendoderm marker (MIXL1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition, definitive endoderm co-expressed both FOXA2 and SOX17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This was further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis CD13 (mesodermal marker) and SOX17 (endodermal marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f-g</xref>).

We evaluated the efficiency of cardio-pulmonary induction following exposure to CHIR (7 µM) for different periods (24, 48, and 72 hr), and found that extended CHIR exposure for 48 or 72 hr was required to induce robust cardio-pulmonary programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Specifically, CHIR favored cardiac specification with increase in exposure time and plateaued at 48 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>); while the induction of pulmonary program peaked at 48 hr of CHIR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) and declined with further extension of the treatment. Based on these observations, for all subsequent experiments, we used 48 hr treatment of CHIR (7 µM) during Stage-1 of the co-differentiation program.

In the absence of accompanying cardiac cells, although NKX2.1<sup>GFP+</sup> lung progenitors can be robustly induced and maintained, their alveolar maturation (as indicated by SFTPC<sup>tdTomato</sup> reporter) following 3 days of maturation in 3D suspension culture was dramatically diminished compared to the cardio-pulmonary group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g–l</xref>). Whole mount imaging of μTs on Day-18 showed pulmonary-only differentiation mainly comprised NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> cells, while cardio-pulmonary μTs possessed a concentric arrangement of NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> cells, surrounded by NKX2.5<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i and j</xref>). This was further supported by gene expression analysis of NKX2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>) and SFTPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4n</xref>). Further extension of CKDCI maturation period for 2 weeks up to Day-29 in the pulmonary-only group failed to produce AT2 induction to a level comparable to that of the cardio-pulmonary group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

The current study primarily focused on co-induction of cardio-pulmonary progenitor cells, thus establishing the foundation for future investigations of how the crosstalk between these two organ lineages regulates their respective lineage maturation. We demonstrated that upon co-induction of mesoderm and endoderm, a series of shared signaling events were capable of driving simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from their respective germ-layer progenitors. Upon transitioning the co-induced cardiac and pulmonary progenitors to 3D suspension culture, we observed expedited alveolar maturation within 3 days, which was supported by the accompanying cardiac lineage. In 3D suspension culture, each cardio-pulmonary μT effectively segregates into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs, which was partially inhibited by WNT activation. This study therefore delivers an effective in vitro model for studying the mechanistic interplay between the developing heart and lung during human embryogenesis.</p><p>The extensive cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during organogenesis has been well documented in the mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle, 2018</xref>); however, the translatability of these findings to human embryogenesis remains elusive due to the lack of proper model systems. Human pluripotent stem cell differentiation has offered an effective means for recapitulating and investigating human organogenesis, and tremendous progress has been made toward directed cardiac or pulmonary specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mummery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gotoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laflamme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Longmire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 2011</xref>). However, almost all existing models have been focusing on one parenchymal lineage at a time, and therefore lack the ability to support the investigation of inter-organ crosstalk. Here, building on the established understanding of signaling events necessary for cardiac and pulmonary induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mummery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gotoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laflamme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Longmire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 2011</xref>), we have developed a robust protocol for the simultaneous co-differentiation of cardiac and pulmonary lineages from hiPSCs. Within our co-differentiation system, unrestricted interaction between cells of both lineages is enabled even before their lineage commitment.</p><p>Most current attempts on pulmonary induction from hiPSCs relies on initial nodal activation using growth factor (Activin A) supplementation, which is critical for definitive endoderm specification. Here, we showed that by fine tuning WNT signaling using a small-molecule inhibitor of GSK-3β (CHIR), robust induction of endoderm and subsequently lung progenitors can be achieved without any exogenous growth factors. This is consistent with the observation that CHIR was capable of inducing cardiac differentiation in replacement of combined effect of exogenous Activin A and BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martyn et al., 2019</xref> demonstrated that WNT is sufficient to induce primitive streak, which then creates a gradient of signals (BMP, WNT, Nodal) that could further specify fate towards mesoderm and endoderm lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martyn et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, Nodal and BMP signaling remains crucial in mesoderm and endoderm specification, as inhibition of these signals effectively terminated cardio-pulmonary co-induction.</p><p>Our study demonstrated the need for endogenous TGF-β signaling for effective cardio-pulmonary induction, as well as the critical role of endogenous BMP signaling in cardiogenesis. Furthermore, we found that temporal-specific action of the same set of small molecules regulating TGF-β and WNT signaling was capable of simultaneously driving mesoderm-to-cardiac and endoderm-to-pulmonary specification. Moreover, BMP4 has been shown to improve NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> lung progenitor specification in both mouse and hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Serra et al., 2017</xref>). In our system, endogenous instead of exogenous BMP signaling was required during a developmental stage corresponding to foregut ventralization for effective co-emergence of cardiac and pulmonary progenitors. This is in line with the close spatial positioning of the developing heart and lung primordia within embryonic body patterning, which implies their exposure to a similar paracrine microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herriges and Morrisey, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To achieve alveolarization, NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> lung progenitors are usually embedded in extracellular matrices, such as Matrigel and collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Carvalho et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we established an effective approach that enabled AT2 cell maturation within 3 days in suspension culture of 3D cell aggregates spontaneously formed from Day-15 cardiac and pulmonary progenitors. We further demonstrated that the presence of accompanying cardiac lineage is critical for robust alveolar induction. This observation is consistent with the recently reported inter-dependence between cardiac and pulmonary lineages during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle, 2018</xref>). In the absence of cardiac lineage, NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> lung progenitors could not achieve as effective AT2 maturation as what is observed in cardio-pulmonary μTs. This is again emphasizing that chemical cues derived from heart field also plays a role in lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle, 2018</xref>). However, it should be noted that pulmonary mesenchyme could also augment distal lung differentiation, which requires further investigation with the ability to differentiate the participation and contribution of each mesodermal cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCulley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leeman et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the presence of mesoderm-derived stromal cells have also been shown to be essential for effective alveolarization in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herriges and Morrisey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domyan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rankin et al., 2016</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gotoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, cells of the mesodermal lineage are known to be robust producers of extracellular matrix, which may also contribute to the effective alveolar maturation in the absence of external extracellular matrix support. The ability to enable effective alveolar induction from hiPSC-derived lung progenitors with the convenient of suspension culture also opens the door to large-scale production of alveolar cells, a critical challenge in regenerative medicine applications.</p><p>Using dual-lineage cardio-pulmonary μTs formed from the co-induced progenitors, we observed a novel process of cardio-pulmonary tissue segregation. The human body cavities are highly crowded spaces, filled with different tissues and organs that are in close contact with each other. It remains enigmatic how inter-organ boundaries are maintained to prevent undesired cell migration or tissue merging. Our cardio-pulmonary tissue segregation model suggests an intrinsic mechanism that effectively establishes a boundary between two distinct parenchymal lineages even when they are initially mingled together. Although no model of collective migration has been described in the context of cardio-pulmonary development, studies in other model systems suggest cell-cell communication and paracrine signaling (e.g. WNT) to be crucial for directed cell migration during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciruna and Rossant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Calisto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we found that exogenous WNT activation via GSK-3β inhibition effectively slowed down the cardio-pulmonary segregation, while inhibition of endogenous WNT (canonical and non-canonical) did not obviously affect the process. In consistence with our observation, it has been shown that the inhibition of non-canonical WNT signaling does not stop collective cell migration but distorting migration direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Wang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite the presence of AT1-like cells in cardio-pulmonary μTs based on HOPX staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liebler et al., 2016</xref>), the organization of these cells remained unlike the thin, flat squamous cells found in the native lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams, 2003</xref>). Although HOPX expression has been observed in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>), we did not observe HOPX expression following establishment of cardio-pulmonary progenitors, and the induction of HOPX coincided with alveolar maturation during Day-15 to Day-18. Further study is needed to explore the possibility of obtaining AT1-like cells with a more mature phenotype using multiple markers. Our work demonstrates early emergence of SFTPC-expressing cells as early as Day-18, with CHIR and 3D suspension culture being key driving forces that promote alveologenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>), Removal of CHIR on Day-18 led to a decreased in SFTPC expression on Day-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), suggesting that the complete alveolar niche was not fully established yet. Future investigation is needed to further clarify components of the supporting alveolar niche as well as its timeline of establishment. In parallel, cardiac contractility of the μTs was initiated 7 days following removal of CHIR, consistent with previous studies showing that GSK-3β inhibition promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation but hinders contraction by affecting myofibrillar architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buikema et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tseng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Heart begins to form around gestation week 3, which is the earliest organ to be developed during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan and Lewandowski, 2020</xref>). Lung development initiates soon afterwards during weeks 4–7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schittny, 2017</xref>). In the present study, we showed that the progenitor cells of both heart and lung can be simultaneously induced following 15 days of co-differentiation from hiPSCs. More comprehensive time-series analysis will be necessary to further delineate the fine temporal relationship between heart and lung lineage specification, which is expected to provide fundamental insights regarding cardio-pulmonary crosstalk during their paralleled organogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our work focuses on specification of cardio-pulmonary progenitors that have the potential to further mature into their respective descendent lineages. Further morphological and functional maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary lineages, as well as their crosstalk during this process will require future in-depth investigation. In addition, our work offers a novel model for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation. We also expect this work to be of potential use for studying congenital diseases affecting both cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Detailed information regarding reagents for culture and differentiation medium was summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Image J was used to measure the overlapping perimeter between GFP<sup>+</sup> (pulmonary) and non-GFP (cardiac) compartments, which was then normalized to total perimeter of GFP<sup>+</sup> compartments and expressed as the percentage of overlapping.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>%</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>qPCR analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol, processed by chloroform extraction, precipitated using 1 volume of absolute isopropanol with 50 μg/mL of RNase-free glycoblue as carrier, washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried, solubilized in RNase-free water and quantified using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized via reverse transcription of 1 μg total RNA with random hexamers and the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit according to manufacturer’s instruction. Real-time qPCR analysis was performed on CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System using TaqMan probes. Each reaction mixture was prepared by combining 1 μL of probe, 10 μL of TaqMan Master Mix, 1 μL of cDNA (equivalent to 50 ng), and the final volume was brought up to 20 μL. The final Ct value was normalized to housekeeping gene (β-actin), using comparative Ct method. Unless otherwise specified, baseline, defined as fold change = 1, was set as undifferentiated hiPSCs, or if undetected, a cycle number of 40 was assigned to allow fold change calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>).

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sarah XL Huang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a novel idea on simultaneous heart and lung induction from hPSCs. The work has a very good potential to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the manuscript in its current form is not publishable. There is consensus that the reproducibility of a given protocol must be demonstrated using multiple hPSC lines. Under COVID situation, the full protocol should be tested using at least another pluripotent cell line. In addition, the work in its current form lacks rigor and complete lineage characterization at key differentiation steps, as described in the review comments. The reviewers are confident that when such data are provided, there is a high possibility that it will support the conclusion of the paper, but the authors should not leave the readers to speculate.</p><p>The overall suggestion is that the authors should revise the manuscript to (1) perform additional thorough characterization of the differentiation culture up to the cardiac and lung progenitor specification stage of the protocol (day 15); (2) give an explicit clarification that progenitor specification is the focus of the current manuscript, and the maturation of cardiac and lung lineages will be investigated in-depth in near future studies. Otherwise, multi-lineage characterization within each of the organ and functional analyses on mature cell types are required for publication. This will take considerable time. (3) Analyses of the data that provide mechanistic insights into how each of the developmental milestones is achieved by the protocol (day 1-15), will greatly increase the impact of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Expression of lung (NKX2.1) and cardiac (NKX2.5) markers (Figure 1and2) is based on immunofluorescence and RT-PCR, but it remains unclear which percentage of cells expressed these markers, and which expressed neither marker. FACS analysis could have provided such data. This is relevant information for assessing the efficiency of the differentiation protocol (and comparison to those based on separate endoderm and mesoderm induction). Along the same line, it is unclear which percentage of cells ultimately expressed alveolar and cardiac markers in the 3D suspension cultures.</p><p>2. The approach to use scaffold-free 3D suspension cultures to create microtissues is not novel in the field of hiPSC and has been used e.g. in studies on cardiac myocyte and endothelial cell development. What was the reason to select this system, also because most alveolar differentiation protocols use Matrigel based organoid cultures?</p><p>3. In Figure 3, the authors use activin A to suppress development of cells of the cardiac lineage, and show that these support alveolar type 2 cell maturation. How did the authors check that activin A indeed suppressed development of cardiac cells and thus provide (indirect) evidence for the role of cardiac cells in alveolar development?</p><p>4. In Figure 3, the authors show that no alveolar type 2 cells are developed in the ALI culture system. Is there any evidence that this may be explained by loss of cells of the cardiac lineage?</p><p>5. Regarding further characterization of alveolar epithelial cells: did the authors also check for markers of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells?</p><p>6. Regarding further characterization of cardiac cells/cardiomyocytes: was any attempt made to quantify contraction, and show that this could e.g. be blocked using ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers such as verapamil? And did they check other markers to show that the cells had developed into more mature heart cells, including other sarcomere markers, but also ion channels etc?</p><p>7. To achieve cardiopulmonary segregation as shown in Figure 4, the authors first used CKDCI medium from day 15-18, before switching to KDCI. What happened to alveolar type 2 marker expression upon CHIR withdrawal and segregation (was the alveolar niche fully established at day 18, and was therefore exogenous WNT activation no longer needed?), and was this segregation also observed if cultures were directly switched to KDCI on day 15?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While a potentially very interesting model, much more in depth characterization is required. Each component, as well intervening stages of development should be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are further clarifications to some of the above-mentioned weaknesses, as well as additional suggestions on how the manuscript could be improved to increase the impact of the work.</p><p>Lines 24-30 of manuscript: the authors reasoned that WNT signaling is required for both mesodermal and endodermal specification. On this basis, the authors explained why they decided to use WNT agonist CHIR for mesoderm and DE co-induction from hiPSC line BU3. To my knowledge, the justification is not supported by lung developmental studies. In other words, the data shows convincing evidence of meso- and endo- dermal induction by the end of stage-1/day 4, however the interpretations provided by the authors are not accurate. A more plausible explanation is that, within the first 48 hours (day 1-2), high dose of WNT agonist CHIR induces primitive streak formation from part of the hiPSCs in culture. Subsequently, the newly formed primitive streak provides endogenous WNT, BMP and Nodal/Activin signaling to pattern the rest of the hiPSCs in culture to form mesoderm and DE by the end of day 4. This alternative mechanistic explanation is supported by evidence from both the existing literature and the authors' own data. Brivanlou's group elegantly demonstrated that activation of WNT signaling solely is sufficient to induce primitive streak from hPSCs. In addition, the dosage of CHIR applied in day 1-2 is way too high to be able to induce endoderm with lung potential. Furthermore, the authors maintain the cells in pluripotent medium mTESR1 for the first 48 hours (lines 48-50 of manuscript), which is critical for the success of the protocol (lines 87-90 of manuscript, suppl Figure 3). This supports my hypothesis that CHIR induces part of the hiPSCs in culture to form primitive streak during the first 48 hours, mTESR1 is required to maintain the remaining hiPS cells in culture in pluripotent state during this stage, before they start meso- and endo-dermal differentiation in day 2-4. Consistently, the data shows that Activin A or BMP inhibition during days 2-4 is detrimental for DE or mesodermal induction. Single cell analysis at 48 hr would be sufficient to prove a mixture of &quot;primitive streak and pluripotent cells&quot; profile, which will provide valuable mechanistic insights.</p><p>The whole manuscript is based on the differentiation of a double reporter line derived from one parental hiPSC line BU3. For scientific rigor and assurance, it is necessary to demonstrate efficient co-differentiation of lung and heart from other parental hPSC lines (both reporter and non-reporter) using the combination of time and dosage depicted in the current protocol.</p><p>It is convincing that most of the NKX2-1+ cells are lung fated and NKX2-5+ cells are cardiac fated, however, for scientific rigor and thoroughness, it is necessary to characterize the differentiation culture to exclude contamination of neural (EpCAM-) and thyroid (PAX8+) fated NKX2-1+ cells, and to confirm that all the NKX2-5+ cells co-express other cardiac progenitor markers such as KDR and PdgfR-α. Based on previous studies, some of the early lung progenitors co-express NKX2-5, therefore the authors must confirm whether NKX2-5+ cells at day 15 and on are NKX2-1- and EpCAM- cells.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Recapitulating Human Cardio-pulmonary Co-development Using Simultaneous Multilineage Differentiation of Pluripotent Stem Cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Paul Noble (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>While the manuscript is improved, significant concerns remain that need to be addressed for publication. In particular, reviewer 2 has specific concerns that we would like to see addressed in a revision</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have made important changes and added results of new experiments in this extensively revised manuscript. This has markedly improved the quality of the manuscript, and conclusions are much better supported by the results.</p><p>As a result the revised manuscript is interesting and provides a new and relevant model to study heart and lung development in a dish, and cross-talk between these developing organs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Ng et al., report on a system where cardiac mesoderm and pulmonary endoderm co-develop from pluripotent stem cells. This is of potential interest, as it could provide an integrated model for the study of human cardiopulmonary development. I still have quite a few concerns, though, which were not fully addressed by the authors.</p><p>1. In my first review, I pointed out that the main weakness lies in the lack of thorough characterization of the resulting cells and tissues. This is still the case. The characterization relies almost entirely on reporter gene expression and PCR for the same markers. In Figure 1, representative examples are shown of a limited set of markers. It would be nice to have quantification (and for intracellular flow quantification, analysis of cells not expressing the protein of interest should be used as a control). The qPCR data do shown that these markers are expressed, but they compare something to nothing (i.e. PSCs), so that fold changes will be always be very high. One image of the ultrastructure of type 2 cells is shown now, which is a plus. Overall, this work still does begs the question why the only pulmonary markers observed in this model are basically SFTPC and NKX2.1. Furthermore, type 2 identity has not been further verified with markers such as SFTPB, ABCA3, LAMP2. Another outstanding question for the lung component is whether any pulmonary mesenchyme was generated. This was still not addressed. In this era, at scRNAseq should be performed. This would also address several of my other concerns below.</p><p>2. It is still not clear which cardiac cells are generated: ventricular, atrial, endocardium, epicardium, conducting tissue? This is the same comment as in my first review. An experiment with verapamil or some cells expressing α-actinin, as shown here, do not address this question. Atrial and ventricular cells contract. I would also add that in many PSC differentiation cultures where lineages are not sufficiently rigorously specified, contamination with beating cardiomyocytes is quite typical. This may be the case here. It is also difficult to understand why type 2 cells and unspecified cardiac cells are the only output of this model.</p><p>3. In Figure 2-S1d, the nuclear stains for NKX2.5 and NKX2.1 do not seem to align with DAPI. The same is true in Figure 3-S1a, where the higher magnifications for NKX2.1, NKX2.5 and DAPI do not seem to align. The same is true again for Figure 4-S1d, where the pattern of NKX2.1 is not the inverse of that of NK2.5 (no DAPI shown here). Furthermore, there is much more cTNT positivity than NKX2.5 expression in Figure 2-S1d. One would expect the opposite. These potential inconsistencies make the images difficult to interpret.</p><p>4. Along the same lines, in Figure 3a and 3d, as well in Figure 3-S1b and Figure 3-S3b (each time lower right panel), there seems to be co-expression of NKX2.1 and NKX2.5. Or is this superposition? Are there cells that express neither marker? This is difficult to evaluate without DAPI images. Also, could it be that in Figure 3-S1, the reduced cardiac and pulmonary differentiation is due to reduced proliferation? Again, without a DAPI image, this is difficult to evaluate.</p><p>5. This sentence is unclear: 'This may in part be due to the reduction of cardiac progenitor as indicated by significant downregulation of NKX2.5 gene expression (Figure 4f, Figure 4—figure supplement 1d).' (line 292). According to Figure 4f, there is no downregulation of NKX2.5 in suspension culture.</p><p>6. In Figure 4c, which relies entirely on reporters, it would be nice to co-stain for the actual proteins and other markers identifying type 2 cells. I note that in Figure 3c, the fluorescence patterns of the GFP and TdTomato reporters is very different, yet they should both be cytoplasmic. In the reporter studies, it would be good to co-differentiate a non-reporter expressing line as a reporter-negative control for autofluorescence in Figure 4 and its supplements. Figure 4-S1c is apparently not commented on the text.</p><p>7. The authors mention in the rebuttal evidence for type 1 cells, as shown by staining for HOPX in a non-reporter line (Figure 4-S5) and in the reporter line (Figure 6b). However, HOPX is not a marker for type 1 cells in humans, and is expressed broadly, including in cardiomyocytes (see, among others, Friedman et al., Cell Stem Cell 2018). In Figure 6b, there does not appear to be much pro-SFTPC, and that seems to be on the outside of the structure, whereas in Figures 4 and 5, the NKX2.1+ cells are on the inside.</p><p>8. The authors should not call Act. A 'TGF-β' signaling. It is a TGF-β family ligand, but signals through its own receptors. It recapitulates Nodal signaling in vitro.</p><p>9. Finally, there is still no sufficient quantification of differentiation efficiency and yield. NKX2.1, for example is also expressed in the forebrain and in the thyroid. The minimal conditions described typical yield neurectoderm. TUJ1 was examined, but other markers, such as PAX 6 should be included.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>While a still potentially interesting model, much more in depth characterization is still required as well. In particular the nature and yield of the output should be better characterized, and figure quality and consistency should be paid attention to.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors addressed most of the questions and concerns raised in the 1st round of review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67872.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors present a novel idea on simultaneous heart and lung induction from hPSCs.

Specifically, we have included additional FACS analysis on Day-15 to provide a more comprehensive cellular characterization (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a), and have also confirmed that the NKX2.1<sup>+</sup> progenitors are neither neural- nor thyroid-fated by co-staining with PAX8 and TUJ1 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1d). Furthermore, we showed that NKX2.5<sup>+</sup> progenitors are cardiac-fated as they co-express cTnT (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d).</p><p>(2) We agree with the reviewers’ comment and suggestion that the present study is primarily focused on progenitor specification. We have added explicit statements to emphasize this at discussion line 490-493; line 603-606. Nonetheless, in the revised manuscript, we have provided additional alveolar epithelial characterization in 3D cardio-pulmonary μTs to show positive immunofluorescence staining of SFTPC and HOPX (Figure 6b), as well as the presence of lamellar bodies by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 6a). In parallel, the cardiac μTs exhibited a striated pattern when stained for cTnT and sarcomeric α actinin (Figure 6c,d). Additionally, the cardiac μTs were functional and responded to calcium channel blockers (Verapamil) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6e).</p><p>(3) Based on the reviewers’ suggestions and to provide further mechanistic insights regarding developmental milestones, we have included staining markers of primitive streak (Brachyury) and mesendoderm (MIXL1) after 2 days of initial CHIR99021 induction, and used FACS analysis to show that the majority of resulting cells have committed to primitive streak at this stage (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>(4) We have also validated our differentiation protocol on an additional hiPSC line, including germ layer induction, cardio-pulmonary progenitor induction, and 3D µT formation and maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):1.

Therefore, we confirmed that Activin A supplementation suppressed the induction of cardiac cells, which suggested the potential positive impact of cardiac accompaniment during alveolar maturation. This is consistent with findings from rodent embryogenesis that chemical cues derived from the heart field play key roles in lung development. <sup>3,4</sup> We have included additional discussion in the revised manuscript (line 556-559).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In the revised manuscript, we have added qPCR analysis to compare cardiac NKX2.5 expression in both ALI and 3D suspension culture. We found that NKX2.5 gene expression (by qPCR) was significantly downregulated in ALI culture compared to 3D suspension culture (Figure 4f). This was further supported by immunostaining (Figure 4—figure supplement 1d), which showed a reduction in the cardiac population in ALI culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Regarding further characterization of alveolar epithelial cells: did the authors also check for markers of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, in the revised manuscript, we added alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell characterization by performing HOPX staining <sup>5-7</sup> on Day-22 cardio-pulmonary μTs and observed the presence of AT1-like cells that did not colocalize with the AT2 cell marker SFTPC (Figure 6b). Nonetheless, the organization of these AT1-like cells in μTs remained different from that in the native lung. This suggests that further optimization of AT1 maturation is needed to overcome this limitation. We have also addressed this in the manuscript (line 585-587).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Regarding further characterization of cardiac cells/cardiomyocytes: was any attempt made to quantify contraction, and show that this could e.g. be blocked using ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers such as verapamil? And did they check other markers to show that the cells had developed into more mature heart cells, including other sarcomere markers, but also ion channels etc?</p></disp-quote><p>To further investigate the function of contracting cardiac lineages, in the revised manuscript, we added an experiment to treat the cardio-pulmonary μTs with different concentrations of Verapamil (calcium channel blocker). Using Ca520 as a calcium influx indicator, we showed that the effect of Verapamil on the cardiac μTs was dose-dependent (Figure 6e). Furthermore, we have included cTnT and Sarcomeric Α Actinin staining on Day-22 μTs, which revealed a striated pattern (Figure 6c,d). Together, this provides more compelling evidence of the functionality of the induced cardiac tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. To achieve cardiopulmonary segregation as shown in Figure 4, the authors first used CKDCI medium from day 15-18, before switching to KDCI.

Further investigation is needed to address whether the complete supporting niche for alveologenesis can be fully established and if the corresponding time point can be identified. In addition, we found that CHIR was indeed an important factor to induce alveologenesis, consistent with previous publications. <sup>1,2</sup> Without the addition of CHIR following Day-15 differentiation, we observed no maturation of AT2 cells on Day-18 of µT culture (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b,c). As for segregation, cardio-pulmonary µTs cultured directly in KDCI (without CHIR) from Day-15 were still able to undergo segregation over time (Figure 5—figure supplement 1d,e).

This is of potential interest, as it could provide an integrated model for the study of human cardiopulmonary development. I still have quite a few concerns, though, which were not fully addressed by the authors.</p><p>1. In my first review, I pointed out that the main weakness lies in the lack of thorough characterization of the resulting cells and tissues. This is still the case. The characterization relies almost entirely on reporter gene expression and PCR for the same markers. In Figure 1, representative examples are shown of a limited set of markers. It would be nice to have quantification (and for intracellular flow quantification, analysis of cells not expressing the protein of interest should be used as a control). The qPCR data do shown that these markers are expressed, but they compare something to nothing (i.e. PSCs), so that fold changes will be always be very high. One image of the ultrastructure of type 2 cells is shown now, which is a plus. Overall, this work still does begs the question why the only pulmonary markers observed in this model are basically SFTPC and NKX2.1. Furthermore, type 2 identity has not been further verified with markers such as SFTPB, ABCA3, LAMP2. Another outstanding question for the lung component is whether any pulmonary mesenchyme was generated. This was still not addressed. In this era, at scRNAseq should be performed. This would also address several of my other concerns below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and have organized our response in three subsections as described below.</p><p>(a) It would be nice to have quantification (and for intracellular flow quantification), analysis of cells not expressing the protein of interest should be used as a control.</p><p>We have performed additional flow cytometry experiments to characterize and quantitate mesoderm and endoderm induction during Stage-1 of differentiation.

In figures such as Figure 1d, we agree that normalization based on hiPSCs that did not express the target gene led to fold changes that appeared to be very high. However, the main comparisons that we intend to deliver in these experiments were those between different differentiation conditions, such as different CHIR concentrations, where in all conditions there were measurable expression of the target gene and the fold change between groups is much more realistic than the comparison versus hiPSCs. The high fold change values relative to hiPSC control did not affect us to perform accurate comparison regarding gene expression levels between different differentiation conditions.</p><p>(c) Overall, this work still does begs the question why the only pulmonary markers observed in this model are basically SFTPC and NKX2.1. furthermore, type 2 identity has not been further verified with markers such as SFTPB, ABCA3, LAMP2.

Further, based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have included characterization of an additional marker (pro-SFTPB) to verify AT2 identity (Figure 6—figure supplement 1a). Staining of S100A4, a marker for mesenchyme, has been performed in the 3D cardio-pulmonary μT (Figure 6—figure supplement 1c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is still not clear which cardiac cells are generated: ventricular, atrial, endocardium, epicardium, conducting tissue? This is the same comment as in my first review. An experiment with verapamil or some cells expressing α-actinin, as shown here, do not address this question. Atrial and ventricular cells contract. I would also add that in many PSC differentiation cultures where lineages are not sufficiently rigorously specified, contamination with beating cardiomyocytes is quite typical. This may be the case here. It is also difficult to understand why type 2 cells and unspecified cardiac cells are the only output of this model.</p></disp-quote><p>(a) It is still not clear which cardiac cells are generated.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have performed additional staining to characterize the identity of the induced cardiac cells, including ventricular myocytes (MLC2v), atrial myocytes (COUPTFII), endocardium (NFATC) and epicardium (WT1). In Figure 2—figure supplement 1d, we observed presence of NKX2.5+COUPTFII+ cardiac cells but negative for the rest markers such as MLC2v, NFATC and WT1, suggesting that the some of the cardiac cells have been specified into atrial myocytes. The observation of atrial induction is consistent with the presence of retinoic acid in our co-differentiation medium, which has been shown to be critical for atrial specification [3-5].

However, based on our flow cytometry analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a), a balanced induction of pulmonary (32.8%) and cardiac (39.3%) cells were observed. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1b, we further confirmed that emergence of cardiac cells could be modulated by Activin A.

In Figure 2-S1d, the nuclear stains for NKX2.5 and NKX2.1 do not seem to align with DAPI. The same is true in Figure 3-S1a, where the higher magnifications for NKX2.1, NKX2.5 and DAPI do not seem to align. The same is true again for Figure 4-S1d, where the pattern of NKX2.1 is not the inverse of that of NK2.5 (no DAPI shown here). Furthermore, there is much more cTNT positivity than NKX2.5 expression in Figure 2-S1d. One would expect the opposite. These potential inconsistencies make the images difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to high confluency after long term culture (15 days), the cells were arranged in multiple layers, resulting in superimposition, and thus it was difficult to appreciate DAPI staining with the presence of different cell lineages. Although confocal imaging would have solved this issue, but the co-differentiation was performed in 96 well plate, rendering difficulty to image with confocal microscopy. We have included respective DAPI images in Figure 2—figure supplement 1d, Figure 3—figure supplement 1a, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1d. Figure 4-S1d represented the cells cultured on Transwell Membrane. While one may expect the inverse relationship between NKX2.1 and NKX2.5 staining, within Day-15 differentiated cells, there were still about 20% of cell that belong to neither cardiac or pulmonary lineages. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1d, we observed that majority of the NKX2.5 cells were cTnT positive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Along the same lines, in Figure 3a and 3d, as well in Figure 3-S1b and Figure 3-S3b (each time lower right panel), there seems to be co-expression of NKX2.1 and NKX2.5. Or is this superposition? Are there cells that express neither marker? This is difficult to evaluate without DAPI images. Also, could it be that in Figure 3-S1, the reduced cardiac and pulmonary differentiation is due to reduced proliferation? Again, without a DAPI image, this is difficult to evaluate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In Figure 3a, 3d, Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, Figure 3—figure supplement 3b, due to high cell confluency, the resulting cells from different lineages were superimposed. As the reviewer suggested, we have included DAPI images. By referring to Figure 4b, using confocal imaging of cardio-pulmonary μT, we did not observe obvious co-localization between NKX2.1 and NKX2.5 expression. Indeed, there were cells that do not express either cardiac or pulmonary marker as shown by flow cytometry analysis, where there were about 20% cells that expressed neither NKX2.1 nor NKX2.5 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a). In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, it is still possible that the reduced cardio-pulmonary differentiation was due to reduced proliferation since initial differentiation medium in B27 minus insulin was harsh compared to mTESR1. However, the well was full of cells at the end of differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. This sentence is unclear: 'This may in part be due to the reduction of cardiac progenitor as indicated by significant downregulation of NKX2.5 gene expression (Figure 4f, Figure 4—figure supplement 1d).' (line 292). According to Figure 4f, there is no downregulation of NKX2.5 in suspension culture.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. The sentence “This may in part be due to the reduction of cardiac progenitor as indicated by significant downregulation of NKX2.5 gene expression (Figure 4f, Figure 4—figure supplement 1d).” In this context, we were comparing 3D suspension culture with ALI culture. We found 3D suspension is a more robust system for alveolar maturation as indicated by SFTPC gene induction. We anticipated that the lower alveolar specification efficiency in ALI culture was due to reduction of cardiac progenitor as pointed out in Figure 4f (ALI vs. Day-15 cells) and Figure 4—figure supplement 1d (Immunostaining on ALI) (line 295).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 4c, which relies entirely on reporters, it would be nice to co-stain for the actual proteins and other markers identifying type 2 cells. I note that in Figure 3c, the fluorescence patterns of the GFP and TdTomato reporters is very different, yet they should both be cytoplasmic. In the reporter studies, it would be good to co-differentiate a non-reporter expressing line as a reporter-negative control for autofluorescence in Figure 4 and its supplements. Figure 4-S1c is apparently not commented on the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have included staining for both pro-SFTPC and pro-SFTPB to further verify type 2 identify as demonstrated in Figure 6b and Figure 6—figure supplement 1a. The fluorescence reporter TdTomato is generally a subset of GFP, as only a portion of the GFP+ lung progenitors have matured into type 2 cells (labelled by TdTomato). Thus, not all GFP cells would express SFTPC. To address the possibility of autofluorescence, as the reviewer suggested, we have added representative images of non-reporter BU1 hiPSC line as a control (Figure 4—figure supplement 6). We have also commented Figure 4—figure supplement 1c in the text (line 286-287).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors mention in the rebuttal evidence for type 1 cells, as shown by staining for HOPX in a non-reporter line (Figure 4-S5) and in the reporter line (Figure 6b). However, HOPX is not a marker for type 1 cells in humans, and is expressed broadly, including in cardiomyocytes (see, among others, Friedman et al., Cell Stem Cell 2018). In Figure 6b, there does not appear to be much pro-SFTPC, and that seems to be on the outside of the structure, whereas in Figures 4 and 5, the NKX2.1+ cells are on the inside.</p></disp-quote><p>(a) HOPX is not a marker for type 1 cells in humans, and is expressed broadly, including in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Thank you for the comment.

Although HOPX expression has been observed in cardiomyocytes, [7] we did not observe HOPX expression following establishment of cardio-pulmonary progenitors, and the induction of HOPX coincided with alveolar maturation during Day-15 to Day-18.</p><p>(b) In Figure 6b, there does not appear to be much pro-SFTPC, and that seems to be on the outside of the structure, whereas in Figures 4 and 5, the NKX2.1+ cells are on the inside.</p><p>In Figure 6b, the μTs have been cultured in maturation medium without CHIR for 4 days. With CHIR withdrawal after Day-18, tissues in the μTs would have reorganized themselves and the pulmonary tissue started to undergo segregation from the cardiac tissue, leading to the pulmonary lineages to move towards the edge (Figure 5a). While in Figure 4, and Figure 5, the μTs were of Day-18 (before cardio-pulmonary segregation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors should not call Act. A 'TGF-β' signaling.

Finally, there is still no sufficient quantification of differentiation efficiency and yield. NKX2.1, for example is also expressed in the forebrain and in the thyroid.

The data has been included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>While a still potentially interesting model, much more in depth characterization is still required as well.
