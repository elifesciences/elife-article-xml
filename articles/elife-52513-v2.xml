Instead of being randomly distributed along DNA, nucleosomes are typically evenly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Widom, 1998</xref>) and aligned to key regulatory features, such as transcriptional start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>) and transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The action of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes plays a key role in the establishment of nucleosome organisation in vivo at promoters and adjacent to transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wiechens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krietenstein et al., 2016</xref>). Different members of the protein family have distinct roles in this process. Here, we focus on the action of Chd1. Chd1 is known to contribute to the establishment of promoter-based nucleosome organisation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>) and has the ability to generate evenly separated nucleosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lieleg et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanism by which even spacing is achieved is not fully understood.</p><p>Chromatin remodelling enzymes contain catalytic domains that include RecA folds, placing them within an extended family of DNA translocases, the superfamily II grouping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, chromatin remodelling enzymes are observed to translocate along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deindl et al., 2013</xref>). The single-strand processing herpes virus helicase, NS3, provides a paradigm for understanding the mechanism of DNA translocation of superfamily II proteins. A series of crystal structures show the contacts between NS3 and the DNA tracking strand and indicate a ratcheting action during the ATP hydrolysis cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu and Rice, 2010</xref>). In this case, a combination of structures and biochemical studies provides a structural basis for 3’–5’ DNA translocation. Snf2-related chromatin remodelling enzymes also translocate on DNA with 3’–5’ directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deindl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A major advance in understanding how remodelling enzymes reposition nucleosomes has been provided by structures obtained using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In many cases, the ATPase domains are observed to bind nucleosomes at superhelical location +2 (SHL+2) or the symmetry-related location at SHL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armache et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2020</xref>). In some cases, structures have been obtained of enzymes bound to nucleosomes, including linker DNA on one side only. Where the enzyme includes additional domains capable of recognising this DNA, a favoured orientation for binding can be determined. This is the case for the relatively simple, single subunit remodelling enzyme, Chd1, which includes a DNA binding domain that binds to linker DNA extending to approximately 15 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nodelman et al., 2022</xref>). These structures also enable directionality of ATP-dependent DNA translocation to be inferred, making use of homology to NS3. Surprisingly, this indicates that Chd1 is oriented such that translocation would be anticipated to extend the long linker. This is counter to the known biochemical action of Chd1 which repositions nucleosomes towards the centre of DNA fragments so that linkers of approximately equal length are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stockdale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKnight et al., 2011</xref>). This has given rise to proposals that the cryo-EM structures represent an inhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nodelman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nodelman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that Chd1 acts to reposition nucleosomes from SHL+2, rather than the SHL -2 location observed in previous cryo-EM structures. We also observe that the binding of Chd1 to nucleosomes changes in the presence of ATP, enabling contacts between the ATPase domains and SHL+2. We obtain structures of Chd1 bound to nucleosomes in the presence of ATP that can be considered snapshots of the reaction cycle. From these observations, we propose a mechanism involving transitions between Chd1 oriented to direct repositioning in both directions. When combined with the ability of the DNA binding domain to sample DNA length, this provides a means by which continuous cycles of remodelling could generate evenly spaced nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Repositioning by Chd1 requires intact DNA on the exit side of the nucleosomes</title><p>To investigate whether the interactions with the entry or exit side of the nucleosome are required for Chd1-mediated repositioning, a series of two base pair gaps was introduced into a DNA fragment containing the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence. The positions of these gaps on the linear DNA fragment and how these are arranged when assembled into nucleosomes are illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, respectively. Chd1-driven repositioning of nucleosomes assembled on these DNA templates was directly compared to repositioning on intact DNA spiked into the same reaction but labelled with a different fluorescent dye. After the reaction was quenched, the positioning of nucleosomes on identical DNA fragments, with or without gaps was assessed by native gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CD</xref>). The introduction of gaps at all sites was observed to reduce the rate at which nucleosomes were repositioned. In three cases, repositioning was so slow that substantially less than 50% of nucleosomes were repositioned after 32 min. These sites positioned the gap from +15 to +35 on DNA sequences anticipated to interfere with Chd1 action if it were bound to the opposite SHL to that observed in cryo-EM structures in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nodelman et al., 2022</xref>). As this is the side of the nucleosome where new exit DNA is generated following Chd1 action, we refer to it as the exit side of the nucleosome. Gaps both on the top strand, in which the dyad base is deoxycytosine, and the bottom strand, in which it is a deoxyguanosine, had strong effects. This is consistent with previous data showing that within nucleosomes, translocation of RSC is impeded by gaps on either strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saha et al., 2005</xref>). The basis for this is now clearer as ATPase domains make extensive contact with both DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNA gaps at SHL +2, but not at SHL -2 prevent repositioning by Chd1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2 bp gaps were introduced as illustrated on a linear representation of a DNA fragment, including the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence and an asymmetric 49 bp linker and (<bold>B</bold>) on a 3D representation of the same DNA bound by Chd1 (based on PDB 6 FTX).

This can be used to direct cleavage of DNA from the two copies of H4 4 bp on either side of the nucleosome dyad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> lane 4). Following the repositioning of intact nucleosomes, the major product is repositioned by 20 base pairs to a location that is close to the centre of the DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> lane 3). In contrast, on gapped templates that greatly reduced repositioning, nucleosomes were substantially retained at their original locations (gaps at +25 C, +15 C). Repositioning of nucleosomes on the template with the gap at +35 results in repositioning of nucleosomes to an intermediate location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> lane 9). In this case, gaps are drawn into the nucleosome until they reach locations equivalent to +25 and +15 that are inhibitory. This is consistent with previous observations with Chd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKnight et al., 2011</xref>), Isw2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>), and RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saha et al., 2005</xref>) all indicating that repositioning is impeded by gaps on the exit side of the nucleosome. It is also consistent with the previous observation that appropriately placed gaps do not prevent the initiation of repositioning but can limit the extent of repositioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabantsev et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Chd1 activity is blocked by occlusion of ATPase binding to entry side nucleosomal DNA</title><p>DNA gaps could potentially prevent the ATPase domains making contacts required to drive DNA across the nucleosome surface. Alternatively, they could increase DNA flexibility, preventing distortions to DNA from propagating across the nucleosome surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). To distinguish between these explanations, steric blocks were introduced into nucleosomes with otherwise intact DNA strands. This was achieved through the coupling of streptavidin to biotinylated DNA bases. Binding of streptavidin has previously been shown to provide a means of blocking Chd1 binding to one side of nucleosomes while binding to the other side is not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nodelman et al., 2017</xref>). This approach was adapted to determine which nucleosomal surface is required for repositioning by assembling nucleosomes onto 194 bp DNA fragments with biotin introduced on either side of the nucleosome dyad. In the absence of streptavidin, native gel electrophoresis indicates that nucleosomes on both biotin-labelled DNAs are repositioned to more central locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AB</xref> lanes 1–5). In the presence of streptavidin, both DNA and nucleosomes are super-shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AB</xref> lanes 6–10), but this is not complete for nucleosomes labelled on the SHL+2 side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> 6–11), most likely due to incomplete biotinylation. In the case of the SHL-2 labelled nucleosomes, a subtle shift in the mobility of the streptavidin-bound nucleosomes was observed following incubation with Chd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> lanes 7–10). To confirm this shift in mobility represents a change in the histone octamer on this DNA fragment, reactions were repeated using S47C octamers with the Fe EDTA compound attached to enable the location of histone H4 to be determined by directed DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This confirms that both in the presence and absence of streptavidin, Chd1 action causes a reduction in the proportion of nucleosomes at the original location and an increase at a new location shifted 20 base pairs towards the linker DNA. A comparable shift was not observed for nucleosomes bound by streptavidin SHL +2, suggesting that binding in this region prevented repositioning.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Access to SHL +2, but not SHL -2, is required for Chd1-directed nucleosome repositioning.</title><p>DNA fragments in which the 601 sequence is flanked by a 49 bp linker were generated with a biotin-modified base introduced at –17 (<bold>A</bold>) or +17 (<bold>B</bold>). Nucleosomes were assembled onto these fragments and found to be repositioned to more central locations following incubation of 100 nM nucleosome with 5 nM Chd1 and 1 mM ATP. In the presence of 400 nM streptavidin, both nucleosome and DNA fragments are supershifted (Lanes 6–10). A supershift corresponding to repositioning of streptavidin-bound nucleosomes was only observed for nucleosomes bound by streptavidin at SHL -2. (<bold>C</bold>) Nucleosome repositioning was measured at high resolution using site-directed hydroxyl radical cleavage.

In contrast, published structures of Chd1 all indicate that ATPase domains interact with the SHL location distal to entry DNA. To investigate whether Chd1 engages with DNA in a different conformation during ATP hydrolysis, samples were prepared in which Chd1-nucleosome complexes with a 32 bp linker DNA on one side were incubated with 100 µM ATP prior to mild cross-linking and plunge freezing onto EM grids. Following the collection of high-resolution movies, the data was processed using the CryoSPARC workflow utilising 3D variability analysis, hierarchical classification, particle subtraction, and local refinement to determine different species present within the dataset. Four major species were identified, including unbound nucleosomes and three major Chd1-bound nucleosome complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the arrangement of nucleosomal DNA is almost identical to that observed in the unbound nucleosome with both sides of the nucleosome DNA edge wrapped and well-defined DNA on the putative exit side, suggesting that repositioning has not taken place. Density corresponding to the Chd1 ATPase lobes and a portion of the chromodomain is detected at the SHL2 region closer to the short edge of the nucleosomal DNA. This contrasts with previous structures of Chd1-nucleosome complexes in which Chd1 is bound at the SHL -2 location adjacent to the longer linker DNA. We speculate that complex I represents a previously undetected state formed during activation of Chd1 in which ATPase lobes are repositioned to the opposite side of the nucleosome in an orientation that is poised for driving DNA from the longer to the short linker. As there is no evidence that DNA has been repositioned, we believe this intermediate requires additional reconfiguration prior to gaining full activity for DNA translocation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Chd1-nucleosome complexes detected in the presence of ATP.</title><p>Complexes between Chd1 and nucleosomes with 29 bp linker DNA on one side were incubated with 100 μM ATP for 10 min at 25°C prior to cross-linking and cryo-grid preparation.

The DNA in this structure is not as precisely positioned as in previous structures. We observe additional density on the short linker side extending 5–7 bp further than observed in nucleosomes. As a result, it’s likely that this structure is formed during or subsequent to ATP-dependent nucleosome repositioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Chd1 ATPase domains bind to both sides of nucleosomes in the presence of ATP</title><p>To validate the ATP-dependent changes in the orientation of Chd1 engagement, FeEDTA was coupled to Chd1 at a cysteine residue engineered at 524 within ATPase lobe 1. Importantly, Chd1 proteins, including this mutation, remain active for nucleosome repositioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). DNA cleavages directed from this site show strand specificity with weak cleavage on the top (C at dyad) strand at 16/17 either in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> lane 2+3). On the bottom (G at dyad) strand, stronger cleavage is observed at 17/15 on the top strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> lanes 2+3). These cleavages are all consistent with the configuration of Chd1 binding previously observed in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>3</sub> by EM and cross-linking with the ATPase domains bound to the SHL2 location distal to linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nodelman et al., 2022</xref>). In the presence of 1.5 or 2.5 μM ATP, strong additional cleavage of the top strand and weak cleavage of the bottom strand are observed at +15 (top strand) and +18 (bottom strand). These new cleavages are consistent with repositioning of Chd1 from the familiar state in which the DNABD is bound to the entry linker and ATPase lobes bound to the adjacent SHL2 in the presence of no nucleotide or ADP-BeF<sub>3</sub> to being bound equally to both sides of the nucleosome in the presence of ATP. To reduce the possibility of nucleosome repositioning leading to altered Chd1 mapping, low concentrations (2.5 μM) of ATP were used, reactions were performed at 0°C, and nucleosomes were assembled on templates with short linkers that are known to be repositioned less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stockdale et al., 2006</xref>). Mapping the locations of nucleosomes using FeEDTA coupled at H4S47C confirmed that nucleosomes are substantially retained at their initial locations under these conditions, which are slightly different to those used for cryo EM. This indicates that the binding of Chd1 to both sides of nucleosomes in the presence of ATP is likely to occur prior to nucleosome repositioning. Due to the symmetry of the nucleosome and as our structures do not resolve DNA bases, it is not possible to assign the orientation of complexes from the density maps alone. The changes in directed DNA cleavage indicate a proportion of complexes are formed on the opposite side of the nucleosome in the presence of ATP. The concentration of ATP in the reactions is below the Km for ATP, and this may limit the extent of the change in binding orientation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ATP-dependent changes to the binding of Chd1 ATPase domains.</title><p>Hydroxyl radical mapping, directed by Chd1 S524C (300 nM), on nucleosomes (100 nM) with a 13 bp linker reports on the location of the ATPase lobes in apo, ADP-BeF<sub>3</sub>-, and ATP-bound states.

The interaction of Chd1 with SHL +2 is required for repositioning, indicating that this nucleotide-dependent switch in binding orientation is required for productive nucleosome repositioning. These observations are consistent with the orientation in which Chd1 repositions asymmetrically blocked nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nodelman et al., 2021</xref>). Recent studies provide evidence for nucleotide-dependent changes to remodelling enzyme structure on different scales. Localised changes to the DNA contacts made by the ATPase domains take place as they drive DNA distortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabantsev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sia et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Winger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malik et al., 2025</xref>). The changes we observe occur on a larger scale and likely occur in addition to these smaller scale changes. We suspect that larger scale reconfiguration of ATPase domain interactions may be a common feature of remodelling enzymes that act to space nucleosomes evenly when relevant accessory domains are associated with the ATPase. Indeed, larger scale changes in domain interactions have been observed in ISWI enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gangaraju et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>).</p><p>By combining the observations made here with previous reports, we can synthesise a likely reaction cycle for the Chd1 enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Initially, Chd1 is likely to associate with nucleosomes in the configuration observed previously in the absence of nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nodelman et al., 2022</xref>). Upon ATP binding, at least a proportion of Chd1 ATPase domains dissociate from SHL-2 and reassociate at SHL +2, consistent with complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the appearance of site-directed DNA cleavage at SHL +2 in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The mechanism driving this switch is unclear; however, translocation of Chd1 by even 1 bp from the apo state would generate strain between the DNA binding domain, the ChEx domain and the ATPase lobes due to the associated ~30° change in their rotational orientation around the DNA helix. Under this strain, the ATPase lobes may be prone to dissociate as the DNA binding domain has a higher affinity for DNA. Remaining nucleosome contacts made via both the ChEx domain and DNA-binding domain may act to reduce the probability of complete Chd1 dissociation and favour reassociation at the alternate SHL +2 location. We do not detect density corresponding to the DNA binding domain in complex I, likely the result of failure to form a stable interaction with DNA as is the case in ISWI enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sia et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malik et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chio et al., 2024</xref>). A recent report describing distinct nucleotide-free forms of human Chd1 indicates the ability of the DNA binding domain to bind the opposite side of the nucleosomes to the ATPase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">James and Farnung, 2025</xref>). This supports the concept that Chd1 domains can independently associate with different sides of the nucleosome. However, the way in which hChd1 interacts with nucleosomes is distinct from yChd1 in that it does not unravel 10 bp of DNA in the nucleotide bound state and multiple nucleotide free states are observed. Yeast Chd1 forms a well-defined apo complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nodelman et al., 2022</xref>) and repositioning of the ATPase domains to the other side of the nucleosome requires ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Following the association of ATPase domains on the other side of the nucleosome, the DNA-binding and ChEx domains could dissociate from their original locations to complete a switch between nucleosomal surfaces. This ability to efficiently associate with different sides of the nucleosome is consistent with previous observations indicating a single Chd1 has the ability to direct repositioning of nucleosomes in different directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, in complex I, the DNA ends are well defined and indistinguishable from those in nucleosomes not bound by Chd1 (EMD-53596). As a result, we believe Complex I is likely to be inactive for DNA translocation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A mechanism for Chd1-mediated nucleosome spacing.</title><p>Chd1 is likely to initially bind nucleosomes in the conformation previously observed in the absence of nucleotides RSC PDB 7TN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nodelman et al., 2022</xref>). In the presence of ATP, this is converted to Complex I, in which the organisation of nucleosomal DNA has the same arrangement as nucleosomes prior to remodelling, but Chd1 is bound on the opposite side. The lack of DNA dynamics suggests Complex I is inactive for repositioning, and in the absence of linker DNA on the entry side, the location of the DNA binding domain is dynamic and so not resolved. Transition to Complex II involves association of the ChEx domain. In Complex II, the DNA ends are poorly defined, consistent with ongoing ATP-dependent translocation, which is likely to occur in single base steps. Extension of exit DNA to a length of approximately 15 bp, sufficient to bind the DNA binding domain, allows formation of Complex III. Association of the DNA binding domain is likely to constrain further DNA translocation, meaning this Complex III can be considered product inhibited. Via a process similar to the initial change in ATPase lobe binding, Complex III could be converted to a conformation related to Complex I, but with the ATPase lobes bound on the other side of the nucleosome. These symmetry-related complexes are labelled with brackets (Complex I). Activation of this complex would result in a second round of repositioning but with opposing directionality. Multiple cycles are anticipated to drive bidirectional repositioning tuned to favour a nucleosomal repeat length close to 15 bp. Colouring of Chd1 and nucleosomes is as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-52513-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The conversion of complex I to complex II is likely to be coupled with reassociation of the ChEx domain with the acidic patch as observed in the EM structure but could involve additional autoregulatory changes not resolved at the density obtained during ongoing ATP-hydrolysis but detected in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nodelman et al., 2025</xref>). In complex II, the DNA on both sides of the nucleosome has poorly defined ends, which is consistent with the ratcheting action of the ATPase domains driving DNA across the nucleosome in multiple steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabantsev et al., 2019</xref>) that are averaged within this state. This is also consistent with our observation that integrity of SHL +2, but not SHL -2, is required for Chd1-mediated repositioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). In complex II, the path of exit DNA is intermediate between a fully wrapped nucleosome and one in which one turn of DNA is unwrapped as observed in previous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This may reflect the ability of exit DNA linkers of between 8–12 bp to associate transiently with the DNA binding domain in a conformation which partially unwraps nucleosomal DNA. In this respect, forms of complex II with increasing exit linker lengths represent intermediates in the formation of complex III.</p><p>Complex III includes approximately 15 bp of exit linker which is sufficient to enable stable association of the DNA binding and ChEx domains in the conformations observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesise this represents a product-inhibited state in which the association of the DNA-binding domain constrains the extension of exit DNA. This would be anticipated to reduce the rate of repositioning as exit linker length approaches 15 bp a spacing similar to that observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>). As such, this provides a molecular basis for length-dependent DNA sensing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eustermann et al., 2024</xref>). The product-inhibited state is anticipated to be capable of reverting to the active state by conversion to complex I, this time located at SHL-2, enabling a subsequent round of repositioning in the opposite direction. Successive rounds of nucleosome shuffling would be anticipated to reposition nucleosomes away from barriers, such as bound transcription factors or adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Engeholm et al., 2024</xref>), with a bias towards mean spacing of 15 bp similar to that observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oberbeckmann et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We note that the 601 DNA sequence we use to direct nucleosome assembly at specific locations is asymmetric and has been shown to influence the directionality of repositioning by Chd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Winger and Bowman, 2017</xref>). We do not believe this is likely to influence directionality in the reactions performed in this study, as these sequence-dependent effects typically bias movement on nucleosomes with two linkers. In reactions performed with on nucleosomes assembed with a single linker, as is the case in our own experiments, Chd1 repositions regardless of asymmetric sequence elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levendosky et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One puzzling aspect of this pathway is that Chd1 initially associates with nucleosomes in a conformation that is likely to be less active as it is closely related to the product inhibit complex III. A potential explanation for this would be that this initial interaction: (i) samples the presence of entry DNA; (ii) samples for an accessible acidic path and (iii) destabilises the entry DNA by unwrapping the outer turn. This selects for a nucleosome with entry DNA suited for subseqeunt repostioning and primes the nucleosome for more efficient repositioning following the switch to the opposite side. A related process in which Chd1 switches from acting on one side of a nucleosome to the other could be involved in the resolution of hexasome nucleosome particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Engeholm et al., 2024</xref>). It is also notable that recently published structures of ISWI and SNF2H detect a series of intermediates in the formation of a nucleosome in which a single base is drawn between the ATPase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sia et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malik et al., 2025</xref>), but not a highly dynamic state compatible with an ongoing remodelling reaction comparable to our complex II, or evidence for switching of enzymes between different sides of a nucleosome. A possible explanation for this is that accesory domains in association with the ATPase domains are required for full activity including the switching behaviour. While the single subunit enzyme Chd1 includes accessory domains in a single polypetide, ISWI and SNF2H are likely to gain full functionality when incorporated into complexes with additional subunits that include accessory domains. We consider it likely that other ATPases that act to generate evenly spaced nucleosomes will act via pathways related to those we report for Chd1 here.</p><p>In summary, this work provides biochemical and structural evidence to support a mechanism for nucleosome spacing in which the remodelling enzyme Chd1 switches between different sides of a nucleosome to facilitate the establishment of regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes. Structures obtained in the presence of ATP identify previously undetected intermediates supporting a mechanism in which Chd1 domains sequentially sample different sides of a nucleosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nucleosomal DNA preparation</title><p>DNA was amplified via PCR from the Widom sequence, p601.2, using the primers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

For nucleosome position mapping, histone H3 C110A and histone H4 S47C mutants were used. Octamers were refolded by combining denatured (6 M guanidine hydrochloride) histones in equimolar ratios and dialysing in 3 changes of 2 M sodium chloride/10 mM Tris pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA and isolated via size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Nucleosome assembly</title><p>Nucleosomes were assembled via salt gradient dialysis of approximately 2.5 μM <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> octamer and 1.75 μM dsDNA.

Salt was reduced stepwise in 2 hr intervals from 0.85 M to 0.65 M to 0.5 M potassium chloride in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA; the two final dialyses were performed in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, with the final step taking place overnight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chd1 purification</title><p>Chd1 was expressed at 20°C over 48 hr in autoinduction media from a pGEX6p1 vector in Rosetta2 DE3 pLysS cells. Cells were resuspended in 40 mM Tris pH 7.5/400 mM sodium chloride with protease inhibitors and DNase I and were lysed via freeze-thawing. Clarified lysate was purified first on HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo) and then on Glutathione Resin (Amintra), from which the protein was cleaved via PreScission Protease overnight. Chd1 was dialysed into 40 mM Tris pH 7.5/400 mM sodium chloride/20% glycerol for storage. For Chd1 mapping, all cysteines were mutated to serines, and cysteine residues were introduced at either S524C or S1127C for mapping ATPase lobes or DBD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Coupling to mapping reagent</title><p>Prior to the coupling of mapping reagent, refolded octamers or Chd1 protein were reduced with 20 mM DTT for approximately 1 hr. DTT was removed over the Superdex 200 size exclusion column in their respective buffers.

Solutions were made in degassed water: 40 mg of ammonium iron(II) sulfate hexahydrate was dissolved in 50 mL water, 200 mg of L-ascorbic acid was dissolved in 50 mL water, and 333 μL hydrogen peroxide was diluted in 50 mL water. Ammonium iron(II) sulfate solution was diluted to 10 μL in 490 μL water and 400 μL of the ascorbic acid solution was buffered with 100 mM 1 M Tris pH 7.5 (chelex-treated) prior to their use. Iron (3.4 μL) was added to the 10 μL reaction and incubated on ice for 15 min; 5 μL each of buffered ascorbic acid and diluted hydrogen peroxide were added and hydroxyl radical cleavage of DNA progressed on ice for 45 min. Cleaved DNA was extracted via phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitated with the addition of glycogen carrier overnight. Prior to Chd1 mapping, Chd1 was allowed to bind the nucleosome on ice for 15 min. S47C nucleosome mapping was performed upon transfer of sliding reactions from 30°C to ice. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 5 μL of formamide loading dye, and all of this was run for 1 hr at 50°C at 50 W maximum on a denaturing (7 M urea) polyacrylamide (8%, 19:1) gel in 1X TBE; the gel had been prerun for an hr to warm it.

For sliding performed on streptavidin-blocked nucleosomes, 800 nM streptavidin was preincubated for 10 min with nucleosomes in reaction buffer on ice prior to the addition of ATP and Chd1 enzyme. Reactions were stopped at the specified times by moving from 30°C to ice and adding 0.1 μg/ μL competitor DNA, 0.2 M sodium chloride, and 1.6% sucrose for loading. Nucleosomes were loaded on a prerun 6% polyacrylamide (39:1) native gel in 0.2X TBE at 300 V for 4 hr. Cy3/Cy5 labelled nucleosomes were visualised on an Amersham Typhoon Gel Imaging System (GE), and the percent of nucleosome repositioned from the DNA edge (higher mobility) towards the centre were quantitated using AIDA Image Analyzer as (intensity of higher mobility band)/(total intensities of higher and lower mobility bands)×100%.

ScChd1(1–1305 ΔC) nucleosome complexes formation was determined by titration and native PAGE analysis. The formed complex was then size exclusion gel filtrated using a PC 3.2/30 Superdex 200 analytical column in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. In a typical run, 50 μL s of 20 µM of sample was injected using a Dionex autoloader. 50 μL fractions were collected and analysed in Native PAGE gel, and fractions containing ScChd1-nucleosome complexes were pooled together. The complex was mildly concentrated with an Amicon ultra-0.5 100 kDa concentrator to produce a final concentration of 4 µM complex. To initiate remodelling, 100 µM of ATP was added to the complex and incubated at 4°C for 10 min then subjected to crosslinking with 0.05% final concentration of glutaraldehyde on ice for 10 min. The crosslinking was quenched with 10 μL of 1 M Tris and 10 μL of 0.1 M lysine. CryoEM grids were then prepared immediately using a vitrobot FEI Mark IV cryo plunger maintained at 4°C and 100% humidity. A 4 µl drop of sample was then applied to C-flat Holey carbon foil (400 mesh R1.2/1.3 μM) pre-cleaned with glow discharge (Quorum technologies). After a 15 s wait time, grids were double-side blotted for 4 s and plunge-frozen into −172°C liquefied ethane. Standard vitrobot filter paper Ø 55/20 mm, Grade 595 was used for blotting.</p><p>The prepared grids were initially checked for their ice quality and the particle distribution using an in-house JEOL 2200 microscope with side-entry cryo-holder operated at 200 keV and equipped with a Gatan 4k × 4k CCD camera. Cryo-grids were then stored in liquid nitrogen and dry-shipped to the electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC) located in Diamond Light Source, Oxford, UK. Data was acquired on a FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 300 keV, equipped with a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). Automated data acquisition was carried out using FEI EPU software at a nominal magnification of 81,000x. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> summarises all the parameters used for the data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>CryoEM data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Structural reconstruction of nucleosome-chd1 complex in the presence of ATP using single particle analysis was carried out with CryoSPARC suite (v4.5.3). Movies were imported into CryoSPARC, and using patch motion correction frames are aligned, and beam-induced motions correction and electron dose weighting were performed. CTF estimation using CTFFIND4 was carried out, and those micrographs with CTF fit worse than 5 Å were discarded, which resulted in 2526 images. Particles were initially picked and optimised on a subset of 200 images using Blob picker with particle diameter of 200 Å which is subsequently extended to all the images. A total of 2.7 M particles were picked and extracted with a box size of 560 pixels. The extracted particles were then inspected, filtered for any ice contamination and artifacts, and subjected to three rounds of 2D classification. The best 2D classes were selected, resulting in 1.04 M particles. At this stage, local motion correction was carried out on the 2D classification polished set of particles before being subjected to ab initio reconstruction. During ab initio reconstruction, 4 classes were generated and subjected to heterogeneous refinement. A set of 500,179 particles that are attributed to nucleosome are selected and subjected to homogenous refinement, which yielded a 3.7 Å. Subsequently, 3D variability analysis, hierarchical 3D classification, particle subtraction along with homogenous, non-uniform and local refinement were carried out to determine structures of different complexes. A complete CryoSPARC workflow of structure reconstruction of different complexes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Subsequently, the model was refined with many rounds of model correction and building with Coot and ISOLDE (1.9). The model was then refined with Phenix (v1.20.1–4487) real-space refinement.

cryo-EM structures of the Chd1 remodeling enzyme where the location of the ATPase domain at SHL-2 was counter to that inferred from biochemical studies (SHL+2). Here, through a combination of compelling biochemical experiments and the convincing demonstration of additional structural states of Chd1 bound to nucleosomes, the authors provide an elegant resolution. Their data leads to a fundamental new model wherein initiation of DNA translocation occurs from action by the ATPase at SHL+2, and that once sufficient DNA has translocated out from the exit site, the DNA binding domain switches to bind the exited DNA. The results help resolve a key puzzle arising from earlier Chd1-nucleosome structures and hence will be valuable to the chromatin remodeling community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52513.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Narlikar</surname><given-names>Geeta J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kurumizaka</surname><given-names>Hitoshi</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/057zh3y96</institution-id><institution>The University of Tokyo</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Narlikar</surname><given-names>Geeta J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nucleotide dependent changes to Chd1-nucleosome interactions required to initiate repositioning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The revised manuscript incorporates several changes in response to previous comments, resulting in a more robust study that makes a valuable contribution to the field of chromatin remodeling, particularly in relation to Chd1.

While the Methods section indicates that model building was performed, the resulting models are barely shown in the figures, and structural interpretations are provided without sufficient validation. Notably, the CheX domain appears to be positioned near the histone core. Because the authors suggest an interaction with the acidic patch, they should include an overlay of the map and model to demonstrate this interaction and compare it with previously reported structures. Furthermore, since the DNA adjacent to the short linker in Complex 3 plays a central role in their discussion, a figure illustrating the fit between the map and model in this region is also necessary.</p><p>4. When referencing Chd1's nucleosome spacing activity the authors should also cite Lusser et al. 2005 (PMID: 15643425) and Lieleg et al. 2015 (PMID: 25733687) as biochemical evidence.</p><p>5. The model in Figure 5 is a bit confusing. The arrows showing ATP usage in both directions should be replaced with unidirectional arrows, as ATP hydrolysis is coupled to a directional process.

In Figure 5, since the states marked as &quot;active&quot; or an &quot; poised for remodelling&quot; were sufficiently stable to be observed by single-particle cryo-EM analysis, the authors can clarify that the structures obtained are not transient intermediates in a multi-step ATP hydrolysis pathway, but rather stabilized versions resulting from perhaps a nucleotide-free or ADP-bound state.

While it is true that DNA structural properties can bias the directionality with which of ATP-dependent reposition directed Chd1 (Winger and Bowman 2017), these effects are typically observed to bias the direction of movement on nucleosomes with two linkers. Our experiments include an asymmetric linker and in these cases Chd1 repositions regardless of asymmetric DNA elements e.g. Figure 4 (Levendosky, Sabantsev et al. 2016). We also not that the structure of Chd1-nucleosome complexes are essentially indistinguishable when Chd1 is bound to either side of the 601 position sequences (compare the structures reported by Sundaramoorthy, Hughes et al. 2018; Farnung, Vos et al. 2017). As a result, we do not believe sequence bias is a plausible explanation for the effects we observe.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this revision, the authors have satisfactorily addressed the main reviewer comments and have gone further by providing new cryo-EM data, which captures states of Chd1 bound at SHL+2.

If available, please provide quality control gels of nucleosomes used for remodeling</p></disp-quote><p>The integrity of nucleosomes was checked by native gel electrophoresis prior to all remodelling reactions. In Figure 1 images of gels showing the quality of samples are shown in panel C. To save space these gels were cropped. However, the full gels are included in the source data and all species present from the wells to the DNA can be seen. We think the cropping of the gels is justified as these include the key information relevant to the experiment. Similarly in Figure 2, the native gels (Figure 2A and B) indicate the quality of the reconstitutions. For the structural studies shown in Figure 3, native page was used to check the quality of nucleosomes prior to structural characterisation. Consistent with this the density for the histone octamer is strong indicating intact nucleosomes and no evidence for nucleosome lacking a subset of histones. For Figure 4, Figure supplement 1 indicates the integrity of nucleosomes during remodelling with the 524C mapping mutant. This was performed using nucleosomes assembled onto a 0W47 DNA fragment. We have added an additional panel, Figure 4 supplement 1B, indicating the quality of nucleosomes assembled on the 0W11 fragment used in Figure 4. When characterising Chd1-nucleosome complexes, native gel electrophoresis is not ideal as binding is likely to be affected by the change in ionic conditions from solution to in gel. Instead, we characterise these complexes by separately, measuring the interaction of Chd1524C (Figure 4 AB), Histone H4 (Figure 4C), and by determining structures (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The structures could be intermediates in a multi-step ATP dependent reaction. In fact, we favour this interpretation.
