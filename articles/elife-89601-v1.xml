Our brain wakens us when danger is imminent. If events are non-threatening, our brain might store them for later consideration to improve decision-making. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether novel vocabulary consisting of simultaneously played pseudowords and translation words are encoded/stored during sleep, and which neural-electrical events facilitate encoding/storage. An algorithm for brain-state-dependent stimulation selectively targeted word pairs to slow-wave peaks or troughs. Retrieval tests were given 12 and 36 hr later. These tests required decisions regarding the semantic category of previously sleep-played pseudowords. The sleep-played vocabulary influenced awake decision-making 36 hr later, if targeted to troughs. The words’ linguistic processing raised neural complexity. The words’ semantic-associative encoding was supported by increased theta power during the ensuing peak. Fast-spindle power ramped up during a second peak likely aiding consolidation. Hence, new vocabulary played during slow-wave sleep was stored and influenced decision-making days later.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>sleep-learning</kwd><kwd>consciousness</kwd><kwd>unconscious memory</kwd><kwd>slow-wave sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009068</institution-id><institution>University of Bern</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Interfaculty Research Cooperation Grant &quot;Decoding Sleep: From Neurons to Health &amp; Mind&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henke</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNSF Advanced Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henke</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TMAG-1_209374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henke</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sleep-encoded vocabulary influences awake decision-making 36 hr later, particularly when targeting the vocabulary to slow-wave troughs, which suggests that unconscious episodic memory formation during deep sleep is possible.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Falling asleep is accompanied by a gradual loss of consciousness of the external environment. Although the thalamic gating hypothesis had claimed a blockade of sensory information at the thalamic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">McCormick and Bal, 1994</xref>), we now know that sleepers still monitor the environment for their safety and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andrillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andrillon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Arzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Blume et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Koroma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Ruch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Ruch and Henke, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). The sleeping brain decides whether an external event can be disregarded, requires immediate awakening or should be stored for later consideration in the waking state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ameen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Blume et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Formby, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Holeckova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Moyne et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Oswald et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Türker et al., 2023</xref>). Although the processing of external information during sleep versus wakefulness is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andrillon et al., 2016</xref>), sleep still allows for the detection of semantic incongruity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bastuji and García-Larrea, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ibáñez et al., 2006</xref>) and the detection of rule violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Ruby et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that the sleeping brain cannot only process information, but can store new information, ranging from tone-odor to word-word associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrillon and Kouider, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Arzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ataei et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">de Lavilléon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Koroma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether and under what circumstances the most sophisticated form of human learning, namely episodic memory formation, can proceed during deep sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Ruch and Henke, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The term episodic memory refers to the recollection of personally experienced episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Tulving, 2002</xref>). Episodic memory formation depends on hippocampal-neocortical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Henke, 2010</xref>). Because episodic memory belongs to declarative/explicit memory, episodic memory was long associated with wakefulness and conscious awareness of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gabrieli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Moscovitch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Schacter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Squire and Dede, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Tulving, 2002</xref>). In the meantime, counterevidence suggests that hippocampal-assisted episodic memory formation may also proceed without conscious awareness of the learning material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Duss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Reber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). When applying such tasks, unconscious hippocampus-assisted episodic encoding of subliminal (invisible) words was revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Duss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Reber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in the current study, we define episodic memory based on its key computational properties, which are the rapid formation of new associations calling on the hippocampus' ability for one-shot relational binding, and the flexible retrieval of these associations in novel contexts. We used this definition to explore episodic verbal learning during the unconsciousness of deep sleep. We applied a sleep-learning and awake-retrieval task that requires rapid semantic associative encoding of pseudowords and German translation words, memory storage of the formed associations over days, and a cued associative retrieval that requires a flexible representation of the sleep-encoded pseudoword-word associations. As proposed and demonstrated by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Henke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">O’Reilly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">O’Reilly and Rudy, 2000</xref>), these task-enforced demands call upon the episodic memory system, according to its computational definition.</p><p>Although slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) is characterized by an average neurochemical milieu and neural functional connectivity that does not favour episodic memory formation, slow-wave sleep is not a unitary state. In fact, neuronal activity and excitability waxes and wanes during slow-wave sleep, thereby generating the eponymous electroencephalographic slow-waves that oscillate at 1 Hz and are characterised by slow-wave peaks and troughs. A peak and a trough each last around 500 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Berry et al., 2015</xref>). Because peaks of slow-waves are associated with high neural excitability and wake-like network characteristics, peaks might provide the necessary plasticity mechanisms for episodic memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cox et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref> reported successful paired-associate learning in humans during peaks of slow-waves recorded in a mid-day nap with the retrieval of the sleep-learned associations tested after awakening on the same day. Because peaks with their depolarized neural states are also the time windows when memories formed during the previous days are replayed, strengthened, and consolidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Göldi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mölle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mölle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Muehlroth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>), high-jacking peaks for de novo learning might impair ongoing memory consolidation. Troughs on the other hand are characterized by neural silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cox et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Destexhe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Schabus et al., 2012</xref>). One speculative argument in favour of troughs might be the relative absence of ongoing consolidation processes. This absence of ongoing endogenous functional activity might rise the troughs’ sensory receptiveness to external events, provided that at least local neural processing remains possible during troughs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Destexhe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Vyazovskiy and Harris, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Hence, both peaks and troughs possess characteristics that might support sensory processing and learning, but which of these brains states provides optimal learning conditions is unknown. Furthermore, recent results suggest that the high background firing rate during the peak state favors synaptic down-scaling/depression rather than potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bartram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Yoshida and Toyoizumi, 2023</xref>). Hence, the trough rather than the peak state might be beneficial for de-novo memory formation during deep sleep.</p><p>We leveraged peaks and troughs of slow-waves for the linguistic processing and the ensuing paired-associate encoding of word pairs. Here, we applied slow wave phase-targeted, brain-state-dependent stimulation for de novo memory formation, instead of memory reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ngo and Staresina, 2022</xref>) or the modification of slow waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Navarrete et al., 2020</xref>). To this aim, we simultaneously played pseudowords and translation words during either troughs or peaks (Trough/Peak condition) of frontal slow-waves using an electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-state-dependent stimulation algorithm of our own devising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Ruch et al., 2022</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>, we hypothesized that the critical process of memory formation, namely paired-associate semantic encoding, is bound to peaks because only peaks provide the necessary conditions for effective hippocampal-neocortical crosstalk. Regarding the optimal state for the words’ initial psycholinguistic analysis leading up to their relational encoding, we had no directed hypothesis. We further anticipated that associations formed through hippocampal-neocortical interactions would last for hours or days thanks to immediate hippocampal long-term potentiation and an immediate hippocampally triggered replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Frankland et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>). This hypothesis was significantly inspired by the finding of subliminally formed unconscious episodic memories lasting over 10 hr and increasing their influence on human decision-making over this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Pacozzi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We played 27 pairs of pseudowords (e.g. aryl) and 27 translation words (e.g. bird; nouns) in the experimental condition (EC) and pseudowords alone (e.g. egref) in the control condition (CC) during either troughs or peaks of slow-waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Peak/Trough-targeting was manipulated between participants with 15 participants per group. Each group was played words from the experimental condition and the control condition during sleep within the same night. Word pairs (EC) and pseudowords (CC) were played four times in succession to increase the probability that the words pass the thalamic gate. The test of whether semantic associations were formed between pseudowords and translation words during deep sleep followed 12 hr and again 36 hr later in the waking state. This retrieval test required participants to assign earlier sleep-played pseudowords to one of three semantic categories: animals, tools, places. Each sleep-played translation word was a noun that belongs to one of these superordinate categories (counterbalanced between participants: nine animals, nine tools, nine places). As participants were in deep sleep, while the vocabulary was being played, participants could not consciously remember the word pairs at test. Therefore, we encouraged them to decide intuitively about category assignments. This task triggers an unconscious associative retrieval by cueing a memory reactivation solely by the sound of the pseudoword alone. Once the meaning of the pseudoword-associated translation word was reactivated in memory, this meaning needed to be converted to the appropriate superordinate semantic category. If the number of correct category assignments exceeded chance performance (33%), we attributed this excess to successful sleep-learning. Importantly, we provided no feedback regarding category assignments to leave assignment accuracy at the 36 hr retrieval uninfluenced by the preceding 12 hr retrieval.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design overview: There were three experimental sessions per participant. Thirty participants heard pairs of pseudowords and translation words during sleep starting around 11 pm. They took a first retrieval test at 12 hr and a second retrieval test at 36 hr after the acoustic stimulations during sleep. The EEG was recorded during sleep and during the first retrieval at 12 hr. (<bold>B</bold>) Experimental conditions: We varied between subjects whether the words were played during peaks or troughs of slow-waves. Within subjects we played pairs of pseudowords and translation words in the experimental condition and pseudowords alone in the control condition. Both word pairs (experimental condition) and pseudowords (control condition) were presented four times in succession to facilitate sleep-learning. In the experimental condition, translation words were played into the left ear and pseudowords into the right ear. (<bold>C</bold>) Retrieval tasks: Retrieval tasks were the same at the 12 hr and the 36 hr retrieval. Previously sleep-played and new pseudowords were presented at test in both the visual and auditory modality simultaneously (a word appeared on screen and was simultaneously spoken). During each presentation of a pseudoword, participants needed to answer three questions. First, they were asked to indicate whether they had a feeling of having heard (FoHH) the presented word during their sleep in the laboratory. Next, they were asked to assign the presented pseudoword to a superordinate category (animal, tool, place; categorization task). Lastly, they were asked to rate their confidence on a four-point scale regarding their category assignment.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89601-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty healthy male and female volunteers were acoustically stimulated during their slow-wave night-sleep with an average of 23.98 (<italic><sc>SD</sc></italic> 3.84) pairs of pseudowords and translation words.

Each word pair was presented four times in succession to enhance the odds of their successful processing.

Although the 12 hr versus 36 hr comparison was not statistically significant (<italic>F<sub>Encoding-Test Delay</sub></italic> (1,14)=1.308, p=0.272), retrieval performance was numerically larger at 36 hours than at 12 hr (<italic>M<sub>12hours</sub></italic>=37.4%, SD = 9.0; <italic>M<sub>36hours</sub></italic>=40.7%, SD = 12.4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BC</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Planned contrasts against chance level revealed that retrieval performance significantly exceeded chance at 36 hr only (<italic>P<sub>36hours</sub></italic>=0.036, <italic>P<sub>12hours</sub></italic>=0.094). To better understand why retrieval performance was significantly better in the Trough vs. the Peak condition and why performance exceeded chance level only after 36 hr in the Trough condition, we analysed participants’ category assignments at the single-item level. This item-based analysis revealed that participants consistently chose the same category (animals, tools, places) for specific sleep-played pseudowords at the 12- and 36 hr retrieval test (12-to-36 hr consistency rate = 47%, chance level = 33.3%). Moreover, the consistency rate did not differ significantly between the Trough and the Peak condition (M<sub>Trough</sub> = 47.2%, M<sub>Peak</sub> = 47.0%, p=0.98). A descriptive analysis of participants’ category assignments suggested that the better retrieval performance in the Trough compared to the Peak condition after 36 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) was due to the following differences in participants' behaviors:</p><p>Participants in the Trough condition were more likely to assign pseudowords to the correct category at 36 hr when they were already correct at 12 hr (Trough: 20% of all items at 36 hr, or 54% of all initially correctly assigned items; Peak: 14% of all items at 36 hr, or 42% of all initially correctly assigned items). (B) Participants in the Trough condition were more likely to switch assignments and use the correct category at 36 hr, if they had initially assigned them to an incorrect category at 12 hr (Trough: 20% of all items at 36 hr, or 32% of the initially incorrectly assigned items; Peak: 18% of all items at 36 hr, or 27% of the initially incorrectly assigned items). Hence, in the Trough condition, pseudowords that were correctly assigned to the object category after 12 hr remained correct after 36 hr, while new correct assignments for initially incorrectly classified pseudowords were added at 36 hr. This is additional evidence that the above-chance retrieval performance at 36 hr is no fluke but originates from sleep-learning.</p><p>Because word pairs were exclusively played during slow-wave sleep, which is accompanied by a loss of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dement and Kleitman, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Massimini et al., 2012</xref>), encoding and retrieval must have been unconscious. Nevertheless, we assessed whether encoding and retrieval were subjectively unconscious by asking participants to indicate whether they had a “feeling of having heard” (FoHH) the presented pseudoword during sleep (rating from 1: not heard to 4: heard). This wording of the question should set a liberal criterion for reporting having heard a pseudoword. We wanted to obtain information of any potential residual awareness for sleep-played words. Participants’ feeling-of-having-heard (FoHH) responses in the Trough condition did not differ significantly between previously sleep-played pseudowords and new pseudowords that had not been played during sleep (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; ANOVA factor ‘sleep-played’: <italic>F</italic>(1,14) = 0.45, p=0.51, <italic>M<sub>sleep-played_12hours</sub></italic>=2.41, SD = 0.36, <italic>M<sub>new_12hours</sub></italic>=2.42, SD = 0.353, <italic>M<sub>sleep-played_36hours</sub></italic>=2.53, SD = 0.53, <italic>M<sub>new_36hours</sub></italic>=2.56, SD = 0.618). Furthermore, differences in FoHH responses remained non-significant even if we compared only the correctly categorized pseudowords to the never heard, new pseudowords (<italic>F</italic>(1,14) = 0.08, p=0.78). We also found no significant difference between the FoHH for correct versus incorrect category assignments (ANOVA factor ‘accuracy’: <italic>F</italic>(1,14) = 0.09, p=0.77, <italic>M<sub>12hours_correct</sub></italic>=2.37, SD = 0.54, <italic>M<sub>12hours_incorrect</sub></italic>=2.42, SD = 0.39, <italic>M<sub>36hours_correct</sub></italic>=2.57, SD = 0.62, <italic>M<sub>36hours_incorrect</sub></italic>=2.49, SD = 0.55) and no difference between EC and CC trials (ANOVA factor “Association”: <italic>F</italic>(1,14) = 0.09, p=0.77, <italic>M<sub>12hours_correct</sub></italic>=2.37, SD = 0.54, <italic>M<sub>12hours_incorrect</sub></italic>=2.42, SD = 0.39, <italic>M<sub>36hours_correct</sub></italic>=2.57, SD = 0.62, <italic>M<sub>36hours_incorrect</sub></italic>=2.49, SD = 0.55).

These findings strongly suggest that participants could not consciously recognize sleep-played pseudowords.</p><p>Furthermore, we explored whether participants’ confidence ratings revealed an unconscious reminiscence of sleep-played word pairs for correctly versus incorrectly categorized items at retrieval. Hence, we included the confidence scale as a subtle measure of memory besides the cruder accuracy measure. At retrieval testing, participants rated their confidence for each assignment of a pseudoword (sleep-played and new) to a superordinate word category (animal, tool, place).

Hence, sleep-learning in the Trough condition benefited from a pronounced trough during stimulus onset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A brain-wide voltage distribution that is typically associated with a frontal trough promoted word processing</title><p>The visual inspection of the difference in the topographical voltage distribution at word onset between subsequently (36 hr) correctly versus incorrectly assigned pseudowords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) suggested that sleep-learning in the Trough condition was best, if the brain-wide voltage distribution corresponded to the typical trough state as quantified with a template of a slow-wave trough. Note that we targeted slow-wave troughs/peaks by correlating the online measured EEG with a template map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Ruch et al., 2022</xref>). The template map is based on pre-recorded EEG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>) and represents the average voltage distribution of thousands of peaks/troughs (peak template, trough template). Accordingly, we consider the trough template a prototypical voltage distribution of endogenously generated troughs. Descriptively, the measured voltage map underlying later (at 36 hr) correctly versus incorrectly assigned pseudowords corresponded to the template map of a typical trough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, we tried to find out, which trough aspect had promoted sleep-learning. We examined four trough aspects measured at word onset: (A) prototypicality reflecting the correspondence (i.e. correlation) of the trough voltage distribution at word onset with the prototypical voltage distribution of a trough, that is the trough template. A high prototypicality suggests that the trough originated in the same neocortical network that generates the majority of endogenous slow waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Michel and Koenig, 2018</xref>) (B) global field power (GFP) reflecting the synchronisation within the measured trough voltage map. A high GFP indicates strong coherence and stability of neuronal activity within the cortical network that generates the trough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Khanna et al., 2015</xref>) (C) inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) reflecting the temporal coherence of Trough-targeting across the four presentations of a specific word pair; (D) time difference reflecting the time difference between the actual acoustic stimulation and the measured trough maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; for a more detailed description see method section). Prototypicality differentiated significantly between correctly (higher prototypicality) versus incorrectly assigned pseudowords at 36 hr (p=0.005, FDR corrected: <italic>q</italic> <sub>Benjamini-Hochberg</sub> = 0.0125; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

AUC was computed to ensure that not only the word onset, but the entire trough period was more similar to the trough template for subsequently correctly versus incorrectly assigned pseudowords. The other trough aspects did not differentiate significantly between subsequently correctly versus incorrectly assigned pseudowords (all p&gt;0.13).

Neural complexity is indicative of both the brain’s capacity to process sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Waschke et al., 2019</xref>) and the extent of ongoing cognitive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Höhn et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Parbat and Chakraborty, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, levels of neural complexity closely correspond to the depth of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Casali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Höhn et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Türker et al., 2023</xref>), with the lowest levels typically observed during SWS. Within sleep, periods of elevated neural complexity are associated with a heightened propensity to process verbal information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrillon and Kouider, 2016</xref> reported larger lateralized readiness potentials indicating correct semantic categorization of words during sleep when words were played during states of elevated neural complexity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Türker et al., 2023</xref> further observed that sleeping participants were more likely to produce accurate facial responses to words vs. pseudowords when stimulus presentations occurred during states of high complexity. Importantly, auditory stimulation during sleep tends to temporarily reduce post-stimulus neural complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alnes et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andrillon et al., 2016</xref>), probably reflecting an inhibitory, sleep-protective brain response to stimulation.</p><p>Here, we explored whether word presentations would have distinct impacts on post-stimulus neural complexity when stimulation was targeted to the Trough, where sleep-learning occurred, vs. to the Peak, where no sleep-learning occurred. To this aim, we calculated the Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) of the EEG signal in the time domain at each channel separately for a pre- (−2 to –0.5 s) and a post-stimulus (0.5–2 s) time window. HFD is one of many measures of neural complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lau et al., 2022</xref>). We analyzed HFD for a late post-stimulus window ranging from 0.5 s up to 2 s because we assumed that neural complexity for this time-window would not be biased by the differences that are due to the targeted state (Peak/Trough) but would mirror stimulus-induced neural activity. Note that for this time-window, the word-evoked EEG potentials no longer showed differences between Peak versus the Trough condition.</p><p>Baseline corrected EEG complexity following word offset (from 500 ms to 2 s, when the EEG was aligned between the two conditions) was higher in the Trough than the Peak condition (cluster-level Monte Carlo p=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, we observed that presentation of word pairs reduced post-stimulus complexity compared to the pre-stimulus baseline in the Peak but not the Trough condition (post-stimulus complexity compared to baseline; Peak condition: cluster-level Monte Carlo p=0.002; Trough condition: cluster-level Monte Carlo p&gt;0.1). The Peak-specific reduction in complexity might reflect the brains’ standard inhibitory response to sensory stimulation during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andrillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Höhn et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, this inhibitory response was absent following Trough-targeted stimulation. In fact, post-stimulus complexity was descriptively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) but not significantly increased compared to baseline in the Trough condition. This absence of a post-stimulus dip in neural complexity could reflect learning-associated neural activity in the Trough condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Parbat and Chakraborty, 2021</xref>). However, baseline-corrected HFD did not differ significantly between word pairs that were later (at 12 hr and at 36 hr) correctly versus incorrectly assigned to categories (correct vs incorrect Peak and Trough: all cluster-level Monte Carlo p&gt;0.49). Nor did baseline-corrected HFD significantly differ between the EC and the CC (EC vs CC Peak and Trough: all cluster-level Monte Carlo p&gt;0.16). Finally, we correlated HFD values with the participants’ accuracy of assigning pseudowords to the three categories at the 36 hr retrieval of the Trough condition. This correlation yielded an insignificant result (<italic>R</italic>=0.25, p=0.36).

For our protection, we still need to process external events in order to decide whether an event is threatening and requires an immediate awakening or whether an event is relevant enough to warrant storage for later consideration. There is evidence indicating that we can process and store new information during slow-wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrillon and Kouider, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Arzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Arzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Koroma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Ruch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Ruch and Henke, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether the most sophisticated form of learning - episodic learning - is possible during deep sleep, is contentious. This experiment reveals that troughs and peaks of slow-waves contribute mutually to successful episodic learning during sleep. Vocabulary played during troughs of slow-waves passed the thalamic gate and was processed perceptually and conceptually, which raised neural complexity. The following peak harbouring an increase in theta power provided the conditions for semantic-associative encoding of pseudowords and translation words. An immediately following second peak accompanied by a rise in fast spindle power around 1 s following word onset may have aided the immediate consolidation of the formed associations. This sequence of processing steps prepared the ground for later stages of memory consolidation that resulted in a successful retrieval of associations after 36 hr.</p><p>Was the sleep-presented vocabulary stored and retrieved through the episodic memory system? Traditionally, episodic memory and hippocampal processing were considered processes of declarative or explicit memory and were thought to require conscious awareness of the learning material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gabrieli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Moscovitch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Schacter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Squire and Dede, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Tulving, 2002</xref>). Yet, increasing counterevidence indicates that hippocampal-assisted episodic memory formation may proceed with and without conscious awareness of the learning material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Duss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Henke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Henke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wuethrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Züst et al., 2015</xref>). The conscious and unconscious rapid encoding and flexible retrieval of novel relational memories was found to recruit the same or similar neural networks including the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Henke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that conscious and unconscious episodic memories are processed by the same memory system. In the current study, we directed word processing to the episodic memory system by: (a) exacting <italic>associative encoding</italic>, (b) enforcing a <italic>speedy encoding process</italic>, and (c) compelling a delayed cued <italic>associative retrieval</italic> that requires a flexible representation of the sleep-formed memories. These task-enforced processing characteristics are key features of episodic memory with no other memory system disposing of these computational abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Henke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">O’Reilly et al., 2014</xref>). Only the hippocampus can form arbitrary word-word associations and rapidly store the associations in a flexible format. The neocortex forms new arbitrary associations only slowly over dozens of learning trials and provides for fused (rather than flexible) word-word representations in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Henke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">O’Reilly et al., 2014</xref>). Although no brain imaging was performed in the current study, evidence that relational learning during sleep is mediated by the hippocampus was provided by findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>. Using a very similar memory task, these authors observed that successful retrieval of sleep-played associations was associated with increased hippocampal activity. Mere priming is unlikely to account for the observed learning effects because priming is not compositional and flexible enough to provide the cued retrieval of word meaning that is required by the retrieval task. Note that at retrieval, only the pseudoword was presented. Hence, participants had to infer the corresponding category by first retrieving the sleep-played translation word and then classifying the translation word’s semantics to the superordinate category (tool, animal, place). We reason that memory representations formed by priming are not compositional and flexible enough to promote the required cued retrieval of word meaning. In summary, the task requirements called upon the episodic memory system and previous evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>) of hippocampal activation during correctly versus incorrectly categorized items at wake-retrieval testing and the between-subjects correlation of this contrast with retrieval performance suggest that the sleep-formed memories were mediated by the episodic memory system.</p><p>While consciously acquired information in the episodic memory system tends to decay rapidly during the 24 hr following learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ebbinghaus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hardt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Murre and Dros, 2015</xref>), we did not observe a deterioration in retrieval performance from 12 hr to 36 hr. This speaks to the longevity and robustness of sleep-formed memories. Because participants enjoyed a night of undisturbed sleep at home between the 12 hr and the 36 hr retrieval, the newly formed associations may have undergone additional sleep-assisted memory consolidation. One might argue that the retrieval task after 12 hr led to a conscious re-encoding of sleep-formed memories. However, the sleep-played translation words were not presented at test, and participants received no feedback regarding the accuracy of their responses during the retrieval task. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the successful delayed retrieval after 36 hr was due to conscious re-learning during the first retrieval. Instead, the reactivation of sleep-formed memories during the first retrieval task might have tagged these memories for further (re-) consolidation during the ensuing night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Rabinovich Orlandi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In fact, sleep-dependent memory consolidation supports weak memories more than strong memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Denis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Drosopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Petzka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Schechtman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Tucker and Fishbein, 2008</xref>). Hence, the presumably weak sleep-formed memories in this study may have profited especially from sleep-dependent memory consolidation. We have recently found that unconscious memories formed from subliminal (consciously invisible) cartoon clips (instead of memory formation during sleep) benefited from sleep-dependent memory consolidation, such that they were retrievable after hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Pacozzi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>However, before memory consolidation can kick in, the sleep-played vocabulary needs to pass thalamic gating and undergo neocortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gent et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">McCormick and Bal, 1994</xref>). How was this possible? We played the vocabulary either during peaks or during troughs of slow-waves. The retrieval performance indicated that the vocabulary was processed only in the Trough condition. When troughs were pronounced, encoding and retrieval were best, and the EEG exhibited more neural complexity reflecting cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Parbat and Chakraborty, 2021</xref>). We offer two speculative explanations as to why the processing of the played vocabulary was possible during troughs rather than peaks of slow-waves. First, the peaks may have been ‘occupied’ by the consolidation of previously wake-formed memories. Wake-formed memories appear to be preferentially reactivated during peaks, when hippocampus-neocortical interactions take place, which are accompanied by a rise in fast spindle power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Göldi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mölle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mölle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Muehlroth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). Even a causal role of endogenous spindles is suggested for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Antony et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chen and Wilson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mölle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>), particularly if the spindles are nested into peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dang-Vu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Schabus et al., 2012</xref>). Troughs, on the other hand, may not be occupied by ongoing consolidation processes and might therefore be receptive to sounds. Second, targeting vocabulary to troughs bypasses the natural sleep preserving mechanisms at play during peaks of slow-waves. Any sound evokes a systematic endogenous EEG response, often described as a K-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Andrillon and Kouider, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cox et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Halász, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Halász, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Mölle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ngo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Schabus et al., 2012</xref>). Such a generic response represents a cortical sensory gate that protects sleep and the consolidation of wake-formed memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Andrillon and Kouider, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Halász, 2005</xref>). The prominent frontal negativity at 500 ms in particular reflects a breakdown of the cortico-thalamic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Niknazar et al., 2023</xref>). This breakdown of communication appears to leave sensory processing intact in primary sensory cortices but mitigates responses at higher cortical levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Schabus et al., 2012</xref>). When words were played into peaks, we recorded a K-complex like, generic response from frontal electrodes, while when words were played into troughs, the vocabulary evoked a phase reset of the slow-waves that differed sharply from K-complexes. To conclude, we assume that ongoing consolidation processes and sleep-protective responses generated during peaks of slow-waves inhibited the psycholinguistic processing of the simultaneously played pseudowords and translation words, while these words were psycholinguistically processed during troughs.</p><p>Because the cued associative retrieval was above chance following sleep-learning in the Trough condition, the translation words must have been understood and their meaning must have been bound to the sound of the pseudoword during slow-wave sleep. We assume that the psycholinguistic processing of the translation word lasted up to 500 ms, which was also the duration of the word utterance and the duration of the ongoing trough. The brain starts extracting the meaning of a word already while it is being uttered. The phonological, syntactic, lexical, and semantic word analyses occur in parallel during the 500 ms after word onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brodbeck and Simon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hagoort, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hickok and Poeppel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pulvermüller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Skeide and Friederici, 2016</xref>). ERP and MEG recordings during (awake) spoken word processing revealed that phonological word forms are processed 20–50 ms following word onset in the auditory cortex. Phonological word forms are categorized at the morphosyntactic level at 40–90 ms. Lexical–semantic word analyses occur at 50–80 ms in the left anterior superior temporal cortex, where lexical items associated with the phonological word forms are retrieved at 110–170 ms. These same temporal areas funnel lexical information to Brodmann areas 45 and 47, where semantic relations between words are analysed between 200–400 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Skeide and Friederici, 2016</xref>). The timing of external stimulus processing during slow-wave sleep appears to be similar to the waking state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Laurino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Ruby et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Sabri et al., 2000</xref>). Awake learning experiments in humans indicated that the hippocampus ramps up its encoding machinery at 300–500 ms after word onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Long et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Quiroga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Staresina and Wimber, 2019</xref>). The perceived associations between the meaning of translation words and the sound of pseudowords need to be encoded in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Sakaguchi and Hayashi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Tonegawa et al., 2018</xref>) that induces long-term potentiation and increases the numbers of dendritic spines to strengthen the connectivity between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hebb, 1949</xref>). This process of memory formation requires the collaboration of the hippocampus with neocortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Buzsáki and Tingley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Schreiner and Staudigl, 2020</xref>). Hippocampal associative binding depends on theta activity (and theta-gamma coupling) in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Axmacher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kahana et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mormann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Osipova et al., 2006</xref>). In the current study, theta power rose at 500 ms following word onset. This might reflect the moment when semantic pseudoword-word associations underwent storage in the hippocampus. The magnitude of the increase in theta power correlated, between-subjects, with retrieval performance at 36 hr. One interpretation is that theta activity supported the association of pseudowords with translation words. Importantly, at 500 ms following word onset, a slow-wave peak followed the stimulated trough, which provided for the necessary neuronal excitability and an effective hippocampal-neocortical communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Andrillon and Kouider, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Destexhe et al., 2007</xref>). The frontally recorded peaks coincided with enhanced theta power, and both may have contributed to a hippocampal encoding of new associations. Initially labile hippocampal-neocortical memory traces are usually replayed to secure storage by consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). Fast sleep spindles support this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chen and Wilson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Petzka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Schreiner and Staudigl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>) because they constitute a ‘shuttle’ of hippocampal representations to neocortical sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Antony et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>). We assume that fast sleep spindles supported the immediate replay of the sleep-formed associations at one second following word onset (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdellahi et al., 2023</xref>). This was the time when a second peak occurred and when fast spindle power ramped up in the experimental condition but not in the control condition, where no associative encoding took place because pseudowords alone were played during troughs. Both the increase in theta power at 500 ms and the increase in fast spindle power at one second were accompanied by an enhancement of neuronal activity. These neuronal events were absent if the vocabulary was played during peaks. Hence, critical events that foster learning and storage were observed in the Trough condition, where vocabulary was stored long-term, but not in the Peak condition, where no sleep-learning was observed.</p><p>According to the sequence of events described above, we speculate that learning during sleep may proceed as follows: (1) A frontal slow-wave trough allows for spoken language comprehension by providing a 500 ms time window for external stimulus processing (no sleep-protective K-complexes). (2) 500 ms following word onset, paired-associative encoding takes place during the next slow-wave peak, coincident with enhanced theta power, both providing for the necessary hippocampal-neocortical crosstalk. (3) 1000 ms following word onset, fast spindles assist the immediate replay of the encoded information through hippocampal-neocortical interactions. This model needs to be tested in future sleep-learning experiments using magnetoencephalography or the simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance imaging data and EEG data for a precise temporal mapping of the processing stages and the simultaneous measurement of associated activations in brain regions.</p><p>While the current experiment is the first to target acoustic stimuli to slow-wave peaks and troughs for episodic learning during sleep, we have earlier performed a similar experiment playing vocabulary at fixed intervals (open-loop) during slow-wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). In that study, the pseudoword and translation word of a pair were played in succession rather than simultaneously. This changes the timing and the sequence of processing steps. With words played in succession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>), the paired-associative encoding in memory cannot happen before the second word of a pair is being played. In the current study, the two words of a pair were simultaneously presented and the paired-associative encoding in memory occurred around 500 ms following the onset of both words. Because hippocampal paired-associative encoding requires broadly activated neurons for an effective hippocampal-neocortical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cox et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Destexhe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Schabus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Sirota and Buzsáki, 2005</xref>), a slow-wave peak at the time of associative learning seems mandatory. This time point is during the play of the second word of a pair, when word presentations are sequential, and the time point is around 500 ms following word onset, when word presentations are simultaneous. The critical paired-associate encoding process required a frontally recorded slow-wave peak in both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref> study and the current study. It should be noted that the comparison of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref> study with the current study is difficult because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref> entrained the sleep-EEG by rhythmically playing words inter-stimulus-interval 1053 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ngo et al., 2013</xref>, which changed the natural course of the sleep EEG. Therefore, only the current study permits conclusions regarding the role of endogenously generated slow-wave peaks and troughs in mediating sleep-learning.</p><p>Because slow-wave sleep is a state of unconsciousness, a sophisticated form of learning like rapid vocabulary acquisition is not expected given the still prevailing dogma of episodic learning depending on conscious awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gabrieli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Moscovitch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Schacter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Squire and Dede, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Tulving, 2002</xref>). Rapid vocabulary acquisition during deep sleep adds to evidence of successful episodic learning from subliminal (consciously invisible) words presented in the waking state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Duss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Henke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Reber et al., 2012</xref>). These findings support the claim that episodic memory formation may proceed without conscious awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dew and Cabeza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hannula and Greene, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Henke, 2010</xref>). The sleep-formed memories did not significantly subside but (non-significantly) strengthened over 36 hr to the point where they influenced deliberative decision-making. Evidence of language processing and rapid verbal associative learning during deep sleep challenges the views that slow-wave sleep is a state of general synaptic depotentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</xref>), that we have a strict gating of sensory information at the thalamus, and that the direction of information flow during sleep is strictly from hippocampus to neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we would like to acknowledge certain limitations inherent to our research design, methodology, and interpretation. First, our interpretation of how learning may have occurred during sleep is speculative and hypothetic at this point. The delineated sequence of word processing steps during slow-wave phases should inspire future research aimed at testing these hypotheses. Second, sound duration was a bit longer than the average duration of the targeted slow-wave phases (500 ms) and therefore extended into the following slow-wave phase. This lowers the specificity of the contrast between the slow-wave phases. Third, there is a discrepancy in auditory complexity and information density between the experimental and control conditions (pseudoword-word pairs vs. one single pseudoword). These differences can induce processing and EEG differences between conditions other than associative learning. Fourth, carry-over effects from the first to the second retrieval test are possible and may have produced the slight increase in retrieval accuracy from the first to the second retrieval.</p><p>Future studies might look into practical applications as well as the ethical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Stickgold et al., 2021</xref>) of acoustic stimulations during sleep. While the acquisition of new vocabulary is certainly best during waking, other forms of sleep-learning might yield better results, when learning is unconscious versus conscious. Sleep-learning might be exploited by entities with nefarious intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Stickgold et al., 2021</xref>). However, sleep-learning might also be put to good use, such as in psychotherapy. Because sleep-learned messages are processed and stored unconsciously, they circumvent conscious defence mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Arzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Levy et al., 2014</xref>). This information might dispose the sleeper more readily towards behavioural change than traditional psychotherapy conducted in the waking state. Finally, sleep-learning may allow for the reactivation and the subsequent modification and reframing of unwanted memories without the need to consciously re-experience the stressful memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Taschereau-Dumouchel et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Taschereau-Dumouchel et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Contact for resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources should be directed to the corresponding author Flavio Schmidig, E-mail: flavio.schmidig@gmail.com.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We aimed for a sample size of N=30 participants based on a previous sleep-learning study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). To achieve this sample size, we had to examine a total of 68 participants. Of these participants, 34 could not sleep long enough for the experimenter to play the vocabulary during slow-wave sleep. In these participants, we discontinued the experiment before the behavioural tests the next morning. In four additional participants, our brain-state-dependent stimulation algorithm failed. These four participants were thus also excluded from analysis. The final analyses included the data of 30 participants (age: 19–28, <italic>M</italic>± <italic>SD</italic> = 24.16±2.32; 22 [73.3 %] female), whereof 15 were assigned to the Trough condition and 15 to the Peak condition. All included participants were right-handed and reported normal hearing abilities and the absence of mental and physical illness. They denied a history of sleep disorders and declared pursuing a regular sleep schedule. The participants' sleep during the night preceding the night at the sleep laboratory was restricted to five hours. Adherence to this sleep restriction was assessed via self-report. Moreover, participants refrained from naps and consuming stimulants (e.g. coffee) the day before the night at the sleep laboratory.</p><p>Participants were fully informed of the study protocol and of the fact that the study includes vocabulary learning during sleep. Participants also knew that the retrieval of the sleep-learned vocabulary would be tested during the next two mornings following the stimulation night. However, participants were naïve regarding their assignment to the Trough or Peak condition, and regarding the simultaneous, lateralized presentation of pseudowords (right ear) and translation words (left ear). We informed participants about sleep-learning because we wanted to provide a convincing explanation for why participants had to wear in-ear headphones during the entire night and why not removing them was essential. We hoped that the information about sleep-learning would unconsciously prime participants for processing the sounds during sleep without waking up. Prior to experimentation, participants gave their written consent to the study protocol, which had been approved by the local ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern, 2017–01046).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Method details</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The experimental design included one between-subjects factor ‘Peak versus Trough’: the vocabulary was either played during peaks (15 participants) or during troughs (15 participants) of slow-waves. The experimental design also included two within-subjects factors, namely the factor ‘Encoding-Test Delay’ with two levels (12 hr, 36 hr) and the factor ‘Stimulation’ with two levels (experimental condition, control condition). In the experimental condition, we played vocabulary binaurally. Vocabulary consisted of pseudowords that were played to the right ear, and German translation words that were played to the left ear. In the control condition, we played pseudowords binaurally (one pseudoword was simultaneously played to both ears).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>A total of 96 pseudowords and 36 German translation words were used in this study. Nine of the 36 German translation words were presented in practice trials that participants took before experimentation to become familiar with the forced-choice semantic categorization task used for retrieval testing. The pseudowords were adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>. They consisted of two-syllabic pseudowords (no meaning) and were originally created by combining German and Dutch syllables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Duyck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). The spoken pseudowords lasted around 600 ms (mean = 0.591 s, SEM = 0.006 s). The German translation words were also two-syllabic and exhibited approximately the same speech duration (mean = 0.541 s, SEM = 0.011 s). Each German translation word was prototypical for one of three superordinate categories: animals, tools, places. These categories were chosen because of their neuroanatomically distinct brain activation patterns. Distinct brain activation patterns are useful for category decoding based on the recorded EEG. The German translation words exhibited similar lexical frequencies (according to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://corpora.uni-leipzig.de/de?corpusId=deu_newscrawl_2011">Leipzig Corpora Collection</ext-link>) throughout categories.</p><p>Because the retrieval test required participants to assign each pseudoword to one of three superordinate categories (animals, tools, places), we made sure that the sound of the spoken pseudowords was not indicative of a certain category; that is we avoided sound symbolism to influence category assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Sidhu and Pexman, 2017</xref>). To this aim, we asked 80 students to indicate for each spoken pseudoword whether it represents an animal, a tool, or a place. We then selected those 96 pseudowords from a large set that showed the least category bias. Furthermore, we computed post-hoc analyses on the data acquired in the retrieval tests of the Trough condition to find out whether any remaining sound symbolism had systematically biased participants’ category assignments. The number of correct assignments at the 36 hr retrieval in the Trough condition (where sleep-learning was demonstrated) was not significantly different between the three categories (<italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 0.77, p=0.47). We also computed an ANOVA with the two independent within-subject variables ‘Category’ (animals, tools, places) and ‘Correctness of Choice’ (correct, incorrect) and with the dependent variable ‘Number of Choices’ for the 36 hr retrieval in the Trough condition. This ANOVA yielded neither a significant main effect of Category (<italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 0.39, p=0.67) nor a significant interaction between Category and Correctness of Choice (<italic>F</italic>(2,28) = 0.49, p=0.615). Only the main effect Correctness of Choice reached significance (<italic>F</italic>(1,14) = 8.40, p=0.012) reflecting participants’ above chance performance. In sum, sound symbolism exerted no significant influence on category assignments.</p><p>Audio-files of all stimuli were processed manually to have equal loudness. This was done to eliminate potential loudness artefacts on the EEG-signal. Salient phonetic features (plosive and sibilant sounds) were attenuated manually. All audio-files were compressed for dynamic range and normalised for peak volume (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Züst et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A set of 27 German translation words and 27 pseudowords was used for sleep-learning in all participants. German translation words and pseudowords were randomly combined to pairs for each participant. Hence, any pseudoword could be combined with any German translation word. This procedure reduced the risk that potentially remaining category-biases exerted by pseudowords would systematically influence retrieval accuracy. An additional set of 27 pseudowords was used in the control condition, where a pseudoword (without a translation word) was played to both ears. Hence, words presented in the control condition contained no meaning. The 27 pseudowords presented in the experimental condition and the 27 pseudowords presented in the control condition were later represented at the 12 hr and the 36 hr retrieval for their assignment to categories. In addition, we presented 21 pseudowords that had not been played during sleep at the 12 hr retrieval. At the 36 hr retrieval, these same 21 pseudowords were represented as well as an additional set of 21 entirely new pseudowords. Participants assigned these non-sleep-played pseudowords also to categories. Yet, these assignments were considered neither correct nor incorrect because no translation words had been associated with these pseudowords.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants arrived at the sleep laboratory at 10 p.m. and were equipped with EEG electrodes. They filled in several questionnaires, namely the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Buysse et al., 1989</xref>), the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hoddes et al., 1973</xref>), and a sleep diary. Next, we determined the participant’s hearing threshold to adjust the sound volume individually for the subsequent presentation of vocabulary during sleep. An hour after arrival, participants went to bed wearing in-ear headphones for vocabulary presentation during sleep. When lights went out, we administered a relaxation exercise, progressive muscle relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Jacobsen, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kalra et al., 2015</xref>) to facilitate sleep onset.</p><p>The experimenter waited for the participant to fall asleep. Once the recorded EEG showed stable slow-wave sleep, the experimenter started the auditory stimulation. Word presentation was controlled by a brain-state-dependent stimulation algorithm, which detected upcoming slow-wave peaks and troughs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Ruch et al., 2022</xref>). Words were either played during peaks or troughs of slow-waves, depending on the experimental condition the participant was randomly assigned and blind to. The experimenter monitored the participant’s sleep EEG and paused the auditory stimulation if the EEG displayed signs of arousal. Auditory stimulation was resumed once a participant was back in stable slow-wave sleep. Following the play of all words (27 * 4 word pairs in the experimental condition and 27 * 4 pseudowords in the control condition; total of 216 presentations), participants were woken up and were sent home to continue their night sleep.</p><p>In the next morning, participants visited the sleep laboratory again between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., that is exactly 12 hr following their recorded slow-wave sleep phase. Participants were again outfitted with EEG electrodes and took the 12 hr retrieval task, while their EEG was being recorded. Nine practice trials familiarized participants with the retrieval procedure. Twenty-four hours later, participants returned again to the laboratory to perform the 36 hr retrieval, which was administered without EEG registration.</p><p>Following the 36 hr retrieval, we applied a formal hearing test to ensure that each participant’s hearing ability was in the normal range regarding volume and frequencies. For this hearing test, we played short beeps at random intervals targeting the left or right ear. The participants’ task was to indicate, which ear was stimulated. We varied the frequency of the played tones, the tone’s volume, and the type of tone (pink noise and pure tones; frequency: 500 Hz, 1000 Hz or 2000 Hz; 15–45 dB). All participants exhibited hearing abilities in the normal range.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Auditory stimulation during sleep</title><p>When the experimenter observed stable slow-wave sleep for at least 2 min (4 sleep scoring time windows) in the EEG, he started auditory stimulation. To habituate participants to the presence of auditory stimuli, we first played white-noise bursts (instead of words). The volume of these white-noise burst was at first below the individual hearing threshold and was then raised to the participant-specific, predetermined volume (~35 dB). The target volume was adjusted to the hearing threshold for each participant. A sound-proof chamber with very low background noise (~30 dB) and in-ear headphones allowed to play the sounds at such a low volume. Once the target volume was reached with the participant remaining sound asleep, the experimenter initiated the presentation of the words that belonged to the experimental (e) and the control (c) condition. The sequence of the sleep-played words was systematically alternated between conditions (E-C-E-C-E-C...; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Words within condition were presented in an order that was randomly generated for each participant. Each word pair (experimental condition) and pseudoword (control condition) was presented four times in direct succession before the next word pair/pseudoword was presented. The experimenter monitored the participant’s sleep and paused auditory stimulation whenever the EEG indicated arousal. The experimenter resumed the auditory stimulation once the EEG return to stable slow-wave sleep.</p><p>Participants were played a mean of 101.23 (SD = 2.40) word pairs (maximum: 4x27 = 108) in the experimental condition. The number of word pairs played depended on the duration of a participant’s slow-wave sleep phase. We post-hoc excluded word pairs from the analysis, if one or more of the four presentations of a word pair had occurred outside slow-wave sleep or if a presentation was accompanied by a muscle artefact within a time window of +/-3 s of stimulation onset. Therefore, a final mean of 95.33 (SD = 15.41) word pairs entered data analysis. This final number was not significantly different between the Peak and the Trough condition (<italic>M<sub>Trough</sub></italic> = 95.2 (<italic>SD<sub>Trough</sub></italic> 17.11), <italic>M<sub>Peak</sub></italic> = 96.8 (<italic>SD<sub>Peak</sub></italic> 13.43); <italic>t</italic> (26.5)=–0.285, p=0.778).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Retrieval task</title><p>To probe participants’ memory of the sleep-played word pairs, we gave them three tasks that they completed in immediate succession on each presented pseudoword. The pseudowords were presented simultaneously visually (on a monitor) and acoustically (as during sleep). The presentation order of the pseudowords was randomly generated for each participant (i.e. it varied between participants). When participants logged their response, the program progressed to the next task.</p><p>Upon the presentation of a pseudoword, participants were first prompted to indicate any ‘feeling of having heard’ (FoHH) the presented pseudoword during sleep. They responded with a rating between 1 and 4 (1=no feeling of having heard, 4=strong feeling of having heard). We asked participants to indicate whether they feel that they may have heard the word during sleep. We wanted participants to set a liberal criterion for reporting a feeling of having heard a word because we were interested in any semi-conscious or conscious word recognition. Then, we prompted participants to guess whether the presented pseudoword designates an animal, a tool, or a place. This task was intended to reactivate a sleep-formed pseudoword-translation word association and to trigger the conversion of the reactivated translation word (e.g. dog) into the superordinate semantic category (e.g. animal). Mean chance performance on this task was 33.33% correct responses. Participants chose one of the three categories by pressing a keyboard button. The assignment of keyboard buttons to categories (animal, tool, place) was randomly shuffled between the response trials to exclude habituation and hence a category-associated motor response pattern in the neuronal data. Finally, we prompted participants to indicate on a four-point-scale how confident they were about their previous category assignment. This metacognitive evaluation was to reveal any conscious/semi-conscious hunch of a previously sleep-formed associative memory.</p><p>We probed the participants' memory twice, first at 12 hr and then again at 36 hr following the vocabulary presentation during sleep. At the 12 hr retrieval, we presented 75 pseudowords, whereof 27 had been sleep-played along with a translation word in the experimental condition, 27 were sleep-played (without translation words) in the control condition, and 21 were presented for the first time. All of these pseudowords were presented to each participant, although not all pseudowords entered the data analysis for each participant because some pseudowords could not be played during sleep to certain participants. The 36 hr retrieval proceeded exactly like the 12 hr retrieval. Yet, it included 21 additional pseudowords that had not been presented at the 12 hr retrieval. Therefore, we presented 96 pseudowords at the 36 hr retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Equipment</title><sec id="s4-3-6-1"><title>Sleep laboratory</title><p>We used two computers in this experiment. One computer was used for the recording of the EEG and the other for the control of the auditory stimulation. The EEG data were streamed in real-time via LAN from the recording computer to the stimulation computer. The stimulation computer hosted the brain-state-dependent stimulation algorithm that controlled auditory stimulation during sleep. The stimulation computer was also used to administer the retrieval tasks and to conduct the hearing test.

One electrode at the chin recorded the muscle tone (EMG). The EEG sampling rate was 500 Hz. Impedances were kept below 20 kΩ.</p><p>Sleep scoring was performed according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Iber et al., 2007</xref>). For the online detection of the onset of slow-wave sleep and for the surveillance of slow-wave sleep, the real-time EEG was displayed according to the AASM guidelines using the OpenViBE environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Renard et al., 2010</xref>). Offline sleep scoring was performed by two trained raters, who were blinded to the experimental conditions, with the software Polyman (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.edfplus.info/">http://www.edfplus.info/</ext-link>). The interrater reliability reached a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.83, which is substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">McHugh, 2012</xref>). In cases, where the two raters disagreed, we used the more conservative rating, i.e., the sleep score that indicated the shallower sleep stage. The processing of the EEG data was performed with the MATLAB toolboxes EEGLAB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/">http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/</ext-link>, version, version 14.1.2b) and fieldtrip (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/">https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/</ext-link>, version 20190819). If the offline scoring revealed that a word pair or word was played outside slow-wave sleep, all repetitions of this stimulus were excluded from data analysis for this subject.</p><p>The 30 participants slept for a mean of 59.3 min (<italic>SEM</italic> 24.11 min) before the experimenter woke them. They spent a mean of 32.3 min in slow-wave sleep (<italic>SEM</italic> 12.70 min). Total sleep time did not differ between the Peak-targeted and the Trough-targeted participant sample (Peak: <italic>M<sub>Peak</sub></italic> = 67.4 min, SEM = 27.2 min; Trough: <italic>M<sub>Trough</sub></italic> = 51.1 min, SEM = 18.0 min, <italic>t</italic>=–1.929, p&gt;0.065). The duration of slow-wave sleep was significantly shorter for the Trough-targeted participant sample than for the Peak-targeted participant sample (Trough: <italic>M<sub>SWS</sub></italic> = 26.3 min, <italic>SEM<sub>SWS</sub></italic> = 15.7, Peak: <italic>M<sub>SWS</sub></italic> = 38.2 min, <italic>SEM<sub>SWS</sub></italic> = 14.0; <italic>t</italic>=–2.9, p=0.01). Furthermore, the inter-trial stimulus interval (ISI) happened to be shorter in the Trough than the Peak condition (Peak: <italic>M</italic><sub>ISI</sub> = 6.3 s, <italic>SD</italic><sub>ISI</sub> = 2.6 s; Trough: <italic>M</italic><sub>ISI</sub> = 3.3 s, <italic>SD</italic><sub>ISI</sub> = 1.1 s; p&lt;0.003). These differences are due to the fact that the brain-state-dependent stimulation algorithm targeted troughs better than peaks. Peak-to-trough transitions are more prominent EEG features than trough-to-peak transitions because peak-to-trough transitions have higher amplitudes and steeper slopes. The brain-state-dependent stimulation was more likely to detect these peak-to-trough transitions and therefore targeted more troughs than peaks within the same amount of time. Consequently, the ISI was shorter in the Trough than the Peak condition. For this reason, we were able to present the vocabulary within a narrower SWS time-span and could wake and release the participants earlier in the Trough than the Peak condition. Importantly, neither the length of the ISI nor the duration spent in slow-wave sleep (both z-transformed; N=30) correlated with retrieval accuracy at 36 hr (ISI: <italic>r</italic>=–0.017, p=0.93; slow-wave sleep duration: <italic>r</italic>=–0.11, p=0.56). Therefore, the length of the ISI and the duration spent in slow-wave sleep do probably not account for the difference in retrieval performance between the Trough and the Peak condition. Of note, the number of words played during slow-wave sleep did not differ between the Peak and the Trough condition (Peak: <italic>M<sub>Peak</sub></italic> = 24.2, SD = 3.6; Trough: <italic>M<sub>Trough</sub></italic> = 24.1, SD = 4.3; p&gt;0.95).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6-3"><title>Brain-state-dependent targeting of slow-wave peaks and troughs</title><p>Peaks and troughs of slow-waves were targeted based on the correlation of the online registered scalp EEG map with a template of a prototypical slow-wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Ruch et al., 2022</xref>).

The mean word onset was 113 ms before peak maxima and 96 ms before trough minima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the onset of spoken words preceded a trough on average by 64.05 degrees 95% CI = [53.15 74.95] and a peak by 56.8 degrees 95% CI = [54.08 59.52], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.

This indicates that our brain-state-dependent stimulation algorithm targeted peaks and troughs reliably. This stimulation accuracy allows attributing differences in sleep-learning/wake-retrieval between the Peak and the Trough condition to these same brain states rather than to technical fuzziness.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Accuracy of the targeting of slow-wave phase.</title><p>Utterance into a half-wave of a slow-wave.

If the assigned category corresponded to the superordinate category of the translation word that had been played during sleep along with the pseudoword, then the participant’s response was classified as correct. Participants’ assignments of new pseudowords to the three categories were neither correct nor incorrect because new pseudowords were not associated with a certain translation word. The new pseudowords were included at the 12 hr and the 36 hr retrieval as a baseline for the event-related EEG potential analyses (correct versus incorrect versus baseline).</p><p>Categorization accuracy for previously sleep-played pseudowords was expressed as percentage of correct responses. If accuracy was significantly above the mean chance level of 33.33%, we inferred successful sleep-learning. Accuracy values of participants did not significantly deviate from a normal distribution at the 12 hr and at the 36 hr retrieval (p<sub>Shapiro</sub> &gt;0.148), variances did not significantly violate the assumption of homogeneity (p<sub>Levene</sub> &gt;0.34), and all values were within the range of +/-2 standard deviations from the mean. We computed a 2x2 ANOVA with the between-subjects factor Peak versus Trough and the within-subjects factor Encoding-Test Delay (12 hr versus 36 hr). The dependent variable was retrieval accuracy expressed as the difference between the percentages of correctly retrieved associations minus the percentage of mean chance performance (33.33 %). A second ANOVA with the within-subjects factor Encoding-Test Delay (12 hr versus 36 hr) was computed for the Trough condition alone to determine whether the intercept is significant (indicating that the average retrieval accuracy exceeded chance level in the two encoding-test delays) and to determine whether retrieval performance was different at 12 hr versus 36 hr. Furthermore, we planned a comparison of retrieval performance against chance level at the 12 hr and at the 36 hr retrieval.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EEG data analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>EEG preprocessing</title><p>The raw EEG-data were re-referenced to the common average, band-pass filtered at 0.25–35 Hz, and down-sampled to 100 Hz. The continuous EEG data was subjected to manual artefact rejection. First, noisy channels and channels with strong sweat artefacts were visually identified and subsequently interpolated. Next, we visually identified and excluded data segments that contained muscle artefacts, movement artefacts, or arousals. Artefact rejection was performed by Flavio Schmidig, who was blinded to the participants’ condition (Peak/Trough) and to the type and timing of sound presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Event-related EEG analyses</title><p>We computed sleep-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) for each participant. For ERPs, we first epoched the raw EEG data into 7 s trials (from 3 s before to 4 s after word onset) and then averaged over all trials per condition and per participant. Moreover, we compared ERSPs between experimental conditions. To this aim, we computed the spectral power for the fast spindles (12–16 Hz) and the theta band (4–8 Hz). We estimated the power over the interval of 2 s before to 3 s after word onset using discrete wavelet transformation (20 ms steps, i.e. 50 Hz sampling rate). We used linearly increasing cycle numbers with 4.25 cycles at the lowest and 11.75 cycles at the highest frequency for the theta frequency band and with 4.25 cycles at the lowest and 11.75 cycles at the highest frequency for the spindle frequency band. ERSPs were baseline-corrected at the single trial level by normalising the time-series at each frequency using the frequency-specific mean and standard deviation of the power, which was computed across the entire trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Grandchamp and Delorme, 2011</xref>). Baseline-corrected ERSPs were then averaged over all trials of a condition. This procedure was performed for each electrode, each condition, and each participant. Then, we computed the grand averages for the conditions (Peak condition, Trough condition, experimental condition, control condition, correct assignments in the experimental condition, incorrect assignments in the experimental condition). To test for statistical differences, we performed mass univariate analyses with cluster-based permutation statistics (1000 permutations) to correct for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>). Cluster-level Monte Carlo values were considered significant if error probability was lower than 5%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Extraction of slow-wave characteristics</title><p>Our aim was to find out which slow-wave characteristics promoted sleep-learning. Therefore, we computed the standardized global field power of the targeted slow-wave (GFP, z-score) at the time of word onset in each trial. We averaged over the four presentations of a word pair and over each participant. Furthermore, we computed the Peak/Trough prototypicality, which reflected the similarity (Fisher’s z-transformed correlation values) between the electrical field (scalp maps) of the online-recorded EEG at word onset and the electrical field of the targeted slow-wave phase (Peak/Trough). Next, we extracted the inter-trial-phase coherence at word onset to estimate the consistency of the targeted slow-wave phase across the four presentations of each word pair (measured over frontal electrodes, a.u.). Finally, we computed the z-scored time delay between word onset and the time-point of the maximal amplitude of the targeted slow-wave peak/trough. We compared these parameters between correctly versus incorrectly assigned pseudowords at the 12 hr and the 36 hr retrieval. Where necessary, the data were z-transformed using Fisher’s transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Offline detection of slow-wave peaks and troughs</title><p>In order to identify the delay between the time of word onset and the time of the maximal amplitude of the targeted slow-wave peak/trough, we post-hoc identified discrete slow-wave events in the EEG. Slow-waves were automatically detected by a MATLAB-based algorithm modelled after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mölle et al., 2002</xref>. Slow-wave peaks and troughs produce distinct brain wide voltage distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Ruch et al., 2014</xref>), which we used to target online slow-wave phases. For the off-line identification of slow-wave peaks and troughs, we used frontal derivatives. We bandpass-filtered the EEG from 0.5 to 1.5 Hz and averaged the EEG over the frontal electrodes ('F1', 'F2', 'F3', 'F4', 'Fz'). Next, we identified every zero-crossing in the bandpass filtered frontal signal. The local minima and maxima between zero-crossings were labelled as potential peaks and troughs. In this process, time and amplitude constraints were added. All slow-waves with durations shorter than 0.8 s or longer than 2 s were excluded. The resulting slow-waves lay between 0.5 and 1.25 Hz. A further criterion was slow-wave amplitude. The detected slow-wave half-waves needed to exhibit an amplitude (trough-to- peak) that exceeded two thirds of the slow-wave amplitudes per participant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Estimation of neural complexity: Higuchi Fractal Dimension</title><p>We quantified the degree of information processing in the brain during and following word presentation during sleep. To this aim, we computed Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) as an EEG-based measure of ‘complexity’ of ongoing neural activity. HFD provides a non-linear measure of the complexity, variability, and randomness of EEG time-series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Parbat and Chakraborty, 2021</xref>). Importantly, a high neural complexity has been associated with successful memory formation during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sheehan et al., 2018</xref>). We computed HFD separately for each trial and electrode for the EEG time-series of our windows of interest (see below) using the MATLAB code provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Monge-Alvarez, 2024</xref>. K<sub>max</sub> for extracting HFD was set to 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Monge-Alvarez, 2024</xref>). Single-trial HFD values were averaged within participants separately for each condition (experimental condition and control condition), electrode, and time window of interest. Average HFD values were then used for group-level analyses.</p><p>We determined the degree of stimulus-induced information processing following word offset. To this aim, we computed HFD for the time window from 0.5 to 2 s following word onset. We used the HFD values, which were computed for the time window from –2 to –0.5 s before word onset, as a baseline in order to control for inter-individual differences in neural complexity. To test for statistical differences in HFD, we performed mass univariate analyses with cluster-based permutation statistics (1000 permutations) to correct for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Specifically, this procedure was successful when stimuli were delivered during slow oscillation troughs as opposed to peaks, which has been the focus of many recent investigations into the learning &amp; memory functions of sleep. Finally, further analyses showed that larger and more prototypical slow oscillation troughs led to better categorization performance, which offers hints to others on how to improve or predict the efficacy of this intervention.</p><p>Comments on the revised version:</p><p>I applaud the authors on a nice rebuttal. Many responses use solid arguments based on the existing literature, such as their response regarding the possibility that low-level acoustic characteristics explaining EEG differences between conditions. Their new analyses also clarify the paper. Additionally, I appreciate their labeling their more speculative claims as such. Below are my remaining thoughts:</p><p>Major point:</p><p>The largest remaining issue for me regards the term 'episodic'. Before I begin, I should say that I imagine the authors have thought considerably about this definition and may disagree with what I will say. That would be fine - it's their choice at this journal. My main point in writing this is to help them clarify their case further. R3 had a similar concern on the first round of review, and I imagine others holding the &quot;traditional&quot; view of episodic memory would be similarly skeptical. If the authors have a great rebuttal to these points, I imagine it will address others' concerns too.</p><p>I believe I understand the authors' argument: I read the Henke (2010, Nature Reviews Neuroscience) piece years back with great interest and again now, and I've gone back to read their other papers cited in this manuscript. Again, I applaud the authors on producing a large collection of fascinating findings expanding knowledge of what can be accomplished via unconscious learning. That includes this paper! But I still disagree with the term 'episodic' for what is measured here. The authors state in the Methods section that they prompted participants to 'guess whether the presented pseudoword designates an animal, a tool, or a place'. IMHO, the main issue of using 'episodic' is the nature of the memory representation - 'guessing' does not ask participants anything about the source (the who-what-when-why-where) of the information (anything about an episode).</p><p>Notably, it does seem to fit their own definition from Henke (2010). Rapid? I believe so - 4 trial-learning is fairly quick. Certainly, there are studies of supposed episodic memory that use a few rounds of learning the same stimuli (rather than single trial learning) and one can still get away with calling the nature of the memories 'episodic'. Flexible? I believe the authors mean that their task is flexible because participants learn a category exemplar during sleep (e.g., 'aryl'-'bird') but then only respond based on its category membership ('animal'?). If this is the case, I agree that the representations are flexible. Reliant on the 'episodic memory system' (lines 495-9)? Reasonably likely, given their prior findings (e.g., Züst et al., 2019). However, there is considerable data suggesting the hippocampus contributes to functions beyond episodic memory, including statistical learning (e.g., Schapiro et al., 2013, Current Biology), motor learning (e.g., Schendan et al., 2003, Neuron; Dohring et al., 2017, Cortex; Jacobacci et al., 2020, PNAS), attention (e.g., Aly &amp; Turk-Browne, 2016, Cerebral Cortex), perception (e.g., Lee et al., 2012), and semantic memory (e.g., Cutler et al., 2019, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience). Therefore, given that the hippocampus contributes to other tasks too, saying the task is episodic in part because it likely relies on the hippocampus (the 'episodic memory system') is an incorrect reverse inference. But regardless of this concern, it seems true to me that the term fits 'episodic' according to Henke (2010).</p><p>So, it seems I'm raising an issue with this entire way of defining memory. IMHO, the biggest issue is that there is no reason to assume the participant relies upon any source-related information in making their guess. There is room in the field for a new type of rapid, unconscious, flexible, hippocampal-dependent learning that does not need to align with the term, 'episodic', for it to be important and fascinating! The term, 'episodic', is convenient for a reason - namely, for labeling the behavioral output of what it measures, not the process that underlies it. The authors have continually made an excellent case for rapid, unconscious, flexible, hippocampal-dependent learning, and it would seem even more beneficial for the field for the authors to just call this its own thing.</p><p>A related point:</p><p>- I see that the authors do not use 'episodic' in prior papers with similar tasks (e.g., Züst et al., 2019), and I am curious if anything changed in their thinking or why they use the term now. They can ignore this if they'd like, but it would perhaps give useful context.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>IMHO, the issue of repeated tests is more legitimate than the authors suggest. They state in their response letter, &quot;However, recent literature suggests that retrieval practice is only beneficial when corrective feedback is provided (Belardi et al., 2021; Metcalfe, 2017).&quot; This is incorrect. While retrieval practice is often less effective without feedback, it can be effective without feedback if retrieval accuracy is high and if the experimenters later employ a long enough retention interval to witness long-term effects. This is clear in various papers (e.g., Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006, Psychological Science; Karpicke &amp; Roediger, 2008, Science) and there is a nice theoretical model explaining how these complex effects could arise (Halamish &amp; Bjork, 2011, JEP:LMC; Kornell et al., 2011, JML). The authors do not heavily rely on this in their paper, but they could consider tempering their claims that it is 'unlikely' (line 509) that delayed retrieval was affected by the first retrieval.</p><p>The authors claim that fast spindles are part of a speculative model underlying their learning effects (lines 605-6). However, they did not find any differential spindle effects in determining later performance, so they could consider keeping just points #1&amp;2 or mentioning that spindles differ by condition but may not directly influence the learning effects here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89601.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This is a revision in response to the reviewer's comments.

Specifically, this procedure was successful when stimuli were delivered during slow oscillation troughs as opposed to peaks, which has been the focus of many recent investigations into the learning &amp; memory functions of sleep. Finally, further analyses showed that larger and more prototypical slow oscillation troughs led to better categorization performance, which offers hints to others on how to improve or predict the efficacy of this intervention. The strength here is the novel behavioral finding and supporting physiological analyses, whereas the biggest weakness is the interpretation of the peak vs. trough effect.</p><p>R1.1. Major importance:</p><p>I believe the authors could attempt to address this question: What do the authors believe is the largest implication of this studies? How far can this technique be pushed, and how can it practically augment real-world learning?</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the discussion to put more emphasis on possible practical applications of this study (lines 645-656).</p><p>In our opinion, the strength of this paper is its contribution to the basic understanding of information processing during deep sleep, rather than its insights on how to augment realworld learning. Given the currently limited data on learning during sleep, we believe it would be premature to make strong claims about potential practical applications of sleep-learning. In addition, as pointed out in the discussion section, we do not know what adverse effects sleep-learning has on other sleep-related mechanisms such as memory consolidation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1.2. Lines 155-7: How do the authors argue that the words fit well within the half-waves when the sounds lasted 540 ms and didn't necessarily start right at the beginning of each half-wave? This is a major point that should be discussed, as part of the down-state sound continues into the up-state. Looking at Figure 3A, it is clear that stimulus presented in the slow oscillation trough ends at a time that is solidly into the upstate, and would not neurolinguists argue that a lot of sound processing occurs after the end of the sound? It's not a problem for their findings, which is about when is the best time to start such a stimulus, but it's a problem for the interpretation. Additionally, the authors could include some discussion on whether possibly presenting shorter sounds would help to resolve the ambiguities here.</p></disp-quote><p>The word pairs’ presentations lasted on average ~540 ms. Importantly, the word pairs’ onset was timed to occur 100 ms before the maximal amplitude of the targeted peaks/troughs.</p><p>Therefore, most of a word’s sound pattern appeared during the negative going half-wave (about 350ms of 540ms). Importantly, Brodbeck and colleagues (2022) have shown that phonemes are continuously analyzed and interpreted with delays of about 50-200 ms, peaking at 100ms delay. These results suggest that word processing started just following the negative maximum of a trough and finished during the next peak. Our interpretation (e.g. line 520+) suggests that low-level auditory processing reaches the auditory cortex before the positive going half-wave. During the positive going half-wave the higher-level semantic networks appear the extract the presented word's meaning and associate the two simultaneously presented words. We clarified the time course regarding slow-wave phases and sound presentation in the manuscript (lines 158-164). Moreover, we added the limitation that we cannot know for sure when and in which slow-wave phase words were processed (lines 645-656). Future studies might want to look at shorter lasting stimuli to narrow down the timing of the word processing steps in relation to the sleep slow waves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1.3. Medium importance:</p><p>Throughout the paper, another concern relates to the term 'closed-loop'. It appears this term has been largely misused in the literature, and I believe the more appropriate term here is 'real-time' (Bergmann, 2018, Frontiers in Psychology; Antony et al., 2022, Journal of Sleep Research). For instance, if there were some sort of algorithm that assessed whether each individual word was successfully processed by the brain during sleep and then the delivery of words was subsequently changed, that could be more accurately labelled as 'closed-loop'.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the meaning of “closed-loop” in its narrowest sense is not fulfilled here. We believe that “slow oscillation phase-targeted, brain-state-dependent stimulation” is the most appropriate term to describe the applied procedure (BSDBS, Bergmann, 2018). We changed the wording in the manuscript to brain-state-dependent stimulation algorithm. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that the algorithm we developed and used (TOPOSO) is very similar to the algorithms often termed closed-loop algorithm in memory and sleep (e.g. Esfahani et al., 2023; Garcia-Molina et al., 2018; Ngo et al., 2013, for a comparison of TOPOSO to these techniques see Wunderlin et al., 2022 and for more information about TOPOSO see Ruch et al., 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1.4. Figure 5 and corresponding analyses: Note that the two conditions end up with different sounds with likely different auditory complexities. That is, one word vs. two words simultaneously likely differ on some low-level acoustic characteristics, which could explain the physiological differences. Either the authors should address this via auditory analyses or it should be added as a limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, the two conditions differ on auditory complexities. Accordingly, we added this issue as another limitation of the study (line 651-653). We had decided for a single word control condition to ensure that no associative learning (between pseudowords) could take place in the control condition because this was the critical learning process in the experimental condition. We would like to point out that we observed significant differences in brain responses to the presentation of word-pairs (experimental condition) vs single pseudowords (control condition) in the Trough condition, but not the Peak condition. If indeed low-level acoustic characteristics explained the EEG differences occurring between the two conditions then one would expect these differences occurring in both the trough and the peak condition because earlier studies showed that low-level acoustic processing proceeds in both phases of slow waves (Andrillon et al., 2016; Batterink et al., 2016; Daltrozzo et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1.5. Line 562-7 (and elsewhere in the paper): &quot;episodic&quot; learning is referenced here and many times throughout the paper. But episodic learning is not what was enhanced here. Please be mindful of this wording, as it can be confusing otherwise.</p></disp-quote><p>The reported unconscious learning of novel verbal associations during sleep may not match textbook definitions of episodic memory. However, the traditional definitions of episodic memory have long been criticised (e.g., Dew &amp; Cabeza, 2011; Hannula et al., 2023; Henke, 2010; Reder et al., 2009; Shohamy &amp; Turk-Browne, 2013).</p><p>We stand by our claim that sleep-learning was of episodic nature. Here we use a computational definition of episodic memory (Cohen &amp; Eichenbaum, 1993; Henke, 2010; O’Reilly et al., 2014; O’Reilly &amp; Rudy, 2000) and not the traditional definition of episodic memory that ties episodic memory to wakefulness and conscious awareness (Gabrieli, 1998; Moscovitch, 2008; Schacter, 1998; Squire &amp; Dede, 2015; Tulving, 2002). We revised the manuscript to clarify that and how our definition differs from traditional definitions. Please see reviewer comment R3.1 for a more extensive answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this project, Schmidig, Ruch and Henke examined whether word pairs that were presented during slow-wave sleep would leave a detectable memory trace 12 and 36 hours later. Such an effect was found, as participants showed a bias to categorize pseudowords according to a familiar word that they were paired with during slow-wave sleep. This behavior was not accompanied by any sign of conscious understanding of why the judgment was made, and so demonstrates that long-term memory can be formed even without conscious access to the presented content. Unconscious learning occurred when pairs were presented during troughs but not during peaks of slow-wave oscillations. Differences in brain responses to the two types of presentation schemes, and between word pairs that were later correctly- vs. incorrectly-judged, suggest a potential mechanism for how such deep-sleep learning can occur.</p><p>The results are very interesting, and they are based on solid methods and analyses. Results largely support the authors' conclusions, but I felt that there were a few points in which conclusions were not entirely convincing:</p><p>R2.1. As a control for the critical stimuli in this study, authors used a single pseudoword simultaneously played to both ears. This control condition (CC) differs from the experimental condition (EC) in a few dimensions, among them: amount of information provided, binaural coherence and word familiarity. These differences make it hard to conclude that the higher theta and spindle power observed for EC over CC trials indicate associative binding, as claimed in the paper. Alternative explanations can be made, for instance, that they reflect word recognition, as only EC contains familiar words.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In the revised version of the manuscript, we emphasise this as a limitation of our study (line 653-656). Moreover, we understand that the differences between stimuli of the control and the experimental condition must not rely only on the associative binding of two words. We cautioned our interpretation of the findings.</p><p>Interestingly, EC vs CC exhibits differences following trough- but not peak targeting (see R1.4). If indeed all the EC vs CC differences were unrelated to associative binding, we would expect the same EC vs CC differences when peaks were targeted. Hence, the selective EC vs CC differences in the trough condition suggest that the brain is more responsive to sound, information, word familiarity and word semantics during troughs, where we found successful learning, compared to peaks, where no learning occurred. Troughtargeted word pairs (EC) versus foreign words (CC) enhanced the theta power 336 at 500 ms following word onset and this theta enhancement correlated significantly with interindividual retrieval performance indicating that theta probably promoted associative learning during sleep. This correlation was insignificant for spindle power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2.2. The entire set of EC pairs were tested both following 12 hours and following 36 hours. Exposure to the pairs during test #1 can be expected to have an effect over memory one day later, during test #2, and so differences between the tests could be at least partially driven by the additional activation and rehearsal of the material during test #1. Therefore, it is hard to draw conclusions regarding automatic memory reorganization between 12 and 36 hours after unconscious learning. Specifically, a claim is made regarding a third wave of plasticity, but we cannot be certain that the improvement found in the 36 hour test would have happened without test #1.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that the retrieval test at 12h may have had an impact on performance on the retrieval test at 36h. Practicing retrieval of newly formed memories is known to facilitate future retrieval of the same memories (e.g. Karpicke &amp; Roediger, 2008). Hence, practicing the retrieval of sleep-formed memories during the retrieval test at 12h may have boosted performance at 36h.</p><p>However, recent literature suggests that retrieval practice is only beneficial when corrective feedback is provided (Belardi et al., 2021; Metcalfe, 2017). In our study, we only presented the sleep-played pseudowords at test and participants received no feedback regarding the accuracy of their responses. Thus, a proper conscious re-encoding could not take place. Nevertheless, the retrieval at 12h may have altered performance at 36h in other ways. For example, it could have tagged the reactivated sleep-formed memories for enhanced consolidation during the next night (Rabinovich Orlandi et al., 2020; Wilhelm et al., 2011).</p><p>We included a paragraph on the potential carry-over effects from retrieval at 12h on retrieval at 36h in the discussion section (line 489-496; line 657-659). Furthermore, we removed the arguments about the “third wave of plasticity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2.3. Authors claim that perceptual and conceptual processing during sleep led to increased neural complexity in troughs. However, neural complexity was not found to differ between EC and CC, nor between remembered and forgotten pairs. It is therefore not clear to me why the increased complexity that was found in troughs should be attributed to perceptual and conceptual word processing, as CC contains meaningless vowels. Moreover, from the evidence presented in this work at least, I am not sure there is room to infer causation - that the increase in HFD is driven by the stimuli - as there is no control analysis looking at HFD during troughs that did not contain stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>With the analysis of the HFD we would like to provide an additional perspective to the oscillation-based analysis. We checked whether the boundary condition of Peak and Trough targeting changes the overall complexity or information content in the EEG. Our goal was to assess the change in neural complexity (relative to a pre-stimulus baseline) following the successful vs unsuccessful encoding of word pairs during sleep.</p><p>We acknowledge that a causal interpretation about HFD is not warranted, and we revised the manuscript accordingly. It was unexpected that we could not find the same results in the contrast of EC vs CC or correct vs incorrect word pairs. We suggest that our signal-to noise ratio might have been too weak.</p><p>One could argue that the phase targeting alone (without stimulation) induces peak/trough differences in complexity. We cannot completely rule out this concern. But we tried to use the EEG that was not influenced by the ongoing slow-wave: the EEG 2000-500ms before the stimulus onset and 500-2000ms after the stimulus onset. Therefore, we excluded the 1s of the targeted slow-wave, hoping that most of the phase inherent complexity should have faded out (see Figure 2). We could not further extend the time window of analysis due to the minimal stimulus onset interval of 2s. Of course we cannot exclude that the targeted Trough impacted the following HFD. We clarified this in the manuscript (line 384-425).</p><p>Furthermore, we did find a difference of neural complexity between the pre-stimulus baseline and the post-stimulus complexity in the Peak condition but not in the Trough condition (we now added this contrast to the manuscript, line 416-419). Hence, the change in neural complexity is a reaction to the interaction of the specific slow-wave phase with the processing of the word pairs. Even though these results cannot provide unambiguous, causal links, we think they can figure as an important start for other studies to decipher neural complexity during slow wave sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The study aims at creating novel episodic memories during slow wave sleep, that can be transferred in the awake state. To do so, participants were simultaneously presented during sleep both foreign words and their arbitrary translations in their language (one word in each ear), or as a control condition only the foreign word alone, binaurally. Stimuli were presented either at the trough or the peak of the slow oscillation using a closed-loop stimulation algorithm. To test for the creation of a flexible association during sleep, participant were then presented at wake with the foreign words alone and had (1) to decide whether they had the feeling of having heard that word before, (2) to attribute this word to one out of three possible conceptual categories (to which translations word actually belong), and (3) to rate their confidence about their decision.</p><p>R3.1. The paper is well written, the protocol ingenious and the methods are robust. However, the results do not really add conceptually to a prior publication of this group showing the possibility to associate in slow wave sleep pairs of words denoting large or small object and non words, and then asking during ensuing wakefulness participant to categorise these non words to a &quot;large&quot; or &quot;small&quot; category. In both cases, the main finding is that this type of association can be formed during slow wave sleep if presented at the trough (versus the peak) of the slow oscillation. Crucially, whether these associations truly represent episodic memory formation during sleep, as claimed by the authors, is highly disputable as there is no control condition allowing to exclude the alternative, simpler hypothesis that mere perceptual associations between two elements (foreign word and translation) have been created and stored during sleep (which is already in itself an interesting finding). In this latter case, it would be only during the awake state when the foreign word is presented that its presentation would implicitly recall the associated translation, which in turn would &quot;ignite&quot; the associative/semantic association process eventually leading to the observed categorisation bias (i.e., foreign words tending to be put in the same conceptual category than their associated translation). In the absence of a dis-confirmation of this alternative and more economical hypothesis, and if we follow Ocam's razor assumption, the claim that there is episodic memory formation during sleep is speculative and unsupported, which is a serious limitation irrespective of the merits of the study. The title and interpretations should be toned down in this respect</p></disp-quote><p>Our study conceptually adds to and extends the findings by Züst et al. (a) by highlighting the precise time-window or brain state during which sleep-learning is possible (e.g. slow-wave trough targeting), (b) by demonstrating the feasibility of associative learning during night sleep, and (c) by uncovering the longevity of sleep-formed memories.</p><p>We acknowledge that the reported unconscious learning of novel verbal associations during sleep may not match textbook definitions of episodic memory. However, the traditional definitions of episodic memory have long been criticised e.g, (Dew &amp; Cabeza, 2011; Hannula et al., 2023; Henke, 2010; Reder et al., 2009; Shohamy &amp; Turk-Browne, 2013). We stand by our claim that sleep-learning was of episodic nature. We use a computational definition of episodic memory (Cohen &amp; Eichenbaum, 1993; Henke, 2010; O’Reilly et al., 2014; O’Reilly &amp; Rudy, 2000), and not the traditional definition of episodic memory that ties episodic memory to wakefulness and conscious awareness (Gabrieli, 1998; Moscovitch, 2008; Schacter, 1998; Squire &amp; Dede, 2015; Tulving, 2002). The core computational features of episodic memory are (1) rapid learning, (2) association formation, and (3) a compositional and flexible representation of the associations in long-term memory.</p><p>Therefore, we revised the manuscript to emphasize how our definition differs from traditional definitions (line 64).</p><p>For the current study, we designed a retrieval task that calls on the core computational features of episodic memory by assessing flexible retrieval of sleep-formed compositional word-word associations. Reviewer 3 suggests an alternative interpretation for the learning observed here: mere perceptual associations between foreign words and translations words are stored during sleep, and semantic associations are only inferred at retrieval testing during ensuing wakefulness. First, these processing steps would require the rapid soundsound associative encoding, long-term storage, and the flexible sound retrieval, which would still require hippocampal processing and computations in the episodic memory system. Second, this mechanism seems highly laborious and inefficient. The sound pattern of a word at 12 hours after learning triggers the reactivation of an associated sound pattern of another word. This sound pattern then elicits the activation of the translation words’ semantics leading to the selection of the correct superordinate semantic category at test.</p><p>Overall, we believe that our pairwise-associative learning paradigm triggered a rapid conceptual-associative encoding process mediated by the hippocampus that provided for flexible representations of foreign and translation words in episodic memory. This study adds to the existing literature by examining specific boundary conditions of sleep-learning and demonstrates the longevity (at least 36 hours) of sleep-learned associations.</p><p>Other remarks:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R3.2. Lines 43-45 : the assumption that the sleeping brain decides whether external events can be disregarded, requires awakening or should be stored for further consideration in the waking state is dubious, and the supporting references date from a time (the 60') during which hypnopedia was investigated in badly controlled sleep conditions (leaving open the doubt about the possibility that it occurred during micro awakenings)</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the manuscript to add timelier and better controlled studies that bolster the 60ties-born claim (line 40-51). Recently, it has been shown that the sleeping brain preferentially processes relevant information. For example the information conveyed by unfamiliar voices (Ameen et al., 2022), emotional content (Holeckova et al., 2006; Moyne et al., 2022), our own compared to others’ names (Blume et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R3.3. 1st paragraph, lines 48-53 , the authors should be more specific about what kind of new associations and at which level they can be stored during sleep according to recent reports, as a wide variety of associations (mostly elementary levels) are shown in the cited references. Limitations in information processing during sleep should also be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>In the lines to which R3 refers, we cite an article (Ruch &amp; Henke, 2020) in which two of the three authors of the current manuscript elaborate in detail what kind of associations can be stored during sleep. We revised these lines to more clearly present the current understanding of the potential and the limitations of sleep-learning (line 40-51). Although information processing during sleep is generally reduced (Andrillon et al., 2016), a variety of different kinds of associations can be stored, ranging from tone-odour to word-word association (Arzi et al., 2012, 2014; Koroma et al., 2022; Züst et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R3.4. The authors ran their main behavioural analyses on delayed retrieval at 36h rather than 12h with the argument that retrieval performance was numerically larger at 36 than 12h but the difference was non-significant (line 181-183), and that effects were essentially similar. Looking at Figure 2, is the trough effect really significant at 12h ? In any case, the fact that it is (numerically) higher at 36 than 12h might suggest that the association created at the first 12h retrieval (considering the alternative hypothesis proposed above) has been reinforced by subsequent sleep.</p></disp-quote><p>The Trough effect at 12h is not significant, as stated on line 185 (“Planned contrasts against chance level revealed that retrieval performance significantly exceeded chance at 36 hours only (P36hours = 0.036, P12hours = 0.094).”). It seems that our wording was not clear. Therefore, we refined the description of the behavioural analysis in the manuscript (lines 188-193).</p><p>In brief, we report an omnibus ANOVA with a significant main effect of targeting type (Trough vs Peak, main effect Peak versus Trough: F(1,28) = 5.237, p = 0.030, d = 0.865). Because Trough-targeting led to significantly better memory retention than Peak-targeting, we computed a second ANOVA, solely including participants with through-targeted word-pair encoding. The memory retention in the Trough condition is above chance (MTrough = 39.11%, SD = 10.76; FIntercept (1,14) = 5.660, p = 0.032) and does not significantly differ between the 12h and 36h retrieval (FEncoding-Test Delay (1,14) = 1.308, p = 0.272). However, the retrieval performance at 36h numerically exceeds the performance at 12h and the direct comparison against chance reveals that the 36h but not the 12h retrieval was significant (P36hours = 0.036, P12hours = 0.094). Hence, we found no evidence for above chance performance at the 12h retrieval and focused on the retrieval after 36h in the EEG analysis.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the subsequent sleep seems to have improved consolidation and subsequent retrieval. We assume that the reviewer suggests that participants merely formed perceptual associations during sleep and encoded episodic-like associations during testing at 12h (as pointed out in R 3.1). However, we believe that it is unlikely that the awake encoding of semantic associations during the 12h retrieval led to improved performance after 36h. We changed the discussion regarding the interaction between retrieval at 12h and 36h (line 505-512, also see R 2.2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R3.5&gt; In the discussion section lines 419-427, the argument is somehow circular in claiming episodic memory mechanisms based on functional neuroanatomical elements that are not tested here, and the supporting studies conducted during sleep were in a different setting (e.g. TMR)</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the TMR and animal studies are a different setting compared to the present study. We re-wrote this part and only focused on the findings of Züst and colleagues (2019), who examined hippocampal activity during the awake retrieval of sleep-formed memories (lines 472-482). Additionally, we would like to emphasise that our main reasoning is that the task requirements called upon the episodic memory system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R3.6. Supplementary Material: in the EEG data the differentiation between correct and incorrect ulterior classifications when presented at the peak of the slow oscillation is only significant in association with 36h delayed retrieval but not at 12h, how do the authors explain this lack of effect at 12 hour ?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer refers to the TROUGH condition (word-pairs targeted at a slow-wave trough) and not as written to the peak condition.

Why frame the paper in the broadest terms about awakenings and threats from the environment when this is a paper about intersections between learning &amp; memory and sleep? I do understand that there is an interesting point to be made about the counterintuitive behavioral findings with respect to sleep generally being perceived as a time when stimuli are blocked out, but this does not seem to me to be the broadest points or the way to start the paper. The authors should consider this but of course push back if they disagree.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s criticism but believe that this has more to do with personal preferences than with the scientific value or validity of our work. We believe that it is our duty as researchers to present our study in a broader context because this may help readers from various fields to understand why the work is relevant. To some readers, evidence for learning during sleep may seem trivial, to others, it may seem impossible or a weird but useless conundrum. By pointing out potential evolutionary benefits of the ability to acquire new information during sleep, we help the broad readership of eLife understand the relevance of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 31-32: &quot;Neural complexity&quot; -&gt; &quot;neural measures of complexity&quot; because it isn't clear what &quot;neural complexity&quot; means at this point in the abstract.

Whereas ‘neural measures of complexity’ only finds 3 hits on google scholar [September 2023]. In order to link our study with other studies on neural complexity, we would like to keep this terminology. As an example, two recent publications using “neural complexity” are Lee et al.

Here, we build on work from the field of microstate analyses and use two measures to describe and quantify the targeted brain states: the topography of the electric field (i.e., the correlation of the electric field with an established template or “microstate”), and the field strength (global field power, GFP). While the topography of a quasi-stable electric field reflects activity in a specific neural network, the strength (GFP) of a field most likely mirrors the degree of activation (or inactivity) in the specific network. Here, we find that consistent targeting of a specific network state yielding a strong frontal negativity benefitted learning during sleep.

I really appreciate the authors trying to figure out the set of precise times in which each level of neural processing might occur and how this intersects with their slow oscillation phase results. However, I found a lot of this too speculative, especially given that the sounds may bleed into parts of other phases of the slow oscillation. I do not believe this is a problem unique to these authors, as many investigators attempting to target certain phases in the target memory reactivation literature have faced the same problem, but I do believe the authors get ahead of the data here. In particular, there seems to be one paragraph in the discussion that is multiple pages long (p. 22-24). This paragraph I believe has too much detail and should be broken up regardless, as it is difficult for the reader to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering the recent literature, we believe this interpretation best explains the data. As argued earlier, we believe that a speculative interpretation of the reported phenomena can provide substantial added value because it inspires future experimental work. We have improved the manuscript by clearly distinguishing between data and interpretation. We do declare the speculative nature of some offered interpretations. We hope that these speculations, which are testable hypotheses (!), will eventually be confirmed or refuted experimentally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I very much enjoyed the paper and think it describes important findings. I have a few suggestions for improvement, and minor comments that caught my eye during reading:</p><p>(1) I was missing an analysis of CC ERP, and its comparison to EC ERP.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this analysis to the manuscript (line 299-301). The comparison of CC ERP with EC ERP did not yield any significant cluster for either the peak (cluster-level Monte Carlo p=0.54) or the trough (cluster-level Monte Carlo p&gt;0.37). We assume that the noise level was too high for the identification of differences between CC and EC ERP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Regarding my public review comment #2, some light can be shed on between-test effects, I believe, using an item-based analysis - looking at correlations between items' classifications in test #1 and test #2. The assumption seems to be that items that were correct in test #1 remained correct in test #2 while other new correct classifications were added, owing to the additional consolidation happening between the two tests. But that is an empirical question that can be easily tested. If no consistency in item classification is found, on the other hand, or if only consistency in correct classification is found, that would be interesting in itself. This item-based analysis can help tease away real memory from random correct classification. For instance, the subset of items that are consistently classified correctly could be regarded as non-fluke at higher confidence and used as the focus of subsequent-memory analysis instead of the ones that were correct only in test #2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we re-analysed the data accordingly. Participants were consistent at choosing a specific object category for an item at 12 hours and 36 hours (consistency rate = 47% same category, chance level is 1/3). Moreover, the consistency rate did not differ between the Trough and the Peak condition (MTrough = 47.2%, MPeak = 47.0%, P = 0.98). The better retrieval performance in the Trough compared to the Peak condition after 36 hours is due to: (A) if participants were correct at 12h, they chose again the correct answer at 36h (Trough: 20% &amp; Peak: 14%). (B) Following an incorrect answer at 12h, participants switched to another object category at 36h (Trough: 72%, Peak: 67%). (C) If participants switched the object category following an incorrect answer at 12h, they switched more often to the correct category at 36h in the trough versus the peak condition (Trough: in 56% &amp; Peak: 53%).Hence, the data support the reviewer’s assumption: items that were correct after 12 hours remained correct after 36 hours, while other new correct classifications were generated at 36h owing to the additional consolidation happening between the two tests. We added this finding to the manuscript (line 191-200, Figure S6):</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89601-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As suggested, we re-analysed the ERP with respect to the subsequent memory effect. This time we computed four conditions according to the reviewer’s argument about consistently correctly classified pseudowords, presented in the figure below: ERP of trials that were correctly classified at 36h (blue), ERP of trials that were incorrectly classified at 36h (light blue), ERP of trials that were correctly classified twice (brown) and ERP of trials that were not correctly classified twice (orange, all trials that are not in brown). Please note that the two blue lines are reported in the manuscript and include all trials. The brown and the orange line take the consistency into account and together include as well all trials.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89601-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>By excluding even more trials from the group of correct retrieval responses, the noise level gets high. Therefore, the difference between the twice-correct and the not-twice-correct trials is not significant (cluster-level Monte Carlo p &gt; 0.27). Because the ERP of twice-correct trials seems very similar to the ERP of the trials correctly classified at 36h at frontal electrodes, we assume that our ERP effect is not driven by a few extreme subjects. Similarly, not-twicecorrect trials (orange) have a stronger frontal trough than the trials incorrectly classified at 36h (light blue).</p><p>(3) In a similar vein, a subject-based analysis would be highly interesting. First and foremost, readers would benefit from seeing the lines that connect individual dots across the two tests in figures 2B and 2C. It is reasonable to expect that only a subset of participants were successful learners in this experiment. Finding them and analyzing their results separately could be revealing.</p><p>We added a Figure S1 to the supplementary material, providing the pairing between performance of the 12h and the 36h retrieval.</p><p>It is an interesting idea to look at successful learners alone. We computed the ERP of the subsequent memory effect for those participants, who had an above change retrieval accuracy at 36h. The result shows a similar effect as reported for all participants (frontal cluster ~0-0.3s). The p-value is only 0.08 because only 9 of 15 participants exhibited an above chance retrieval performance at 36 hours.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89601-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>ERP effect of correct (blue) vs incorrect (light blue) pseudoword category assignment of participants with a retrieval performance above chance at 36h (SD as shades):</p><p>We prefer to not include this data in the manuscript, but are happy to provide it here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I wondered why the authors informed subjects of the task in advance (that they will be presented associations when they slept)? I imagine this may boost learning as compared to completely naïve subjects. Whether this is the reason or not, I think an explanation of why this was done is warranted, and a statement whether authors believe the manipulation would work otherwise. Also, the reader is left wondering why subjects were informed only about test #1 and not about test #2 (and when were they told about test #2).</p></disp-quote><p>Subjects were informed of all the tests upfront. We apologize for the inconsistency in the manuscript and revised the method part. The explanation of why participants were informed is twofold: (a) Participants had to sleep with in-ear headphones. We wanted to explain to participants why these are necessary and why they should not remove them. (b) We hoped that participants would be expecting unconsciously sounds played during sleep, would process these sounds efficiently and would remain deeply asleep (no arousals).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) FoHH is a binary yes/no question, and so may not have been sensitive enough to demonstrate small differences in familiarity. For comparison, the Perceptual Awareness Scale (Ramsøy &amp; Overgaard, 2004) that is typically used in studies of unconscious processing is of a 4-point scale, and this allows to capture more nuanced effects such as partial consciousness and larger response biases. Regardless, it would be informative to have the FoHH numbers obtained in this study, and not just their comparison between conditions. Also, was familiarity of EC and CC pseudowords compared? One may wonder whether hearing the pseudowords clearly vs. in one ear alongside a familiar word would make the word slightly more familiar.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for having simplified this part too much in the manuscript. Indeed, the FoHH is comparable to the PAS. We used a 4-point scale, where participants rated their feeling of whether they have heard the pseudoword during previous sleep. In the revised manuscript, we report the complete results (line 203-223). The FoHH did not differ between any of the suggested contrasts. Thus, for both the peak and the trough condition, the FoHH did not differ between sleep-played vs new; correct EC trials vs new; correct vs incorrect EC trials; EC vs CC trials. To illustrate the results, a figure of the FoHH has been added to the supplement (Figure S4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Similarly, it would be good to report the numbers of the confidence ratings in the paper as well.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we extended the description of the confidence rating results. We added the descriptive statistics (line 224-236) and included a corresponding figure in the supplement (Figure S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor/aesthetic comments:</p></disp-quote><p>We implemented all the following suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) I suggest using &quot;pseudoword&quot; or &quot;nonsense word&quot; instead of &quot;foreign word&quot;, because &quot;foreign word&quot; typically means a real word from a different language.
