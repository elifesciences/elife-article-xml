The process by which this second cell becomes a specific type of cell is called differentiation. The body contains many different types of stem cells, such as neural stem cells, which go on to form the nervous system, and epithelial stem cells, which give rise to various types of surfaces in the body, such as the skin and the lining of the intestine.</p><p>Many types of epithelial cells are polarized, which means they have three distinct sides or domains: a basal domain that faces the underlying tissue; an apical domain on the opposite side; and a lateral domain on the side in between the apical and basal domains. The details of how cell polarity is established in epithelial cells are not fully understood, but it is thought to have its origins in the division of epithelial stem cells.</p><p>Now, by studying follicle stem cells in the ovaries of fruit flies, Castanieto et al. have shown that a process called EGFR signaling (which is short for epidermal growth factor receptor signaling) has a central role in establishing the difference between the stem cell and the cell that differentiates. EGFR signaling does this, in part, by promoting a ‘partially polarized state’ in the stem cells: this state is characterized by the presence of a basal domain and a lateral domain but no apical domain.</p><p>In fully polarized cells, the apical and lateral domains work together to ensure that all three domains remain separated on the surface of the cell, so it was surprising to find that the stem cell could maintain basal and lateral domains without an apical domain. Castanieto et al. propose that this feat is achieved by EGFR signaling, which activates a multiple number of proteins, including one called LKB1 that is known to regulate cell polarity.</p><p>This work strongly suggests that that changes in cell polarity are among the earliest differences to arise between epithelial stem cells and differentiating cells. In the future, it will be important to determine whether these differences in cell polarity cause the stem cells and the differentiating cells to take on different roles in the tissue. For example, it may be that the lack of an apical domain in the stem cells shields them from signals in the tissue that promote differentiation, thus allowing them to remain undifferentiated. Conversely, the development of an apical domain in the differentiating cells may expose them to signals that promote their differentiation, and also allow them to form a barrier and perform the other roles of epithelial tissue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04437.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04437.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>epithelial cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castanieto</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><name><surname>Nystul</surname><given-names>Todd G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castanieto</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005595</institution-id><institution>University of California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Genentech Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castanieto</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007185</institution-id><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Eugene Cota Robles Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castanieto</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The specification of cell polarity is essential for self-renewal and the segregation of stem-cell and daughter-cell fates in an epithelial stem cell lineage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult stem cell divisions produce asymmetric outcomes such that one daughter self-renews while the other goes on to differentiate. Although the signals that specify these different cell fates act directly on stem cells and their immediate daughters, the process of differentiation in the non-stem cell daughters can be gradual, sometimes occurring over the course of several cell divisions. Indeed, in many stem cell lineages, the non-stem cell daughter initially has the potential to re-enter the niche and become a stem cell, indicating that it does not immediately commit to the fully differentiated fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simons and Clevers, 2011</xref>). Instead, newly produced stem cell daughters are likely in a state of flux, undergoing a wide range of molecular and cytological changes. Previous studies have exploited visible differences in the cellular and sub-cellular morphology of stem cells and their daughters to investigate the signals that govern the segregation of cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). In several different <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian epithelia, the stem cells have a constricted or immature apical domain relative to the differentiated cell types in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buske et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huo and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kronen et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, signals that regulate the development of cell polarity may play an important role in the segregation of epithelial stem cell and daughter cell fates. However, the relationship between cell polarity and differentiation in epithelial stem cell lineages is poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the signals that promote stem cell maintenance in the niche and apical–basal cell polarity in the epithelial follicle stem cells (FSCs) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. Two FSCs are maintained within a structure at the tip of each ovariole, called the germarium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Margolis and Spradling, 1995</xref>). A population of stromal escort cells located just anterior to the FSCs forms the niche, providing essential self-renewal ligands to the FSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song and Xie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sahai-Hernandez and Nystul, 2013</xref>), and also supports early germ cell cyst development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kirilly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eliazer et al., 2014</xref>). As germ cell cysts mature, they move out of the escort cell region into the follicle epithelium, and each FSC divides approximately once per incoming cyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nystul and Spradling, 2010</xref>). Newly produced FSC daughter cells, called prefollicle cells, move away from the niche either toward the posterior or across the germarium toward the opposite FSC niche before incorporating into the follicle epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nystul and Spradling, 2007</xref>). This well-characterized tissue architecture makes it possible to readily identify and genetically manipulate FSCs and their immediate daughter cells within intact ovarioles.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04437.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The EGFR pathway is upregulated specifically in FSCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the germarium of the Drosophila ovary.

The FSCs have a lateral domain (which includes Discs large (Dlg), Lethal giant larvae (Lgl), and Scribble), a basal domain (defined by the localization of integrins to the surface that contacts the basement membrane), but no discrete apical domain. Instead, apical determinants are either undetectable or diffusely localized throughout the FSCs. In contrast, nascent apical domains are visible in adjacent, differentiating prefollicle cells. The apical–lateral determinant, Bazooka (Baz, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of Par-3), is the first marker to become visible on the cell membrane, followed by atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which localizes to the apical surface and positions Baz at the apical–lateral junctions. Further downstream, proteins in the Crumbs complex colocalize with aPKC and reinforce the apical identity. Adherens junctions also relocalize during follicle cell differentiation from a broad band along the anterior lateral surface of FSCs to discrete puncta at the apical–lateral junctions in differentiated follicle cells.</p><p>Once cell polarity is established in epithelial tissues, it is maintained through a highly conserved, self-sustaining process of mutual repression between the apical and lateral protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Betschinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanentzapf and Tepass, 2003</xref>). However, since these complexes are absent or immature during the establishment of cell polarity, additional signals are required at earlier stages. One such signal is provided by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which regulates multiple proteins involved in the establishment of cell polarity, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakano and Takashima, 2012</xref>). LKB1 is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) and Par-1, and is required for follicle cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin and St Johnston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haack et al., 2013</xref>). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling may also be important for follicle cell polarity because a global reduction of the function of <italic>Egfr</italic> or of the downstream EGFR pathway modifiers <italic>brainiac</italic> or <italic>egghead</italic> disrupts the architecture of the follicle epithelium; however cell-polarity markers were not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goode et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1996</xref>). Here we show that EGFR signaling promotes FSC maintenance in the niche, that EGFR is required specifically in FSCs to establish cell polarity throughout the FSC lineage, and that EGFR signals through both the canonical Ras–Raf–MEK–Erk pathway and through LKB1 and AMPK to suppress apical identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The EGFR pathway is upregulated specifically in FSCs</title><p>To determine which cells within the early FSC lineage have active EGFR signaling, we stained for the dual-phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (pErk), one of the downstream effectors of the canonical EGFR pathway. Consistent with published studies, we found that pErk was detectable in escort cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), sporadic follicle cells in the germarium, and most follicle cells surrounding mid-stage follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Buskirk and Schupbach, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, we noticed bright pErk staining in cells at the position of the FSC. As FSCs can be unambiguously identified as the anterior-most cell in an FSC clone induced in adult flies by mitotic recombination, we generated FSC clones marked by the absence of green florescent protein (GFP) and stained for pErk. Indeed, we found that bright pErk staining was detected in 90% (n = 28/31) of FSCs identified within an FSC clone, but was completely undetectable in 87% (n = 27/31) of prefollicle cells just downstream of the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). In the remaining 13% of prefollicle cells just downstream of the niche (n = 4/31), pErk was also detectable, which could be due to the perdurance of the pErk signal in cells that had recently exited the niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To determine whether this pErk signal is dependent upon EGFR, we generated FSC clones that are homozygous for <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup>, a loss-of-function allele, and stained for pErk. Indeed, we found that pErk was undetectable in the FSC in 93% (n = 13/14) of <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSC clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the EGFR pathway is active in FSCs and downregulated in prefollicle cells that have moved downstream from the FSC niche.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EGFR is required for FSC maintenance in the niche</title><p>Given the specificity of EGFR signaling in the FSC, we hypothesized that EGFR is required for FSC maintenance in the niche. To test this hypothesis, we performed a standard assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song and Xie, 2002</xref>) in which clones are generated in adult ovaries, and the frequencies of ovarioles with 0, 1, or 2 clonally marked FSCs are quantified at multiple time points after clone induction. In this assay, ovarioles that start out as mosaic (1 marked FSC) become fully marked (2 marked FSCs) or fully unmarked (0 marked FSCs) when the daughter of one FSC replaces the other FSC. Thus, FSC turnover causes a decrease in the frequency of mosaic ovarioles, and an increase in the frequencies of fully marked and fully unmarked ovarioles. If both the marked and unmarked FSCs are wildtype, they will replace each other at equal rates so the frequencies of fully marked and fully unmarked ovarioles increase at approximately equal rates. If the clonally marked FSCs are mutant for a gene that is required for FSC maintenance in the niche, the marked FSCs will be rapidly lost, causing a disproportionate increase in the frequency of fully unmarked ovarioles. Conversely, if the clonally marked FSCs contain a genetic modification that enhances their ability to occupy the niche or replace wildtype FSCs, unmarked FSCs will be preferentially lost, causing a disproportionate increase in the frequency of fully marked ovarioles.</p><p>We generated either wildtype (control group) or <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> (experimental group) GFP<sup>(−)</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) under identical conditions (See ‘Materials and methods’) and assayed for FSC clone frequencies at 4, 7, and 11 days post clone induction (dpci). It is more common to assay for FSC clone frequencies at 7, 14, and 21 dpci, but because <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSC clones were extremely rare at late time points we chose this earlier set of time points. Nonetheless, we found significantly fewer (p &lt; 0.02) mosaic ovarioles in the experimental group compared to the control group at all three early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, while the frequency of fully marked ovarioles in the control group increased from 0% at 4 dpci (n = 0/157) to 10% at 11 dpci (n = 9/87), no fully marked ovarioles were observed in the experimental group at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Therefore, we next measured the frequency of all FSC and follicle cell clones in the germarium of each ovariole at 2 dpci and found that the combined frequencies of FSC clones and prefollicle cell clones (i.e. those originating in follicle cells downstream of the FSC) were nearly the same in the control and experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that the low frequency of <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSC clones at 2 dpci was due to a very rapid loss of <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSCs and not a lower rate of clone induction, as explored further in the next section.</p><p>Lastly, since loss of <italic>Egfr</italic> inhibits FSC maintenance in the niche, we tested whether constitutively active EGFR signaling had the opposite effect. To test this, we used the MARCM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>), which makes it possible to express a transgene of interest in all of the cells in the clone. We generated groups of flies in which the clonally marked cells were either wildtype (control group) or overexpressing a constitutively activated allele of <italic>Egfr</italic> (<italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>λtop</italic></sup>) (experimental group) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Queenan et al., 1997</xref>). We induced clones in paired control and experimental groups, and assayed for FSC clone frequencies at 7, 14, and 21 dpci. Whereas the frequency and distribution of FSC clones was similar in both groups at 7 dpci (p &gt; 0.33), the frequency of fully marked ovarioles was significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group at 21 dpci (18% in wildtype vs 31% in <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>λtop</italic></sup>, p &lt; 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In addition, many of the follicle cells in this region were not cuboidal but instead had a more pointed shape that resembled FSCs or early prefollicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, Dlg was still detectable on the cell membranes of follicle cells with constitutively active EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>), indicating that lateral identity was largely unaffected in these cells. In addition, bright puncta of Baz staining were still visible on the cell membrane near sites of contact with the germline in 76% (n = 86/110) of these germaria, suggesting that apical–lateral identity is also largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D,F</xref>).

EGFR activates both the canonical Ras-mediated pathway leading to the phosphorylation of Erk, and the LKB1–AMPK pathway. Both Erk and AMPK are kinases that can regulate gene activity by activating transcription factors and phosphorylating proteins in the cytoplasm. AMPK directly promotes the lateral identity in polarized cells by activating lateral proteins. PKA is an upstream activator of LKB1 in follicle cells, and PKA can be activated by EGFR signaling, suggesting that EGFR signaling may activate LKB1 via PKA. EGFR signaling may suppress apical polarity either directly by regulating the transcription or activity of apical proteins, or indirectly by enhancing the activity of lateral proteins that suppress the localization of apical proteins. Low levels of EGFR signaling in prefollicle cells relieves this suppression, allowing apical domains to form and permitting differentiation away from the stem cell fate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04437.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04437.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04437-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>It is interesting that, despite the importance of EGFR signaling in FSCs, <italic>Egfr</italic> is dispensable for the maintenance and continued development of cell polarity in prefollicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In polarized epithelial cells, apical and lateral identities are maintained by a process of mutual exclusion in which the cortical localization of the Par-6/aPKC complex is suppressed by Lgl and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hutterer et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it may be that EGFR signaling is required to maintain the unique partially polarized state of the FSCs but, once both apical and lateral domains are present together, they become self-sustaining. Indeed, the reactivation of EGFR signaling in follicle cells during mid- and late-oogenesis does not seem to disrupt polarity, suggesting that the influence of EGFR signaling on cell polarity is diminished in these stages when the cells are more differentiated and fully polarized. This mutual dependency may also explain why prefollicle cells produced by FSCs that are mutant for <italic>Egfr</italic> exhibit cell-polarity defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The segregation of the basal and lateral protein complexes during an FSC division has not been characterized, but it is plausible that prefollicle cells inherit their basal and lateral domain identities from the FSC. Since <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> FSCs lack basal and lateral domain identities, they may be unable to contribute polarity information to their prefollicle cell daughters, leaving these cells with no polarity cues to build upon and therefore rendering them incapable of specifying basal, lateral or apical domains.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that EGFR signaling regulates cell polarity in part by activating LKB1. First, our observations that loss of <italic>lkb1</italic> phenocopies loss of <italic>Egfr</italic>, and that constitutively active LKB1 partially rescues the phenotypes caused by a decrease in <italic>Egfr</italic> function, indicate that EGFR and LKB1 operate together to promote cell polarity in the FSC lineage. Second, our observation that the LKB1-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK is dependent in part on <italic>Egfr</italic> suggests that LKB1 is activated by EGFR signaling. LKB1 is a ‘master regulator’ of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Partanen et al., 2013</xref>), capable of initiating apical–basal polarity even in cultured cells that lack cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baas et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, LKB1 is required in follicle cells to prevent apical proteins from encroaching into the lateral domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin and St Johnston, 2003</xref>). Moreover, although the intermediate steps were not investigated, a recent study demonstrated that EGFR promotes apical constriction of epithelial cells in the tracheal placode during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In many <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell types, EGFR signaling operates exclusively through the linear Ras–Raf–MEK–Erk cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perrimon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shilo, 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the activation of LKB1 in the FSC lineage is also induced by pErk, which could promote the transcription or post-translational activation of either LKB1 or an upstream activator of LKB1. However, our finding that the loss of <italic>Ras85D</italic> produces a substantially less penetrant phenotype than loss of <italic>Egfr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) suggests that the pathway bifurcates upstream of <italic>Ras85D</italic>, placing <italic>lkb1</italic> in a separate pathway downstream of EGFR. Consistent with this possibility, a study of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain found that EGFR can activate PKA in a Ras-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hannan et al., 2006</xref>), and PKA is a well-established activator of LKB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sapkota et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, each of the individual steps of this pathway from EGFR through to PKA, LKB1, and AMPK to apical–basal polarity have been observed in studies of mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tortora and Ciardiello, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>), suggesting that these connections make up an evolutionarily conserved pathway.</p><p>In addition to promoting apical–basal polarity, our findings indicate that EGFR signaling also regulates the segregation of stem cell and daughter cell fates in the FSC lineage. Specifically, our finding that <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSC clones are rapidly lost from the tissue indicates that EGFR is required for the FSC fate; whereas our observation that constitutively active EGFR signaling causes prefollicle cells to retain an FSC-like morphology and replace wildtype stem cells more often suggests that EGFR signaling must be downregulated to permit differentiation. EGFR signaling may promote the FSC fate in several ways. First, the activation of the canonical EGFR pathway leading to the phosphorylation of Erk is likely to directly regulate the activity of many genes in the FSC self-renewal program. Second, EGFR signaling may interact with other pathways, such as the Wingless pathway, that are required for FSC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song and Xie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sahai-Hernandez and Nystul, 2013</xref>). Indeed, EGFR and Wingless signaling cooperate to specify cell fate in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues such as the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Szüts et al., 1997</xref>) and the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), and thus there may be similar cross-talk in the FSC niche compartment. Third, our data strongly suggest that EGFR signaling is required for FSC maintenance in the niche in part because of its role in regulating cell polarity. Specifically, our observation that DE-cad and β-integrin are absent from the membranes of cells in <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSC clones indicates that EGFR signaling is required for the formation of the cellular junctions that are known to anchor FSCs in the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song and Xie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Reilly et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the lack of polarity in <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSCs could also affect other processes, such as cellular trafficking, cell division, and signal transduction that may be important for the self-renewal program.</p><p>Collectively these studies demonstrate that EGFR signaling, and the role that the pathway plays in regulating cell polarity, are an essential part of the program that promotes the segregation of FSC and daughter cell fates. EGFR signaling is known to promote a stem-like or less differentiated state in other epithelial tissues as well. For example, EGFR signaling induces proliferation of progenitor cells in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis, and is downregulated in cells within the suprabasal layers that are differentiating into mature keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, EGFR signaling is required for the maintenance and proliferation of the stem cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, EGFR signaling is commonly upregulated in epithelial cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer, that have a stem cell-like molecular profile. However, the specific effects of EGFR signaling in the stem cells of these tissues are not well understood. In addition, although EGFR signaling can promote a loss of cell polarity in differentiated epithelial cells by contributing to the activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, it is unclear whether or how this function of EGFR signaling relates to cell fate specification. Our study suggests that EGFR signaling promotes the stem cell fate at least in part by specifying the unique polarity of the stem cell. It will be interesting to determine whether the regulation of cell polarity is a common mechanism by which cell fates are specified in other epithelial tissues as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained on standard molasses food.</p><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>The following genotypes were used to generate clones</title><p>GFP<sup>(−)</sup> clones<bold>:</bold> (1) wildtype control for <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup>: FRT 42d/FRT 42d, Ubi-GFP; MKRS(hsFlp)/+, (2) <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup>: FRT 42d, Egfr[f24]/FRT 42d, Ubi-GFP; MKRS(hsFlp)/+, (3) wildtype control for <italic>Ras85D</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> and <italic>lkb1</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>: hsFlp/+; FRT 82b/FRT 82b, Ubi-GFP, (4) <italic>Ras85D</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>: hsFlp/+; FRT 82b, Ras85D[<italic>Δ</italic>c40b]/FRT 82b, Ubi-GFP, (5) <italic>lkb1</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>: hsFlp/+; FRT 82b, lkb1[4A4-2]/FRT 82b, Ubi-GFP.</p><p>MARCM clones: (1) wildtype control for <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>λtop</italic></sup>: hsFlp, tub-Gal4, UAS-GFP/+; FRT 40a/tub-Gal80, FRT 40a, (2) <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>λtop</italic></sup>: hsFlp, tub-Gal4, UAS-GFP/+; FRT 40a/tub-Gal80, FRT 40a; UAS-<italic>λ</italic>top/+, (3) wildtype control for <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f2</italic></sup>: hsFlp, tub-Gal4, UAS-GFP/+; FRT 42d/FRT 42d, tub-Gal80, (4) <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f2</italic></sup>: hsFlp, tub-Gal4, UAS-GFP/+; FRT 42d, Egfr<sup>f2</sup>/FRT 42d, tub-Gal80.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>The following genotypes were used in Gal4 experiments</title><p>(1) 109-30 &gt; <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>λtop</italic></sup>: P{GawB}109-30/+; P{UAS-Egfr.λtop}4.4/+, (2) 109-30 &gt; <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>DN</italic></sup>: P{GawB}109-30/P{w[+mC]=UAS-Egfr.DN.B}29-77-1; P{w[+mC]=UAS-Egfr.DN.B}29-8-1/+, (3) 109-30 &gt; <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>DN</italic></sup>, <italic>lkb1</italic><sup><italic>S535E</italic></sup>: P{GawB}109-30/P{w[+mC]=UAS-Egfr.DN.B}29-77-1; P{w[+mC]=UAS-Egfr.DN.B}29-8-1/ P{UASp-GFP-lkb1.S535E}.</p><p>Wildtype stock used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> was <italic>y[1] w[1]</italic>.</p><p>All stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center except the following: <italic>yw, hsFlp, tub-Gal4, UAS-GFP/FM7; tub-Gal80 FRT40A/CyO</italic> obtained from Yuh Nung Jan, <italic>w; FRT 42D, Ubi-GFP/CyO; MKRS(hsFlp)/TM2</italic> obtained from Allan Spradling, <italic>FRT 42d, EGFR[f24]/CyO</italic> and <italic>FRT 82b, Ras85D[ΔC40b]/TM3</italic> obtained from Bruce Edgar, <italic>hsFlp, tub-Gal4, UAS-GFP; FRT 42d, tub-Gal80</italic> obtained from Ben Ohlstein, <italic>w; P{UASp-GFP-lkb1.S535E}TM6B</italic> and <italic>w; FRT 82b, lkb1[4A4-2]/TM3</italic> obtained from Daniel St Johnston, and P{UAS-Egfr.λtop}<italic>4.4</italic> obtained from Trudi Schupbach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Clone induction experiments</title><p>Clones were generated by culturing flies of the appropriate genotypes and carrying control and experimental adults as paired cohorts through an identical clone induction process as follows: adults were given wet yeast for 2 days at 25°C, heat shocked twice a day for 2 days (4 times total) for 1 hr in a 37°C water bath, then maintained on wet yeast at 25°C for up to 21 days post heat shock, and dissected at the indicated days post clone induction.

When a clone is induced in an FSC, the labeled FSC remains in the niche and continues to divide as the clone grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Margolis and Spradling, 1995</xref>). Therefore, these clones can span across many follicles and will always include at least one cell at the Region 2a/2b border, where the FSC niche is located. In contrast, when a clone is induced downstream from the FSC (for example in a prefollicle cell produced by an FSC), the clone will move out of the germarium as it grows; it will not span across more than two follicles and will not cover more than approximately one half of a single follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nystul and Spradling, 2010</xref>). Occasionally, the FSC that is maintaining an FSC clone is lost from the niche due to stem cell replacement, which results in a (former) stem cell clone that no longer extends back to the Region 2a/2b border. These can be difficult to distinguish from FSC clones unless they are very big (e.g. clearly spanning three or more consecutive follicles). However, <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> clones that originate from an FSC should have a polarity phenotype, yet only 5–6% of <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> prefollicle cell clones scored at 4–7 dpci had polarity defects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that this type of ‘false’ transient clone is uncommon at these time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gal4 experiments</title><p>Experimental flies bearing the 109-30-Gal4 construct were raised at 25°C and then shifted to 29°C 1–2 days post eclosion and maintained on wet yeast.

For pErk staining, adult flies of the appropriate genotype were given fresh wet yeast 4–6 hr before dissecting. Ovaries were dissected in Graces medium (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA) using tungsten needles and carefully transferred to microfuge tubes with forceps or a tungsten needle. To minimize mechanical damage, ovarioles were never aspirated with a pipette. Ovarioles were fixed in 1× PBS + 4% paraformaldehyde diluted from 16% (Fisher) for 15 min, rinsed, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.

All images were acquired on a Zeiss M2 Axioimager with Apotome unit or Leica TCS SP5 spectral confocal. For multicolor fluorescence images, each channel was acquired separately.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The general consensus is that this paper is in principle appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> as it is novel and addresses issues of substantial general interest. There are, however, substantial concerns about whether the main conclusions are rigorously supported that would need to be addressed before it could be accepted.</p><p>The main experimental approach is to generate follicle cell clones and this is where several issues arise. First, there is the possibility that some of the clones may be 'false' as recently described by the St Johnston lab. Second, it is not clear how they distinguish between stem cell clones and prefollicle cell clones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>, given that many of the mutant stem cells are lost, so one cannot always identify the former by the presence of a GFP-negative FSC. Third, only a single allele of each mutation has been tested and there is a risk of contaminating mutations. This is somewhat abrogated by the use of lambda-top, but here, too, only a single insertion was tested. The DN-EGFR, Ras85D and LKB1 effects were rather weak.</p><p>All these issues could be addressed by generating one or two positively marked MARCM clones, using another allele. Were the results to be clear, it might not be necessary to do it for all the genes tested.</p><p>The exact role of EGFR is not easy to conclude from these experiments. It appears to have distinct functions in FSCs and PFCs. The authors should be more circumspect; it is probably premature to describe everything in terms of a simple linear pathway through LKB1. Furthermore, the strong statement that “The EGFR is required for FSC self-renewal” is misleading, as half of the <italic>Egfr–</italic> FSC clones persist for 11 days. During this time, they must go through multiple rounds of asymmetric division to produce a daughter stem cell and a prefollicle cell, that is, self-renew. What the authors are referring to is the observation that mutant stem cells cannot replace their counterparts on the other side of the germarium, which is stem cell replacement, not self-renewal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04437.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The main experimental approach is to generate follicle cell clones and this is where several issues arise.

This experiment provided a clear confirmation of our previous results: as with the F24 allele, nearly all F2 FSC clones (94%, n = 15/16) had defective polarity whereas polarity was not substantially disrupted in nearly all of the F2 transient clones (95%, n = 112/118). These results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplements 1</xref> and 2.</p><p><italic>The exact role of EGFR is not easy to conclude from these experiments. It appears to have distinct functions in FSCs and PFCs</italic>.</p><p>Our data support a model in which EGFR functions in FSCs to maintain basal and lateral polarity of FSCs but is not required in prefollicle cells for the maintenance or continued development of cell polarity. However, we also found that prefollicle cells produced by <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup> FSCs have polarity defects even though these cells do not need EGFR to maintain polarity. This may be because prefollicle cells produced by <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup> FSCs do not inherit the proper polarity cues and thus cannot become polarized. We have added a discussion of this issue in the Discussion section, which includes the following possible explanation:</p><p>“The segregation of the basal and lateral protein complexes during an FSC division has not been characterized, but it is plausible that prefollicle cells inherit their basal and lateral domain identities from the FSC. Since <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup> FSCs lack basal and lateral domain identities, they may be unable to contribute polarity information to their prefollicle cell daughters, leaving these cells with no polarity cues to build upon and therefore rendering them incapable of specifying basal, lateral or apical domains.”</p><p><italic>The authors should be more circumspect; it is probably premature to describe everything in terms of a simple linear pathway through LKB1</italic>.</p><p>Our favored model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is not a linear pathway through LKB1 but instead that LKB1 is a member of just one of the branches downstream from EGFR in FSCs. In addition, we have tried to be very cautious throughout the manuscript to leave open the possibility that other proteins may function downstream of EGFR to regulate cell polarity. For example, we state in the Discussion section “Several lines of evidence indicate that EGFR signaling regulates cell polarity <italic>in part</italic> by activating LKB1” and go on to point out that “constitutively active LKB1 <italic>partially</italic> rescues the phenotypes caused by a decrease in <italic>Egfr</italic> function”. This discussion continues in the following paragraph, where we describe the bifurcation model using language that emphasizes our uncertainty, such as “it is possible that,” “suggests,” and “consistent with this possibility”. Also, in the next paragraph of the same section, we discuss the many ways that the phosphorylation of Erk may directly regulate the activity of genes in the FSC self-renewal program. We hope this is an effective way of communicating our views without overstating them.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the strong statement that “The EGFR is required for FSC self-renewal” is misleading, as half of the Egfr</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup> <italic>FSC clones persist for 11 days.

What the authors are referring to is the observation that mutant stem cells cannot replace their counterparts on the other side of the germarium, which is stem cell replacement, not self-renewal</italic>.</p><p>We consider the term “self-renewal” to encompass not just the ability of a stem cell to divide asymmetrically but also the ability of the stem cell to remain in the niche and continue dividing in this way over a period of time that is comparable to that of a wildtype stem cell. Thus, we interpret our observation that <italic>Egfr</italic><sup><italic>f24</italic></sup> FSC clones are lost from the tissue much more rapidly than wildtype FSC clones as evidence that <italic>Egfr</italic> is required for FSC self-renewal. However, we understand from the reviewers’ comment that this wording can be ambiguous, so we have removed “self-renewal” from the title and replaced most instances of this term with “maintenance in the niche” or “stem cell replacement”, as the reviewers suggest.</p></body></sub-article></article>
