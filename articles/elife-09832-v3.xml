Dna2 requires ssDNA ends, and is dependent on the ssDNA-binding protein Rpa, which controls cleavage polarity. Here we present the 2.3 Å structure of intact mouse Dna2 bound to a 15-nucleotide ssDNA. The nuclease active site is embedded in a long, narrow tunnel through which the DNA has to thread. The helicase domain is required for DNA binding but not threading. We also present the structure of a flexibly-tethered Dna2-Rpa interaction that recruits Dna2 to Rpa-coated DNA. We establish that a second Dna2-Rpa interaction is mutually exclusive with Rpa-DNA interactions and mediates the displacement of Rpa from ssDNA. This interaction occurs at the nuclease tunnel entrance and the 5’ end of the Rpa-DNA complex. Hence, it only displaces Rpa from the 5’ but not 3’ end, explaining how Rpa regulates cleavage polarity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09832.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09832.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09832.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA carries the genetic information that is essential for organisms to survive and reproduce. It is made of two strands that twist together to form a double helix. However, these strands can be damaged when the DNA is copied before a cell divides, or by exposure to radiation or hazardous chemicals. To prevent this damage from causing serious harm to an organism, cells activate processes that rapidly repair the damaged DNA.</p><p>“Homologous recombination” is one way in which cells can repair damage that has caused both strands of the DNA to break in a particular place. In the first step, several enzymes trim one of the two DNA strands at each broken end to leave single stranded “tails”. Dna2 is one enzyme that is involved in making these tails, but it can only bind to single-stranded DNA so it only acts after another enzyme has made some initial cuts. The exposed single stranded DNA then searches for an intact copy of itself elsewhere in the genome, which promotes its repair. It is important that only one of the two DNA strands is trimmed at each end otherwise the repair will fail. A protein called Rpa is bound to the DNA and is required for Dna2 to correctly trim the DNA. However, it is not clear exactly how Rpa2 regulates Dna2.</p><p>Zhou et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to analyze the three-dimensional structures of Dna2 when it is bound to single stranded DNA and when it is bound to Rpa. The experiments show that Dna2 adopts a cylindrical shape with a tunnel through which the single-stranded DNA passes through. The region of Dna2 that is capable of trimming DNA – which is called the nuclease domain – is embedded within the tunnel. The entrance to the tunnel is too narrow to allow double-stranded DNA to enter, so this explains why Dna2 can only act on double-stranded DNA that already has a small single-stranded section at the end.</p><p>Inside the tunnel, Dna2 displaces Rpa from one of the strands, which allows Dna2 to trim the DNA. However, other molecules of Rpa remain firmly bound to the other strand to protect it from Dna2. These enzymes also act in a similar way to trim DNA before it is copied in preparation for cell division. Zhou et al.’s findings provide an explanation for how Rpa determines which strand of DNA is trimmed by Dna2. Further work is needed to understand how Dna2 and Rpa work with other enzymes to trim DNA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09832.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09832.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Dna2</kwd><kwd>Rpa</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>nuclease</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>DNA end resection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pavletich</surname><given-names>Nikola P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>X-ray crystallography reveals that the Dna2 nuclease-helicase contains a long tunnel through which single-stranded DNA threads, and an allosteric mechanism for displacing the DNA-binding protein Rpa that restricts cleavage to the proper polarity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dna2 has nuclease and helicase activities and plays key roles in maintaining genomic integrity. It is involved in the nucleolytic processing of 5’ flaps during Okazaki fragment maturation, of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during homologous-recombination mediated repair, and of stalled replication forks in the intra-S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nimonkar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Dna2 was first identified as a replication mutant required for viability in yeast, and was subsequently shown to be involved in trimming long 5’ RNA-DNA flaps from Okazaki fragments during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budd et al., 1995</xref>). Most flaps are cleaved by Fen1 concomitant with their generation by strand displacement during Pol δ synthesis on the lagging strand. Flaps that escape early cleavage, or those extended by the Pif1 helicase, get long enough to be coated by the Replication Protein A (Rpa), which renders them resistant to Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pike et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stith et al., 2008</xref>). Dna2, which can displace Rpa from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2008</xref>), trims the flap to a length too short for stable Rpa binding, and restores Fen1 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayyagari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gloor et al., 2012</xref>). The lethality of Dna2 deletion in yeast is attributed to persistent Rpa-coated flaps, which recruit Ddc2 (ATRIP in metazoa) and activate the Mec1 (ATR in metazoa) DNA-damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Long-flap processing by Dna2 is dependent on Rpa removing ssDNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2008</xref>), an essential Rpa function in many other aspects of DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanning et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>). Also paralleling other Rpa-dependent processes, the ability of Dna2 to act on Rpa-coated ssDNA is dependent on direct Dna2-Rpa interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bae et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2001</xref>). The yeast Dna2△405N mutation that reduces Rpa binding also reduces 5’ flap cleavage and DSB resection in vitro, and renders yeast temperature-sensitive for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bae et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In DSB resection, Dna2 acts redundantly with Exo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gravel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mimitou and Symington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). Resection of the 5’ terminated DNA strand results in a long track of 3’ overhang ssDNA, which forms a nucleoprotein filament with the Rad51 strand-exchange protein and initiates homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>). In vitro, Dna2, Rpa and the helicase Sgs1 (BLM in mammals) constitute the minimal complex that can carry out long-range resection. Resection is dependent on the nuclease activity of Dna2 and the helicase activity of Sgs1/BLM. Rpa is essential for supporting the helicase activity of Sgs1/BLM in part by sequestering the unwound strands, and also for regulating Dna2 by blocking its 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nimonkar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niu et al., 2010</xref>). In cells, Rpa depletion eliminates long-range DSB resection, and also causes the loss or inappropriate annealing of short 3’ ends generated by Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these functions, Dna2 is implicated in preventing the regression of stalled replication forks, which otherwise can generate aberrant structures resembling recombination intermediates and lead to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). This is dependent on the Dna2 nuclease activity, consistent with the ability of Dna2 to cleave fork structures with regressed leading or lagging nascent strands in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Dna2 contains a PD-(D/E)XK superfamily nuclease motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budd et al., 2000</xref>) and a 5’ to 3’ helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae and Seo, 2000</xref>). It is a ssDNA endonuclease that requires a free end for cleavage, and does not cleave dsDNA, single-stranded gaps, D-loops or RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae and Seo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kao et al., 2004</xref>). In vitro, isolated Dna2 cleaves ssDNA starting at either end, with multiple rounds of incision degrading ssDNA in both the 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae and Seo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuda-Sasa et al., 2006</xref>). With 5’ flap DNA, cleavage starts ~∼10 nucleotides (nts) from the ssDNA end and continues to within ∼5 nts of the duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae and Seo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gloor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuda-Sasa et al., 2006</xref>). It has been suggested that Dna2 loads at the free 5’ end of the flap and tracks in the 5’ to 3’ direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kao et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The helicase and ATPase activities of Dna2 are substantially weaker than those of other helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuda-Sasa et al., 2006</xref>). The helicase activity can be increased by a high ATP to Mg<sup>2+</sup> ratio, but this also inhibits the nuclease activity through ATP sequestering Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae and Seo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuda-Sasa et al., 2006</xref>). The 5’ to 3’ polarity of the helicase translocation could, in principle, drive the tracking of Dna2 along the 5’ flap. However, ATPase mutations have a minimal effect on 5’ flap processing and DSB resection in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). And, in vivo, ATPase-inactive yeast Dna2 mutants are viable, although they exhibit impaired growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budd et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>To understand the mechanism of action and regulation of this multi-faceted enzyme, we first determined the structure of the intact Dna2-ssDNA complex. The structure revealed that the ssDNA has to thread through a tunnel to bind to Dna2, with a polarity that precludes the cooperation of the helicase and nuclease activities. The requirement for DNA threading prompted us to investigate how Dna2 gains access to Rpa-coated DNA. We provide the structure of a complex between a Dna2 α helix and the Rpa70 OBN domain, both of which are flexibly-tethered and likely serve to recruit Dna2 to Rpa. We also establish a second Dna2-Rpa interaction that helps to displace Rpa from the 5’ DNA end, explaining how Rpa restricts the cleavage polarity of Dna2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of the Dna2-ssDNA complex</title><p>We determined the 2.3 Å crystal structure of full-length mouse Dna2 (residues 1 to 1062) bound to a ssDNA substrate of 21 nucleotides (nts), 15 of which are well ordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

In addition, the structure reveals an OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding) fold domain N-terminal to the nuclease domain, and a β barrel domain that occurs between the nuclease and helicase domains and which is held in place by a stalk of two long alpha helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>The overall structure has a cylindrical shape with a central tunnel through which the ssDNA threads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The base of the cylinder is formed by the nuclease domain, which adopts a doughnut-like structure with the active site embedded in the central tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The β barrel and helicase 1A domains pack on top of the nuclease doughnut and extend the cylinder and central tunnel. The helicase 2A domain, which packs with the 1A domain as in the ADP states of other SF1 helicase structures, hangs over the tunnel opening at the top of the cylinder. Most of the DNA-binding sites of the nuclease and helicase 1A domains are inside the tunnel, whereas those of the helicase 2A domain are solvent exposed. The OB domain decorates the exterior of the nuclease domain, and is uninvolved in DNA binding. The nuclease domain is the hub that organizes the overall structure. It packs with the flanking OB and β barrel-stalk domains, as well as the helicase 1B domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The ssDNA is positioned with its 5’ end at the helicase domain, and its 3’ end at the nuclease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A 7-nt segment at the 5’ end contacts first the helicase 2A domain outside the tunnel and then the 1A domain inside the tunnel. The DNA crosses over from the helicase to the nuclease domains over the next two nucleotides, which are in the vicinity of the β barrel domain in the middle of the tunnel, but do not make any protein contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The subsequent 6-nt segment binds to the nuclease domain. Here, the first three nucleotides are fully enclosed by the tunnel, while the last three nucleotides contact the tunnel opening. The DNA bases stack continuously, except for a base step at the helicase, one at the nuclease and one at the transition between the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Two of the three unstacked base steps are at pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairs, and this may contribute to the DNA binding at a well-defined register. An N-terminal acidic/amphipathic α helix (α1; residues 1 to 13) packs with the helicase domain of a symmetry-related complex. The α1 helix is flexibly tethered to the rest of the protein, as the 6 residues that connect it to the OB domain have no electron density in the crystals. As shown later, this helix is one of the two Rpa-binding elements of Dna2.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09832.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nuclease and helicase domain structures and DNA contacts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of the Dna2 nuclease domain on the AddB nuclease domain.

On ATP hydrolysis, domain 1A would be the one releasing its DNA and rebinding it at the +1 nt register, restoring the initial open-cleft conformation. In the Dna2-ssDNA structure, however, the rebinding of 1A to DNA at the shifted register will have to await the transient dissociation of the nuclease domain from DNA. The increased half life of the closed cleft would likely also reduce the rate of exchange of ADP for ATP, as the γ phosphate binding site of the helicase fold is far less solvent accessible in the closed cleft.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09832.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09832.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09832-fig2-figsupp1-v3.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nuclease structure and active site</title><p>As predicted, the Dna2 nuclease domain contains the core αβββαβ fold of the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pingoud et al., 2005</xref>).

These superimpose on the ∼310-residue Dna2 nuclease domain with a ∼2 Å root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) in the Cα positions of 128, 112 and 106 residues, respectively.</p><p>The most extensive similarity is exhibited by AddB, which shares with Dna2 the presence of the iron-sulfur cluster and most of the insertions and extensions that decorate the core fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krajewski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yeeles et al., 2009</xref>). While most of these elements have diverged beyond a ∼2 Å r.m.s.d., their secondary structures, arrangement and structural implications are closely related. In particular, both proteins have a β–α–α N-terminal extension and an α–α C-terminal extension that are stapled together by the iron-sulfur cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This iron-sulfur cluster domain supports a loop that crosses over the catalytic channel and converts it to a tunnel through which the DNA has to thread. λ exonuclease and RecB also have a crossover loop, but their N- and C-terminal extensions that anchor it are structurally divergent from Dna2, and, more significantly, they lack the iron-sulfur cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singleton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Dna2 nuclease domain binds to a total of four phosphodiester groups, two before and two after the scissile phosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The scissile phosphate group contacts two calcium ions, one (Ca-1) through a non-bridging oxygen, and another (Ca-2) through the 3’ bridging oxygen of the preceding base. The Ca-1 ion has an octahedral coordination shell very similar to other PD-(D/E)XK nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pingoud et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). It’s formed by the side chains of His164, Asp278 and Glu299, the Leu300 main chain carbonyl group, the non-bridging oxygen atom of the scissile phosphate group, and a water molecule, which also hydrogen bonds to Lys301 and is positioned for nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Lys301 is buttressed by Gln314, a motif IV residue characteristic of the RecB and λ exonuclease families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind et al., 2000</xref>). The relative position of the second, Ca-2 ion differs from other nucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and it is not clear whether it reflects the use of calcium instead of magnesium, or a divergent aspect of the nuclease mechanism of Dna2.</p><p>The base groups of the 6 nt segment stack in two sets of three, with Met157 and other crossover loop side chains wedging in between the Ade12 and Gua13 base groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is very similar to the λ exonuclease crossover loop, which marks the transition from double stranded to single stranded and is thought to play a key role in unwinding dsDNA, although λ exonuclease does so without a helicase domain and in the context of a homo-trimeric assembly that contacts the dsDNA of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, Met157 and the crossover loop may have an analogous function in the weak strand-separating activity of Dna2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Helicase structure</title><p>Dna2’s combination of the β barrel, stalk and helicase domains, and their relative arrangement are strikingly similar to RNA/DNA helicases of the Upf1 subfamily, which contains Upf1, Ighmbp2 and Senataxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>). The ∼600-residue assembly of the stalk, β barrel and helicase 1A and 2A domains can be superimposed on the structure of Ighmbp2 with a 1.5 Å Cα r.m.s.d. over 452 residues, with most of the non-superimposing residues accounted for by a ∼10° rotation of the β barrel, which otherwise is structurally conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The structural similarity between Dna2 and Ighmbp2 is actually more extensive than that between Ighmbp2 and Upf1 (1.8 Cα Å r.m.s.d for 436 residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Upf1-like subfamily is one branch of the SF1B family of helicases that translocate in the 5’ to 3’ direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>). The other SF1B branch, represented by the DNA helicase RecD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</xref>), lacks the barrel and stalk domains. Furthermore, the individual RecD2 1A and 2A domains are not as similar to Dna2, with alignment r.m.s.d. values of 1.8 Å for 134 residues and 1.9 Å for 97 residues, respectively, in contrast to the Dna2-Ighmbp2 alignment, where the corresponding values are 1.5 Å for 204 residues and 1.4 Å for 183 residues, respectively. Together, these structural observations suggest that Dna2 evolved by incorporating an ancestral Upf1-family helicase.</p><p>DNA binds to Dna2 through both its phosphodiester and base groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Dna2-base interactions include Van der Waals contacts from the motif III loop (Leu795 and Val797), which wedges in between the bases of the last two 2A-bound nucleotides. These contacts are consistent with the proposed role of motif III in preventing DNA sliding during translocation of SF1B helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</xref>). Dna2-phosphodiester interactions involve protein pockets that are rich in backbone amide and short-side chain hydroxyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Three consecutive phosphodiester groups, near the 5’ end of the DNA, bind to the 2A domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). The fourth phosphodiester group is in the cleft between the 2A and 1A domains and does not contact the protein, while the fifth and sixth phosphodiester groups bind to pockets on the 1A domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Contacts to the ribose groups are minimal, and they are consistent with the helicase accommodating the 2’ hydroxyl group of RNA. In fact, the DNA contacts as well as the phosphodiester backbone conformation are very similar to those of the Ighmbp2-RNA, Upf1-RNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This is in contrast to the RecD2-ssDNA structure, where extensive aromatic and van der Waals contacts with the sugar are thought to discriminate against RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The helicase and ssDNA-dependent ATPase activities of Dna2 are considerably weaker than other helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuda-Sasa et al., 2006</xref>). One possible explanation, at least for the low ATPase/translocation rate, is the helicase domain being 5’ to the nuclease domain on the DNA. This would, in principle, make completion of the ATPase/translocation cycle dependent on the nuclease domain releasing its grip on the DNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> legend for discussion of translocation).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mechanism of DNA binding</title><p>The structure explains why the nuclease activity of Dna2 requires the ssDNA to have a free end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae and Seo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kao et al., 2004</xref>). The active site is embedded in a ∼10 Å wide portion of the tunnel, and the tunnel entrances leading to it are too narrow to accommodate dsDNA or a single-stranded loop of a gap substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Since isolated Dna2 can degrade ssDNA with either 5’ to 3’ or 3’ to 5’ polarity in vitro, the ssDNA must be able to enter and thread through either end of the tunnel. In 5’ flap processing, threading likely proceeds through initial, transient interactions at the nuclease domain entrance of the tunnel, with subsequent re-binding events occurring further along the tunnel interior. This threading is likely related to that of λ exonuclease, where a 5’ terminal phosphate binding site inside the enzyme is proposed to drive the forward movement of the DNA in an electrostatic ratchet mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The 5’ to 3’ nuclease activity was shown to require ∼15 nts of ssDNA for optimal affinity and cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gloor et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the nuclease domain-DNA interactions do not provide sufficient binding energy or their half-life is too short relative to the catalytic step of cleavage. We thus presume that the 5’ end of the ssDNA threads through the nuclease portion of the tunnel without cleavage, until it reaches the helicase domain and engages the DNA-binding pockets there.</p><p>To investigate this in more detail, we assayed the Dna2 affinity and cleavage of a series of 5’ overhang substrates with ssDNA lengths that extend successively from the nuclease to the helicase 1A and 2A domains. The ssDNA consisted of deoxythymidine nucleotides, which have minimal secondary structure and thus do not require Rpa for cleavage by Dna2 (5’(dT)<sub>6</sub> to 5’(dT)<sub>24</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The short substrates that can span only the nuclease domain (5’(dT)<sub>6</sub> and 5’(dT)<sub>8</sub>) have Dna2 affinities approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of 5’(dT)<sub>24</sub>, and they exhibit minimal cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). With the slightly longer 5’(dT)<sub>8</sub>, low level cleavage occurs 7 and 8 nucleotides from the 5’ end, indicating that the ssDNA extends to the helicase 1A domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The sites of cleavage indicate that Dna2 opens up ∼2 base pairs (bps) of the duplex, since the tunnel entrance 3’ to the scissile phosphate is too narrow to accommodate double-stranded DNA. As ATP is neither required, nor has a significant effect, this DNA unwinding is the result of threading, likely analogous to DNA unwinding by λ exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Extending the ssDNA by 2 nts, (5’(dT)<sub>10</sub>), results in a major increase in Dna2 affinity and cleavage, with the cleavage sites indicating the engagement of the helicase 2A domain after the unwinding of ∼2 bps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). With 5’(dT)<sub>17</sub> where the ssDNA is long enough to reach both the 1A and 2A domains without duplex unwinding, there is a final increase in Dna2 affinity and cleavage that plateau at the levels of 5’(dT)<sub>24</sub>.</p><p>The 3’ to 5’ nuclease activity would require the 3’ end of the ssDNA to enter the tunnel at the helicase 2A domain.

However, because the DBDA–DBDB is at the 5’ end of the Rpa-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bochkarev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan and Pavletich, 2012</xref>), and the Dna2 OB domain is next to the nuclease tunnel entrance, the transiently free 5’ end of the DNA will be well-placed to start threading through the nuclease tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The threading process then should be able to completely dissociate the already weakened Rpa-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At a 3’ end of DNA, by contrast, the transient dissociation of DBD-A–DBD-B from DNA will expose an internal ssDNA lacking an end that can be trapped by the Dna2 tunnel, and DBD-A–DBD-B will revert to their DNA-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>This mechanism of Rpa displacement predicts that the inhibition of 3’ end cleavage by Rpa is due to the inability of Dna2 to displace Rpa there. To test this prediction, we conjugated 5’- or 3’-(dT)<sub>26</sub> overhang DNA that was biotinylated on the duplex end onto streptavidin beads, loaded it with Rpa, and then added nuclease-dead Dna2 (D278A mutant). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, Dna2 reduced the amount of Rpa bound to the 5’ overhang DNA by ∼30% (lanes 2 and 3), whereas it had a minimal effect on the Rpa bound to the 3’ overhang DNA (∼5% reduction; lanes 5 and 6). The amount of Rpa displacement was proportional to Dna2 loading, which was substantial with 5’ overhang DNA (∼45% of the reaction lacking Rpa; lanes 1 and 3), but negligible with 3’ overhang DNA (∼3%; lanes 4 and 6). In the absence of Rpa, by contrast, the amount of Dna2 loading on the two DNA substrates was essentially identical (lanes 1 and 4), consistent with the inability of Dna2 to load onto the 3’ overhang being due to its failure to displace Rpa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Dna2-ssDNA structure shows that the active site and most of the DNA-binding sites are enclosed in a narrow tunnel, necessitating the threading of the DNA through a tunnel end to access the DNA binding sites. The structure also indicates that the translocase activity of the helicase domain does not drive threading. A 5’ DNA end would have to thread halfway through the tunnel before it can access the helicase domain, while the threading of a 3’ end starting at the helicase 2A domain would be opposed by the 5’ to 3’ polarity of translocation, as we demonstrate. Instead of translocation, the helicase domain appears to be important for providing DNA affinity and for bypassing the 5’ RNA primer of Okazaki fragments.</p><p>The structure also precludes the helicase domain tracking on DNA to any significant extent, because the nuclease domain is ahead, in the 5’ to 3’ direction of translocation. This is consistent with in vitro studies showing the ATPase activity to be dispensable for 5’ flap processing and DSB resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>), and the fact that this activity is rather low compared to bona-fide helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae and Seo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masuda-Sasa et al., 2006</xref>). In yeast, ATPase mutations do result in growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budd et al., 2000</xref>), and it is possible this is due to the ATPase activity contributing to the bypassing of the RNA primer of Okazaki flaps, as suggested by our in vitro data. This may be reflected in the similarity of the Dna2 helicase domain to the Upf1 family of RNA/DNA helicases, which is extensive enough to indicate that Dna2 picked up an ancestral Upf1-like helicase during its evolution.</p><p>The requirement for threading necessitates Dna2 having a mechanism to displace Rpa from ssDNA. As our proposed mechanism of Rpa displacement predicts, we find that Dna2 can displace Rpa from a 5’ but not a 3’ end, explaining how Rpa dictates the proper end polarity of the nuclease activity of Dna2.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Full-length mouse Dna2 was cloned into a pFastbac1 baculovirus vector engineered with a cleavable N-terminal GST tag and a non-cleavable C-terminal FLAG tag, and was expressed in Hi-5 insect cells (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant protein was purified first by GST-affinity chromatography and, after cleavage of the GST tag, by anion exchange and gel-filtration chromatography.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, James Berger, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The editor and the reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript from the Pavletich laboratory on Dna2 is a remarkable tour de force. The paper describes a structure/function analysis of the Dna2 ATPase/nuclease and its interaction with RPA. It is well-written and fun to read. The structure has multiple interesting features. The paper establishes how the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease and SF1B helicase domains of Dna2 jointly bind ssDNA and how Dna2 interacts with RPA physically and biochemically to process DNA ends. The results furthermore provide the structural mechanisms for how Dna2 works on both 3' and 5' overhangs. The additional insight from biochemical experiments on how Dna2 might displace RPA from 5' but not 3' overhangs is a bonus. This work will be of tremendous and broad-based biological interest across many fields. It is a great paper in multiple respects. <italic>eLife</italic> is a highly suitable venue for publication.</p><p>The reviewers have raised the following points. The authors should use their judgement in how best to address these issues in preparing a revised version of the paper.</p><p>1) Dna2 is a multi-domain protein. TLS may improve the refinement. Given the importance of this structure, optimizing the refinement is worth the extra effort.</p><p>2) Is there any structural feature that sets the register of the ssDNA? It is remarkable that there weren't mixed populations, one or two nt off. A comment on this would be useful.</p><p>3) The authors pointed out that Dna2 primarily contacts the phosphodiester portion of the DNA (paragraph three, subheading “Helicase structure”). However, it is intriguing that the nuclease seems to be phosphodiester dominated, while the helicase domain has contacts with the bases as well. This is likely functionally relevant. Could the authors add a comment?</p><p>4) Why wasn't there a directly comparable DNA substrate to the RNA (21 nt) in subheading “Role of helicase activity in 5’ Okazaki fragment processing”? The authors used a 24 nt substrate. For a non-specific DNA binding protein like Dna2, a few nt can make a difference.</p><p>5) As Dna2 must cooperate on flaps with FEN1, are there any useful insights from this structure as to how this coordination may work? Also how do the active site metal ions and bound ssDNA compare to the FEN1-DNA structure as both enzymes incise 5' flaps (Cell 2011 145(2): 198–211). What is similar and what is different in terms of the DNA binding and catalytic site? In considering the lower activity with short 5' flaps, one wonders why is it active? The structure shows how Fen1 is controlled. Could Dna2 be &quot;activated&quot; somehow? Also FEN1 has significant changes upon DNA binding. For Dna2, the overall Rmsd was 0.9, but do some side chains in the nuclease have significant shifts with and without DNA?</p><p>6) Given the lowered incision activity with small ssDNA oligonucleotides, can the authors explain the 5 nt limit on 5' flaps? Is it simply that once bound, Dna2 can easily incise down to 5 nt in a processive fashion? Is it possible to distinguish the processive incision rate from an initial bind-incise rate?</p><p>7) The displacement of RPA from the 5' end by Dna2 is interesting. However, the mechanism is difficult to understand, as the alpha1 and the OB fold are closer to where the 5' end ends up after threading than where the 5' end must thread in. Are there any added insights that can be gained from adding in the DNA-bound RPA structure, with a linker added in between 70N.</p><p>8) The models put forth for Dna2 action often invoke a need to thread DNA (or RNA) through the nuclease tunnel. The entirety of the tunnel would seem rather long and narrow for this to readily occur (e.g., in RecBCD/AddAB systems, movement toward the nuclease through a tunnel is aided by the helicase domains). Is it possible that the barrel and stalk might transiently undock from the body of Dna2 to make binding more favorable to the SF1B domain, and this binding could then aid threading through the (now shorter) tunnel? Also, such a conformational change occurs in the FEN1 structure where flexibility evidently aids threading prior to the formation of the active complex, so perhaps this merits a comparative comment.</p><p>9) Along similar lines, although it is true that the ATPase activity of Dna2 is not strictly essential for yeast viability, it is unclear from the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> why Dna2 should need an ATPase domain at all. Given the conservation of this region in Dna2 homologs, this question merits some discussion/clarification.</p><p>10) Paragraph five, subheading “Overall structure of the Dna2-ssDNA complex”: Where does the α1 helix sit on the structure when it docks against a symmetry mate? Is this internal interaction functionally important? Would it be possible for this interaction to occur in cis?</p><p>11) Ramachandran values are not included in the Methods or in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09832.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Dna2 is a multi-domain protein. TLS may improve the refinement. Given the importance of this structure, optimizing the refinement is worth the extra effort.</italic></p><p>We now report the statistics from the TLS refinement, which has only a minor effect on the statistics and quality of electron density, consistent with the multiple domains being rigidly coupled.</p><p><italic>2) Is there any structural feature that sets the register of the ssDNA? It is remarkable that there weren't mixed populations, one or two nt off. A comment on this would be useful.</italic> </p><p>We think the DNA binds in a single register because of base-base stacking effects. We now mention this possibility in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“The DNA bases stack continuously, except for a base step at the helicase, one at the nuclease and one at the transition between the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Two of the three unstacked base steps are at pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairs, and this may contribute to the DNA binding at a well-defined register.” (paragraph four, subheading “Overall structure of the Dna2-ssDNA complex”).</p><p>We disfavor the alternative possibility of end effects, as unstructured or poorly-defined nucleotides exist at both the 5’ (one) and 3’ (three) ends of the DNA, and we now mention this in the revised manuscript (subheading “Overall structure of the Dna2-ssDNA complex”). <italic>3) The authors pointed out that Dna2 primarily contacts the phosphodiester portion of the DNA (paragraph three, subheading “Helicase structure”). However, it is intriguing that the nuclease seems to be phosphodiester dominated, while the helicase domain has contacts with the bases as well. This is likely functionally relevant. Could the authors add a comment?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that our previous discussion of the functional importance of helicase-base contacts could be overlooked (“Van der Waals contacts include those […] during translocation of SF1B helicases”; subsection “Helicase structure”).</p><p>To fix this, we have moved the aforementioned sentence closer to the beginning of the paragraph and have modified the introductory sentence:</p><p>“DNA binds to Dna2 through both its phosphodiester and base groups […] that are rich in backbone amide and short-side chain hydroxyl groups…” <italic>4) Why wasn't there a directly comparable DNA substrate to the RNA (21 nt) in subheading “Role of helicase activity in 5’ Okazaki fragment processing”? The authors used a 24 nt substrate. For a non-specific DNA binding protein like Dna2, a few nt can make a difference.</italic> </p><p>We now report the data with a directly comparable RNA (24 nt) substrate (subheading “Role of helicase activity in 5’ Okazaki fragment processing”), which does not materially change our conclusions.</p><p><italic>5) As Dna2 must cooperate on flaps with FEN1, are there any useful insights from this structure as to how this coordination may work?</italic> </p><p>As we discuss in the Introduction, the literature indicates that the coordination of Dna2 and Fen1 action at 5’ flaps is mediated by Rpa. As Fen1 cannot displace Rpa, it cannot act on a flap that is long enough to be coated by Rpa. This necessitates Dna2, which trims the flap until it is a poor substrate for Dna2 binding and incision as elaborated upon in our study, but an optimal substrate for Fen1 according to most published studies. As far as we know, there has been no report of a direct interaction between Dna2 and Fen1.</p><p><italic>Also how do the active site metal ions and bound ssDNA compare to the FEN1-DNA structure as both enzymes incise 5' flaps (Cell 2011 145(2): 198–211). What is similar and what is different in terms of the DNA binding and catalytic site?</italic> </p><p>While both Dna2 and Fen1 incise 5’ flaps, structurally they are very distinct. Fen1 is a DNA structure-specific nuclease as it binds to the two duplexes flanking the flap and holds both the 5’ and 3’ nucleotides at the nick, while Dna2 is a single stranded DNA endonuclease that requires a free 5’ end for threading. As such, we have found no informative parallels between the two structures, beyond their use of a two-metal catalytic mechanism as in many other PD-(D/E)XK nucleases. As discussed (paragraph three, subheading “Nuclease structure and active site”), one of the two calcium ions in the Dna2 structure has a coordination shell very similar to other nucleases, while the second one differs. This is possibly due to our use of calcium instead of magnesium, as the use of mutations at either a metal ligand or the lysine in other structural studies has also been observed to cause minor shifts in metal positions.</p><p><italic>In considering the lower activity with short 5' flaps, one wonders why is it active? The structure shows how Fen1 is controlled. Could Dna2 be &quot;activated&quot; somehow? Also FEN1 has significant changes upon DNA binding. For Dna2, the overall Rmsd was 0.9, but do some side chains in the nuclease have significant shifts with and without DNA?</italic></p><p>We have not found any indications of minor conformational changes between apo and DNA-bound Dna2 that could have functional implications.</p><p><italic>6) Given the lowered incision activity with small ssDNA oligonucleotides, can the authors explain the 5 nt limit on 5' flaps? Is it simply that once bound, Dna2 can easily incise down to 5 nt in a processive fashion? Is it possible to distinguish the processive incision rate from an initial bind-incise rate?</italic> </p><p>We have found no evidence for processivity using the standard assay of quenching a reaction of labeled substrate with unlabeled substrate. The 5’ flap remnant is likely too short to remain bound while the cleaved off ssDNA dissociates (or is driven off by the helicase action). <italic>7) The displacement of RPA from the 5' end by Dna2 is interesting. However, the mechanism is difficult to understand, as the alpha1 and the OB fold are closer to where the 5' end ends up after threading than where the 5' end must thread in. Are there any added insights that can be gained from adding in the DNA-bound RPA structure, with a linker added in between 70N.</italic> </p><p>As discussed in “Mechanism of Rpa displacement by Dna2”, the OB fold domain and alpha1 are actually closer to where the 5’ end threads into (nuclease portion of tunnel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) than where it ends up (hel2A of helicase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We have clarified this by labeling the schematic and expanding the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. We thank the reviewer for pointing out that the presentation of the model needs to be improved. <italic>8) The models put forth for Dna2 action often invoke a need to thread DNA (or RNA) through the nuclease tunnel. The entirety of the tunnel would seem rather long and narrow for this to readily occur (e.g., in RecBCD/AddAB systems, movement toward the nuclease through a tunnel is aided by the helicase domains). Is it possible that the barrel and stalk might transiently undock from the body of Dna2 to make binding more favorable to the SF1B domain, and this binding could then aid threading through the (now shorter) tunnel? Also, such a conformational change occurs in the FEN1 structure where flexibility evidently aids threading prior to the formation of the active complex, so perhaps this merits a comparative comment.</italic> </p><p>We cannot rule out the barrel and stalk transiently undocking from the bulk of the Dna2 structure, especially as it is rather mobile in the Upf1 family of RNA helicases and has high temperature factors in the Dna2 structure. However, this will not help with the initiation of threading because the tunnel entrance, which is also the narrowest part of the tunnel, is formed by the crossover loop that is stapled on the rest of the nuclease by the iron-sulfur cluster.</p><p><italic>9) Along similar lines, although it is true that the ATPase activity of Dna2 is not strictly essential for yeast viability, it is unclear from the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> why Dna2 should need an ATPase domain at all. Given the conservation of this region in Dna2 homologs, this question merits some discussion/clarification.</italic> </p><p>Our data suggests that the helicase activity helps bypass the 5’ RNA primer of Okazaki fragments. The data is described in “Role of helicase activity in 5’ Okazaki fragment processing” and shows that the helicase activity (ATP versus AMPPNP) stimulates cleavage of a mixed RNA-DNA substrate. Our structure also sheds light on the reported inhibition of 3’ end cleavage by ATP, indicating that this is due to 3’ end threading being counteracted by the helicase domain moving the DNA in the opposite direction (paragraph five, subheading “Mechanism of DNA binding”). We now reiterate this in the Conclusions:</p><p>“Instead of translocation, the helicase domain appears to be important for providing DNA affinity and for bypassing the 5’ RNA primer of Okazaki fragments.”</p><p><italic>10) Paragraph five, subheading “Overall structure of the Dna2-ssDNA complex”: Where does the α1 helix sit on the structure when it docks against a symmetry mate? Is this internal interaction functionally important? Would it be possible for this interaction to occur in cis?</italic> </p><p>In the crystals, the alpha1 helix packs against the helicase 2A domain, at a site that is not conserved across species, and in an interaction that cannot occur in cis. It is also unlikely to form in solution, as we have found no evidence of dimerization at up-to ~200 micromolar Dna2. <italic>11) Ramachandran values are not included in the Methods or in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have included Ramachandran values in the Methods, subheading “Structure determination and refinement”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
