nuclear pore complex (NPC), localizing at the nuclear periphery and clustering with co-regulated genes. Dynamic tracking of peripheral genes shows that they cycle on and off the NPC and that interaction with the NPC slows their sub-diffusive movement. Furthermore, NPC-dependent inter-chromosomal clustering leads to coordinated movement of pairs of loci separated by hundreds of nanometers. We developed fractional Brownian motion simulations for chromosomal loci in the nucleoplasm and interacting with NPCs. These simulations predict the rate and nature of random sub-diffusion during repositioning from nucleoplasm to periphery and match measurements from two different experimental models, arguing that recruitment to the nuclear periphery is due to random sub-diffusion and transient capture by NPCs. Finally, the simulations do not lead to inter-chromosomal clustering or coordinated movement, suggesting that interaction with the NPC is necessary, but not sufficient, to cause clustering.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromosome</kwd><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd><kwd>dynamics</kwd><kwd>nuclear architecture</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>clustering</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM118712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sumner</surname><given-names>Michael Chas</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Donna G</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sumner</surname><given-names>Michael Chas</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Donna G</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 CA193419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sumner</surname><given-names>Michael Chas</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sumner</surname><given-names>Michael Chas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004944</institution-id><institution>Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-97ER25308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torrisi</surname><given-names>Steven B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Measuring and simulating chromatin dynamics reveals that repositioning of genes to the nuclear pore is neither active nor vectorial, but reduces sub-diffusion and coordinates movement between loci on different chromosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, genomes are spatially organized within the nucleus. Chromosomes occupy distinct subnuclear ‘territories’, heterochromatin is segregated from euchromatin, and individual genes show non-random positioning relative to nuclear structures and other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Misteli, 2020</xref>). Gene positioning reflects physical interactions of chromosomal loci with nuclear structures like the nuclear lamina, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), or nuclear bodies, and changes in gene expression are often accompanied by changes in gene positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brickner, 2017</xref>). The positioning of genes can impact their transcription, mRNA processing, or chromatin modifications.</p><p>One model for such phenomena is the recruitment of genes to the nuclear periphery through interaction with the NPC. Many genes in budding yeast, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammals physically interact with NPCs, suggesting that the NPC plays an important role in determining the spatial arrangement of eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Capelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Casolari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ibarra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jacinto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Toda et al., 2017</xref>). This is particularly apparent in budding yeast where hundreds of genes interact with the NPC and inducible genes rapidly reposition to the nuclear periphery upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Casolari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Van de Vosse et al., 2013</xref>). Interaction with the NPC and localization to the nuclear periphery require specific transcription factors (TFs) and nuclear pore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dieppois et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dilworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lapetina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Luthra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Texari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Van de Vosse et al., 2013</xref>). A majority of yeast TFs can mediate interaction with the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that the yeast genome encodes spatial organization through <italic>cis</italic>-acting TF binding sites. Such <italic>cis-</italic>acting <italic>DNA zip codes</italic> are both necessary and sufficient to mediate interaction with the NPC and positioning to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, interaction with the NPC frequently leads to inter-chromosomal clustering of co-regulated genes, suggesting that it influences the spatial organization of the yeast genome at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mirkin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Much of the work on gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery has utilized static population measurements such as microscopy, chromatin immunoprecipitation, or HiC. Although these studies have revealed important players necessary for gene positioning to the nuclear periphery, there are questions that cannot be answered using static methods. For example, while some loci interact very stably with the nuclear envelope (e.g., telomeres and centromeres; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Heun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jin et al., 2000</xref>), leading to ~85% of cells showing colocalization of these loci with the nuclear envelope, genes that interact with the NPC show lower levels (~50–65%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>). This has been suggested to reflect transient interaction with the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>), cell-cycle regulation of peripheral localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brickner and Brickner, 2010</xref>), or, perhaps, two distinct populations, one that stably associates with the NPC and the other that does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, the repositioning of inducible genes from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery is not well-understood. Some data – including the involvement of nuclear actin and myosin – has suggested that repositioning to the NPC could involve directed, super-diffusive movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, while inter-chromosomal clustering is a widespread phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolou and Thanos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Homouz and Kudlicki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Noma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schoenfelder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>), relatively few studies have explored the dynamics of clustering over time and it is unclear if clustering reflects a stable physical interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dai et al., 2018</xref>). High-resolution, quantitative dynamics of chromatin diffusion are required to address each of these questions.</p><p>Chromatin is a mobile polymer, and individual loci exhibit constrained or anomalous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Bystricky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gasser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hajjoul et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Heun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>). Chromatin motion can reveal important aspects of the nuclear environment and the biophysical mechanisms that control the spatial organization of the genome. Repositioning to the NPC in budding yeast is an intriguing model for such studies because it is inducible, relatively rapid, controlled by well-understood DNA elements, and induces both a change in position and inter-chromosomal clustering.</p><p>Here we show that repositioning to the nuclear periphery is continuous and dynamic but uniform within the population, suggesting that, within each cell, localization to the periphery it is a probabilistic process. Localization at the nuclear periphery correlates with more constrained diffusion, as suggested by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Backlund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>). Using mean-squared displacement (MSD) analysis and molecular genetics, we pinpoint this effect to the interaction with the NPC. The parameters of sub-diffusion derived from MSD of nucleoplasmic loci were used to develop a computational simulation that faithfully recapitulates the behavior of such genes. This simulation was also adapted to model repositioning to the nuclear periphery through random sub-diffusion and transient capture at the nuclear envelope. The repositioning predicted by the simulation was then compared with several rapid repositioning experiments to determine whether it is vectorial or super-diffusive. The simulation matched the observed behavior of loci in cells, suggesting that repositioning from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery does not require directed movement.</p><p>Finally, we monitored the dynamics of inter-chromosomal clustering. Unlike pairs of simulated paths, genes that exhibit clustering remain near each other for tens of seconds and show correlated movement. Simulated interaction with the NPC, while sufficient to recapitulate the chromatin dynamics of individual loci, is not sufficient to recapitulate this correlated movement. Therefore, we propose that inter-chromosomal clustering relies on a distinct physical interaction between genes that can extend hundreds of nanometers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chromatin positioning to the nuclear periphery is continuous and dynamic</title><p>The localization of genes at the nuclear periphery can be followed in live yeast cells by tagging chromosomal loci of interest with an array of 128 Lac operators in a strain expressing GFP-Lac repressor (GFP-LacI) and quantifying its colocalization with mCherry-marked nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Egecioglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Robinett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Straight et al., 1996</xref>). In static confocal microscopy experiments, repositioning of inducible genes such as <italic>HIS4</italic> or <italic>INO1</italic> to the periphery leads to an increase in the fraction of cells in which the locus colocalizes with the nuclear envelope from that expected for a random distribution (~30%) to ~50–65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Egecioglu et al., 2014</xref>). However, artificially tethering chromatin to the nuclear envelope leads to ~85% colocalization with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>). This suggests that localization to the nuclear periphery reflects either dynamic or continuous interaction with the NPC or two distinct populations of cells, one that exhibits stable association with the nuclear envelope and the other that does not. To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantified peripheral localization of three LacO-tagged loci over time in individual cells: the inducible genes <italic>HIS4</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic>, as well as the negative control <italic>URA3</italic>, which localizes in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). To avoid the complication that interaction of many genes with the NPC is lost during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brickner and Brickner, 2010</xref>), cells were synchronized using nocodazole and released into G1 for 30 min before scoring colocalization with the nuclear envelope every 10 s over 10 min. In complete media (i.e., uninducing conditions), all three genes showed similar patterns: episodic, brief colocalization with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E, and F</xref>). However, under inducing conditions (−histidine for <italic>HIS4</italic> or −inositol for <italic>INO1</italic>), the pattern changed. Both <italic>HIS4</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic> showed longer periods of colocalization with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, F, and J</xref>), while <italic>URA3</italic> was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The pattern was consistent across the population, so that the fraction of cells in which <italic>HIS4</italic> or <italic>INO1</italic> colocalized with the nuclear envelope at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) was in close agreement with the fraction of time spent colocalized with the nuclear envelope in each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This argues against two distinct populations and instead suggests that interaction with the NPC is continuous and dynamic over time, increasing the duration of colocalization with the nuclear envelope.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Continuous and dynamic positioning at the nuclear periphery.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal micrographs of cells having the LacO array integrated at a locus of interest, expressing GFP-LacI and Pho88-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Robinett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>) and scored as either nucleoplasmic (left) or peripheral (right).

For comparison, we tracked the movement of the less-mobile nuclear envelope-embedded spindle pole body (SPB) and a much more mobile cytoplasmic particle (the µNS viral capsid; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). While µNS was highly diffusive, the SPB showed very limited displacement at this timescale, reflecting both slow diffusion within the membrane and movement of the whole nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The MSD of 11 nucleoplasmic loci (i.e., not associated with the NPC) and two telomeres tethered to the nuclear envelope exhibited a range of intermediate sub-diffusion between these two extremes, with the nucleoplasmic loci showing greater MSD than tethered telomeres and telomeres showing greater MSD than the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Simultaneously acquiring images of chromosomal loci and the SPB to correct for nuclear movement significantly reduced the time resolution (data not shown). Given that nuclear movement was much less than chromosomal movement at these timescales, it could be ignored. We also determined the MSD of chromosomal loci in 3D. Although this gave very similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the quality of the data was lower because of the longer time interval (&gt;1 s). For these reasons, we limited our movies for MSD analysis to 40 s at 210 ms resolution (200 × 0.21 s) in a single focal plane and calculated MSD for time intervals between 210 ms and 4 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mean-squared displacement (MSD) of chromatin sub-diffusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of fluorescent foci within the yeast cell.

Sub-diffusion of a segment of chromatin results from forces affecting the chromatin segment both directly (e.g., the viscoelastic potential of the polymer, boundary collision) and indirectly (forces and membrane tethering nearby; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). MSD for a Rouse polymer like chromatin reflects a relationship MSD(τ) = Γ(τα) for any time interval τ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Socol et al., 2019</xref>). Gamma (Γ) describes the diffusion coefficient, while an α exponent less than one reflects a hallmark for sub-diffusive movement: each step vector is anticorrelated with both the previous and subsequent steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lucas et al., 2014</xref>). While the exact value for α from different MSD experiments or different loci varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Backlund et al., 2014</xref>), work on multiple loci in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hajjoul et al., 2013</xref>) and our MSD data with nucleoplasmic loci (see Materials and methods) suggests that yeast chromatin has an <underline>average</underline> α = 0.52.</p><p>Chromatin sub-diffusion has been modeled using several approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Verdaasdonk et al., 2013</xref>). Anticorrelated movement cannot be reproduced through either a random walk or a simple process of weighted step sizes derived from our experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; uniform and Gaussian, respectively). However, a continuous-time Gaussian process known as fractional Brownian motion (FBM) produces trajectories that approximate chromatin sub-diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lucas et al., 2014</xref>). FBM produces non-independent steps across time, allowing us to impart the anticorrelation between individual steps that is characteristic of yeast chromatin sub-diffusion. For each trajectory, two numeric arrays for the x and y dimensions of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dietrich and Newsam, 1997</xref>) were generated based on an expected covariance matrix and α = 0.52. This array produces a stochastic time series of vectors with an anticorrelation structure functionally identical to that observed for chromatin movement. Finally, these vectors were scaled according to the experimentally derived Γ value and Hurst exponent (α/2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mandelbrot and Van Ness, 1968</xref>). Starting from random positions within the nucleus, the resulting array of discrete step lengths describes a single, two-dimensional sub-diffusive particle trajectory. This simple and rapid approach generates trajectories similar to our experimental observations and imparts memory resembling the MSD of chromosomal loci in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Paths generated by FBM suffer from one significant shortcoming. In an enclosed volume, FBM will deplete occupancy of particles near the boundary over time, resulting in a biased distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This phenomenon has also been reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vojta et al., 2020</xref>) and is not consistent with observations that chromosomal loci, unless associated with the nuclear envelope, localize at the nuclear periphery at a frequency expected from a random distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hediger et al., 2002</xref>). This may reflect a fundamental difference between sub-diffusion of particles and the apparent sub-diffusion of a segment of chromatin. We explored several methods to avoid depletion at the nuclear periphery and found that the following was effective: steps that would have taken the locus beyond the boundary were replaced with steps to the boundary along the same vector and, upon interaction with the boundary, the normalized, correlated noise for future steps was regenerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, FBM + regeneration).

One challenge with such experiments is that the time required for genes to reposition when cells are shifted from uninducing to inducing conditions is gene-specific and can be quite slow (e.g., t<sub>1/2</sub> ~ 30min; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that the rate-limiting step for repositioning often reflects the regulation of TFs that mediate repositioning, rather than the rate-limiting step for movement to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). To overcome this complication, we developed two approaches to maximize the rate of repositioning from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery. First, we arrested cells bearing <italic>URA3:GRS1-LacO</italic> with α-factor mating pheromone, which disrupts peripheral localization by inhibiting Cdk, which phosphorylates Nup1 and is required for peripheral localization of <italic>URA3:GRS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brickner and Brickner, 2010</xref>). Upon release from α-factor arrest, <italic>URA3:GRS1</italic> repositioned to the nuclear periphery within ~15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Tethering of a 27 amino acid ‘positioning domain’ from the Gcn4 TF (PD<sub>GCN4</sub>) near <italic>URA3</italic> using the LexA DNA binding domain (DBD) is sufficient to position <italic>URA3:LexABS</italic> at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, as a complementary approach, we used an optogenetic switch to recruit the PD<sub>GCN4</sub> to <italic>URA3</italic>, resulting in targeting to the nuclear periphery. Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) and cryptochrome interacting protein CIB1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> undergo rapid dimerization when exposed to 488 nm light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benedetti et al., 2018</xref>). In a strain having both the LacO array and the LexA binding site at <italic>URA3</italic>, CRY2-LexA DBD was co-expressed with CIB1-PD<sub>GCN4</sub> to generate a light-induced peripheral localization system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>). LexA DBD-Gcn4 served as a positive control and a mutant CIB1-pd<sub>GCN4</sub> that does not mediate interaction with the NPC served as a negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>). Cells were arrested, synchronized in G1, and illuminated with 488 nm light for 1 s pulses every 10 s over 10 min. Illumination resulted in rapid, PD<sub>GCN4</sub>-dependent repositioning to the nuclear periphery within ~7.5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, both the biological and the optogenetic stimuli led to rapid repositioning to the nuclear periphery with kinetics comparable to the simulation.</p><p>Having established that these two approaches lead to rapid peripheral localization, we then used particle tracking to define the nature of the movement during this transition. <italic>URA3</italic>, <italic>URA3:GRS1</italic>, or <italic>URA3:LexABS</italic> were tracked for 5 min at 0.5 s resolution (600 frames) during repositioning. For each movie, the position and time of initial colocalization with the nuclear envelope was recorded (if observed). While peripheral colocalization of <italic>URA3:GRS1</italic> and <italic>URA3:LexABS</italic>+CIB1-PD<sub>GCN4</sub> represents – at least some of the time – interaction with the NPC, peripheral colocalization of the negative controls does not. Therefore, we expected that if directed movement brings genes to the nuclear periphery, the positive and negative controls should show differences in the step velocities, time of arrival, or directness of the path preceding arrival at the nuclear periphery. For comparison, we also determined each of these parameters for paths generated by the default simulation and the simulation+zip code, which include no directed movement. The mean velocities for the simulations and experimental controls were statistically indistinguishable, ranging from 0.163 ± 0.10 µm s<sup>−1</sup> to 0.207 ± 0.13 µm s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; n = 6077–9724 steps per strain), suggesting that the speed of movement was not increased during peripheral repositioning. We did not observe significantly more large steps in the experimental movies than in the negative control movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The mean arrival time prior to initial contact with the nuclear envelope was also similar between the simulations and the experimental controls, ranging from 105 ± 49 s to 133 ± 54 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; n = 27–40 cells per strain), consistent with the predictions from the simulation. Finally, to assess whether any of the loci underwent processive, vectorial movement during translocation, we measured the radial deviation (θ) of each step from a direct path to the ultimate contact point at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Random sub-diffusion should produce an average θ of ~ π/2 = 1.57 radians, while directed movement would produce an average of ~0. The simulations were close to random, and while the experimental loci appear slightly more directed than random, the positive and negative controls were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that repositioning of chromatin from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery is likely due to random sub-diffusion and collision with the NPC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dynamics of inter-chromosomal clustering</title><p>Genes that interact with the yeast NPC can exhibit inter-allelic or inter-genic clustering with co-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brickner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>).

Perhaps interaction with the yeast NPC functions with other transcriptional regulators to stimulate transcriptional bursts.

The physical interaction between chromatin and the NPC, though transient, reduces chromatin sub-diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Backlund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>), independent of changes in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Using the parameters derived from MSD, we developed computational simulations for yeast chromatin sub-diffusion in the nucleoplasm and at the nuclear periphery. The anticorrelation between successive steps of chromatin and can be modeled as FBM (a.k.a. overdamped fractional Langevin motion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lucas et al., 2014</xref>). Sub-diffusion of yeast chromosomal loci is determined by the elastic response from the chromatin polymer and the viscous interaction between the polymer and the nucleoplasm. While we do not explicitly simulate the total chromatin polymer or other nuclear occupants, FBM captures their net effects, recapitulating the MSD behavior of a nucleoplasmic locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the FBM model leads to exclusion near boundaries, leading to non-random positioning of loci, a phenomenon that is not consistent with experimental observations. This likely reflects the fact that, while the motion of a segment of chromatin can be modeled as an FBM particle, it is part of a polymer and is not an FBM particle. Our solution to this shortcoming of the FBM model, recalculating the path upon collision with the nuclear boundary (see detailed explanation in Materials and methods), produced localization patterns and MSD behaviors that are consistent with experimental observations. However, additional theoretical and experimental work will help clarify the biological and physical significance of this modification.</p><p>To simulate the interaction of chromatin with the NPC, we allowed loci in an area within 50 nm of the nuclear boundary to ‘bind’ to the nuclear periphery, assuming the mobility of the SPB. The width of this annulus is roughly equal to the height of the NPC nuclear basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vallotton et al., 2019</xref>), whose components are required for chromatin association with the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). We independently optimized the probability of binding and of remaining bound by comparing the positioning and MSD of simulated paths with that conferred by a DNA zip code. This simple modification of the simulation was able to reliably recreate the peripheral localization and constraint on chromatin sub-diffusion caused by interaction with the NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the work described here provides a straightforward and powerful theoretical framework for modeling the biophysical nature of gene positioning through association with any stable nuclear structure.</p><p>Repositioning of genes to the NPC during transcriptional activation occurs over a wide range of timescales, depending on the stimulus and gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>), making it difficult to test whether it involves super-diffusive or vectorial movement. Our simulated trajectories offer an important insight; starting from random positions within the center of the yeast nucleus, the population shifted from a random distribution to a peripheral distribution within ~2 min by random sub-diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This timescale is comparable to the experimental models for peripheral repositioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), arguing that active mechanism(s) are unnecessary to explain the observed rate of repositioning. More importantly, experimental analysis of the speed and vector of individual steps preceding contact with the nuclear envelope showed non-vectorial sub-diffusive movement that was indistinguishable from that captured by the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, there was also no difference between experimental cells and negative control cells for these components. These results indicate that zip code-dependent gene localization results from random sub-diffusive chromatin movement, collision with the NPC, leading to dynamic binding. The recently discovered role for actin and Myo3 in localization of <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), raises an important question: how do these factors impact peripheral repositioning through a sub-diffusive mechanism? Our results suggest that loss of Myo3 delays arrival of some loci at the nuclear periphery but does not disrupt localization once it is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Perhaps, like actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kapoor et al., 2013</xref>), Myo3 impacts the function of chromatin remodeling complexes or histone-modifying enzymes, which regulate binding of transcription factors to DNA zip codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, perhaps actin/Myo3 act at the NPC to facilitate capture. A better biochemical and biophysical understanding of these processes will illuminate such possible roles.</p><p>Interaction with nuclear pore proteins plays a conserved role in promoting transcription. However, while interaction of yeast genes with nuclear pore proteins occurs at the nuclear periphery in association with the NPC, many genes in mammalian cells and <italic>Drosphila</italic> interact with soluble nuclear pore proteins in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Capelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Sub-diffusion for mammalian chromatin (which has been suggested to be less mobile than in yeast; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chubb et al., 2002</xref>) in a nucleus with a radius of 5 µm would make it impossible (on a biologically meaningful timescale) for loci in the center of the nucleus to reach the periphery. In larger nuclei, recruitment of nuclear pore proteins to sites of action, regardless of their position, likely overcomes this obstacle.</p><p>Inter-chromosomal clustering is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bantignies et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cook and Marenduzzo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eskiw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gehlen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Haeusler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Noma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ramos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taddei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xu and Cook, 2008</xref>).

Clustering persisted for 20–40 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and led to correlated movement between pairs of loci that were within 550 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, independently correlating step size and step angle is sensitive to correlations among pairs of loci in a subset of the cells in the population. Such correlated movement, averaged over the entire population, would be more difficult to appreciate. This may explain why previous work tracking movement of pairs of active <italic>GAL1-10</italic> alleles in yeast found little correlation in aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Backlund et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pairs of paths generated by either the simulation or the simulation+zip code do not lead to inter-chromosomal clustering, consistent with the observation that genes that interact with the NPC through different transcription factors do not exhibit clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, while clustering requires transcription factors and interaction with the NPC, it represents a distinct physical interaction. Surprisingly, correlated movement was observed between loci separated by hundreds of nanometers, suggesting that it reflects a large molecular complex, or more likely, an environment. Physical interactions that lead to phase separation could encompass groups of genes to create a (perhaps transient) nuclear sub-compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hult et al., 2017</xref>). This is reminiscent of superenhancers, which exist within phase-separated droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>) and are strongly associated with nuclear pore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ibarra et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that phase separation is facilitated by multivalent interactions between natively unstructured nuclear pore proteins, which are capable of forming phase-separated droplets in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>). Such conditional phase separation would be regulated and specified by transcription factors, and potentially other transcriptional complexes such as mediator or RNA polymerase II, to functionally compartmentalize the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals, reagents, and media</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted.

This simulation is governed by FBM, which gives rise to anomalous diffusion of the locus. Anomalous diffusion is distinct from Brownian diffusion due to a non-linear MSD over time, with distinct behaviors for the super-diffusive (α &gt; 1) vs. sub-diffusive (α &lt; 1) regimes. Free fitting our MSD measurements for 23 different loci/conditions, we found an average α = 0.52 (not shown), matching that determined in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hajjoul et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, for the simulations, we used α = 0.52. Following previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lucas et al., 2014</xref>), we present fractional Langevin dynamics simplified by the assumption of overdamping (i.e., no inertial term) and no driving force. In FBM, the statistical noise is a stationary Gaussian process with a mean equal to zero and a nonzero anticorrelation between successive steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Meyer et al., 1999</xref>). This property is exploited to allow random vector generation with a given correlation structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dietrich and Newsam, 1997</xref>). We draw values for each simulated dimension of movement to generate the entire time series for a trajectory. We re-scale the vectors to an appropriate magnitude for given time units equal to τ using a Γ parameter provided by non-linear regression on experimental MSD data (where MSD (τ) = Γ(τ<sup>0.52</sup>)). No additional complications in our computational model are required to reproduce experimental MSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>To properly simulate chromatin diffusion within the confines of the nucleus, we added an impassable boundary to serve as a nuclear membrane. Recent work on the behavior of FBM and the fractional Langevin equation in finite volumes of space showed that the presence of boundaries and the handling of those boundary conditions can affect the long-timescale distribution close to the edges of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guggenberger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vojta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vojta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wada and Vojta, 2018</xref>). These studies agree with our findings that in the sub-diffusive regime, depletion occurs at the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). This depletion at the periphery is rationalized by the fact that because successive steps are anticorrelated, a step that would take the particle over the boundary is likely to be followed by one which would take it away from it. Such depletion is not observed in experimental distributions of control and non-control specimens. It is possible that the physicochemical landscape of the periphery or the region near the periphery involves many interactions which have the effect of attracting the chromatin locus to the periphery, but such effects are not evident in the aforementioned studies (which do not consider transient binding interactions with a hard wall). Because our particle is actually a segment of a much larger polymer, we instead decided to regenerate the underlying noise time series whenever the trajectory collides with the periphery to negate the effects of prior movement. This adaptation succeeded in creating a uniform distribution of positions across the nucleus. However, we acknowledge that our theoretical particle no longer satisfies the fluctuation dissipation theorem inherent to all Brownian motion, including FBM. Additional investigation of the behavior of chromatin at the boundary in silica and in vivo will help clarify the validity of this modification.</p><p>Binding of chromatin to NPCs was modeled using a simple two-state Markov model wherein a locus within the peripheral region (an annulus extending 50 nm from the nuclear boundary) can assume a bound state in the next step with a defined probability. Particles bound to the NPC remain bound at a second defined probability for every step until it becomes unbound. A particle bound to the NPC is assumed to be interacting strongly with an NPC, their motion is inhibited, but not entirely arrested. We therefore scaled the step sizes of particles in the bound state with Γ and α parameters derived from non-linear regression of the MSD for the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In this way, we simulate the effective ‘pausing’ of chromatin motion due to NPC interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Source code</title><p>Our simulation data and source code are openly available.

live imaging studies to investigate the process of gene re-localization to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast. The study reveals gene re-positioning to the NPC can be explained by sub-diffusive Brownian motion of loci followed by capture at the NPC rather than through a directed mechanism. The authors also provide new insights into the dynamics underlying the clustering of co-regulated genes. The data and analysis are well-presented and support the authors' conclusions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Random sub-diffusion and capture of genes by the nuclear pore reduces dynamics and coordinates interchromosomal movement&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kerry Bloom (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers felt it important to address more explicitly the interplay between the position of the locus within the nucleus and its dynamics. For example, although Figure 2 and 3 show that in activating conditions (-inositol or – histidine), the MSD measurements for INO1 or HIS4 or GCN4 decline (suggesting that nuclear pore contact/tethering leads to reduced movement) this is not further demonstrated more directly by correlating gene position and MSD. Can the authors assess whether loci at the nuclear periphery actually move less than those in the nuclear interior? Although nup2delta mutants in Figure 3 provide further evidence for this, it would be a nice addition to the paper if the relationship between position and movement/MSD were shown more explicitly. This information could likely be gleaned from existing data. An important consideration in this context relates to the resolution of the light microscope and the ability to perceive whether a locus is &quot;at&quot; the periphery. Based on their simulations, can the authors address how this does or does not influence the precision or accuracy of the analysis? The authors decide on 50 nm as their band of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; steps in the simulations based on the dimensions of the basket of the NPC, but how are considerations of the microscope resolution accounted for when comparing experiment and theory?</p><p>2. On the surface the presented model is somewhat at odds with the recently published report by Wang et al. (Dev Cell 2020, PMID: 31902656), which concludes that peripheral targeting of INO1 depends on a myosin motor and nuclear actin and associated machinery. This should be more directly addressed in the manuscript. Best would be the addition of data in which the authors test the effect of some of these factors in their system and with their measurement. Expansion on this point highlights two other issues for the authors to consider: a) the importance of what can and cannot be gleaned from different approaches (MSD measurements versus population analysis of &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; the periphery); and b) how a boost in diffusive motion OR directed motion could both influence the ultimate association of a locus with the nuclear periphery. Although the authors present clear evidence against a role for directed motion, the authors also argue against an increase in diffusive motion based on the MSD under conditions that lead to peripheral interactions. However, there does seem to be a trend towards a boost in mobility in an undirected fashion that could still contribute to the kinetics of these processes. Given evidence that transcriptional activation can increase locus mobility from yeast to human cells, it would also extend the study to explore (in simulations) how much of an effect on the kinetics of movement to the periphery would be expected from different extents of such a boost. In other words, could a small (perhaps even insignificant boost based on the errors of the measurements) have a meaningful effect? If not, how much of a boost would be needed? Greater exploration and discussion of these possibilities would be informative for the field.</p><p>3. The reviewers questioned whether the data on gene clustering added value to the manuscript, as this aspect of the work was found to be under-developed. The model as applied does not explain the inter-chromosomal clustering (Figure 6). Although informative, how then does binding the NPC dictate clustering? This line of investigation would be made much richer if greater use of modeling could reveal additional parameters that can recapitulate (at least to some extent) the Nup-dependent clustering of genes/alleles. Alternatively, the authors could perhaps further speculate on or test the potential additional forces that drive such clustering. Several studies on clustering chromatin regions indicate these are local interactions (e.g. condensin/transcription factors, Cera et al., 10.1128/mSphere.00063-19 ; Hult et al., doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx741.).</p><p>4. The reviewers suggest that the authors expand their discussion and citation of the value for α. Studies from Mikael P. Backlund, Ryan Joyner, Karsten Weis, and W. E. Moerner https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e14-06-1127 report the value for α to be 0.6-0.75 in yeast (the same system) and from Weber and Theriot (Weber SC, Spakowitz AJ, Theriot JA (2010) Bacterial chromosomal loci move subdiffusively through a viscoelastic cytoplasm.) to be 0.39 in bacterial systems. This is consistent with the notion that α may realize distinct values at different time scales; the value that they find works well to describe their observations is reasonable but may not always apply to all conditions.</p><p>5. Prior work from the Zimmer group argues that there is an effect of the chromosome length in which a locus resides given the impact of the centromeric and telomeric tethers. Do the authors see evidence of this (or in other words, are the loci investigated here on larger chromosomes?). Did the authors consider/explore including such tethers in their simulations?</p><p>6. There were several suggestions for greater precision in the language used in the manuscript, including: a) The authors state that zip codes are necessary and sufficient to &quot;cause&quot; peripheral localization, which implies that zip codes drive an active transport mechanism. As the mechanism the authors describe is a random sub-diffusive motion with the zip codes conferring increased dwell time of given loci at the nuclear envelope, stating that zip codes stabilize what would otherwise be very transient interactions would be more appropriate rather than suggesting they direct the localization; b) The reviewers suggest that the authors take greater care with the terms &quot;passive&quot; (p. 14 bottom) and &quot;random&quot;. As shown in the Theriot work and many others, these processes are ATP dependent. Motion is severely curtailed upon ATP depletion. It is the case that the motion is random, that does not mean it is passive. In the Introduction the statement that repositioning does not require an active mechanism should also be qualified; active processes contribute to the kinetics and extent of random motion as evidenced by the decrease in MSD in cells depleted for ATP. The authors should clarify that active motion need not equate to a super-diffusive, vectorial mechanism.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript explores the mechanisms that govern the movement of gene loci between the nucleoplasm and the nuclear periphery as well as the clustering of gene loci that share common transcriptional activators. The study provides evidence that association of genes with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) or nuclear periphery occurs through a stochastic, constrained diffusion followed by capture that depresses further dynamics of the locus. Clustering of genes under control of a common transcription factor appears to be a distinct process, likely mediated by physical interactions between clustered loci.The authors address the question of whether the behavior of such loci is ergodic – that is, does variation manifest uniformly across the population or are there distinct states in individual cells that contribute, concluding that there is uniform behavior across the population. The MSD analysis and simulations concur on this point and also argue against directed motion. Using a number of genetic tricks they uncover evidence for a constrained diffusion followed by capture model that is unaffected by transcriptional activity. With regards to gene clustering, the investigators argue that such clustering events, although often occurring coincident with recruitment to the nuclear periphery, instead reflects a distinct, likely physical, mechanism.</p><p>Overall this is a careful, mechanistically dissected study and the conclusions are well supported by the data. The combination of experimental approaches and simulations is a strength. There are an important inference from these observations, namely that association with the NPC, rather than driving a specific state, instead can contribute to the constraint of a locus in the (larger volume of) nuclear periphery more generally. Another key question in the field, particularly given the broad observation that chromatin dynamics are influenced by the depletion of ATP, has been whether there is a role for actively-driven, directed motion of chromatin to the nuclear periphery and/or NPC – on this point the data is unequivocal, at least for any type of directed motion. The molecular dissection of the contributions to localization and MSD in response to stimuli is impressive and highlights what can be determined in budding yeast relative to other models. In particular, the kinetics of how long it takes for a locus to diffuse and be captured takes is revealing and is supported by experimental observations using the optogenetic approach.</p><p>I have some points for the authors to consider further, listed below.</p><p>1. The resolution of the light microscope must enter into the ability to perceive whether a locus is &quot;at&quot; the periphery. Based on the simulations, can the authors address how this does or does not enter into the analysis? The authors decide on 50 nm as their band of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; steps in the simulations based on the dimensions of the basket of the NPC, but how are considerations of the microscope resolution accounted for when comparing experiment and theory?</p><p>2. In Figure 2C what does the line represent a theoretical relationship or the best fit of the data?</p><p>3. The authors comment on page 19 about how their observations could be extended to considerations of chromatin movement in the much larger volume of the mammalian nucleus, but putting numbers on this based on their simulation would be very helpful and would extend the study.</p><p>4. Prior work from the Zimmer group argues that there is an effect of the chromosome length in which a locus resides given the impact of the centromeric and telomeric tethers. Do the authors see evidence of this (or in other words, are the loci investigated here on larger chromosomes?). Did the authors consider/explore including such tethers in their simulations?</p><p>5. In addition to the clear data against a role for directed motion, the authors also argue against an increase in diffusive motion based on the MSD under conditions that lead to peripheral interactions.

In other words, could a small (perhaps even insignificant boost based on the errors of the measurements) have a meaningful effect? If not, how much of a boost would be needed?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Sumner et al., the authors combine live imaging and computational simulation to investigate the process of gene re-localization to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast. The authors characterize movement dynamics of genes, previously shown to re-position to the NPC from the nuclear interior upon activation, using the lacO tagging system and mean square displacement (MSD) analysis. They find that genes exhibit transient interactions with the NPC in both induced and uninduced conditions, but that such interactions become more lasting upon activation. Importantly, gene sub-diffusion appears to be reduced by interactions with the NPC, in a way that is not explained by just transcriptional activation.</p><p>The authors proceed to successfully model such gene movement and re-positioning, and conclude that gene targeting to the NPC can be explained by sub-diffusive Brownian motion of loci followed by capture at the NPC, as opposed to an active directed mechanism of re-localization. This is an interesting and important conclusion, particularly in light of recently published evidence that nuclear actin and myosin are involved in gene movement to the NPC. The authors' approach also suggests that unlike reported movement of damaged loci, which has been shown to occur in a directed nuclear actin-dependent manner, activated genes re-localize primarily through random movement and collision-capture at the NPC.</p><p>On the other hand, the authors' modeling was not found to recapitulate the NPC-mediated inter-chromosomal clustering of genes (previously reported for genes or alleles targeted by the same transcription factor). The authors conclude that gene clustering must involve additional forces not accounted for in their modeling.</p><p>Overall, the experiments and analysis appear very rigorous, and the conclusions are impactful, introducing new insight into how active genes re-localize within nuclear space. The presented model will be important for future consideration of other contexts of gene and chromosome movement.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. Figure 2 and 3 show that in activating conditions (-inositol or – histidine), the MSD measurements for INO1 or HIS4 or GCN4:BS decline, suggesting that nuclear pore contact/tethering leads to reduced movement. This is however not demonstrated more directly though correlating gene position of the gene and MSD. Can the authors assess whether loci at the nuclear periphery actually move less than those in the nuclear interior? Although nup2delta mutants in Figure 3 provide further evidence for this, it would be a nice addition to the paper if the relationship between position and movement/MSD were shown more explicitly. This information may already be in the existing live imaging videos.</p><p>2. Since the presented model is somewhat at odds with the recently published report by Wang et al. (Dev Cell 2020, PMID: 31902656) that peripheral targeting of INO1 depends on a myosin motor and nuclear actin and associated machinery, can the authors test the effect of some of these factors in their system and with their measurements? It would be informative for the field to know whether perhaps it is the reduced movement of such genes at the NPC or the capture by the NPC that is primarily affected by the myosin/actin machinery.</p><p>3. The title states that &quot;…capture of genes by the nuclear pore.…coordinates interchromosomal movement&quot;, yet sub-diffusion and NPC interactions do not seem to explain inter-chromosomal clustering in the presented modeling (Figure 6). Although this is likely not trivial, can the authors attempt to add a modeling parameter that can at least partially reflect the Nup-dependent clustering of genes/alleles? This is certainly not a requirement for publication in my opinion, but it would make this portion of the paper more developed (since currently it reads somewhat underdeveloped). Alternatively, the authors could perhaps further speculate on or test the potential additional forces that drive such clustering.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript follows up work from the investigators' laboratory on the interaction of gene loci with the nuclear envelop. In this manuscript they address the mechanism that drives the interaction and find that it can be explained by sub-diffusive motion, that has been well-characterized at this point for chromosomes in living cells. From the polymer physics perspective, this is entirely consistent with the statistical mechanics of these systems. The work does not preclude findings in the literature that point to active, vectorial processes in specific cases.</p><p>The authors state that zip codes are necessary and sufficient to &quot;cause&quot; peripheral localization. This implies the zip codes are part of the transport mechanism. My understanding is that mechanism is a random sub-diffusive motion, and the zip codes increase the dwell time of a given loci to the nuclear envelop. The zip codes don't cause the localization, they stabilize what would otherwise be very transient interactions.</p><p>I would caution the authors in citing one value for α. Studies from Mikael P.

This is not particularly surprising based on several papers in the literature that recapitulate the motion of loci within a chromosome (Verdaasdonk et al., Mol. Cell 2013) and nuclear motion (Arbona et al., Genome Biology, 2017). One needs to be cautious about stating these are &quot;passive&quot; processes (p. 14 bottom). As shown in the Theriot work and many others, these processes are ATP dependent. Motion is severely curtailed upon ATP depletion. It is the case that the motion is random, that does not mean it is passive.</p><p>The last figure on clustering raises questions outside the scope of this paper. The authors state that binding the nuclear pore is required for clustering, but it is unclear how binding the pore dictates clustering. Several studies on clustering chromatin regions indicate these are local interactions (e.g. condensin/transcription factors, Cera et al., 10.1128/mSphere.00063-19 ; Hult et al., doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx741.).</p><p>I found the data to be very well done and support the authors claims.

First, to clarify our methods, based on our microscopy experiments, we assume that the resolution of our images leads to scoring of a locus as colocalized with the nuclear envelope if it is within 150nm. For our simulations, we assume that the physical interaction with the NPC can only occur if the locus is within 50nm of the nuclear envelope but we score any locus that is within 150nm of the membrane was scored as peripheral. This was described in the manuscript, but we have made it more explicit in multiple locations in the Results section.</p><p>Second, we attempted to use our videos to analyze individual steps that occur at the nuclear periphery. This necessitated automating the tracking and gene localization scoring. We were successful in automating the localization scoring and the tracking for these experiments and we validated that the new method produces tracking data very similar to our original method (Figure 2 Supplement 1A). This new tracking method also recapitulated the MSD change upon activation of <italic>INO1</italic> (Figure 2 Supplement 1B). We found that analyzing MSD of individual steps was challenging because individual step sizes are very small, making the measurements more error-prone and the differences less obvious than when examining multiple time intervals. Therefore, to address the reviewers’ question, we exploited the heterogeneity within the population (as demonstrated in Figure 1) to separately analyze the MSD (over multiple time intervals) from cells in which the locus was stably at the nuclear periphery and cells in which the locus was mostly in the nucleoplasm. When such analysis was performed for repressed <italic>INO1</italic>, we observed no difference in MSD between these two populations (Figure 2 Supplement 1C). However, when such analysis was performed for active <italic>INO1</italic>, the cells in which the locus was stably maintained at the nuclear periphery over most of the 40s video showed significantly lower MSD than cells in which the locus was mostly nucleoplasmic (Figure 2 Supplement 1D). This, combined with our genetic experiments showing that loss of Nup2 leads to an increase in MSD for active genes, supports our model that interaction with the NPC is responsible for the drop in sub-diffusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Our experiments clarify the nature of the defect of <italic>myo3</italic> mutants in repositioning of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery. We find that loss of Myo3 due to either deletion of the gene or degradation of Myo3 using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) slows the rate at which the population shifts to the nuclear periphery upon activation of <italic>INO1</italic> (Figure 5 Supplement 1A and B). Importantly, this defect is specific to one (GRS1) of the two DNA zip codes that mediate repositioning of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery, which we can observe by inserting <italic>INO1</italic> with GRS1 but lacking GRS2 at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus (<italic>URA3:INO1</italic>). When both zip codes (GRS1 and GRS2) are present at the endogenous <italic>INO1</italic> gene, loss of Myo3 had no effect. GRS1-mediated repositioning of <italic>URA3:INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery occurs after 3-6h, instead of ~1h. Finally, once positioned at the nuclear periphery, <italic>URA3:INO1</italic> localization was unaffected by degradation of Myo3-AID (Figure 5 Supplement 1C).</p><p>These results suggest that Myo3 is either impacting the GRS1-dependent movement of <italic>URA3:INO1</italic> from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery or that it is impacting other regulatory steps that are necessary for GRS1-mediated peripheral localization.</p><p>We also measured MSD of <italic>URA3:INO1</italic> under repressing, activating (1h) and activating (overnight) conditions.

Although the authors present clear evidence against a role for directed motion, the authors also argue against an increase in diffusive motion based on the MSD under conditions that lead to peripheral interactions. However, there does seem to be a trend towards a boost in mobility in an undirected fashion that could still contribute to the kinetics of these processes. Given evidence that transcriptional activation can increase locus mobility from yeast to human cells, it would also extend the study to explore (in simulations) how much of an effect on the kinetics of movement to the periphery would be expected from different extents of such a boost. In other words, could a small (perhaps even insignificant boost based on the errors of the measurements) have a meaningful effect? If not, how much of a boost would be needed?

We have tested if our observed MSD behavior is compatible with a small increase in chromatin dynamics using our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).
