multinucleated muscle fibers (myofibers) whose myonuclei are regularly positioned all along the myofiber’s periphery except the few ones clustered underneath the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) at the synaptic zone. This precise myonuclei organization is altered in different types of muscle disease, including centronuclear myopathies (CNMs). However, the molecular machinery regulating myonuclei position and organization in mature myofibers remains largely unknown. Conversely, it is also unclear how peripheral myonuclei positioning is lost in the related muscle diseases. Here, we describe the microtubule-associated protein, MACF1, as an essential and evolutionary conserved regulator of myonuclei positioning and maintenance, in cultured mammalian myotubes, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle, and in adult mammalian muscle using a conditional muscle-specific knockout mouse model. In vitro, we show that MACF1 controls microtubules dynamics and contributes to microtubule stabilization during myofiber’s maturation. In addition, we demonstrate that MACF1 regulates the microtubules density specifically around myonuclei, and, as a consequence, governs myonuclei motion. Our in vivo studies show that MACF1 deficiency is associated with alteration of extra-synaptic myonuclei positioning and microtubules network organization, both preceding NMJ fragmentation. Accordingly, MACF1 deficiency results in reduced muscle excitability and disorganized triads, leaving voltage-activated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and maximal muscle force unchanged. Finally, adult MACF1-KO mice present an improved resistance to fatigue correlated with a strong increase in mitochondria biogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>muscle fiber</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Programme AVENIR 2014 (ATIP-Avenir)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R14074CS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gache</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004923</institution-id><institution>AFM-Téléthon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alliance MyoNeurAlp</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gache</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maintenance of peripheral myonuclei patterning in skeletal myofibers is dependent on the regulation of microtubules dynamic and nuclei motion and is essential for proper neuromuscular junction integrity and mitochondria homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout skeletal muscle development, myonuclei actively move to settle at specific locations in the fully differentiated muscle fibers (myofibers) where they are regularly spaced along the longitudinal fiber axis, sitting at the periphery underneath the surface membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roman and Gomes, 2018</xref>). The density of myonuclei along myofibers’ length remains relatively constant with the exception of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where ~5–6 myonuclei (synaptic myonuclei) are clustered immediately below the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruusgaard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manhart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ravel-Chapuis et al., 2007</xref>). Failure in proper extra-synaptic myonuclei patterning has been linked to different myopathies and muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falcone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perillo and Folker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roman et al., 2017</xref>). This precise organization is correlated with a particular ‘flatten’ shape of the myonuclei, whose alteration has recently emerged as a potential contributor to several muscular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janin and Gache, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Norton and Phillips-Cremins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Puckelwartz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Proteins localized inside myonuclei such as Lamin A/C, Emerin, or Nuclear Envelope Proteins (NEPs), connect the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton through the ‘LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton’ (LINC) complex, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of myonuclei shape and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Burke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mattioli et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, molecular motors and Microtubule-Associated Proteins (MAPs), in interaction with actin/microtubule networks, are also involved in myonuclei localization during muscle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gache et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rivero et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, the specific localization and shape of myonuclei, determined by mechanical forces emanating from different cytoskeleton networks, act directly on chromatin organization and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chojnowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirby and Lammerding, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ramdas and Shivashankar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robson et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, how myonuclei positioning in mature myofibers is set and how it regulates the signaling pathways maintaining myofiber integrity is still poorly understood.</p><p>To identify proteins involved in the maintenance of myonuclei positioning, we used an in vitro primary myotubes/myofibers culture system and identified MACF1 (Microtubule Actin Crosslinking Factor 1) as a regulator of myonuclei positioning during the late phases of myofiber maturation. MACF1 is a member of the spectraplakin family of proteins. It is a huge protein composed of multiple domains that allow its interaction with actin filaments and microtubules to stabilize them as adhesion structures in a variety of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kodama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sanchez-Soriano et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>MACF1</italic> gene duplication (resulting in a decrease of MACF1 protein) is linked with a neuromuscular disease condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jørgensen et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>MACF1</italic> variants are associated with congenital myasthenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oury et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologous, VAB-10 and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologous, Shot, are essential for nuclei migration in distal tip cells of the somatic gonad and myotendinous junction formation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, Shot was proposed to contribute to the formation and maintenance of a perinuclear shield in muscle from drosophila larvae, contributing to myonuclei localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Volk, 2015</xref>). However, the analysis of MACF1 functions in the control of extra-synaptic myonuclei position and muscle homeostasis is still pending.</p><p>Here, using in vitro and in vivo models, we report that MACF1 is important for the maintenance of myonuclei patterning in mammalian myofibers. MACF1 contributes to extra-synaptic myonuclei motion and positioning through the regulation of microtubules dynamics. We also reveal that MACF1 is essential for proper NMJ formation and mitochondria homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MACF1 uses microtubules to set myonuclei spreading during myofibers maturation</title><p>To identify new factors that contribute to myonuclei spreading in myofibers, we purified proteins able to bind to Taxol-stabilized microtubules from 3 days primary mouse myotubes and 13 days differentiated myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The major Microtubule-Associated-Proteins (MAPs) identified by mass-spectrometry using this protocol revealed the significant presence of MACF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). MACF1 is a member of the spectraplakin family known to play an architectural role through regulation of the spatial arrangement and function of specific organelles such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyer et al., 2010</xref>). MACF1 is a large protein mainly described as a cytoskeleton linker that binds and aligns microtubules and actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Preciado López et al., 2014</xref>). In developing myofibers, actin is actively involved in myoblasts fusion and contributes to sarcomere formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sanger et al., 2010</xref>) while microtubules actively participate in myofiber elongation and myonuclei spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). Although MACF1 was initially described to be predominantly expressed in neurons and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernier et al., 2000</xref>), its role in muscle fibers remains elusive. We first addressed the localization of MACF1 in mature myofibers formed in vitro. Our immunofluorescence approach revealed a dotted pattern all along the myofibers that mainly colocalized with its cortical microtubule network, in agreement with our mass-spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of importance, MACF1 accumulates preferentially around the peripheral myonuclei in mature myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, zoom panels). Conversely, MACF1 is clearly excluded from actin network structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MACF1 is an essential regulator of myonuclei positioning in mature myofibers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme presentation of the sequential steps to obtain immature myotubes and mature myofibers from primary mouse myoblasts.

Mouse <italic>Macf1</italic> mRNA was previously shown to increase steadily during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leung et al., 1999</xref>). We first observed an absence of MACF1 in proliferating myoblasts and confirmed a burst of MACF1 protein expression during the early steps of myotubes formation using primary mouse myoblasts cells and the C2C12 myogenic cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). MACF1 expression was dramatically reduced upon transfection of siRNA or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the MACF1 mRNA compared to their respective scrambled (Scr) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). MACF1 down-regulation had no impact on myotubes formation and architecture, as reflected by the unaffected ratio of myotube length to myonuclei content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). In accordance, neither myonuclei distribution as assessed by the mean distance between myonuclei and myotube’s centroid nor the statistical distribution of myonuclei along myotubes length were affected following MACF1 down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). These results were confirmed in C2C12 myotubes cells where no alteration in myonuclei spreading was observed following MACF1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the implication of MACF1 in mature myofibers, primary mouse myotubes were maintained in differentiation media for 10 additional days using a protocol that allows myofibrillogenesis, sarcomeric structures formation and peripheral myonuclei adopting a flatten architecture and regular spreading along myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falcone et al., 2014</xref>). This long-term differentiation approach showed that MACF1 depletion did not impact the global maturation of myofibers, as reflected by homogeneous myofibers width and unaffected actin network striation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Yet, when addressing the global integrity of the microtubule network in these mature myofibers by immunofluorescence, we found a 50% decrease of the microtubule staining intensity in the vicinity of the myonuclei perimeter and an apparently less dense cortical network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). Accordingly, myonuclei shape was much rounder in MACF1-depleted condition, as appreciated by a significant reduction of the myonuclei feret diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As microtubules are used in developing myofibers by multiple molecular motors to determine myonuclei spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gache et al., 2017</xref>), we investigated the impact of MACF1 depletion on this process and observed a significant reduction in the mean distance between adjacent myonuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) in MACF1-depleted myotubes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MACF1 controls microtubules dynamics and myonuclei motion in developing muscle fibers</title><p>To better understand the localization of MACF1, as driven by its Microtubule Binding Domain (MTBD), we expressed only the MTBD of MACF1 in immature primary myotubes and in mature primary myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

We thus questioned, in our system, how microtubule dynamics evolve during the myofibers maturation steps and whether MACF1 depletion impacts this process. To study the microtubule network dynamics in developing myofibers, we used the tracking of a fluorescently-tagged End Binding protein member (EB3) at different time points during maturation of in vitro primary myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). During myofibers maturation process, EB3-comets speed was relatively constant (≈ 19 μm/min) until 5 days of maturation. After this time point, EB3-comets speed decreased significantly, reflecting a progressive downturn in microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oddoux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the velocity of EB3 comets was increased by 15% upon MACF1 downregulation and remained high (≈ 23 μm/min) all along the process of myofibers maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with a role for MACF1 in the regulation of microtubule polymerization, mainly as a stabilization factor. As myonuclei preferentially use the microtubule network to move longitudinally along myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gache et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>), we next investigated the impact of the increase in microtubule dynamics on myonuclei movements during myofibers maturation. Just before fusion, myoblasts were co-transfected with the lamin-chromobody to visualize myonuclei concomitantly with a shRNA targeting either a scramble sequence or <italic>Macf1,</italic> and a GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

In control conditions, myonuclei spent 32% of the time in motion at a median speed of 0.16 μm/min, resulting in a displacement of 24 μm after 14 hr (more than twice bigger than the mean myonuclei feret). Interestingly, in the absence of MACF1, the median velocity of myonuclei was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) but the percentage of time that myonuclei spent in motion was doubled, reaching 66% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Accordingly, the median motion pause was 530 min in the control conditions while it fell down to 330 min in the absence of MACF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

To quantify the spatial disorganization of the microtubule network, we used a texture detection tool (TeDT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu and Ralston, 2014</xref>). Our data show that the longitudinal microtubule network is the most affected regardless of the age of the animals (2-, 6-, or 12-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>)), in agreement with the loss of MACF1 staining in the <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ muscle myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Altogether, these evidences demonstrate that MACF1 stabilizes the microtubule network during myofibers maturation.</p><p>MACF1 can modulate microtubule dynamics through the interaction with different partners such as CLAPS2, EB1, CAMSAP3, Nesprin, Map1B, ErbB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Noordstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pereira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ryan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zaoui et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, microtubules are subject to a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are associated with changes in microtubules dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nieuwenhuis and Brummelkamp, 2019</xref>). Among these, tubulin de-tyrosination is associated with longer-living microtubules, whereas dynamic microtubules are mainly tyrosinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulinski and Gundersen, 1991</xref>). To further investigate the role of MACF1 in the long-term balance of microtubule dynamic in myofibers, we addressed the microtubule tyrosination/de-tyrosination status in muscles from our conditional-KO and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). In <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre- muscle fibers, tyrosinated tubulin is found all along microtubules and in the vicinity of myonuclei along myofibers. Conversely, de-tyrosinated tubulin was found preferentially in the vicinity of myonuclei. While in <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ muscles, there was no change in the tyrosinated tubulin pattern, de-tyrosinated tubulin staining at myonuclei periphery was either severely reduced or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, arrows).

With respect to myofiber size, no significant alteration was detected in the cross-sectional area (CSA) in <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> muscles from 3-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

We observed a progressive recruitment of myonuclei underneath the NMJ in <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> myofibers of control mice with age, concomitant with an enlargement of the area occupied by AChRs. In control mice, the number of synaptic myonuclei increased from approximately 7 at 2 months of age to 11 at 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In MACF1-depleted myofibers (<italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+), there was no new recruitment of synaptic myonuclei over the same period and the number of synaptic myonuclei remains close to 7 from 2- to 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As we identified that microtubule network is altered along muscle fibers in MACF1-depleted condition, we analyzed the potential changes in tyrosinated/de-tyrosinated tubulin distribution at the NMJ. Surprisingly, tubulin accumulation was not observed around the synaptic myonuclei of control myofibers, in contrast with the pattern observed at extra-synaptic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Instead, we detected tubulin accumulation close to the NMJ site of MACF1 mutant mice with a blurry patterning. Nonetheless, de-tyrosinated tubulin accumulation appeared highly correlated with AChRs staining even when AChR clusters were fragmented in the conditional-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, arrows). Finally, the ratio of both tyrosinated and de-tyrosinated tubulin vs total tubulin at NMJs were not different between <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre- and <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This suggests that the role of MACF1 at the NMJ is not related to myonuclei clustering nor to the control of microtubule dynamics but is instead associated with AChRs clustering.</p><p>To further check that synaptic myonuclei location does not depend on MACF1, we used a sciatic nerve crush protocol to induce denervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milanic et al., 1999</xref>).

There was an increase in the total amount of mitochondria (Tom20 relative to actin) in total protein extracts from <italic>Gastrocnemius</italic> of 12-month-old <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ mice, as compared to control mice. However, there were no changes in the levels of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins (CI, II, III, IV, and V, relative to Tom20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To confirm the increase of mitochondria pool, we measured the ratio of Mitochondrial-DNA to Genomic-DNA. This ratio did not differ between young (3-month-old) and adult (12-month-old) control mice, nor did it between young <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, adult <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ mice showed an increased amount of mitochondrial DNA compared to the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To understand this phenomenon, we followed the expression level of different genes known to contribute to mitochondria fusion/fission/biogenesis such as <italic>DNM1, DNM2, PPARGC1A</italic> and <italic>SLN.</italic> Remarkably, we found that only the expression of Sarcolipin, known to promote mitochondria biogenesis in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maurya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>) was increased in <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We next checked the staining of Cytochrome C, indicative of mitochondria content and spatial organization, in myofibers isolated from <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> muscles from 12-month-old mice. Our immunofluorescence approach showed a strong accumulation of mitochondria in different areas at the periphery of myofibers from the conditional-KO mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, arrow). Additionally, there was an accumulation of mis-oriented longitudinal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), reminiscent of what was observed with the T-tubules staining in certain <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This suggests an alteration of myofibrils cohesion at the periphery of the myofibers. In this view, since mitochondria are linked to both the microtubule network and to Desmin intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reipert et al., 1999</xref>), we questioned the integrity of the Desmin network and found a similar disruption as observed for mitochondria staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). Electron microscopy was next used to visualize the ultrastructure of mitochondria in <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> muscle of <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ mice. This approach confirmed the increase in mitochondria content in <italic>Macf1</italic> Cre+ myofibers, associated with the presence of spherical mitochondria in-between myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). We next questioned if the mitochondrial network distribution was altered in vitro, in primary myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). In myofibers treated with scrambled siRNA/shRNA, mitochondria lined up in the bulk of myofibers, in-between myofibrils, where they followed the longitudinal axis, just like the microtubule network. However, in <italic>Macf1</italic> siRNA/shRNA-treated myofibers, we observed a 30% increase of mitochondria content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). These results confirmed a role of MACF1 in muscles specifically related to mitochondria biogenesis. Consequently, MACF1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondria biogenesis as loss of MACF1 is associated with an increase in Sarcolipin level and redistribution of mitochondrial content.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Different mechanisms involving actin and microtubule network control myonuclei positioning during muscle fiber development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azevedo and Baylies, 2020</xref>). However, the long-term mechanisms allowing myonuclei patterning maintenance in mature muscle fibers are still pending. The present study describes a MACF1-dependent pathway that is critical for proper myonuclei distribution at the periphery of the myofibers, through the ability of MACF1 to control microtubule network dynamics. MACF1 is a giant member of the spectraplakin family, able to simultaneously bind to different cytoskeleton members. Spectraplakins are involved in intracellular trafficking, cellular polarization migration and shaping, cell-cell adhesion and mechanical strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suozzi et al., 2012</xref>). In mononuclear cells, MACF1 acts as a hub between the actin and microtubule networks to promote their alignment, allowing cells structure maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Preciado López et al., 2014</xref>). In skeletal muscle, MACF1 has been implicated in the integrity of the NMJ through its association with rapsyn and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antolik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oury et al., 2019</xref>). Shot, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue participates in the formation and maintenance of a perinuclear shield in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Still, MACF1 function in muscle remained puzzling as <italic>drosophila</italic> Shot exhibits a myonuclei-related localization while previous studies in murine models identified MACF1 specifically accumulated at the NMJ.</p><p>Our in vitro results show that MACF1 is progressively expressed during muscle fiber maturation and differentiation and accumulates at the periphery of the myofibers where it colocalizes with cortical microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In vivo, muscle MACF1 also accumulates strongly in the vicinity of extra-synaptic myonuclei and colocalizes mainly with the longitudinal microtubule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), in accordance with observations from <italic>Drosophila</italic> myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the MACF1 accumulation pattern along the extrasynaptic myofibers differs from that at the NMJ where there isn’t a particular MACF1 meshwork around synaptic myonuclei, nor a colocalization of MACF1 with AChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, extra-synaptic myonuclei positioning is altered in developing myofibers of MACF1-depleted muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), whereas synaptic myonuclei positioning is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our in vitro results suggest that the progressive alteration of myonuclei positioning is mainly due to the capacity of MACF1 to freeze myonuclei displacement events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, in the MACF1-depleted condition, myonuclei motion is increased and contributes to the alteration of myonuclei distribution along myofibers that translates into a reduction in the distance between adjacent myonuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Interestingly, the in vivo long-term depletion of muscle MACF1 leads to a dramatic change in the location of myonuclei in 12 month-old mice. In these mice, myonuclei are internalized, with no associated signs of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Myonuclei internalizations is concomitant with the appearance of T-tubules enlargement and with continuity breaks of membranes and Desmin structures in the myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In mature myofibers, myonuclei have been found to reach the periphery of myofibers by a process dependent on an interplay between myonuclei rigidity, actin and Desmin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roman et al., 2017</xref>). Depletion of MACF1 in vitro or in vivo does not impact the actin network integrity, as reflected by unmodified sarcomere’s structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the myonuclei morphology is modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We believe that in MACF1 depleted myofibers, the loosened anchorage of peripheral myonuclei is the initial cause of changes in their morphology. Over time, MACF1 depletion affects the Desmin network, which is a myofibril linker known to play a hub role between the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton and nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hnia et al., 2015</xref>). In this perspective, myonuclei internalization in MACF1-depleted myofibers from old mice is likely the consequence of loosening of the MACF1-dependent meshwork in the vicinity of the myonuclei. This contributes to the long-term enhancement of myonuclei motion, associated with myonuclei shape alteration. Altogether, this internalization requires loss of cohesion within myofibrils, achieved through reorganization of the Desmin network.</p><p>Our study shows that MACF1 controls myonuclei displacement through the regulation of microtubules dynamics during myofibers maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Early steps of myonuclei positioning in immature myofibers (myotubes) depend on an interplay between microtubules, microtubule-associated-proteins and motors proteins such as MAP4, MAP7, Dynein, and Kif5b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gache et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mogessie et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we found that MACF1 is not involved in the early steps of myonuclei spreading in myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using EB3 comets tracking, we show that microtubule dynamic progressively decreases within myofibers during maturation, leading to more stabilized microtubules structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, the absence of MACF1 impairs this stabilization and leads to microtubule with a higher polymerization rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We propose that this enhanced dynamic is correlated with the increased myonuclei movement along myofibers, especially because endogenous MACF1 is in vitro and in vivo clearly located around myonuclei and is co-localized with the longitudinal microtubule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Progressive microtubule network stabilization during myofibers maturation is associated with de-tyrosinated tubulin accumulation. Interestingly, our microscopy images show that a de-tyrosinated pool of microtubules is present in the vicinity of myonuclei in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gadadhar et al., 2017</xref>). In accordance with the elevated microtubule dynamics, de-tyrosinated tubulin staining around myonuclei is lost in <italic>Macf1</italic> KO muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), supporting a link between microtubule dynamics and myonuclei motion. No direct interplay between MACF1 and tubulin post translational modification (PTMs) has been so far documented, but one can hypothesize that regarding already described MACF1 localization, at the Minus-End of microtubules throught CAMSAP/patronin or at the Plus-End of microtubules throught EB1, MACF1 can influence localization of enzymes controlling tubulin PTMs such as TTL or SVBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aillaud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Noordstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Su et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to postulate that in MACF1-depleted myofibers from old mice, this elevated microtubule dynamic is constantly challenging the cohesion between myofibrils through Desmin reorganization, hence contributing to the myonuclei internalization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heffler et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, in the MACF1-depleted myofibers, the tyrosinated/de-tyrosinated ratio of microtubules is not changed at the NMJ supporting alternative tubulin PTMs in the maintenance of the microtubule network cohesion at that location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Osseni et al., 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, we show that MACF1 is important for the control of AChR clustering in mature myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Failure of this mechanism in the MACF1-depleted myofibers is the most likely reason for the observed decrease in muscle excitability since it will affect neuromuscular transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that myofibril genesis is not impacted neither in vitro nor in vivo upon MACF1-depletion and by the fact that there is also no alteration in SR-Ca<sup>2+</sup> release even though the overall structure of T-tubule network was found affected in some of the myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Our study has also revealed an unexpected role for muscle MACF1 related to mitochondria biogenesis. We observed an increase in the number of oxidative fibers in MACF1-depleted muscles from old mice, with no associated change in the myosins expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This alteration is correlated with an increase of mitochondrial DNA and with the increased fatigue resistance of the MACF1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, our electron and fluorescence microscopy images revealed an alteration of mitochondria shape and patterning as they appear rounder and accumulated in-between myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Molecular motors such as Kif5b and Dynein control mitochondrial motion in myoblasts (iqbal and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iqbal and Hood, 2014</xref>). Microtubule network disorganization and loss of myofibrils cohesion may explain mitochondria mislocalization along myofibers. Accordingly, MACF1 has been previously implicated in mitochondria localization and nuclear positioning in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escobar-Aguirre et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, an increase in microtubules instability directly impacts the local concentration of free tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gache et al., 2005</xref>) and free tubulin-βII level can affect mitochondrial metabolism and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guerrero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guzun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumazawa et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, our investigations revealed that the mRNA levels of proteins related to mitochondrial fusion/fission such as DNM1 and DNM2 were unchanged in MACF1 depleted myofibers but the transcripts of Sarcolipin, a protein related to mitochondrial biogenesis, were dramatically increased in conditional old mutant mice compared to controls. One possibility is that this alteration is due to the aberrant myonuclei size/shape of MACF1 KO myofibers since it has been reported that nuclear alterations can impact gene expression through changes in mechanotransduction processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In any case, our results indicate that the increase in mitochondria number is already present in young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and is the most likely explanation for the resistance of both young and old KO mice to fatigue. We thus provide evidence that microtubule organization and dynamics in muscle cells are imporant not only for mitochondria motion and positioning, but also to maintain mitochondria biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mado et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The present results have physiopathological relevance as there are several disease conditions associated with peripheral myonuclei mis-localization in muscle fibers. This is the case for a heterogeneous group of inherited muscle diseases, called CentroNuclear Myopathies (CNMs), which are defined pathologically by an abnormal localization of myonuclei in the center of the myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jungbluth and Gautel, 2014</xref>). Genes implicated in the various forms of CNMs encode proteins that participate in different aspects of membrane remodeling and trafficking such as MTM1, Amphyphisin-2/BIN1, DNM2, and HACD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bitoun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laporte et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muhammad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muller et al., 2003</xref>). Another example is skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with desminopathies which also present internalized myonuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clemen et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we have identified MACF1, as a critical contributor in the maintenance of extra-synaptic myonuclei positioning, in the maintenance of the NMJ integrity and in mitochondria location and biogenesis. This is of strong relevance to our understanding of muscle diseases associated with centralization of myonuclei and potentially to other pathological muscle defects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary myoblasts were collected from wild type C57BL6 mice as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falcone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pimentel et al., 2017</xref>).

The right <italic>Hindlimb</italic> was shaved before an electrode cream was applied at the knee and heel regions to optimize electrical stimulation. Each anesthetized mouse was placed supine in a cradle allowing for a strict standardization of the animal positioning. Throughout a typical experiment, anesthesia was maintained by air inhalation through a facemask continuously supplied with 1.5% isoflurane. The cradle also includes an electrical heating blanket in order to maintain the animal at a physiological temperature during anesthesia. Electrical stimuli were delivered through two electrodes located below the knee and the Achille’s tendon. The right foot was positioned and firmly immobilized through a rigid slipper on a pedal of an ergometer (NIMPHEA_Research, AII Biomedical SAS) allowing for the measurement of the force produced by the Hindlimb muscles (i.e. mainly the <italic>Gastrocnemius</italic> muscle). The right knee was also firmly maintained using a rigid fixation in order to optimize isometric force recordings. Monophasic rectangular pulses of 0.2 ms were delivered using a constant-current stimulator (Digitimer DS7AH, maximal voltage: 400V). The force-frequency curves were determined by stepwise increasing stimulation frequency, with resting periods &gt; 30 s between stimuli in order to avoid effects due to fatigue. For each stimulation train, isometric peak force was calculated. After a 3 min recovery period, force was assessed during a fatigue protocol consisting of 30 Hz stimulation trains of 0.3 s delivered once every second for 180 s.

Once deeply anesthetized mice were shaved at the level of the left hip and the skin incised over 3 mm, then the connective tissue (muscle fascia) was incised. In order to reach the sciatic nerve the muscle mass was pushed back with the delicate help of fine forceps. The exposed sciatic nerve was subjected for two minutes to a drop of lurocaïne in order to inhibit any nociceptive impulse. Then the nerve was seized using fine forceps and sectioned by ablation of 2–3 mm to avoid any reconnection by scarring.

Estimation of the T-tubule density from the di-8-anepps fluorescence was carried out from a largest possible region of interest excluding the plasma membrane, within each fiber. For each fiber, two images taken at distinct locations were used. Analysis was carried out with the ImageJ software (National Institute of Health). Automatic threshold with the Otsu method was used to create a binary image of the surface area occupied by T-tubules. The ‘skeletonize’ function was then used to delineate the T-tubule network. T-tubule density was expressed as the percent of positive pixels within the region. Sarcomere length was estimated from half the number of fluorescence peaks (T-tubules) along the length of the main axis of a given fiber. To assess variability in T-tubule orientation, objects within two T-tubule binary images of each fiber were outlined and particle analysis was performed to determine the angle of all objects yielding a perimeter larger than an arbitrary value of 10 µm.

Briefly, fibers were partly insulated with silicone grease so that only a short portion (50–100 µm long) of the fiber extremity remained out of the silicone. Fibers were bathed in a standard voltage-clamp extracellular solution containing (in mM) 140 TEA-methanesulfonate, 2.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1 4-aminopyridine, 10 HEPES and 0.002 tetrodotoxin. An RK-400 patch-clamp amplifier (Bio-Logic, Claix) was used in whole-cell conFigureuration in combination with an analog-digital converter (Axon Instruments, Digidata 1440A) controlled by pClamp nine software (Axon Instruments).

The tip of the micropipette was inserted through the silicone within the insulated part of the fiber and was gently crushed against the bottom of the chamber to ease intracellular equilibration and decrease the series resistance. Intracellular equilibration of the solution was allowed for 30 min before initiating measurements. Membrane depolarizing steps of 0.5 s duration were applied from −80 mV.

Representative images were taken from myofibers of each condition as described. Briefly, a threshold of 8 µm was set as the minimal size for AChRs clusters. Myofibers with at least one cluster of 8 µm or bigger were considered as positive.</p><p>Cytochrome C was used to study the mitochondrial content of each myofiber in vitro. On each myofiber, several Regions Of Interest (ROI) were selected randomly. Next, the total number of particles stained for Cytochrome C were quantified per ROI. The particles with circularity equivalent to one were eliminated in order to purify our results from any unwanted background errors. Particles with feret less than 0.75 µm (mean size of mitochondria) were eliminated to purify our results.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Muscle MACF1 maintains myonuclei and mitochondria localization through microtubules to control muscle functionalities&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form. The maximum time for revision is two months and we feel that you will require more time to answer the questions posed by the reviewers. We therefore encourage you to resubmit the revised manuscript. We think that the suggestion that MACF1 is involved in microtubule dynamics is novel and interesting. This aspect should be developed. In contrast MACF1 implication in myonuclear positioning has already been proposed. Its role in mitochondrial localisation would require consolidating if you want to make this a major point of the paper. We appreciate all the in vitro and in vivo analyses presented in the paper. In this context, is not clear to us why knock-down in vitro produces such a rapid effect whereas in vivo it takes months to see an effect. Is this linked first to NMJ defects due to the role of MACF1 in microtubule dynamics? In addition to addressing this question, you should provide more information on the subcellular localisation of MACF1and its relative association with microtubules, actin fibres and the nuclear membrane. The reports provided by the three reviewers are shown below. In the revised paper you should consider the different points raised and indicate how you have addressed them in an accompanying letter.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Ghasemizadeh et al. investigated the role of the skeletal muscle MACF1, a protein related to the microtubule network, in the maintenance of myonuclei and mitochondria localization in mature muscle cells. The major findings are: (1) MACF1 regulates the myonuclei positioning during maturation steps of myofibers but not during their early steps of formation, (2) MACF1 controls the localization and structural integrity of muscle mitochondria, (3) the knockdown of MACF1 in myotubes with shRNA reduces , the formation of agrin-induced AChR clusters and increases myonuclei movements, (4) the loss-function of MACF1 specifically in muscles (conditional muscle-KO) induces mis-localization of myonuclei in adult but not in younger mice, alters the structural integrity of NMJs at younger mice, and enhances mitochondrial content in in adult mice, (7) muscles from Macf1 conditional mice display a higher resistance to fatigue compared to muscles of control mice.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study addressing an important question and provides important mechanistic insight into the role of MACF1 muscle in the positioning of myonuclei and the structural integrity of the mitochondria and the neuromuscular junction.</p><p>The presented data appears to be compelling and is well discussed in light of previous literature. However, some issues need to be addressed to enhance the visibility of the manuscript.</p><p>1. It would be helpful to know about the subcellular location of MACF1 in muscle cells (if the antibody does work in immunocytochemistry).</p><p>2. In Figure1 D and E, MHC-positive cells appear to be at low frequency, indicating that most of cells remain as non-differentiated myoblats or dead cells. This raises the question of whether myoblats or myotubes are the primary source of MACF1 protein expression observed in total protein extracts by Western blot. The authors should resolve this issue.</p><p>3. The authors claimed that MACF1 is progressively expressed and accumulates during muscle differentiation and maturation processes. However, there is no provided data to support this claim. On the contrary, MACF1 expression level appears to be less pronounced at 10 days of muscle differentiation (Figure 1 C). It would useful to examine MACF1 expression levels during muscle cell differentiation and maturation processes both in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>4. In Figure 2, the authors showed that the number of AChR dots was significantly increased in myotubes treated with MAFC1 shRNA. However, the unusual shape and size of fluorescent BTX raised some concerns about the specificity of the staining. This can be ruled out by saturating all AChRs with unlabeled BTX and then add the fluorescently tagged BTX. In this case, you should expect to see no staining.</p><p>5. It was puzzling to see that mislocalization of myonuclei in MACF1 conditional muscle-KO occurs only after a year, while at the NMJ the number of positioned subsynaptic nuclei was altered much earlier (4 months). The authors should explore the idea whether the positioning of non-synaptic and subsynaptic myonuclei is MCF1 activity dependent. One possible experiment is to denervate muscles of mutant and wild type and see the positioning/number of myonuclei.</p><p>6. The authors should also look if the synaptic mitochondria are susceptible to alterations in younger MACF1 conditional muscle-KO mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Ghasemizadeh et al., analyzed the function of MACF1, a microtubule-actin crosslinker protein in muscles. The authors used shRNA knock down in culture conditions, as well as muscle specific knock out in a mouse model for their analysis. They show that myonuclei positioning in vitro and in vivo is impaired in the conditional knock out mouse muscles, and that mitochondria positioning and morphology was impaired. Both phenotypes might be related to destabilized dynamics of the microtubules in the muscles as observed by the authors. In addition abnormal acetylcholine receptors clustering at the neuromuscular junction was observed.</p><p>The results described are interesting, however they might be unrelated to each other, and their novelty is limited. The authors do not provide novel mechanistic insight to any of the processes described, but rather provide a collection of observations and phenotypes observed following knockout of MACF1 in muscles.</p><p>1. The authors used MACF1 conditional knockout mice described in Goryunov et al., 2010. In this model the authors deleted exons 6 and 7 encoding the C-terminal half of the MACF1 actin binding domain (ABD). MACF1 is a large protein with distinct domains, including ABD, Plakin, microtubule and EB1 domains. The authors suggest that the major contribution of MACF-1 in the muscles relates to its function as a microtubule binding protein. However, the truncated protein (produced in the KO mice), lacks only part of the ABD domain, and still contains functional plakin and microtubule binding domains. It is possible that the weak phenotype observed is under representative of the major function of MACF1 in muscles. The authors did not address or discuss this possibility.</p><p>2. Many of the phenotypes described by the authors have been already illustrated in other model organisms, including myonuclear positioning defects, myonuclear sphericity, and microtubule disorganization (e.g. Wang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2010, Bottenberg et al., 2009). The phenotype of the mitochondria fragmentation is novel and interesting, however, the authors do not provide mechanistic explanation for this observation, and only speculate that this is due to aberrant microtubule organization.</p><p>3. Some of the images are not convincing: Figure 1 – the difference between control and MACF1 siRNA are minimal and might be due to differential length of the myofibers. Figure 2 – actin does not appear normal. The difference in microtubule organization is not clear enough. The EM micrographs are of medium quality, and do not allow the reader to see the details of the mitochondria. Higher magnification images are required.</p><p>4. The authors should show where MACF1 is localized in a normal muscle. Does it overlaps with MT? Is it localized at the nuclear membrane`? does it overlaps with tyrosinated or with Non-tyrosinated? Does it overlap with EB1?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>With the exception of the clustered myonuclei at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), multinucleated skeletal muscle cells position most of their nuclei to optimize the distances between them. Moreover, the skeletal muscle cells have developed mechanisms to maintain these positions despite muscle contraction. The manuscript focuses on identifying the role of the microtubule binding protein, MACF1 in mouse muscle cells through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The investigators report that MACF1 is linked to myonuclear positioning at the NMJ and throughout the fiber, mitochondrial positioning/structure, T-tubule organization, and the clustering of Acetylcholine receptors at the NMJ. The authors suggest that the key role of MACF1 is to regulate posttranslational modifications of microtubules and, as a result, microtubule dynamics. They make the argument that alterations in microtubule dynamics found in the loss of MACF1 are linked to deficits in postsynaptic nuclear positioning and function, myonuclear and mitochondrial positioning and ultimately muscle function.</p><p>The authors provide a great deal of in vivo and in vitro data to develop their assertion that MACF1 plays a critical role in muscle maturation and function. They find that loss/reduction of MACF1 results in a number of deficits in the mature fiber: these include morphological defects including aberrant myonuclear position, particularly of the postsynaptic nuclei, reduction in ACHR clustering at the synapse, mitochondria mispositioning and morphology, T-tubule abnormalities, etc and muscle functional defects (reduced force but greater endurance). The authors attempt to link myriad defects in the muscle fiber to one underlying structural alteration in the fibers: abnormal microtubule dynamics. Their evidence to support this: changes in the amount of tyrosination/detyrosinated microtubules (which should be quantified but isn't) and alterations in EB1 comet speed (number and trajectory numbers should be included as well). Both these are suggestive of highly dynamic microtubules in the ko/kd myofibers and some role for MACF1 in the control of microtubule dynamicity (either directly or indirectly). Given that the main conclusions rest on the conclusion of MACF1 control microtubule dynamics, some additional support should be provided that connects MACF1 to Microtubules to Microtubule dynamics and subsequently these altered MTs to the other phenotypes described. For example, does overexpression of MACF1 lead to an increase in stable microtubules? How does this affect AChR clustering, myonuclear clustering at the synapse or even T-tubule structures? Does MACF1 recruit enzymes that post translationally modify MTs to the MTs? Where is MACF1 expressed or enriched in the mouse myofiber at the different ages?</p><p>Also important: please have a native English speaker edit the manuscript as there are many issues in grammar, word choice, sentence structure.

As well, it appears as dots around the myonuclei, following lines that colocalize with the microtubule network (mostly at the cortex of myofibers and also inside myofibers).

To decipher if extra-synaptic myonuclei localization was affected, we first extracted <italic>Tibialis Anterior</italic> muscle fibers from <italic>MACF1</italic> cKO mouse and quantified the distance between myonuclei in 2, 6 and 12months old mice. This approach showed that extra-synaptic myonuclei positioning is affected in <italic>MACF1</italic> cKO mouse compared to controls. Indeed, we observed a 20% reduction in the distance between closest myonuclei at 2 months, 40% at 6 months and up to 70% in 12 months of age (Figure 4B). Thus, as suggested by our in vitro results (Figure 1J), alteration of extra-synaptic myonuclei spreading at the periphery of myofiber occurs precociously. In contrast, internalization of myonuclei is a late event, concomitant with microtubule and intermediate filaments disorganization (Figure 3 and 7G).</p><p>In a second approach, we quantified the number of synaptic myonuclei (beneath the NMJ) during aging. Interestingly, we found that the number of synaptic myonuclei is increased in control mice, from 7 in young mice to 11 in old mice, while this number is relatively stable (around 7) in <italic>MACF1</italic> cKO mice (Figure 5D). As NMJs in <italic>MACF1</italic> KO mice are smaller and present fragmented AChRs clusters compared to control (Figure 5B-C), we hypothesized that failure in synaptic myonuclei recruitment observed in <italic>MACF1</italic> cKO mouse is preferentially driven by the failure in AChR Clustering (Figure 5B-C). To validate this hypothesis, we performed a muscle denervation experiment. The sciatic nerve crush, as previously published (Milanič et al., 1999, PMID: 10421467 ), decreases both myofiber (Cross Section Area, Figure 5H) and NMJs area (Figure 5I) after 15 days. These effects were similar in wild-type and in <italic>MACF1</italic> cKO mouse (Figure 5H-I). We also observed a similar loss of synaptic myonuclei at the NMJ after the denervation experiment (1 synaptic myonuclei), suggesting that MACF1 is not directly involved in synaptic myonuclei positioning at the NMJs.</p><p>Therefore, these data show that MACF1 regulates directly the dynamics of extra-synaptic myonuclei at the periphery of muscle fibers rather than controlling the synaptic myonuclei.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The authors used shRNA knock down in culture conditions, as well as muscle specific knock out in a mouse model for their analysis. They show that myonuclei positioning in vitro and in vivo is impaired in the conditional knock out mouse muscles, and that mitochondria positioning and morphology was impaired. Both phenotypes might be related to destabilized dynamics of the microtubules in the muscles as observed by the authors. In addition abnormal acetylcholine receptors clustering at the neuromuscular junction was observed.</p><p>The results described are interesting, however they might be unrelated to each other, and their novelty is limited. The authors do not provide novel mechanistic insight to any of the processes described, but rather provide a collection of observations and phenotypes observed following knockout of MACF1 in muscles.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this reviewer as our work presents the hitherto unexplored role of MACF1 to control microtubule dynamics/stability and consequently, extra-synaptic myonuclei positioning, AchRs clustering and mitochondria biogenesis.

The authors used MACF1 conditional knockout mice described in Goryunov et al., 2010. In this model the authors deleted exons 6 and 7 encoding the C-terminal half of the MACF1 actin binding domain (ABD). MACF1 is a large protein with distinct domains, including ABD, Plakin, microtubule and EB1 domains. The authors suggest that the major contribution of MACF-1 in the muscles relates to its function as a microtubule binding protein. However, the truncated protein (produced in the KO mice), lacks only part of the ABD domain, and still contains functional plakin and microtubule binding domains. It is possible that the weak phenotype observed is under representative of the major function of MACF1 in muscles. The authors did not address or discuss this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, Goryunov <italic>et al.</italic> observed that conditional deletion of the exons 6 and 7 of <italic>Macf1</italic> does not eliminate the presence of the MACF1c isoform. To our knowledge, this isoform is unique to the nervous system (Cusseddu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021, PMID: 33816492). Supporting this data, we did not observe the presence of such isoform or truncated protein in our muscle system (Figure 1c and supplementary Figure 1c). Therefore, the MACF1c isoform cannot be responsible of the mild phenotype observed.</p><p>In muscle-specific MACF1 conditional KO mouse, qPCR analysis demonstrated that <italic>Macf1</italic> mRNA expression was reduced by 50% in 2-month-old mice and 70% in 12-month-old mice (supplementary Figure 3A). The partial reduction in <italic>Macf1</italic> expression might be attributable to several parameters. First, qPCR experiments were performed on total muscle extracts, which do not reflect solely <italic>Macf1</italic> expression in myofiber. Indeed, skeletal muscle contains multiple cell types in which <italic>Macf1</italic> expression is not altered in muscle-specific MACF1 conditional KO mouse. Then, muscle stem cells contribute to uninjured myofiber homeostasis throughout life (Keefe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015, PMID: 25971691, Pawlikowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015, PMID: 26668715), thus providing new myonuclei where MACF1 is not depleted yet. As well, <italic>Macf1</italic> mRNA could be brought in the mature myofiber upon muscle stem cell fusion. Together, this could partly dilute the effect of the Cre recombinase and allow maintenance of small amounts of MACF1 protein in myofibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Many of the phenotypes described by the authors have been already illustrated in other model organisms, including myonuclear positioning defects, myonuclear sphericity, and microtubule disorganization (e.g. Wang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2010, Bottenberg et al., 2009). The phenotype of the mitochondria fragmentation is novel and interesting, however, the authors do not provide mechanistic explanation for this observation, and only speculate that this is due to aberrant microtubule organization.</p></disp-quote><p>As presented in the first version of our manuscript, we observed an increase in the number of mitochondrial particles following MACF1 downregulation. This phenomenon, which was referred as “mitochondrial fragmentation”, led us to hypothesize that loss of MACF1 disrupts the mitochondrial network integrity. By disorganizing the microtubule (MT) network, MACF1 downregulation would affect the expression or activity level of MT-associated proteins such as DNM1 or DNM2, known to participate in mitochondrial fission or fusion.</p><p>To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out different experiments as follows. First, the mRNA expression of mitochondrial fission/fusion actors were studied both in vitro and in vivo. No differences were observed in <italic>Dnm1</italic> or <italic>Dnm2</italic> expression levels when MACF1 is downregulated either in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>) or in vivo in the <italic>MACF1</italic> cKO mouse (Figure 7F). Therefore, loss of MACF1 does not affect mitochondrial fission/fusion processes.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>QRT-PCR results presenting relative gene expression level of DNM1 (left) and DNM2 (right) to housekeeping genes in short differentiated myotubes or long term differentiated myofibers transfected with scrambled si/shRNA or a pool of si/shRNAs against MACF1.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70490-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, the in vivo histo-enzymological SDH staining (Figure 7B) and q-PCR analysis of mitochondrial DNA amount (Figure 7E) revealed an increase in the number of mitochondria in the adult MACF1 KO mice compared to the control mice.

Some of the images are not convincing: Figure 1 – the difference between control and MACF1 siRNA are minimal and might be due to differential length of the myofibers. Figure 2 – actin does not appear normal. The difference in microtubule organization is not clear enough. The EM micrographs are of medium quality, and do not allow the reader to see the details of the mitochondria. Higher magnification images are required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now provided high magnification images that strengthen our conclusions.</p><p>For the reduced distance of adjacent myonuclei in MACF1-KD myofibers compared to control myofibers (Figure 1J), there is no apparent difference in myofiber length and/or shape. We added a larger view of the cell culture to better appreciate unchanged culture of myofibers (Figure 1D), To investigate actin organization in skeletal muscle fibers, the sarcomere length was measured on images using F-actin staining in control and MACF1-KD myofibers (Figure 1F). No significant difference was observed, showing that MACF1 is not involved in actin network patterning in myofibers.

Moreover, the skeletal muscle cells have developed mechanisms to maintain these positions despite muscle contraction. The manuscript focuses on identifying the role of the microtubule binding protein, MACF1 in mouse muscle cells through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The investigators report that MACF1 is linked to myonuclear positioning at the NMJ and throughout the fiber, mitochondrial positioning/structure, T-tubule organization, and the clustering of Acetylcholine receptors at the NMJ. The authors suggest that the key role of MACF1 is to regulate posttranslational modifications of microtubules and, as a result, microtubule dynamics. They make the argument that alterations in microtubule dynamics found in the loss of MACF1 are linked to deficits in postsynaptic nuclear positioning and function, myonuclear and mitochondrial positioning and ultimately muscle function.</p><p>The authors provide a great deal of in vivo and in vitro data to develop their assertion that MACF1 plays a critical role in muscle maturation and function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating the amount of our data provided to support our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They find that loss/reduction of MACF1 results in a number of deficits in the mature fiber: these include morphological defects including aberrant myonuclear position, particularly of the postsynaptic nuclei, reduction in ACHR clustering at the synapse, mitochondria mispositioning and morphology, T-tubule abnormalities, etc and muscle functional defects (reduced force but greater endurance). The authors attempt to link myriad defects in the muscle fiber to one underlying structural alteration in the fibers: abnormal microtubule dynamics. Their evidence to support this: changes in the amount of tyrosination/detyrosinated microtubules (which should be quantified but isn't) and alterations in EB1 comet speed (number and trajectory numbers should be included as well). Both these are suggestive of highly dynamic microtubules in the ko/kd myofibers and some role for MACF1 in the control of microtubule dynamicity (either directly or indirectly). Given that the main conclusions rest on the conclusion of MACF1 control microtubule dynamics, some additional support should be provided that connects MACF1 to Microtubules to Microtubule dynamics and subsequently these altered MTs to the other phenotypes described. For example, does overexpression of MACF1 lead to an increase in stable microtubules? How does this affect AChR clustering, myonuclear clustering at the synapse or even T-tubule structures? Does MACF1 recruit enzymes that post translationally modify MTs to the MTs? Where is MACF1 expressed or enriched in the mouse myofiber at the different ages?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a number of additional experiments to strengthen our conclusion that MACF1 controls microtubule dynamics and its loss inevitably leads to functional deficits of the mature myofiber.</p><p>For the localization of MACF1 in muscle fibers, similar questions were raised by reviewer #1/question #1 and reviewer #2/question #4. We thank all of our three reviewers to have pointed out the missing of such an important information. Thus, the use of a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Novus biologicals, also validated for its specificity by western blot, allowed us to address MACF1 localization on in vitro and on ex vivo muscle fibers (Figures 1 and 3). Using this immunostaining approach, we validated MACF1 as an exclusive Microtubule-BindingProtein that colocalizes with the microtubule network and accumulates preferentially at the perinuclear area. As MACF1 is a huge protein with the main two isoforms at 830 and 630kD, in vitro over-expression of the full length MACF1 using a plasmid is experimentally impossible. However, we overexpressed the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) of MACF1 in our in vitro system. MACF1-MTBD formed bundles with a preference location around myonuclei (Figure 2B). This indicates that MACF1-MTBD is responsible for the perinuclear positioning of endogenous MACF1.</p><p>Furthermore, we analyzed EB3 comets speed along myofibers maturation in control and in MACF1 depleted myofibers (Figure 2C). These data show (1) that during myofibers formation, EB3 comet speed decreases and (2) that MACF1 depletion maintains EB3 comets speed to high level. All together, these data demonstrate that MACF1 control microtubule dynamic rate along myofiber maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also important: please have a native English speaker edit the manuscript as there are many issues in grammar, word choice, sentence structure.
