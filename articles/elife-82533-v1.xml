The pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is essential for gonad function, is primarily controlled by kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC<sup>kiss</sup>), the pulse generator of GnRH. The pulsatility of GnRH release, as assessed by the amount of circulating gonadotropin, is markedly reduced in aged animals, suggesting that the malfunctions of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> may be responsible for reproductive aging and menopause-related disorders. However, the activity dynamics of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> during the natural transition to reproductive senescence remain unclear. Herein, we introduce chronic in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> in female mice by fiber photometry to monitor the synchronous episodes of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> (SEs<sup>kiss</sup>), a known hallmark of GnRH pulse generator activity, from the fully reproductive to acyclic phase over 1 year. During the reproductive phase, we find that not only the frequency, but also the intensities and waveforms of individual SEs<sup>kiss</sup>, vary depending on the stage of the estrus cycle. During the transition to reproductive senescence, the integrity of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> patterns, including the frequency and waveforms, remains mostly unchanged, whereas the intensities tend to decline. These data illuminate the temporal dynamics of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> activities in aging female mice. More generally, our findings demonstrate the utility of fiber-photometry-based chronic imaging of neuroendocrine regulators in the brain to characterize aging-associated malfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kisspeptin</kwd><kwd>Fiber photometry</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>menopause</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K16270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goto</surname><given-names>Teppei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K15194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goto</surname><given-names>Teppei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K20589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miyamichi</surname><given-names>Kazunari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H02587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miyamichi</surname><given-names>Kazunari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Special Postdoctoral Researchers Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goto</surname><given-names>Teppei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The pulsatile activities of kisspeptin neurons, the central pacemaker activities of reproductive functions, show unexpected robustness in terms of frequency, but a tendency for the intensity to decline, during the transition to reproductive senescence in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reproductive aging occurs broadly across mammalian females, eventually leading to loss of fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kermath and Gore, 2012</xref>). In humans, women undergo the perimenopausal transition to reproductive senescence, in which the menstrual cycles become irregular in length and timing before eventually ceasing at approximately 51 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gore, 2015</xref>). As this transition is associated with a risk of metabolic, physical, and mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greendale et al., 1999</xref>), it is essential to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of reproductive aging for not only reproductive medicine, but also womenâs health in general.</p><p>Reproductive function in females is primarily controlled by coordinated interactions among the three layers of the hypothalamusâpituitaryâovary axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gore, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kermath and Gore, 2012</xref>). At the core, GnRH-producing neurons in the anterior hypothalamus provides the driving force of the reproductive system. GnRH release occurs in a pulsatile manner at intervals of 30 min to several hours, depending on the species and reproductive (estrus) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herbison, 2018</xref>), and this pulsatility is essential for reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belchetz et al., 1978</xref>). GnRH released at the median eminence acts on the anterior pituitary gonadotrophs, which then release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) into the peripheral circulation. Pulsatile (tonic) LH and FSH release facilitate follicular development and steroidogenesis in the ovary. The sex steroid hormones then exert feedback control of the hypothalamic GnRH system and pituitary gonadotrophs. Although age-related changes can occur in each of these layers, classical evidence in rodent models suggests that modulation of GnRH neurons may be a major driving force of reproductive senescence. For example, pulsatile LH release as a proxy of GnRH activities decreases with age in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scarbrough and Wise, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wise et al., 1988</xref>). As such, the preovulatory LH surge is delayed or attenuated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matt et al., 1998</xref>) with decreased c-Fos expression, a marker of neural activation, in the GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 1994</xref>). Together with a classical transplantation study showing the presence of viable follicles in aged rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krohn, 1962</xref>), these studies suggest that reproductive senescence is mediated by the neuroendocrine system independent of the depletion of the follicular reserve.</p><p>How is the homeostatic regulation of the GnRH system altered by aging? Of many candidates for GnRH regulation, kisspeptin, a neuropeptide crucial for puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">dâAnglemont de Tassigny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lapatto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uenoyama et al., 2015</xref>), is thought to play a dominant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kermath and Gore, 2012</xref>). There are two populations of kisspeptin neurons in the rodent hypothalamus: one in the arcuate nucleus (ARC<sup>kiss</sup>), which acts as the GnRH pulse generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagae et al., 2021</xref>), and the other in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV<sup>kiss</sup>), which functions as the GnRH surge generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarkson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsuda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uenoyama et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown a decrease in kisspeptin signaling in both ARC<sup>kiss</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kunimura et al., 2017</xref>) and AVPV<sup>kiss</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lederman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neal-Perry et al., 2009</xref>) during aging in rats. Thus, malfunctions of the kisspeptin system may underpin the transition to reproductive senescence.</p><p>One critical step to characterizing the kisspeptin system for reproductive aging and menopause-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padilla et al., 2018</xref>) is to visualize directly the dynamics of neural activities of kisspeptin neurons during aging. Until recently, activities of the GnRH pulse generator could only be indirectly assessed by repetitive measurement of circulating LH level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steyn et al., 2013</xref>), which is not only labor-intensive but also stressful to animals not fully suited for chronic analysis. Recent seminal studies have established cell-type-specific chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> activities under a free-moving awake condition in mice by using fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). ARC<sup>kiss</sup> shows remarkable pulsatile activities, termed synchronous episodes of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (hereafter referred to as SEs<sup>kiss</sup> for simplicity). SEs<sup>kiss</sup> are well correlated with pulsatile LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>), tightly regulated by gonadal negative feedback signals mediated by sex steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McQuillan et al., 2022</xref>), and undergo dynamic changes in frequency depending on the stage of the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). However, the utility of this system is currently limited to only reproductive-phase or gonadectomized mice. It remains unknown how this system can facilitate the study of reproductive senescence by long-term imaging of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> dynamics. This motivated us to apply fiber photometry to monitor SEs<sup>kiss</sup> from the fully reproductive to acyclic phase over 1 year.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamics of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in the regular estrus cycle at the reproductive phase</title><p>Before characterizing SEs<sup>kiss</sup> during aging, we revisited the detailed patterns and waveforms of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in the reproductive phase. We first established 7 day chronic imaging of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> of cyclic <italic>Kiss1-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gottsch et al., 2011</xref>) female mice at age 4â6 months. An optical fiber was implanted above the ARC of <italic>Kiss1-Cre</italic> female mice that had been injected with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving Cre-dependent GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) into the ARC. Their estrus cycle stages were determined by vaginal cytology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Byers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caligioni, 2009</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed twice per day for 6 h each in the light and dark period with 6 h inter-imaging intervals. Estrus cycle and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from ARC<sup>kiss</sup> were monitored for seven consecutive days. We detected sharp photometric peaks highly resembling the previously reported SEs<sup>kiss</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and Materials and methods). The number of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> was dynamically altered in various stages of the estrus cycle and light and dark periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To align data from multiple animals, we utilized the fact that SEs<sup>kiss</sup> are strongly suppressed by a high level of progesterone just before ovulation in the proestrus stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, when the number of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in the dark period was normalized to that of the preceding light period, proestrus just after the diestrus stage showed a stereotyped drop (&lt;0.5) compared with other stages of the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Based on this profile, the estrus cycle was aligned starting from the proestrus stage. The number of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> during the estrus cycle was lowest at the dark period of the proestrus, and then gradually increased as the estrus cycle advanced, reaching the highest values at the dark period of the metestrus and diestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected from this frequency of SEs<sup>kiss</sup>, the inter-peak intervals showed the opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We also found that the peak height of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> normalized to that in the light period of proestrus fluctuated during the regular estrus cycle, with the highest (approximately 1.5-fold) at the light period 2 days after proestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data show that not only the frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>) but also the intensities of individual SEs<sup>kiss</sup> vary precisely depending on the stage of the estrus cycle. The higher peak during metestrus may be correlated with a higher amount of kisspeptin released to GnRH neurons to facilitate more LH/FSH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czieselsky et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of synchronous episodes of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> (SEs<sup>kiss</sup>) in the regular estrus cycle of the reproductive phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative 6 h photometry raw data of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in each stage of the estrus cycle.

Although the overall shape was similar when the peak was aligned, the onset and offset in proestrus significantly advanced compared with the estrus/metestrus stage 2 days after proestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To confirm this trend further, we quantified the left half-width at quarter maximum (LWQM) and right half-width at quarter maximum (RWQM). Whereas the full-width at quarter maximum (FWQM) was constant across all stages of the estrus cycle, LWQM in the proestrus stage was significantly longer than that in the other stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). RWQM in the proestrus stage tended to be shorter, while that in estrus/metestrus was significantly longer. Variations in waveforms correlated with the peak height: when the peak was higher, the upslope was steeper and the downslope was gentler. This difference likely reflects the activity dynamics of individual ARC<sup>kiss</sup> during each SE<sup>kiss</sup> (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reduced estrus cyclicity with aging in <italic>Kiss1-Cre</italic> mice</title><p>Next, we characterized the progress of reproductive decline in our experimental animals (<italic>Kiss1-Cre</italic> females in C57BL/6 background). In rodents, the most revealing marker of the reproductive stage is the estrous cyclicity determined by a vaginal smear, which is an indicator of the ovarian and neuroendocrine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Byers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caligioni, 2009</xref>).

Middle-aged female rodents can be classified into three groups: regularly cycling, irregularly cycling, and acyclic categories. We first confirmed that the number of estrus cycles per 25 days of wild-type C57BL/6J females was gradually decreased in an age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), generally consistent with a preceding study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson et al., 1982</xref>). A similar trend was observed in <italic>Kiss1-Cre</italic> female mice that had been injected with an AAV driving Cre-dependent GCaMP6s into the ARC with an optic fiber implanted above it, indicating that the genetic manipulation and fiber photometry setting did not alter the reproductive decline process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, n=12). The average number of estrus cycles per 25 days substantially declined between ages 12â13 months, supporting the notion that female mice begin to show irregular cyclicity at around 13 months of age. Based on these data, we set the threshold at three estrus cycles per 25 days and classified middle-aged female mice into one of three groups: regular cyclic (three or more), irregular cyclic (two or one), or acyclic (zero).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Decrease in estrus cycle frequency during the transition to reproductive senescence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of estrus cycles per 25 days at 3â4 (n=5), 8â9 (n=8), 11â12 (n=6), and 14â15 (n=12) months in old wild-type C57BL/6 mice.

Quantitative analysis showed that the frequency of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> as assessed by the average number per 6 h was constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), with no difference in the cumulative probability of inter-peak intervals among data set from age 6 months (fully reproductive) to age 15â18 months (acyclic in aging) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Regarding the intensities of SEs<sup>kiss</sup>, our additional analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, and ID#5, 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) showed that the peak height declined from the regular to the irregular cyclic (two of four individuals) and acyclic phases (all four individuals). Therefore, our data suggest the notion that in aged female mice, the intensity of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> may be reduced, whereas their frequency, to a lesser extent, appears altered.</p><p>Lastly, we assessed the expression level of <italic>Kiss1</italic>, <italic>Tac2</italic>, and <italic>Pdyn</italic> genes, which encode <underline>K</underline>isspeptin, <underline>N</underline>eurokinin B, and <underline>Dy</underline>norphin, respectively, and collectively define ARC<sup>kiss</sup> (KNDy) neurons, using quantitative PCR (qPCR) during reproductive senescence.

We have established long-term chronic imaging of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> by fiber photometry in female mice from the fully reproductive phase to the end of the transition to reproductive senescent over 1 year. Our data illuminate the temporal dynamics of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> during the estrus cycle in the reproductive phase and during the transition to reproductive senescence. Our strategy of direct chronic visualization of hormonal regulators in the brain is generally applicable to facilitate characterizations of aging-associated robustness and/or malfunctions in each component of neuroendocrine systems. Here, we discuss specific insights and major limitations of the present study to guide the design of future investigations.</p><p>We updated the frequency and waveforms of individual SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in the young reproductive phase with a detailed analysis of the light/dark periods of all four stages of the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, we reproduced a previous report showing a stereotyped drop of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in response to a high level of progesterone just before ovulation in the proestrus stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). Second, we found that the frequency of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> varied gradually depending on the stage of the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in contrast to a bimodal frequency reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). Third, we noticed that the intensities of SEs<sup>kiss</sup>, which have been thought to be constant across the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>), significantly varied during the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); individual peak heights of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> increased by almost 1.5-fold in the metestrus compared with the proestrus stage. This trend is consistent with the fact that the amplitude of the LH pulse is highest in the metestrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czieselsky et al., 2016</xref>). The enhanced activities of the GnRH pulse generator may be beneficial to provide LH/FSH more efficiently at the onset of follicular recruitment, which is sensitive to these hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGee and Hsueh, 2000</xref>). What would be the underlying mechanism of these elevated activities? In one scenario, the number of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> that contributes to SEs<sup>kiss</sup> is constant, but individual ARC<sup>kiss</sup> fire more. Alternatively, more ARC<sup>kiss</sup> are dynamically recruited to the SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in the metestrus. To distinguish between these two possibilities, future studies using new tools that allow imaging or recording of neural activities at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>) in gonad-intact cycling female mice are needed.</p><p>We also found that the waveforms of individual SEs<sup>kiss</sup> varied depending on the stage of the estrus cycle. In the metestrus stage, when the peak was higher, the uphill was significantly steeper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-H</xref>). What would be the underlying mechanism? A recent Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging study of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> at single-cell resolution in ovariectomized female mice revealed heterogeneity of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> activations during each SE<sup>kiss</sup>: some subsets of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> act as âleadersâ and others as âfollowersâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2022</xref>). Given these temporal dynamics, in the metestrus stage, the number of âleadersâ may be increased to achieve quicker activation of the entire pool. Alternatively, the âleadersâ more efficiently activate âfollowersâ in the metestrus stage so that the latency to the peak is short. Although the exact mechanism remains an open question, our data suggest that the molecular and/or cellular mechanisms by which synchronized activation of the ARC<sup>kiss</sup> pool is achieved are dynamically modulated by the estrus stage, likely via feedback signals mediated by sex steroid hormones.</p><p>Our results also showed that the frequency of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> during reproductive senescence was generally stable. Classical studies suggest that the reduced reproductive functions in aging rodents are primarily the result of the dysfunction of the neuroendocrine system, independent of follicular depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kermath and Gore, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krohn, 1962</xref>). There is a reduction in intensities of pulsatile LH release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scarbrough and Wise, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wise et al., 1988</xref>) and kisspeptin expression in ARC<sup>kiss</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kunimura et al., 2017</xref>) in aged rats. A reduction in both the intensities and frequencies of pulsatile LH release is also known in postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, a marked increase in the frequency of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> was observed in gonadectomized mice in the reproductive phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2019</xref>) via a decline of sex steroid hormone-mediated feedback mechanisms. Based on these results, it was possible to assume an abnormal frequency of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> in older females; however, our data did not support this prediction. How is the relatively unaltered frequency of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> during the natural transition to reproductive senescence achieved? In one scenario, the levels of sex steroid hormones may be grossly intact, even in the acyclic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mobbs et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nilsson et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, the reduction of sex steroid hormones in aging female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gee et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson et al., 1981</xref>) may be counterbalanced by the attenuation of negative feedback mechanisms in ARC<sup>kiss</sup>. The lack of the stereotyped drop of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> during the proestrus stage in older females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) generally supported a malfunction of negative feedback mechanisms by sex steroid hormones. It would be highly valuable to analyze SEs<sup>kiss</sup> patterns in aging ovariectomized animals to further investigate this matter, as the previous report of pulsatile LH secretion in aging ovariectomized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scarbrough and Wise, 1990</xref>). Whatever the scenario, the lack of increased SEs<sup>kiss</sup> frequency in aged female mice might be adaptive in terms of thermoregulation because elevated SEs<sup>kiss</sup> are thought to be causal to vasodilation (flushing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padilla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rance et al., 2013</xref>), one of the most commonly observed symptoms of perimenopausal disorders in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casper et al., 1979</xref>). In this sense, our data generally support the limitations in the use of older female mice as a model of the human menopausal transition, because not only the ovarian environment but also the adaptation of the hypothalamic regulators, may vary considerably between rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gore, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kermath and Gore, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our data also suggest that the intensities of SEs<sup>kiss</sup>, as assessed by the peak height, gradually declined from the regular to the acyclic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although we do not exclude the possibility that the reduction of photometric peaks was observed owing to technical artifacts, such as a slight misaligning of the optic fiber during long-term chronic imaging, we noticed that a drop in the photometric signals occurred in association with the reproductive phase rather than the total duration of fiber photometry. For instance, the peak intensity of ID#5 was relatively stable over 10 months from the reproductive to the irregular phase, but quickly declined in the subsequent 2 months upon the transition to the acyclic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and E</xref>). By contrast, ID#10 exhibited a quick drop of the peak intensity within just 3 months after the surgery upon entering into the acyclic phase. These observations support the interpretation that reduced photometric signals are associated with reduced neural activities of ARC<sup>kiss</sup>ââindividual firing rates, number of active neurons, or both. This trend can explain reduced LH amounts in each pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scarbrough and Wise, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wise et al., 1988</xref>), leading to inefficient follicular development and steroidogenesis in the ovary. The activity decline of individual ARC<sup>kiss</sup> with the molecular underpinnings should be better characterized in future studies.</p><p>Besides our findings regarding SEs<sup>kiss</sup> dynamics, other factors may contribute to reproductive senescence. For instance, aging may alter the release probability of kisspeptin and its receptivity by GPR54 in the GnRH neurons. Additionally, aging affects the function of GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manfredi-Lozano et al., 2022</xref>), including changes in their activity levels and the integrity of neural circuits with balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kermath and Gore, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, since ARC<sup>kiss</sup> is involved in restricting the amplitude of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mittelman-Smith et al., 2016</xref>), the absence of the stereotyped drop of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> during the proestrus stage in older females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) may contribute to the attenuation of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge, leading to the transition to the acyclic phase. Future studies should examine these downstream processes to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the neuroendocrine functions are disrupted during the transition to reproductive senescence in female mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the RIKEN Kobe Branch.

We then recalculated the ÎF/F by (F<sub>t</sub> â F<sub>0</sub>) / F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>t</sub> is the recorded signal at time = <italic>t</italic> and F<sub>0</sub> is the average of signals from â240 to â120 s. The FWQM, LWQM, and RWQM were determined by the recalculated ÎF/F value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To show the averaged waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>), the recalculated ÎF/F data were downsized at 10 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histochemistry</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The brain was post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS overnight. Thirty-Âµm coronal brain sections (every fourth section) were made using a cryostat (Leica). To generate cRNA probes for <italic>Tac2</italic>, DNA templates were amplified by PCR from the whole-brain cDNA (Genostaff, cat#MD-01). T3 RNA polymerase recognition site (5â-<named-content content-type="sequence"><italic>AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG</italic></named-content>) was added to the 3â end of the reverse primers.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (ISH) combined with anti-GFP immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, after hybridization and washing, brain sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-Dig (Roche Applied Science cat#11207733910, 1:500) and anti-GFP (Aves Labs cat#GFP-1010, 1:500) antibodies overnight. Signals were amplified by TSA-plus Cyanine 3 (AKOYA Bioscience, NEL744001KT, 1:70 in 1Ãplus amplification diluent) for 25 min, followed by washing, and then GFP-positive cells were visualized by anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (Jackson Immuno Research cat#703-545-155, 1:250). PBS containing 50 ng/ml 4â,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich, cat#D8417) was used for counter nuclear staining. Images were acquired using an Olympus BX53 microscope equipped with a 10x (N.A. 0.4) objective lens. Cells were counted manually.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, we prepared control animals by injecting AAV9 <italic>CAG-FLEx-GCaMPs-WPRE-SV40</italic> into the ARC of Kiss1-Cre female mice at 3â4 months of age. We sacrificed them 4 weeks following the surgery at 14 weeks of age, without fiber implantation or imaging. Thus, control samples represent the healthy reproductive phase without potential damage caused by repeated photometry recording and/or prolonged expression of GCaMP6s. The recorded samples were prepared by sacrificing aged animals (ranging from 18 to 29 months of age) after collecting photometry and estrus cycle data. We compared <italic>Tac2</italic> gene expression in the ARC as a robust marker of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> neurons because the expression level of <italic>Kiss1</italic> gene is not sufficient for stable detection by conventional in situ hybridization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the snap-frozen ARC tissues by using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturerâs instructions.

This may not align with the previous reporting of when reproductive senescence is reached in mice, in which the estrus cycles feature persistent vaginal cornification (PVC).

The decrease of GnRH/LH pulsatile release with age could rather be due to a decrease or an alteration of the activity of the GnRH neurons themselves, as suggested by recent studies investigating GnRH neuronal function across aging in certain neurodevelopmental disorders (PMID: 36048943).

We conducted an intensive re-analysis of all the data to find a parameter that correlates with the transitions from regular cyclic (RC) to irregular cyclic (IrC) and acyclic (Ac) phases in aging female mice. However, due to the limited sample size and large individual variations in our study, it turned out to be challenging to identify specific characteristics of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> activities that can predict future transitions of estrus cyclicity. Our analysis revealed only one promising parameter, the right width at quarter maximum (RWQM) of SEs<sup>kiss</sup> waveforms. We analyzed SEs<sup>kiss</sup> waveforms in individual estrus stages and found that aging females in the RC phase displayed a reduction of RWQM values during the diestrus stage, suggesting a faster decay of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> activities during SEs<sup>kiss</sup> (Response Figure 1A). However, the RWQM values either increased or decreased further when the estrus cycle became IrC or Ac phase (Response Figure 1B). This finding suggests that individual variations of RWQM values during the diestrus phase increase upon reproductive senescence, a trait observed in 5 out of 6 animals we analyzed. As the predictability of this trait for estrus cycle transition requires future investigation, we regard this information as a preliminary observation that may be suitable only for this review forum.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of RWQM values during the diestrus stage in aging female mice.</title><p>(A) Quantifications of RWQM of SE<sup>kiss</sup> waveforms in two individual aging female mice (those analyzed in Figure 3). A typical decline in RWQM values is observed from reproductive (Re) to regular cyclic (RC) during aging, and then they increase again as the estrus cycle becomes irregular cyclic (IrC) or acyclic (Ac). Different letters (aâc, xâz) denote significant differences at P &lt; 0.05 by the KruskalâWallis test followed by the MannâWhitney U test. (B) The fold-change of RWQM values from RC to either IrC or Ac phase in four aging female mice (those analyzed in Figure 4). Unlike ID#5 and #6, these animals display a further reduction of RWQM values during the reproductive senescence. Although the origin of these individual variations remains unclear, our data show that 5 out of 6 aging animals exhibit significant changes in RWQM values during the diestrus phase associated with the transition from RC to IrC or Ac.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82533-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Have the authors looked at kisspeptin expression in mice before and at the time when the change in kisspeptin activity was recorded?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important question, we assessed the expression level of <italic>Kiss1</italic>, <italic>Tac2</italic>, and <italic>Pdyn</italic> genes, which encode Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B, and Dynorphin, respectively, and collectively define ARC<sup>kiss</sup> (KNDy) neurons, using quantitative PCR (qPCR) during reproductive senescence. We found that the relative expression levels of these three genes, normalized to that in the healthy phase, unaltered among the diestrus ARC samples from the reproductive to acyclic phase, which was reported in the new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D. This result supports the notion that a reduction in <italic>Kiss1</italic> gene expression may not be a primary driver of the reproductive decline in mice. We added an explanation of this result (Lines 200â207) and related Methods (Lines 417â435) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should define what parameters they have used to measure the beginning and end of a normal reproductive cycle. Is this when proestrus occurs? This may not align with the previous reporting of when reproductive senescence is reached in mice, in which the estrus cycles feature persistent vaginal cornification (PVC). In Figure 3, it appears mice do not enter PVC by the end of the recording period. This may suggest that the estrus cycle has been prolonged, but mice may not have reached acyclicity and reproductive senescence.</p></disp-quote><p>We also appreciate this important question. We clarified our definition of an estrus cycle in the Methods section (Lines 339â341). We define an estrus cycle based on vaginal cytology that begins with proestrus and has a duration of 4 days or longer. Each cycle must include at least one day of the estrus stage and one day of the metestrus/diestrus stage, respectively.</p><p>Regarding PVC, we considered our mice ID#5 and #6 in Figure 3 to have entered acyclicity since they displayed persistent metestrus/diestrus stages in their 25-day vaginal smears, as illustrated in the new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1. The persistent metestrus/diestrus stage is characteristic of reproductive senescence, which typically follows PVC. However, a previous study has reported that 25% of the mice can directly transition to the persistent metestrus/diestrus stage without PVC (Felicio LS et al. <italic>Biology of Reproduction</italic> 31, 446, 1984). Therefore, we speculate that we may have missed detecting the PVC due to our sampling interval, which spanned several months, or these mice may have skipped the PVC altogether.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The mouse line is reported as Kiss1-Cre throughout the manuscript, but the authors have cited the Kiss1-CreGFP line. This should be corrected in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>According to this comment, we corrected the mouse information in the Methods section (Line 321).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors have not conducted a histological analysis of kisspeptin cells after imaging. This would aid in (1) identifying the subset of kisspeptin cells imaged, (2) visualizing whether bleaching may have occurred, and (3) using immunocytochemical markers to confirm that cytotoxicity induced by repeated imaging has not affected the health and normal activity of the recorded cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with this comment and have conducted a post-hoc histochemical analysis. To robustly identify ARC<sup>kiss</sup> neurons, we analyzed the expression of <italic>Tac2</italic> gene as a marker of ARC<sup>kiss</sup> neurons, since the expression level of <italic>Kiss1</italic> gene is not sufficient for stable detection by conventional in situ hybridization. The targeting efficiency, as measured by the fraction of GCaMP6+ cells over <italic>Tac2</italic>+ cells, was comparable between healthy control mice in the reproductive phase and our aged samples collected after imaging sessions, as shown in the new Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B. As we utilized an AAV to target GCaMP6s, the targeting efficiency is as expected. The number of GCaMP6s+ cells was comparable between the control and imaged samples, suggesting that there was no cellular loss in our aged and imaged samples. Moreover, the number of <italic>Tac2</italic>+ cells in the imaged side, normalized to the non-imaged contralateral side, was similar between the control and recorded animals, suggesting the negligible tissue damage or cell death associated with cytotoxicity resulting from prolonged expression of GCaMP6s and/or repeated photometry recording.

Because the continuous infusion of kisspeptin has been shown to be able to restaure pulsatile LH release in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (PMID: 24517142), pulsatile activity of arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons may not be required for GnRH/LH pulsatility, but its suppression in proestrus may play an important facilitatory role for the onset of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge. The decrease of GnRH/LH pulsatile release with age could rather be due to a decrease or an alteration of the activity of the GnRH neurons themselves, as suggested by recent studies investigating GnRH neuronal function across aging in certain neurodevelopmental disorders (PMID: 36048943).

Is this when proestrus occurs? This may not align with the previous reporting of when reproductive senescence is reached in mice, in which the estrus cycles feature persistent vaginal cornification (PVC). In Figure 3, it appears mice do not enter PVC by the end of the recording period. This may suggest that the estrus cycle has been prolonged, but mice may not have reached acyclicity and reproductive senescence.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mouse line is reported as Kiss1-Cre throughout the manuscript, but the authors have cited the Kiss1-CreGFP line.
