Constitutive immunity is always active, even in the absence of infection. For example, uninfected individuals produce natural antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Savage et al., 2017</xref>), immune cells, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). In contrast, induced immune responses are triggered after infection, which frequently involve amplifying existing constitutive factors. This can include immune cells proliferating and differentiating, and the massive upregulation of AMPs and cytotoxic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). Constitutive immunity is fast, allowing hosts to avoid becoming infected altogether or to rapidly clear infections. However, immune defences can be costly, diverting limited resources from other fitness-related traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajgar et al., 2015</xref>) or damaging the host through immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sadd and Siva-Jothy, 2006</xref>). While induced immune responses only incur these costs after infection, they are always present for constitutive immunity, even in the absence of infection. This trade-off between speed and cost is predicted to govern the allocation of host investment into constitutive and induced immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boots and Best, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shudo and Iwasa, 2001</xref>). Theoretical models predict that the key parameter determining which type of defence should be favoured is the frequency that hosts are exposed to infection—more frequent exposure favours constitutive defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shudo and Iwasa, 2001</xref>). In support of this, bacteria tend to evolve phage resistance by altering surface receptors when exposure is high and rely on induced CRISPR-Cas immunity when exposure is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Westra et al., 2015</xref>). However, despite there being variation in the extent of constitutive vs induced immunity within populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jent et al., 2019</xref>), to our knowledge the key prediction that high rates of parasitism lead to induced immune responses becoming constitutively expressed has not been demonstrated.</p><p>To investigate these questions, we examined how the constitutive and induced cellular immune defences of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> evolve under high parasite pressure. Cellular immunity in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> involves blood cells called hemocytes, which play the equivalent role to leukocytes in vertebrates. In uninfected larvae, there are two morphological and functional classes of hemocytes. Plasmatocytes constitute the majority of cells and have diverse functions including phagocytosis and AMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honti et al., 2014</xref>). Crystal cells are a less abundant specialized cell type that produces the prophenoloxidase molecules PPO1 and PPO2, which are processed into enzymes required for the melanization of parasites and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>). Infection can trigger an induced response, where these cell types proliferate, and cells called lamellocytes differentiate from circulating plasmatocytes, and prohemocytes and plasmatocytes in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honti et al., 2014</xref>). Lamellocytes are large flat cells with a specialised role in encapsulating and killing large parasites like parasitic wasps (parasitoids). When a parasitoid lays its egg into <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae, plasmatocytes adhere to the egg. Then, as lamellocytes differentiate they create additional cellular layers known as a ‘capsule’. Finally, the capsule is melanised by the activity of phenoloxidases produced in crystal cells and lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>). The melanin physically encases the parasitoid and toxic by-products of the melanisation reaction likely contribute to parasite killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nappi et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>There is substantial genetic variation in susceptibility to parasitoid infection within <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraaijeveld and Godfray, 1999</xref>), and this is associated with an increase in the number of circulating hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kraaijeveld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGonigle et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we used a combination of experimental evolution with physiological assays and single-cell RNA sequencing to examine how a high rate of parasitism by the parasitoid wasp <italic>L. boulardi</italic> affects constitutive and induced immune defences.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The evolution of resistance is associated with a more reactive immune response</title><p>To investigate the evolution of the cellular immune response, we allowed genetically diverse populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to evolve under intense levels of parasitism. We established an outbred population from 377 wild-caught <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females, and used this to find six experimental populations that were maintained at population sizes of 200 flies. In three of these populations, larvae were infected every generation, and flies that survived by encapsulating and melanising the wasp were used to establish the next generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, High Parasitism populations). The other three populations were maintained in the same conditions but without infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, no parasitism populations). In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fellowes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGonigle et al., 2017</xref>), the high parasitism populations increased in resistance over the generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Selection regime x Generation: χ<sup>2</sup> = 91.41, d.f. = 1, p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>).

This could result from increased activity of the encapsulation immune response, or because the flies are evolving to escape the effects of immunosuppressive molecules produced by the parasite. To distinguish these possibilities, we measured the ability of each population to react to an inert object. When a small volume of paraffin oil is injected into the larval haemocoel, it remains as a sphere and can be encapsulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Havard et al., 2009</xref>). Populations that evolved without parasitism show a very limited reaction to the oil droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, approximately half of larvae from selected populations encapsulate the oil droplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; Selection Regime: χ<sup>2</sup> = 73.35, d.f = 1, p=2×10<sup>−16</sup>). Therefore, high levels of parasitism led to the cellular immune system evolving a more active encapsulation response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Constitutive upregulation of immune-induced genes</title><p>Underlying induced immune responses are transcriptional responses to infection, so we examined how the hemocyte transcriptome altered in populations that evolved under high levels of parasitism. We harvested circulating hemocytes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and sequenced the transcriptomes of individual cells using the 10X Genomics platform. Initially, we pooled and jointly analysed RNAseq reads sequenced from all cells, effectively treating them as ‘bulk’ RNAseq data.

Strikingly, when flies adapted to high parasitism conditions they showed similar transcriptional changes, even when uninfected. This can be seen by comparing the induced changes in gene expression that occur after infection to the constitutive changes in gene expression that occur after adapting to high rates of parasitism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and</xref> ). Taking the 173 genes that had at least a 50% change in transcript levels after infection or selection, in every case the direction of change was the same after infection and adaptation to high parasitism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These genes were enriched for biological roles such as cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We verified that the evolved response mimicked the induced response by using quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the expression of the lamellocyte marker <italic>atilla</italic> and the anti-parasitoid effector gene <italic>PPO3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Again, we found that high rates of parasitism led to these immune-induced genes becoming constitutively upregulated. Therefore, as populations evolved resistance, the induced transcriptional response to infection has become in part genetically hard-wired and constitutive.</p><p>We took the same approach to examine how the induced transcriptional response to infection changed as populations evolved resistance. We found that the transcriptional response to infection involved the same genes in the different populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> vs 2C). However, the magnitude of the changes in gene expression was substantially less in populations that had evolved under high parasite pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> vs 2C). Therefore, the increase in constitutive gene expression has been matched by a decrease in induced expression. Again, this was verified by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with there being a ‘maximum’ level of expression of these genes, so an increase in constitutive gene expression will lead to a decrease in induced expression. In support of this, combining the constitutive and induced changes in gene expression, the hemocyte transcriptome after infection is similar in the populations that evolved under high levels of parasitism and the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, an induced response has become genetically fixed, as opposed to selection leading to a greater total response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>scRNA-seq reveals novel hemocyte types</title><p>The global changes in hemocyte transcriptomes could result from a change in the relative proportion of cell types in the hemocyte population, or from a shift in gene expression within existing cell types.

The crystal cells formed a single cluster of 906 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We found that all three analyses identified very similar clusters of crystal cells, lamellocytes and AMP-expressing plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, there was less correspondence between studies for the other clusters of plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Inducible cell states are present constitutively in resistant populations</title><p>Lamellocytes are key effector cells in the anti-parasitoid immune response. In populations that evolved without exposure to parasitoids, infection resulted in a large increase in the number of cells in all three lamellocyte clusters (LAM1-3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). In populations that evolved under high levels of parasitism, this inducible response becomes constitutive, with uninfected larvae having 3–5 fold more cells in LAM1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, this was matched by a reduction in the induced response, so the final number of cells in these clusters after infection was similar regardless of whether the populations had adapted to high or low parasitism rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). These results held when replicate populations were analysed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>) or when the number of cells in each library were down-sampled to match the library with the least number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Therefore, when populations evolved under high infection rates this led to the differentiation of specialised immune cells occurring in uninfected individuals.</p><p>To investigate the developmental origins of this change, we reconstructed the pathway by which plasmatocytes differentiate into mature lamellocytes. By subclustering the cells and ordering them along a pseudotemporal scale, we found a single lineage starting from the self-cycling plasmatocytes (PLASM1) and ending in LAM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Along this lineage there was a decrease in cell replication, with the largest fraction of cells in the G2M and S phase in PLASM1 and the largest fraction in G1 in LAM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, controlling for the effects of cell cycle had a negligible impact on the clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and the trajectory of lamellocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The expression of numerous genes changed as cells progressed along this trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), including increases in the expression of the lamellocyte effector gene <italic>PPO3</italic> and the lamellocyte marker <italic>atilla</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). To understand the functional significance of the changes we used a gene ontology analysis. Genes involved in actin-filament based processes and biological adhesion were significantly upregulated in the terminal lamellocyte cluster, possibly reflecting the changes in cell morphology and the role of lamellocytes in capsule formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, genes involved in extracellular structure organization were down-regulated as cells differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). This likely reflects the loss of the ability of cells to secrete extracellular matrix, which is a house-keeping function of plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olofsson and Page, 2005</xref>). Together, these results suggest that LAM1 and LAM2 cells are immature lamellocytes, while LAM3 cells are mature lamellocytes. Consistent with this finding, the mature lamellocyte cluster LAM3 strongly corresponds to mature lamellocyte clusters defined in previously published larval hemocyte scRNA-seq data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref> - LM-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref> - LM2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The differentiation of these cells explains the changes in gene expression that we observed in pooled cells after infection or selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)—168 of the 173 genes with at least a 50% change in expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> also change expression in the same direction as cells differentiate from plasmatocytes into lamellocytes (PLASM1 vs LAM3).

However, in contrast to our analysis of single-cell transcriptomes, there was little difference between selection regimes in the proportion of these cells in either infected or uninfected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; Selection regime x Treatment: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, d.f = 1, p=0.69; Selection regime: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.41, d.f = 1, p=0.52). This suggests that while the transcriptional state of cells has been constitutively activated, the change in cell morphology, corresponding to the final step of lamellocytes maturation, remains an inducible response. These cells may be equivalent to hemocytes called lamelloblasts, which morphologically resemble plasmatocytes but are induced by parasitoid infection and likely give rise to lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we used microscopy to measure both cell morphology and, as a marker of the transcriptional state of the cells, atilla expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In line with our scRNAseq data, both infection and adaptation to high parasitism rates increases the proportion of atilla positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; Selection Regime x Treatment: <italic>F</italic> = 25.7, d.f = 1,8, p=0.0009).

Furthermore, in populations raised under high parasitism the proportion of disrupted lymph glands increased up to 60% at the late L3 larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; selection regime*larval stage: χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.46, d.f. = 1, p=0.06). Therefore, adaptation to high parasitism leads to an increase in both the differentiation of lamellocyte precursors in the lymph gland and the premature disruption of lymph glands. Together our analyses of both circulating hemocytes and lymph glands indicate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations that evolved under the high parasitism regime are primed for lamellocyte differentiation.</p><p>Based on our analyses of both circulating hemocytes and lymph glands, we hypothesised that accelerated lamellocyte production during infection underlies the evolution of resistance. To investigate this hypothesis, we counted the number of hemocytes during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). In line with our earlier results, infected larvae from populations selected under high parasitism produced more hemocytes overall and more lamellocytes specifically (total hemocytes, selection regime: χ<sup>2</sup> = 70, d.f. = 1, p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>; lamellocytes, selection regime: χ<sup>2</sup> = 14.92, d.f. = 1, p=0.11×10<sup>−3</sup>). Supporting our hypothesis, the dynamics of lamellocyte production differs between selection regimes, with populations selected under high parasitism producing higher proportions of lamellocytes at earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>; Lamellocyte proportion, selection regime*time point: χ<sup>2</sup> = 36.56, d.f. = 3, p=5.69×10<sup>−8</sup>). At the early timepoint of 12 hr post infection, lamellocyte concentration was eight times higher in the populations that had evolved under high parasitism rates while total hemocytes was 2.5 times higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). This fast increase in circulating hemocytes numbers is likely explained by a combination of cell proliferation and relocation of sessile hemocytes into circulation, since lymph glands take longer to respond to parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref>). Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that constitutive activation of immune defences allows hosts to mount more rapid immune responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results support the hypothesis that natural selection favours constitutive defences when infection is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boots and Best, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shudo and Iwasa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Westra et al., 2015</xref>) by demonstrating that an inducible immune response becomes constitutive when populations frequently encounter a parasite. The induced immune response to parasitoids relies on the differentiation of lamellocytes from embryonic-derived plasmatocytes, lymph gland prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honti et al., 2014</xref>) and lymph gland plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). Evidence for immature lamellocytes during infection has previously come from patterns of marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honti et al., 2010</xref>) and recent scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>). Our results show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations evolve to produce these cells constitutively if they are frequently exposed to infection. Our results contrast with populations evolved with high levels of parasitism by the parasitoid wasp <italic>Asobara tabida</italic>, where there was no significant overlap of differentially expressed genes between selection and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wertheim et al., 2011</xref>). These results were generated by sequencing RNA extracted from the whole larval body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wertheim et al., 2011</xref>), so it is likely they may have missed changes in gene expression that occur in only a subset of immune cells. The difference between the studies could also result from the different genetic basis of resistance to the two wasp species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poirie et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The change in the transcriptional state of constitutive cells was not accompanied by morphological differentiation, suggesting that populations that adapt to high parasitism rates have their cellular immune defences in a state of readiness, with the final step of massive lamellocyte differentiation remaining an inducible response. Genes involved in cytoskeleton dynamics such as <italic>βTub60D</italic> and <italic>shot</italic> are among the genes with the greatest increases in expression as lamellocytes differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and these may be required for the final step of changing cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rizki and Rizki, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, the late stages of the immune response were not qualitatively altered after selection. Populations from both selection regimes had very similar hemocyte compositions in the late stages of the response, which is similar to patterns reported from populations artificially selected with <italic>Asobara tabida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salazar-Jaramillo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Evolving resistance to parasitoid wasps is costly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fellowes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kraaijeveld and Godfray, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGonigle et al., 2017</xref>), so inducible immunity may be an adaptation that allows uninfected individuals to avoid this cost under low parasitism conditions. The physiological mechanism that causes the cost is unknown. It is possible that the differentiation of immature lamellocytes diverts resources from other fitness-related traits as lamellocyte differentiation is energy-demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajgar et al., 2015</xref>). Trehalose is the most abundant circulating sugar in insects, and it can be cleaved into glucose by the enzyme trehalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mattila and Hietakangas, 2017</xref>). In support of previous results, we found that <italic>Trehalase</italic> and the trehalose transporter <italic>Tret1-1</italic> are upregulated in hemocytes after parasitoid infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajgar et al., 2015</xref>). Together with increased expression of glycolysis genes after infection, this is thought to redirect energy from development to immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajgar et al., 2015</xref>). We found that these genes are also upregulated in uninfected larvae after adaptation to high parasitism pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that the metabolic cost of immunity may be borne by uninfected flies in our resistant populations, potentially contributing to the cost of evolving resistance.</p><p>After infection, whether the host or parasitoid survives is a race between parasitoid development and the formation of a cellular capsule by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim-Jo et al., 2019</xref>). To increase their success, parasitoid wasps inject venom proteins and virus like particles (VLPs) during oviposition to suppress the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labrosse et al., 2003</xref>). These factors affect different components of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poirié et al., 2014</xref>), with the <italic>L. boulardi</italic> strain used in this study affecting lamellocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leitão et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, resistant populations must circumvent the suppressive effects of the wasp venoms and VLPs, and constitutive activation of cellular immunity may be a way to achieve this by killing the parasite before immunity is suppressed.</p><p>We find that populations adapted to high levels of parasitism evolved two phenotypes that likely explain their higher resistance. Firstly, they produce more hemocytes in homeostasis, which leads to a faster increase in circulating hemocytes in early time points of infection. Secondly, they produce lamellocytes more rapidly upon infection, likely largely due to the constitutive production of immature lamellocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic molecules could be more readily available as there is an increase in the constitutive expression of <italic>PPO3</italic> in populations adapted to high rates of parasitism. <italic>PPO3</italic> encodes an intracellular prophenoloxidase produced by lamellocytes that, when activated, is responsible for the capsule melanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>). We conclude that the constitutive activation of the cellular immune response likely explains the greatly increased resistance of populations adapted to high rates of parasitism.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Genes with significant upregulation in each cluster were identified using the MAST test statistic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>) after performing Bonferroni correction on the obtained P-values. Markers upregulated in each cluster were used for pathway enrichment analysis. Markers for the plasmatocyte progenitor population were identified through comparisons to the cell types containing other plasmatocyte-type cells. These markers were used for pathway enrichment analyses using the Flymine database and tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyne et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Comparison to other scRNA-seq datasets</title><p>We compared our clusters of cells with clusters defined in two published scRNA-seq data sets generated from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval hemocytes.

For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>, we combined the the WI and NI data sets into a single object. We normalized the counts, identified 2000 HVG for each data set and scaled the data using the default options in Seurat v3. We performed a reference-based label transfer using the <italic>FindTransferAnchors</italic> and <italic>TransferData</italic> functions with a ‘cca’ reduction and L2 normalization. We compared the three data sets in pairs and alternated the reference and query for each comparison. We plot the proportion of cells in query clusters that were predicted to belong to a given reference cluster using the R package ‘pheatmap’ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002630">SCR_002630</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Genomics Core Facility at Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, G Raddi and S Tattikota provided protocols for the scRNAseq.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing -

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bruno Lemaître as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bregje Wertheim (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>It has been previously shown that resistance to parasitoid wasps can emerge upon selection in wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations, and that this increased resistance correlates with a higher number of hemocytes. This paper combined experimental evolution and single cell transcriptomics to show that increased resistance to parasitoids upon several rounds of selection is caused by the presence of a differentiated subset of hemocytes (pre-lamellocyte) in the unchallenged state, which is usually found only upon wasp infestation. This led the authors to conclude that intense pathogen pressures can shift the immune system from inducible to constitutive, consistent with a theoretical framework indicating that elevated and constant pathogen pressure should lead to the emergence of constitutive defense. The approach is interesting, the paper well-written and the notion tested interesting. An important concern is the degree of advance over previous studies. Initial papers investigating how selection increases resistance to wasps have already shown that this was linked to an increase in hemocyte number. In a certain sense, this could be considered as a demonstration of a change from inducible to constitutive defense, although the emphasis of these papers was not on this point. In addition, the current work provides so far only limited information on this specific population of pre-lamellocytes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Analysis of single cell RNA-seq (Figure 3). Several RNA-seq papers have been published and it is important that the authors better relate their hemocyte clusters to other scRNA-seq datasets using the nomenclature of some of these papers. Would their data be deposited in a database? It would also be great to better describe the transcriptional profile, and not only focus on two genes, Attila and <italic>PPO3</italic>.</p><p>2) Discrepancy between the transcriptional and morphological changes in the hemocytes</p><p>a) Earlier studies, both on hemocyte flow cytometry and in other scRNA-seq experiments (as cited in the manuscript) revealed that the transdifferentiation into lamellocytes is a dynamic / continuous process, which may derive from several hemocyte lineages and from different hematopoietic organs. The authors here showed a discrepancy in the transcriptional and morphological changes in the hemocytes, and revealed that the plasmatocyte lineage was already starting the resemble the lamellocytes (in gene expression), without needing the induction by infection. Yet, they were not yet fully differentiated hemocytes based on morphology, and still needed infection to reach that stage. Therefore, the conclusion that the selected lines had &quot;hard-wired&quot; the inducible response into a constitutive response is not fully warranted (they do not fully differentiate, but proceed partially towards that state). Also, the differentiation of lamellocytes is fully attributed to originate from lymph glands and as originating from the plasmatocytes, while different organs and hemocyte lineages appear to contribute to the population of lamellocytes. The reviewer feel that all these aspects should be further explored and would deserve some mentioning in the Discussion.</p><p>b) Along this line, the authors could do a better job in characterizing the hemocyte populations of the evolved lines using available antibody, cooking and other melanization assays, phalloidin treatment…</p><p>c) Third instar hemocytes are found in the sessile state, in circulation or in the lymph gland. It could not be excluded that some of the changes they observed relate more to changes in hemocyte localization rather than differentiation. According to the Materials and methods, the authors has collected only the circulating hemocytes in the unchallenged state as they did not vortex larvae. It is very important to better compare the lymph gland, sessile and circulating compartments of the evolved and the non-evolved lines. This can be done by using various staining methods. The paper is written in such a way that selection acted only on circulating hemocytes but it could also act on hemocytes localization (decrease sessility), lymph gland maturation.</p><p>3) Gene expression was measured in circulating hemocytes at 48h after infection</p><p>The authors measured gene expression in circulating hemocytes, 48h after infection, at which stage hemocyte proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and parasitoid encapsulation is already well underway. The induction of the critical two processes, hemocyte proliferation and lamellocyte differentiation, may not be fully detectable from gene expression of only the circulating hemocytes themselves at this late stage of the immune response. Clearly, the authors do show that differentiation from circulating plasmatocytes can be detected, using pseudotime, and also revealed changes in gene expression in uninfected selected larvae. Yet, how induction in the lymph glands or sessile clusters has changed by experimental evolution, and whether the inducible response had indeed proceeded towards a constitutive response, requires further investigation along a wider time course (e.g. during early larval development) and perhaps in different tissues (e.g. lymph glands). If the author cannot address this, this aspect would need some discussion.</p><p>4) The changes in gene expression after selection can be presented clearer</p><p>The description of these results (subsection “Constitutive upregulation of immune-induced genes”), and Figure 2, are difficult to read and understand, while it is key to the claim that the inducible response has become hardwired into a constitutive response. In the text it starts out with saying that &quot;data was pooled to investigate global changes&quot;, but then it refers in Figure 2 to the x-axis which only provides the data for the control lines. This figure 2 is difficult to grasp, as the strong positive correlation in a) means something different (i.e. stronger constitutive response) than the very similar positive correlation in b) (weaker induced response), while c shows that control and selected larvae respond the same to infection. Is there a better way to tease apart these patterns in a figure, and to explain them in the text? Also, the data is all expressed in log2 fold changes (relative to non-infected control line individuals?). Also, for a subset of approximately 170 genes, the authors showed that the increase in expression had already started without the infection in the selection lines. Do the functional annotations of these genes reveal anything of interest for hemocyte proliferation and the differentiation towards lamellocytes?</p><p>5) Other studies came to partially contrasting, partially similar conclusions.</p><p>Transcriptomics on whole larvae after experimental evolution for high parasitism was done for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, using a different parasitoid species. In this study, they also found the typical increased density of hemocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> selected for increased parasitoid resistance, without being infected. However, contrary to the authors, this study concluded this increase in hemocytes could not be attribute to a pre-activation of the immune response. Additionally, the genes for hematopoiesis and for several effector genes showed opposite patterns to those that would explain the increased density of hemocytes in selected lines or for an pre-activation of the inducible response (Wertheim et al., 2011). However, in line with the findings for the current study, whole-larvae RNAseq after parasitoid infection did not result in substantial gene expression differences between selected lines and control lines (Salazar-Jaramillo et al., 2017), while substantial differences were reported in uninfected larvae of selection and control line larvae (Wertheim et al., 2011). These whole-body transcriptomics experiments lacked the resolution to measure specifically what changed in hemocytes, but both studies indicate that much of the increased resistance after selection is likely caused by changes in constitutive immunity, not by increasing the acute/inducible immune response.</p><p>6) Another concern is related to the parasitoid species. <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> is a parasitoid that relies partly on VLPs to overcome the host defense. This is not discussed, not even mentioned. Some older work (Fellowes et al. 1999, Evolution), shows that, while resistance evolves readily against <italic>L. boulardi</italic>, populations resistant against <italic>L. boulardi</italic> are also cross-resistant to another <italic>Leptopilina</italic> species. The immune effectors studied in this manuscript are obviously playing a significant role, but how do the evolved flies cope with the VLPs? The paper would benefit from at least discussing this issue.</p><p>7) The selection of larvae for the single cell work warrants some clarification. According to Figure 1B just under 50% of parasitoid resistant larvae showed an increased encapsulation response. This is presumably also related to the increase of expression of immune effectors. How is this accounted for in the single cell work? And if not, do you have any way to get an estimate of the variance in the response variables?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59095.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Analysis of single cell RNA-seq (Figure 3).

We have now included two major new experiments to address the questions raised by the reviewers.</p><p>To test if artificial selection with high parasitism increased the total number of hemocytes or their localization, we have measured hemocyte concentration after vortexing larvae with glass beads, a treatment that moves sessile hemocytes into circulation (Petraki, Alexander and Brückner, 2015). The results show that selection with high parasitism led to a higher production of hemocytes in the circulating and sessile compartments.</p><p>Results: “We found that populations maintained under the high parasitism regime increased the total number of hemocytes, rather than move cells from the sessile compartment into circulation (Figure 5—figure supplement 5; Selection regime: χ<sup>2</sup>=34.79, d.f=1, <italic>p</italic>=3.67x10<sup>-</sup> 9; Selection regime * Compartment: χ<sup>2</sup>=2.41, d.f=1, <italic>p</italic>=0.12).”</p><p>Materials and methods: “To relocate hemocytes from sessile compartments into circulation, groups of 10 larvae were transferred into a 2ml microcentrifuge tube with 0.5ml water and 0.5g of glass beads (425- 600μm, Sigma #G9268). The tubes were then vortexed at maximum speed for 1min (Petraki et al., 2015) and larvae prepared for hemolymph collection as described above.”</p><p>To test if artificial selection with high parasitism changed lymph gland maturation we collaborated with Michèle Crozatier and Ismael Morin-Poulard. Antibodies anti <italic>alpha-PS4</italic> and <italic>mys</italic> were used to detect immature (α-PS4<sup>-</sup> mys<sup>+</sup>) and mature lamellocytes (α-PS4<sup>+</sup> mys<sup>+</sup>). The results show that, similar to what happens in circulating hemocytes, lymph glands from larvae selected with high parasitism produce more immature lamellocytes in homeostasis.</p><p>Results: “Lamellocytes can differentiate from sessile or circulating plasmatocytes, or from cells in the lymph gland, which is the larval hematopoietic organ. […] Therefore, adaptation to high parasitism leads to an increase in both the differentiation of lamellocyte precursors in the lymph gland and the premature disruption of lymph glands.”</p><p>Materials and methods: “Lymph glands were dissected and processed as previously described (Krzemień et al., 2007).

To estimate hemocyte numbers during the course of infection, vials were incubated for 12, 24, 36 and 48h post infection.”</p><p>Results: “Based on our analyses of both circulating hemocytes and lymph glands, we hypothesised that accelerated lamellocyte production during infection underlies the evolution of resistance. […] Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that constitutive activation of immune defences allows hosts to mount more rapid immune responses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The changes in gene expression after selection can be presented clearer</p><p>The description of these results (subsection “Constitutive upregulation of immune-induced genes”), and Figure 2, are difficult to read and understand, while it is key to the claim that the inducible response has become hardwired into a constitutive response. In the text it starts out with saying that &quot;data was pooled to investigate global changes&quot;, but then it refers in Figure 2 to the x-axis which only provides the data for the control lines. This Figure 2 is difficult to grasp, as the strong positive correlation in a) means something different (i.e. stronger constitutive response) than the very similar positive correlation in b) (weaker induced response), while c shows that control and selected larvae respond the same to infection. Is there a better way to tease apart these patterns in a figure, and to explain them in the text?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of clarity of Figure 2 and have made two changes to make this key figure easier to understand. First, we have removed what was panel B in the previous submission, where we compared the induced response in high and no parasitism populations. On reflection, we believe this can be inferred from the remaining panels. Second, we have included a schematic in panel A depicting and numbering the comparisons we have performed. We hope this reiteration is clearer in showing that the pattern of gene expression in populations selected under high parasitism is similar to the pattern of gene expression observed following wasp infection in populations that did not undergo parasitoid selection pressures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the data is all expressed in log2 fold changes (relative to non-infected control line individuals?).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. This is indicated in each axis label in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, for a subset of approximately 170 genes, the authors showed that the increase in expression had already started without the infection in the selection lines. Do the functional annotations of these genes reveal anything of interest for hemocyte proliferation and the differentiation towards lamellocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>A gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that these 173 genes (Supplementary file 1) were enriched for many of the same biological function categories as genes that were upregulated in mature lamellocytes (LAM3 – Supplementary file 6). This is because many of the 173 genes were upregulated as lamellocytes differentiated and matured. We appreciate this comment as it shows that the “hardwiring” of transcription response to infection in selected populations is due to the constant differentiation of (pre)lamellocytes even in the absence of infection.</p><p>The revisions we made in response to this are detailed as part of our response to comment 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Other studies came to partially contrasting, partially similar conclusions.</p><p>Transcriptomics on whole larvae after experimental evolution for high parasitism was done for Drosophila, using a different parasitoid species. In this study, they also found the typical increased density of hemocytes in Drosophila selected for increased parasitoid resistance, without being infected. However, contrary to the authors, this study concluded this increase in hemocytes could not be attribute to a pre-activation of the immune response. Additionally, the genes for hematopoiesis and for several effector genes showed opposite patterns to those that would explain the increased density of hemocytes in selected lines or for an pre-activation of the inducible response (Wertheim et al., 2011). However, in line with the findings for the current study, whole-larvae RNAseq after parasitoid infection did not result in substantial gene expression differences between selected lines and control lines (Salazar-Jaramillo et al., 2017), while substantial differences were reported in uninfected larvae of selection and control line larvae (Wertheim et al., 2011). These whole-body transcriptomics experiments lacked the resolution to measure specifically what changed in hemocytes, but both studies indicate that much of the increased resistance after selection is likely caused by changes in constitutive immunity, not by increasing the acute/inducible immune response.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the authors to point to this omission in our Discussion. The differences between studies are important to discuss, although the causes for these differences can be very diverse and worth to explore in future experiments. Firstly, the wasp species used can have different impacts on composition of hemocytes since the genetic basis of resistance is, partially, different for the two species. This is evident because lines resistant for <italic>L. boulardi</italic> are cross-resistant to <italic>A. tabida</italic> but the opposite is not true (Fellowes, Kraaijeveld and Godfray, 1999). It is possible that this phenotype is specifically selected in lines selected for <italic>L. boulardi.</italic> Another difference is the type of sample analysed. Selection has an effect on hemocyte composition but this is still a subtle change, in comparison with the changes caused by infection. When the whole larva body is used to analyse gene expression the power to detect this differences may be too reduced. To add to this caveat, lines have a higher number of total hemocytes, a phenotype that can be detected with whole body RNA extraction but cannot be studied in our analysis, which can just compare differences between hemocyte populations.</p><p>To address these points we added the following text:</p><p>Discussion: “Our results contrast with populations evolved with high levels of parasitism by the parasitoid wasp <italic>Asobara tabida</italic>, where there was no significant overlap of differentially expressed genes between selection and infection (Wertheim et al., 2011). […] The could also result from the different genetic basis of resistance to the two wasp species (Poirie et al., 2000).”</p><p>“Furthermore, the late stages of the immune response was not qualitatively altered after selection. Populations from both selection regimes had very similar hemocyte compositions in the late stages of the response, which is similar to patterns reported from populations artificially selected with <italic>Asobara tabida</italic> (Salazar-Jaramillo et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Another concern is related to the parasitoid species. Leptopilina boulardi is a parasitoid that relies partly on VLPs to overcome the host defense. This is not discussed, not even mentioned. Some older work (Fellowes et al. 1999, Evolution), shows that, while resistance evolves readily against L. boulardi, populations resistant against L. boulardi are also cross-resistant to another Leptopilina species. The immune effectors studied in this manuscript are obviously playing a significant role, but how do the evolved flies cope with the VLPs? The paper would benefit from at least discussing this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include in the Discussion section the following discussion about VLPs:</p><p>“To increase their success, parasitoid wasps inject venom proteins and virus like particles (VLPs) during oviposition to suppress the host immune system (Labrosse et al., 2003). […] Thus, resistant populations must circumvent the suppressive effects of the wasp venoms and VLPs, and constitutive activation of cellular immunity may be a way to achieve this by killing the parasite before immunity is suppressed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The selection of larvae for the single cell work warrants some clarification. According to Figure 1B just under 50% of parasitoid resistant larvae showed an increased encapsulation response. This is presumably also related to the increase of expression of immune effectors. How is this accounted for in the single cell work? And if not, do you have any way to get an estimate of the variance in the response variables?</p></disp-quote><p>The larvae from infection treatments were selected randomly, i.e., it included larvae with capsules and without capsules. This is now made clear in the Materials and methods section “80 to 140 larvae per biological replica were randomly selected”. This was a limitation of our protocol that required a very large number of larvae being dissected in a short period of time to have enough hemocytes.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have neither have data to explore the genetic basis of resistance in these lines, nor any way to know is cells came from larvae that had an encapsulation response. Without it, it becomes speculative to address this point. For example, parasitoid infections in isogenic lines can result in intermediate proportion of larvae with capsules (Leitão et al., 2019), so there may not be genetic differences between larvae with and without an encapsulation response.</p></body></sub-article></article>
