coli</italic>, replisome and replication fork assembly is initiated by DnaB helicase loading at the chromosomal origin <italic>oriC</italic> via its interactions with the DnaA initiator and the DnaC helicase loader. Upon replication fork arrest, the replisome including DnaB dissociates from the stalled fork. Replication fork progression is rescued by primosomal protein PriA- or PriC-dependent pathway in which PriA and PriC promote reloading of DnaB in different mechanisms. However, the mechanism responsible for rescue of blocked replication initiation at <italic>oriC</italic> remains unclear. Here, we found that PriC rescued blocked replication initiation in cells expressing an initiation-specific DnaC mutant, in mutant cells defective in DnaA-DnaB interactions, and in cells containing truncated <italic>oriC</italic> sequence variants. PriC rescued DnaB loading at <italic>oriC</italic> even in the absence of Rep helicase, a stimulator of the PriC-dependent replication fork restart pathway. These results of in vitro reconstituted assays concordantly suggest that this initiation-specific rescue mechanism provides a bypass of the DnaA-DnaB interaction for DnaB loading by PriC-promoted loading of DnaB to the unwound <italic>oriC</italic> region. These findings expand understanding of mechanisms sustaining the robustness of replication initiation and specific roles for PriC in the genome maintenance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>replication initiation</kwd><kwd>replication origin</kwd><kwd>helicase loading</kwd><kwd>primosome</kwd><kwd>replication stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17H03656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katayama</surname><given-names>Tsutomu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20H03212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katayama</surname><given-names>Tsutomu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23K27131</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katayama</surname><given-names>Tsutomu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PriC provides a bypass mechanism for compromised helicase loading at the origin of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> chromosome, which ensures the robustness of the chromosome replication initiation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome replication is strictly regulated to ensure successful duplication of the genetic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa and Diffley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimwade and Leonard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kasho et al., 2023</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the ATP-bound form of the replication initiator protein DnaA (ATP-DnaA) forms a higher-order complex with DNA-bending protein IHF at the unique chromosomal origin <italic>oriC</italic>. This complex promotes local unwinding of <italic>oriC</italic> and recruits a pair of DnaB helicases, which are successively loaded to the single-stranded (ss) DNA regions in a bidirectional manner with the aid of DnaC helicase loader. ssDNA-loaded DnaB interacts with DnaG primase and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, resulting in assembly of the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chodavarapu and Kaguni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Donnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakiyama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakiyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakiyama et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wegrzyn and Konieczny, 2023</xref>). Replisomes disassemble when the replication fork stalls in front of an obstacle, such as protein-DNA roadblock or single-strand breaks. PriA recognizes the abandoned fork structure, which triggers reloading of DnaB with its partner proteins, such as PriB, PriC, DnaT, and DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller and Marians, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michel and Sandler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Windgassen et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, independently of PriA, PriC binds to the abandoned fork structure, triggering reloading of DnaB with the aid of DnaC, which is supported by Rep helicase depending on the fork structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heller and Marians, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandler et al., 1999</xref>). Also, homologous recombination mechanisms can rescue the abandoned replication fork during SOS responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asai and Kogoma, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kogoma, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michel et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast to these well-characterized mechanisms at abandoned forks, little is known about what happens when replication initiation is impeded at <italic>oriC</italic>.</p><p><italic>E. coli oriC</italic> comprises a Duplex-Unwinding Element (DUE) and a DnaA-Oligomerization Region (DOR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimwade and Leonard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kasho et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wegrzyn and Konieczny, 2023</xref>). The DUE contains 13-mer AT-rich sequence repeats known as L-, M-, and R-DUEs. The M- and R-DUEs are essential for stable DUE unwinding with the specific sequences (TT[A/G]T(T)) used for DnaA-ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozaki and Katayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakiyama et al., 2017</xref>). The L-DUE containing the TTATT sequence promotes efficient DnaB loading by expanding the unwound <italic>oriC</italic> region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakiyama et al., 2022</xref>). The DOR is divided into three subregions: the Left-, Middle-, and Right-DORs, which contain asymmetric 9-mer DnaA binding sequences (DnaA box) with the consensus sequence TTA[T/A]NCACA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozaki and Katayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rozgaja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakiyama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shimizu et al., 2016</xref>). The Left-DOR contains a cluster of unidirectionally aligned DnaA boxes, including high-affinity DnaA box R1, and low-affinity boxes R5M, τ1–2, and I1-2, with an IHF-binding region between R1 and R5M boxes. The Right-DOR contains an oppositely oriented DnaA box cluster including high-affinity DnaA box R4 and low-affinity boxes I3 and C1-3. These DnaA box clusters form frameworks for the Left- and Right-DnaA subcomplexes, respectively. DnaA bound to the R2 box, which solely resides in the Middle-DOR, stabilizes these DnaA subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rozgaja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shimizu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the AT-cluster (<named-content content-type="sequence">TATTAAAAAGAA</named-content>) region, which connects to the L-DUE, stimulates DnaB loading in the absence of the Right-DnaA subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakiyama et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic structures of <italic>oriC</italic> and DnaA and the replication initiation mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of <italic>oriC</italic> with the AT-rich cluster. <italic>oriC</italic> (245 bp) includes the Duplex-Unwinding Element (DUE, purple bar) and the DnaA-Oligomerization Region (DOR, gray bar). DUE is composed of three AT-rich 13-mer repeats termed L, M, and R. Dark purple boxes indicate the specific sequences involved in DnaA-ssDNA binding (TT[A/G]T(T)). The AT-cluster (purple dots) flanking the DUE outside <italic>oriC</italic> is a supplementary unwinding region. The DnaA-oligomerization region (DOR) contains 12 DnaA boxes (filled and open arrowheads representing sites with the full consensus TTA[A/T]NCACA sequence and sites with mismatches, respectively) and an IHF-binding region (IBR, green box). The DOR is subdivided into Left, Middle, and Right subregions. (<bold>B</bold>) Domains of DnaA. Domains I-IV are shown schematically, with amino acid residue numbers shown in each bracket. H/B motifs (V211 and R245, squares) and Arginine finger (R285, triangle) are indicated. The major functions of each domain are described on the right side of the structure. (<bold>C</bold>) DUE unwinding by the ssDUE recruitment mechanism. DnaA and IHF are indicated by red and green diagrams, respectively. When ATP-DnaA oligomerizes, DUE is unwound unstably by thermal motion and torsional stress. The M/R region of the DUE-upper strand (purple line) binds to R1-DnaA and R5M-DnaA via IHF-induced DNA bending, resulting in stable DUE unwinding. In addition to M/R-DUE, L-DUE is moderately unwound and interacts with the Right-DnaA subcomplex. (<bold>D</bold>) Mechanism for DnaB loading. Each Left-DnaA and Right-DnaA subcomplex binds to a DnaB hexamer (blue ovals) complexed with DnaC (yellow circles). (<bold>E</bold>) PriC-dependent fork rescue pathways. PriC (vivid red circle) promotes DnaB reloading to the abandoned fork, which exposes ssDNA regions. PriC binds to ssDNA at the replication fork, which remodels the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB)-ssDNA complex (for simplicity, SSB is omitted) for DnaC-dependent reloading of DnaB (<italic>upper panel</italic>). If the ssDNA region is accompanied with a nascent lagging strand, Rep helicase (green shape) is recruited by PriC and unwinds the lagging strand to expose the ssDNA region for DnaB loading (the lower case).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103340-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>DnaA comprises four functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Domain I binds to multiple proteins such as DnaB helicases and the DnaA-assembly stimulator DiaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keyamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keyamura et al., 2009</xref>). Domain II is a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nozaki and Ogawa, 2008</xref>). Domain III contains AAA+ (ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities) motifs, which are involved in tight ATP/ADP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and domain III-III interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duderstadt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erzberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Felczak and Kaguni, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ozaki et al., 2012</xref>). The arginine finger motif (Arg285) in domain III interacts with ATP bound to domain III of adjacent DnaA protomers, stimulating DnaA complex formation in a cooperative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noguchi et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, H/B motifs (Val211 and Arg245) in this domain bind to ssDNA in a sequence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakiyama et al., 2017</xref>). Domain IV, which comprises the helix-turn-helix motif, recognizes the DnaA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujikawa et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>For replication initiation, ATP-DnaA molecules cooperatively oligomerize at <italic>oriC</italic> to form the Left- and Right-DnaA subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Formation of these complexes is stimulated by homotetrameric DiaA protein, which binds up to four DnaA molecules via domain I, including Phe46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keyamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keyamura et al., 2009</xref>). In concert with DNA superhelicity and thermal energy, the DUE undergoes initial unstable unwinding, which is stabilized through specific interaction between H/B motifs of domain III in the Left-DnaA subcomplex and the upper strand of M- and R-DUEs. This interaction is facilitated by sharp DNA bending by IHF, resulting in stable DUE unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakiyama et al., 2017</xref>). When the single-stranded region is expanded to the L-DUE, the resultant single-stranded L-DUE binds the H/B motifs within the Right-DnaA subcomplex, maximizing the efficiency of the DnaB loading process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakiyama et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, two DnaB helicases are loaded onto each ssDUE strand through interactions with DnaC and DnaA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). DnaC binding to DnaB changes the closed ring structure of the DnaB hexamer to an open spiral form to allow it to encircle ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagata et al., 2020</xref>). Each Left- and Right-DnaA subcomplex binds a DnaB-DnaC complex via high-affinity interaction between DnaA Phe46 and DnaB Leu160 and guides the DnaB-DnaC complexes to unwound ssDUE strands via a low-affinity interaction between DnaA domain III His136 and DnaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). Upon interaction with ssDNA, DnaC dissociates from DnaB, which enables migration of DnaB hexamer with helicase action. The pair of DnaB helicases loaded onto the ssDNA strands progress in opposite directions, forming replisomes with DnaG and Pol III holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chodavarapu and Kaguni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Donnell et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Replication restart pathways ensure fork progression of the entire chromosome under conditions that trigger replisome disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller and Marians, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michel and Sandler, 2017</xref>). PriA helicase-dependent pathways predominantly facilitate DnaB reloading onto abandoned forks in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores et al., 2002</xref>). PriA is a 3’–5’ DNA helicase and has a specific affinity for forked DNA structures comprising one parental dsDNA and two newly synthesized sister dsDNA strands. This permits PriA recognition of the abandoned replication fork and the subsequent unwinding of the nascent lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duckworth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Windgassen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Windgassen and Keck, 2016</xref>). The resultant unwound ssDNA associates with PriB and DnaT to promote reloading of DnaB helicase with the aid of DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duckworth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller and Marians, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopper et al., 2007</xref>). In the absence of PriB, PriC participates in a PriA-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandler et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, PriA is required for <italic>oriC</italic>/DnaA-independent chromosomal replication called stable DNA replication (SDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masai et al., 1994</xref>), which is promoted by UV irradiation (inducible iSDR) and loss of <italic>rnhA</italic> or <italic>recG</italic> (constitutive cSDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kogoma, 1997</xref>). In both mechanisms, replication is initiated at triple-stranded structures comprising a dsDNA-ssDNA hybrid (D-loop) or a dsDNA-ssRNA hybrid (R-loop) generated at specific chromosomal loci. These structures mimic the abandoned fork structure, thereby allowing helicase loading to occur similarly to that during PriA-dependent fork restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masai et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Independently of PriA, PriC can restart replication from abandoned forks through its interaction with the ssDNA region and SSB (Single-Stranded DNA Binding protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller and Marians, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wessel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>). PriC consists of N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which are composed of α helices and are connected by a short linker. The PriC C-terminal domain remodels the SSB-ssDNA complex, which is a prerequisite for the recruitment of DnaB helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller and Marians, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wessel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wessel et al., 2016</xref>). PriC also interacts with Rep helicase. When the length of the ssDNA gap within the abandoned fork is short, Rep helps expand the ssDNA gap, promoting PriC-mediated remodeling of the SSB-ssDNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller and Marians, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heller and Marians, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>).

However, the mechanism underlying PriC-promoted rescue of blocks in replication initiation remains a mystery.

The <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells and its derivative cells were grown exponentially at 30 °C, followed by incubation at 40 °C for 90 min prior to DNA extraction.

However, the mechanisms that rescue blocked initiations are largely unknown. To elucidate such mechanisms, we investigated PriC-promoted replication initiation under various challenging conditions. We showed that PriC was necessary for the optimal growth of <italic>dnaC2</italic> cells at the semi-restrictive temperature and for replication initiation even at the permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that PriC contributes to replication initiation rescue in <italic>dnaC2</italic> cells by facilitating DnaB helicase loading at <italic>oriC</italic>. Furthermore, we observed that PriC was necessary for the optimal growth of cells in which the DnaA-DnaB interaction was inhibited by DiaA overexpression or DnaA F46A H136A double mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In addition, PriC was stimulatory for the cell growth and replication initiation bearing <italic>oriC</italic> mutations that impair efficient DnaB loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These results, together with results of form I* formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggest that PriC bypasses the need for the DnaA-DnaB interaction by binding to unwound <italic>oriC</italic> DNA and recruiting DnaB to facilitate its loading onto ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This mechanism is similar to that proposed for the rescue of abandoned replication forks by PriC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for PriC-promoted replication initiation.</title><p>PriC-promoted rescue of blocked DnaA-<italic>oriC-</italic>dependent replication initiation. <italic>oriC</italic>, DnaA, IHF, DnaB, and DnaC are illustrated as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. When tight DnaA binding of DiaA (dark gray circle) (or DnaA F46A H136A double mutations) inhibits DnaB recruitment, PriC (Brilliant red circle) binds to a stably unwound DUE strand, recruiting a DnaB-DnaC complex to lower strand of DUE instead of Left-DnaA subcomplex. When a sufficient ssDNA region is exposed, PriC then recruits the DnaB-DnaC complex to the opposite strand.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103340-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Also, PriC contributes to replication initiation rescue in <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells at 37 °C. It is presumable that DnaA46 protein becomes partially denatured at the sub-permissive temperature of 37 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang and Kaguni, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr and Kaguni, 1996</xref>). This partial denaturation should impair both origin unwinding and helicase loading, though not to the extent that cell viability is lost. The <italic>priC</italic> deletion should further exacerbate helicase loading defects by inhibiting the bypass mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), resulting in the lethality of <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells at this temperature.</p><p>There might remain an alternative possibility that PriC could stabilize the DnaA-DnaB interaction for rescuing the impaired DnaB loading process. However, we believe that this possibility is not very likely. Given that interactions between DnaA and DnaB during DnaB loading to <italic>oriC</italic> are highly dynamic and involve regulated multiple steps, the stabilization of the DnaA-DnaB interaction by PriC, even if it occurs, carries a considerable risk of inhibiting the DnaB loading by constructing abortive complexes. In addition, DnaA-DiaA binding is very tight and stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keyamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keyamura et al., 2009</xref>). Even if WT DnaA and WT DnaB are present, PriC can rescue the initiation defects of <italic>oriC</italic> mutants. Based on these facts and the known characteristics of PriC, it is more reasonable to infer that PriC provides a bypass of DnaB loading at <italic>oriC</italic>, similar to the mechanism at the stalled replication fork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p><p>The finding that PriC failed to stimulate form I* formation in the presence of DnaA V211A, which lacks DUE unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), provides mechanistic insight into PriC-dependent replication initiation at <italic>oriC</italic>. We propose that PriC-dependent replication initiation possibly begins with the recognition of a stably unwound ssDNA region by PriC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Consistent with this perspective, PriC ssDNA-binding activity and ssDNA regions have been reported to be important for PriC-promoted replication fork rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McMillan and Keck, 2024</xref>). The failure of PriC to stimulate replication initiation in ∆<italic>diaA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) is also potentially explained by the reduced DUE unwinding caused by destabilization of the DnaA-<italic>oriC</italic> complex in ∆<italic>diaA</italic> cells. Based on this, we suggest that the stably unwound ssDNA region in <italic>oriC</italic> serves as a distinctive feature for PriC-promoting DnaB loading at <italic>oriC</italic> for replication initiation rescue, and distinguishes it from PriA-dependent replication restart, which requires the specific structure of the replication fork DNA consisting of sister dsDNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller and Marians, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Windgassen et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike PriA, PriC can interact with the simple ssDNA to reload DnaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found that cells with DnaA F46A H136A double mutations grew well, but only when the cells expressed PriC. As for the DnaA F46A single mutant, our previous studies show that DnaA F46A has a limited residual activity in vivo (unlike in vitro), and allows slow growth of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2007</xref>). The growth of cells expressing the DnaA H136A single mutant was severely inhibited even when the cells expressed PriC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakiyama et al., 2018</xref>). The His136 residue is located within the weak, secondary DnaB interaction region in DnaA, and is crucial for DnaB loading onto <italic>oriC</italic> ssDNA. Although domain I in DnaA H136A can stably tether DnaB-DnaC complexes to DnaA complexes on <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakiyama et al., 2018</xref>), the complexes fail to load DnaB onto <italic>oriC</italic> ssDNA even in the presence of PriC. It is possible that the interaction between PriC and DnaB is inhibited by stable DnaB binding to DnaA domain I. This idea is consistent with the in vivo feature of DnaA F46A single mutant. Conversely, the PriC-DnaB interaction may inhibit the interaction between DnaA domain I and DnaB, as suggested by the inhibitory effect of PriC on DnaB loading in vitro in the presence of WT DnaA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, this inhibitory effect of PriC was not observed in vivo, suggesting that PriC-DnaB binding could involve still unknown factors and regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>PriC supported cSDR-dependent growth in <italic>dnaA46 rnhA::cat</italic> double mutant cells without stimulating the initiation of cSDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this mutant, cSDR predominantly initiates from the <italic>ter</italic> region, resulting in head-on collisions between the replisome and transcription complexes in <italic>rrn</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maduike et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that in cSDR cells, PriC specifically rescues abandoned forks, including those generated during head-on conflicts between the replisome and transcription complexes.</p><p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<italic>B. subtilis</italic>), which expresses a PriA homolog but not a PriC homolog, employs a PriA-independent fork rescue pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruand et al., 2001</xref>). In this pathway, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> DnaC (<italic>Bsu</italic>DnaC) helicase is reloaded using the helicase loader DnaI together with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> DnaB (<italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB) and DnaD coloaders. The ssDNA-binding activity of <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB has a crucial role in this PriA-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruand et al., 2005</xref>). SsDNA-bound <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB remodels the SSB-ssDNA complex with DnaD and recruits <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaC. These functions of <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB are similar to the proposed functions of PriC in replication fork rescue in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In addition, <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaC helicase is recruited to <italic>oriC</italic> by concerted actions of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> DnaA and the DnaD-<italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB complex, which has an essential role in chromosome replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jameson and Wilkinson, 2017</xref>), suggesting a similar role of <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB to PriC in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing DnaA F46A H136A. These similarities between PriC and <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB in these two evolutionarily distant bacterial species suggest that the mechanism of PriC-promoted helicase loading is conserved among bacterial species despite the absence of sequence conservation of PriC and <italic>Bsu</italic>DnaB homologs.</p><p>Based on our results, we propose the abnormal competition between DnaB and DiaA for DnaA domain I could represent a form of intrinsic replication initiation stress in bacteria with conserved DiaA homologs.

Portions of the cultures were diluted a thousand-fold into 5 ml LB medium and incubated at 30℃ until the absorbance of the culture (A<sub>600</sub>) reached 0.1. The remaining portions were further incubated to determine the doubling time (Td) by measuring A<sub>600</sub> every 20 min. At A<sub>600</sub> 0.1, aliquots of the cultures were fixed in 70% ethanol to analyze cell mass using the Multisizer 3 Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The remaining cultures were further incubated for 4 hr with 0.3 mg/mL rifampicin and 0.01 mg/mL cephalexin to allow run-out replication of chromosomal DNA. The resultant cells were fixed in 70% ethanol. After DNA staining with SYTOX Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), cellular DNA contents were analyzed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The number of the origins/cell (ori/cell) was determined from the histograms of flow cytometry analysis. The number of ori/cell was divided by the mean cell mass determined by cell mass analysis, resulting in ori/mass ratios.

Yoshida et al. convincingly show that DnaA does not exclusively do loading of the replicative helicase at the <italic>E. coli</italic> oriC, but that PriC can also perform this function. Importantly, PriC seems to contribute to helicase loading even in wt cells albeit to a much lesser degree than DnaA. On the other hand, PriC takes a larger role in helicase loading during aberrant initiation, i.e. when the origin sequence is truncated or when the properties of initiation proteins are suboptimal. Here highlighted by mutations in dnaA or dnaC.</p><p>This a major finding because it clearly demonstrates that the two roles of DnaA in the initiation process can be separated into initially forming an open complex at the DUE region by binding/nucleation onto DnaA-boxes and second in loading of the helicase. Whereas these two functions are normally assumed to be coupled, the present data clearly show that they can be separated and that PriC can perform at least part of the helicase loading provided that an area of duplex opening is formed by DnaA.</p><p>This puts into questions the interpretation of a large body of previous work on mutagenesis of oriC and dnaA to find a minimal oriC/DnaA complex in many bacteria. In other words, mutants in which oriC is truncated/mutated may support initiation of replication and cell viability only in the presence of PriC. Such mutants are capable to generate single strand opening but may fail to load the helicase in absence of PriC. Similarly, dnaA mutants may generate aberrant complex on oriC that trigger strand opening but are incapable of loading DnaB unless PriC is present.</p><p>In the present work, the sequence of experiments presented is logical and the manuscript is clearly written and easy to follow. The very last part regarding PriC in cSDR replication does not add much to the story and may be omitted.</p><p>I have a few specific questions/comments</p><p>The partial complementation of the dnaC2 strain by PriC seems quite straightforward since this particular mutation leads to initiation arrest at the open complex stage and this sets the stage for PriC to load the helicase. The situation is somewhat different for dnaA46. Why is this mutation partly complemented by PriC at 37C? DnaA46 binds neither ATP nor ADP, yet it functions in initiation at permissive temperature. At nonpermssive temperature, it binds oriC as well but does not lead to initiation. Does the present data imply that the true initiation defect of DnaA46 lies in helicase loading? The authors need to comment on this in the text.</p><p>Relating to the above. In Fig. 3 it is shown that the pFH plasmid partly complement dnaA46 in a PriC dependent manner. Again, it would be nice to know the nature of the DnaA46 protein defect.

It is reported that PriC is necessary for the growth and control of DNA replication initiation under diverse conditions where helicase loading is perturbed at the chromosome origin oriC. A model is proposed where PriC loads helicase onto ssDNA at the open complex formed by DnaA at oriC. Reconstituted helicase loading assays in vitro support the model. The manuscript is well-written and has a logical narrative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for understanding this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Questions/Comments:</p><p>An important observation here is that a ΔpriC mutant alone displays under-replication, suggesting that this helicase loading pathway is physiologically relevant. Has this PriC phenotype been reported previously? If not, would it be possible to confirm this result using an independent experimental approach (e.g. marker frequency analysis or fluorescent reporter-operator systems)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for this comment. This study provides the first direct evidence for PriC’s role in initiation of chromosome replication. Given the change of the <italic>oriC</italic> copy number of ∆<italic>priC</italic> cells in non-stressed conditions is only slight, resolution of the suggested methods is clearly not high enough to distinguish the differences in the <italic>oriC</italic> copy number between <italic>priC+</italic> (WT) and ∆<italic>priC</italic> cells. Thus, to corroborate the ∆<italic>priC</italic> phenotype, we additionally analyzed using flow cytometry <italic>priC+</italic> and ∆<italic>priC</italic> cells growing under various nutrition and thermal conditions.</p><p>As shown in Figure 2-figure supplement 1 of the revised version, the fraction of cells with non-2<sup>n</sup> <italic>oriC</italic> copies was slightly higher in ∆<italic>priC</italic> cells compared to <italic>priC+</italic> cells. Furthermore, when grown in M9 minimal medium at 37°C, ∆<italic>priC</italic> mutant cells exhibited slightly reduced ori/mass values. These are supportive to the idea that inhibition of replication initiation occurs at low frequency even in the WT <italic>dnaA</italic> and <italic>dnaC</italic> background, and that PriC function is necessary to ensure normal replication initiation. Related descriptions have been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is PriA necessary for the observed PriC activity at oriC? Is there evidence that PriC functions independently of PriA in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in Introduction of the original manuscript, PriA is a 3’-to-5’ helicase which specifically binds to the forked DNA with the 3’-end of the nascent DNA strand. Thus, structural specificity of target DNA is essentially different between PriA and PriC. Consistent with this, our in vitro data indicate that PriC alone is sufficient to rescue the abortive helicase loading at <italic>oriC</italic> (Figure 7), indicating that PriA is principally unnecessary for PriC activity at <italic>oriC</italic>. Consistently, as described in Introduction, PriC can interact with ssDNA to reload DnaB (Figure 1E). Nevertheless, a possibility that PriA might participate in the PriC-dependent DnaB loading rescue at <italic>oriC</italic> in vivo can not be completely excluded. However, elucidation of this possibility is clearly beyond the scope of the present study and should be analyzed in the future. An additional explanation has been included in Discussion of the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is PriC helicase loading activity in vivo at the origin direct (the genetic analysis leaves other possibilities tenable)? Could PriC enrichment at oriC be detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation?</p></disp-quote><p>These are advanced questions about genomic dynamics of PriC. Given that PriC facilitates DnaB reloading at stalled replication forks (Figure 1E) (Heller and Marians, Mol Cell., 2005; Wessel et al., J Biol Chem, 2013; Wessel et al., J Biol Chem, 2016), PriC might interact with the whole genome and its localization might not necessarily exhibit a preference for <italic>oriC</italic> in growing cells. Analysis about these advanced questions is interesting but is beyond the scope of the present study and should be analyzed in the future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This is a great paper. Yoshida et al. convincingly show that DnaA does not exclusively do loading of the replicative helicase at the <italic>E. coli</italic> oriC, but that PriC can also perform this function. Importantly, PriC seems to contribute to helicase loading even in wt cells albeit to a much lesser degree than DnaA. On the other hand, PriC takes a larger role in helicase loading during aberrant initiation, i.e. when the origin sequence is truncated or when the properties of initiation proteins are suboptimal. Here highlighted by mutations in dnaA or dnaC.</p><p>This is a major finding because it clearly demonstrates that the two roles of DnaA in the initiation process can be separated into initially forming an open complex at the DUE region by binding/nucleation onto DnaA-boxes and second by loading of the helicase. Whereas these two functions are normally assumed to be coupled, the present data clearly show that they can be separated and that PriC can perform at least part of the helicase loading provided that an area of duplex opening is formed by DnaA. This puts into question the interpretation of a large body of previous work on mutagenesis of oriC and dnaA to find a minimal oriC/DnaA complex in many bacteria. In other words, mutants in which oriC is truncated/mutated may support the initiation of replication and cell viability only in the presence of PriC. Such mutants are capable of generating single-strand openings but may fail to load the helicase in the absence of PriC. Similarly, dnaA mutants may generate an aberrant complex on oriC that trigger strand opening but are incapable of loading DnaB unless PriC is present.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank Revierwer#2 for the very positive comments about our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the present work, the sequence of experiments presented is logical and the manuscript is clearly written and easy to follow. The very last part regarding PriC in cSDR replication does not add much to the story and may be omitted.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that the role PriC in stimulating cSDR was unclear, we believe that our finding that PriC has little or no role in cSDR, despite being a negative result, is valuable for the general readership of eLife. To further assess impact of PriC on cSDR and as recommended by Referee #1, we carried out the chromosome loci copy-number analysis by the whole-genome sequencing. As shown in Figure 8-supplement 1 of the revised version, the results support our conclusion from the original version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>At the abandoned replication fork, loading of DnaB helicase requires assistance from PriABC, repA, and other protein partners, but it does not require replication initiator protein, DnaA.

Both assess cell viability and growth; while colony formation is quantitative, spotting is qualitative. Particularly in this study, where differences appear minor but draw significant conclusions, the colony formation assays representing growth versus moderate or severe inhibition are a more precise measure of viability.</p></disp-quote><p>We used serial dilutions of the cell culture for the spotting assay and thus this assay should be referred as semi-quantitative rather than simply qualitative. For more quantitative assessment of viability, we analyzed the growth rates of cells and the chromosome replication activity using flow cytometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2</p><p>The reduced number of two oriC copies per cell in the dnaA46priC-deficient strain was considered moderate inhibition. When combined with the data suggested by the dnaAC2priC-deficient strain containing two origins in cells with or without PriC (indicating no inhibition)-the conclusion was drawn that PriC rescue blocked replication via assisting DnaC-dependent DnaB loading step at oriC ssDNA.</p><p>The results provided by Saifi B, Ferat JL. PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e33613 suggests the idea that in an asynchronous DnaA46 ts culture, the rate by which dividing cells start accumulating arrested replication forks might differ (indicated by the two subpopulations, one with single oriC and the other with two oriC). DnaA46 protein has significantly reduced ATP binding at 42C, and growing the strain at 42C for 40-80 minutes before releasing them at 30 C for 5 minutes has the probability that the two subpopulations may have differences in the active ATP-DnaA. The above could be why only 50% of cells contain two oriC. Releasing cells for more time before adding rifampicin and cephalexin could increase the number of cells with two oriCs. In contrast, DnaC2 cells have inactive helicase loader at 42 C but intact DnaA-ATP population (WT-DnaA at 42 or 30 C should not differ in ATP-binding). Once released at 30 C, the reduced but active DnaC population could assist in loading DnaB to DnaA, engaged in normal replication initiation, and thus should appear with two oriC in a PriC-independent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a question about <italic>dnaA46</italic> Δ<italic>priC</italic> mutant cells. Inhibition of the replication forks causes inhibition of RIDA (the DNA-clamp complex-dependent DnaA-ATP hydrolysis) system, resulting in the increase of ATP-DnaA molecules (Kurokawa et al. (1999) EMBO J.). Thus, if Δ<italic>priC</italic> inhibits the replication forks significantly, the ATP-DnaA level should increase and initiation should be stimulated. However, the results of Figure 2BC are opposite, indicating inhibition of initiation by Δ<italic>priC</italic>. Thus, we infer that the inhibition of initiation in the Δ<italic>priC</italic> cells is not related to possible changes in the ATP-DnaA level. Even if the ATP-DnaA levels are different in subpopulations in <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells, Δ<italic>priC</italic> mutation should not affect the ATP-DnaA levels significantly. Thus, we infer that even in <italic>dnaA46</italic> Δ<italic>priC</italic> mutant cells, Δ<italic>priC</italic> mutation directly affect initiation mechanisms, rather than indirectly through the ATP-DnaA levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Broadly, the evidence provided by the authors may support the primary hypothesis. Still, it could call for an alternative hypothesis: PriC involvement in stabilizing the DnaA-DnaB complex (this possibility could exist here). To prove that the conclusions made from the set of experiments in Figures 2 and 3, which laid the foundations for supporting the primary hypothesis, require insights using on/off rates of DnaB loading onto DnaA and the stability of the complexes in the presence or absence of PriC, I have a few other reasons to consider the latter arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very careful consideration. However, we infer that stabilization of the DnaA-DnaB interaction by PriC, even if present, does not always result in stimulation of DnaB loading to <italic>oriC.</italic> Given that interactions between DnaA and DnaB during DnaB loading to <italic>oriC</italic> are highly dynamic and complicated with multiple steps, stabilization of the DnaA-DnaB interaction by PriC, even if it occurs, has a considerable risk of inhibiting the DnaB loading by constructing abortive complexes. In addition, DnaA-DiaA binding is very tight and stable (Keyamura et al., 2007, 2009). Even if WT DnaA and WT DnaB are present, PriC can rescue the initiation defects of <italic>oriC</italic> mutants. Based on these facts and the known characteristics of PriC as explained in Introduction, it is more reasonable to infer that PriC provides a bypass of DnaB loading even at <italic>oriC</italic>, as proposed for the mechanism at the stalled replication fork. However, we cannot completely rule out the indicated possibility and these explanations are included in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3</p><p>One should consider the fact that dnA46 is present in these cells. Overexpressing pdnaAFH could produce mixed multimers containing subunits of DnaA46 (reduced ATP binding) and DnaAFH (reduced DnaB binding). Both have intact DnaA-DnaA oligomerization ability. The cooperativity between the two functions by a subpopulation of two DnaA variants may compensate for the individual deficiencies, making a population of an active protein, which in the presence of PriC could lead to the promotion of the stable DnaA: DnaBC complexes, able to initiate replication. In the light of results presented in Hayashi et al. and J Biol Chem. 2020 Aug 7;295(32):11131-11143, where mutant DnaBL160A identified was shown to be impaired in DnaA binding but contained an active helicase function and still inhibited for growth; how one could explain the hypothesis presented in this manuscript. If PriC-assisted helicase loading could bypass DnaA interaction, then how growth inhibition in a strain carrying DnaBL160A should be described. However, seeing the results in light of the alternative possibility that PriC assists in stabilizing the DnaA: DnaBC complex is more compatible with the previously published data.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, in this comment, there is a crucial misunderstanding in the growth of cells bearing DnaA L160A. Hayashi et al. reported that the <italic>dnaB</italic>(Ts) cells bearing the <italic>dnaB</italic> L160A allele grew slowly and formed colonies even at 42°C. This feature is similar to the growth of <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells bearing <italic>dnaA</italic> F46A H136A allele (Figure 2). Thus, the results of <italic>dnaB</italic> L160A cells are consistent with our model and support the idea that PriC partially rescues the growth inhibition of cells bearing the DnaB L160A allele by bypassing the strict requirement for the DnaA-DnaB interaction. Nevertheless, we have to be careful about a possibility that DnaB L160A could affect interaction with PriC, which we are going to investigate for a future paper.</p><p>As suggested, if mixed complexes of DnaA46 and DnaA F46A H136A proteins are formed, those might retain partial activities in <italic>oriC</italic> unwinding and DnaB interaction although those cells are inviable at 42°C without PriC. It is noteworthy that in the specific <italic>oriC</italic> mutants which are impaired in DnaB loading (e.g., Left-<italic>oriC</italic>), PriC effectively rescues the initiation and cell growth. In these cells, both DnaA and DnaB are intact. Thus, the idea that only mutant DnaA (or DnaB) protein is simulated specifically via PriC interaction is invalid. Even in cells bearing wild-type <italic>oriC</italic>, DnaA and DnaB, contribution of PriC for initiation is detected.</p><p>In addition, as described in the above response, given that interactions between DnaA and DnaB during DnaB loading to <italic>oriC</italic> are very dynamic and complicated with multiple steps, stabilization of the DnaA-DnaB interaction by PriC, even if present, would not simply result in stimulation of DnaB loading to <italic>oriC</italic>; rather we think a probability that it would inhibit the DnaB loading by constructing abortive complexes. Based on the known characteristics of PriC as explained in Introduction, it is more reasonable to infer that PriC provides a bypass of DnaB loading even at <italic>oriC</italic>, as proposed for the mechanism at the stalled replication fork.</p><p>However, we cannot completely rule out the indicated possibility and this explanation has been described in the revised version as noted in response to the above question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4</p><p>Overexpression of DiaA could contribute to removing a higher number of DnaA populations. This could be more aggravated in the absence of PriC (DiaA could titrate out more DnaA)-the complex formed between DnaA: DnaBC is not stable, therefore reduced DUE opening and replication initiation leading to growth inhibition (Fig. 4A ∆priC-pNA135). Figure 7C: Again, in the absence of PriC, the reduced stability of DnaA: DnaBC complex leaves more DnaA to titrate out by DiaA, and thus less Form I*. However, adding PriC stabilizes the DnaA: DnaBC hetero-complexes, with reduced DnaA titration by DiaA, producing additional Form I*. Adding a panel with DnaBL160A that does not interact with DnaA but contains helicase activity could be helpful. Would the inclusion of PriC increase the ability of mutant helicase to produce additional Form I*?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the proposed idea is biased disregarding the fact that DiaA effectively stimulates assembling processes of DnaA molecules at <italic>oriC</italic>. As <italic>oriC</italic> contains multiple DnaA boxes and multiple DnaA molecules are recruited there, DiaA will efficiently facilitate assembling of DnaA molecules on <italic>oriC</italic>. Even DnaA molecules of DnaA-DiaA complexes can efficiently bind to <italic>oriC</italic>. This is consistent with in vitro experiments showing that higher levels of DiaA stimulate assembly of DnaA molecules and <italic>oriC</italic> unwinding (i.e., DUE opening) but even excessive levels of DiaA do not inhibit those reactions (Keyamura et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2009) 284, 25038-25050). However, as shown in Figure 9, DiaA tightly binds to the specific site of DnaA which is the same as the DnaB L160-binding site, which causes inhibition of DnaA-DnaB binding (<italic>ibid</italic>). These are consistent with in vivo experiments, and concordantly consistent with the idea that the excessive DiaA level inhibits interaction and loading of DnaB by the DnaA-<italic>oriC</italic> complexes, but not <italic>oriC</italic> unwinding (i.e., DUE opening) in vivo. Also, as mentioned above, we do not consider that stabilization of DnaA-DnaBC complex simply results in stimulation of DnaB loading to <italic>oriC</italic>. Based on the known characteristics of PriC, it is more reasonable to infer that PriC provides a bypass of DnaB loading even at <italic>oriC</italic>, as proposed for the mechanism at the stalled replication fork (Figure 1E), as described in the above response.</p><p>As for DnaB L160A, as mentioned above, we are currently investigating interaction modes between DnaB and PriC. While investigating DnaB L160A could further support our model, we believe its contribution to the present manuscript would be incremental. In addition, there is a possibility that DnaA L160A could affect interaction with PriC. Thus, analysis of DnaB mutants in this PriC rescue mechanisms should be addressed in future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5</p><p>The interpretation is that colony formation of the Left-oriC ∆priC double mutant was markedly compromised at 37°C (Figure 5B), and 256 the growth defects of the Left-oriC mutant at 25{degree sign}C and 30{degree sign}C were aggravated. However, prima facia, the relative differences in the growth of cells containing and lacking PriC are similar. Quantitative colony-forming data is required to claim these results. Otherwise, it is slightly confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>The indicated concern was raised due to our typing error lacking <italic>∆priC</italic>. In the revised manuscript, we have amended as follows: the cell growth of the Left-<italic>oriC</italic> ∆<italic>priC</italic> double mutant was markedly compromised at 37°C and moderately reduced at 25°C and 30°C (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A minor suggestion is to include cells expressing PriC using plasmid DNA to show that adding PriC should reverse the growth defect of dnaA46 and dnaC2 strains at non-permissive temperatures. The same should be added at other appropriate places.</p></disp-quote><p>Even in the presence of PriC, unwinding of <italic>oriC</italic> and DnaB helicase loading to the wound <italic>oriC</italic> require DnaA and DnaC activities as indicated by previous studies (see for a review, Windgassen et al., (2018) Nucleic Acids Res. 46, 504-519). Thus, <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells and <italic>dnaC2</italic> cells bearing pBR322-<italic>priC</italic> can not grow at 42°C and 37°C (as follows). These are reasonable results. However, at semi-permissive temperatures (37°C for <italic>dnaA46</italic> and 35°C for <italic>dnaC2</italic>), slight stimulation of the cell growth by pBR322-<italic>priC</italic> might be barely observed (Figure 2-supplement 1 of the revised version). These suggest that the intrinsic level of PriC is functionally nearly sufficient.

The related explanation is included in the Discussion section (the third paragraph) of the original manuscript. As described there, <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells expressing the DnaA H136A single mutant exhibited severe defects in cell growth even in the presence of PriC (Sakiyama et al., 2018). The His136 residue is located within the weak, secondary DnaB interaction region in DnaA, and is crucial for DnaB loading onto <italic>oriC</italic> ssDNA. Given domain I in DnaA H136A can stably tether DnaB-DnaC complexes to DnaA complexes on <italic>oriC</italic> (Sakiyama et al., 2018), we infer that <italic>oriC</italic>-DnaA complexes including DnaA H136A stably bind DnaB via DnaA domain I as an abortive complex, which inhibits functional interaction between PriC and DnaB as well as DnaB loading to <italic>oriC</italic> DNA.</p><p>As for DnaA F46A mutant, our previous studies show that DnaA F46A has a limited residual activity in vivo (unlike in vitro), and allows slow growth of cells. As the stable DnaA-DnaB binding is partially impaired in vivo in DnaA F46A, this feature is consistent with the above ideas. Thus, both F46A and H136A mutations are required for severer inhibition of DnaB loading.

When cells were grown in LB at 30°C, the mean ori/mass values were as follows: 0.34 for R4<italic>Tma</italic> priC, 0.51 for R4<italic>Tma</italic>, 0.82 for DATL priC, 0.99 for DATL (Figures 5 &amp; 6 in the original manuscript).

The situation is somewhat different for dnaA46. Why is this mutation partly complemented by PriC at 37C? DnaA46 binds neither ATP nor ADP, yet it functions in initiation at permissive temperature. At nonpermissive temperature, it binds oriC as well but does not lead to initiation. Does the present data imply that the true initiation defect of DnaA46 lies in helicase loading? The authors need to comment on this in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the thermolabile propensity of the DnaA46 protein, it is presumable that DnaA46 protein becomes partially denatured at the sub-permissive temperature of 37°C. This partial denaturation should impair both origin unwinding and helicase loading, though not to the extent that cell viability is lost. The <italic>priC</italic> deletion should further exacerbate helicase loading defects by inhibiting the bypass mechanism, resulting in the lethality of <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells at this temperature. This explanation is included in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relating to the above. In Figure 3 it is shown that the pFH plasmid partly complements dnaA46 in a PriC-dependent manner. Again, it would be nice to know the nature of the DnaA46 protein defect. It would be interesting to see how a pING1-dnaA46 plasmid performs in the experiment presented in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>A previous paper showed that multicopy supply of DnaA46 can suppress temperature sensitivity of the <italic>dnaA46</italic> cells (Rao and Kuzminov, G3, 2022). This is reasonable in that DnaA46 has a rapid degradation rate unlike wild-type DnaA. As DnaA46 preserves the intact sequences in DnaB binding sites such as G21, F46 and H136, the suppression would not depend on PriC but would be due to the dosage effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8 B: The authors should either remove the data or show a genome coverage: it is not clear that yapB is a good reference. A genome coverage would be nice, and show whether initiation can occur at oriC even if it is not the major place of initiation in a rnhA mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we carried out the chromosome loci copy-number analysis by whole-genome sequencing to assess impact of PriC on cSDR. The new data are shown in Figure 8-supplement 1 with relevant descriptions of the main text of the revised version as shown below. Briefly, results of the chromosome loci copy-number analysis are consistent with those of real-time qPCR (Figure 8B). Given that the role PriC in stimulating cSDR was unclear, we believe that our finding that PriC has little or no role in cSDR, despite being a negative result, is valuable for the general readership of eLife.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 38-39: .....resulting in replisome assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 48: Something is wrong with the Michel reference.
