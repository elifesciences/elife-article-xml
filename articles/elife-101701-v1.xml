Current control strategies for this condition are limited in efficacy, necessitating further research into the underlying mechanisms. Although metabolomics has been applied to study various diseases, its use in understanding postmenopausal hypertension is scarce. Therefore, an ovariectomized rat model was used to simulate postmenopausal conditions. Estrogen levels, blood pressure, and aortic tissue metabolomics were analyzed. Animal models were divided into Sham, OVX, and OVX +E groups. Serum estrogen levels, blood pressure measurements, and aortic tissue metabolomics analyses were performed using radioimmunoassay, UHPLC-Q-TOF, and bioinformatics techniques. Based on the above research content, we successfully established a correlation between low estrogen levels and postmenopausal hypertension in rats. Notable differences in blood pressure parameters and aortic tissue metabolites were observed across the experimental groups. Specifically, metabolites that were differentially expressed, particularly L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (L-AABA), showed potential as a biomarker for postmenopausal hypertension, potentially exerting a protective function through macrophage activation and vascular remodeling. Enrichment analysis revealed alterations in sugar metabolism pathways, such as the Warburg effect and glycolysis, indicating their involvement in postmenopausal hypertension. Overall, this current research provides insights into the metabolic changes associated with postmenopausal hypertension, highlighting the role of L-AABA and sugar metabolism reprogramming in aortic tissue. The findings suggest a potential link between low estrogen levels, macrophage function, and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal hypertension. Further investigations are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications for postmenopausal women.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>postmenopausal hypertension</kwd><kwd>carbohydrate metabolism</kwd><kwd>vascular remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007129</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2024QH262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011324</institution-id><institution>The youth research found of the affiliated hospital of Qingdao university</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QDFYQN2023119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007129</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2024QH640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011324</institution-id><institution>The youth research found of the affiliated hospital of Qingdao university</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QDFYQN2023111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014761</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Qingdao Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24-4-4-zrjj-105-jch</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Low estrogen levels in postmenopausal hypertension are linked to metabolic reprogramming and aortic tissue changes, with L-alpha-aminobutyric acid emerging as a potential protective biomarker.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Estrogen has a multifaceted impact on women, with postmenopausal hypertension being a representative example, characterized by significant fluctuations in blood pressure, primarily in systolic and pulse pressure. This leads to more damage to target organs, ultimately severely affecting the quality of life of middle-aged and elderly women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>). Doctors have attempted to improve patients’ conditions through hormone replacement therapy, but the serious risk of breast cancer has greatly limited the clinical application of this treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fournier et al., 2009</xref>). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in combination with beta-blockers or verapamil are common control strategies for postmenopausal hypertension, yet satisfactory therapeutic effects are still difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Research has long confirmed the influence of estrogen on vascular pressure, for instance, oxidative stress caused by estrogen metabolism changes may result in pulmonary arterial hypertension in obese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). The detailed mechanism by which the drastic decrease in estrogen post-menopause mediates postmenopausal hypertension remains unclear. In recent years, metabolomics strategies have been widely used to explore potential mechanisms of various diseases, with plasma metabolomics being the most popular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferraro et al., 2024</xref>). Some researchers have utilized plasma metabolomics to investigate the pathogenesis of thrombotic or idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Swietlik et al., 2021</xref>), while others have described the plasma metabolomic characteristics of high blood pressure induced by high sodium intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rossitto et al., 2021</xref>). There has been no research exploring the metabolic changes in postmenopausal hypertension yet. Our research team conducted this study to address the aforementioned scientific issues. By simulating the postmenopausal state using an ovariectomized rat model, we monitored the correlation between estrogen and blood pressure changes in rats and revealed the inherent relationship between these changes and postmenopausal hypertension through alterations in the metabolic characteristics of aortic tissues <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Research flowchart.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101701-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of animal models with estrogen depletion</title><p>In the Sham group, normal estrous cycle patterns were observed, with small, round vaginal exfoliated cells present during the nonestrous phase and larger, polygonal cells with abundant cytoplasm seen during the estrous phase. Conversely, in the OVX and OVX + E groups (pre-estrogen supplementation), the estrous cycle ceased, and the vaginal exfoliated cells remained small and round, confirming the effectiveness of bilateral ovariectomy. Serum estrogen levels in the OVX group were significantly lower compared to the Sham group (7.54 ± 1.46pg/mL vs. 36.12 ± 6.07pg/mL, n = 8, p&lt; 0.001), while levels in the OVX + E group were markedly higher than those in the OVX group (36.21 ±4.30pg/mL vs. 7.54 ± 1.46pg/mL, n = 10, p&lt; 0.001).

To normalize the data distribution, both metabolites and samples underwent normalization procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To explore the differences in aortic tissue metabolites under varying estrogen levels, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to select differentially expressed metabolites among the three groups of aortas. The false discovery rate threshold was set at 0.05. Since the normalized data approximated a normal distribution, hypothesis testing was carried out through two methods: non-parametric tests identified 17 different metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>: Non-parametric tests of metabolites), while Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests revealed 23 different metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>：Fisher’s LSD tests of metabolites). By taking the intersection of the two methods, a total of 15 different metabolites were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>：Intersection differential metabolites). Further selection of the most promising differentially expressed metabolites among groups was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–I</xref>. Using multi-class significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) (with a delta set at 1.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), a total of 45 different metabolites were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>：Differential metabolites identified by SAM), with L-Alpha-aminobutyric acid (L-AABA), Methylpicraquassioside A, Pyroglutamine, and D-Ribose 5-phosphate being the most promising inter-group differentially expressed metabolites. A heatmap of metabolite correlations indicated that all metabolites could be roughly categorized into 4 distinct clusters based on their correlation relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>：The correlation coefficient and p-value of the correlation analysis for all metabolites). The Pearson correlation analysis for the three different sample groups clearly demonstrated distinct differences between the OVX group and the other two groups, while the Sham and OVX + E groups with similar estrogen concentrations were challenging to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>：The correlation coefficient and p-value of the correlation analysis for all samples). The trends highlighted in the hierarchical clustering dendrogram further emphasized these distinctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The hierarchical clustering heatmap, created based on the top 25 differentially expressed metabolites filtered by ANOVA, depicted two distinct patterns of metabolite expression across different groups. A class of metabolites represented by Inosinic acid showed a significant upregulation in the OVX group, while displaying consistent downregulation in the Sham and OVX + E groups; another class of metabolites primarily displayed downregulation in the OVX group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Further exploration of the expression characteristics of aortic metabolites in the OVX group was performed using dimensionality reduction analyses. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and sparse PLS-DA (sPLS-DA) were applied as the three analytical strategies. In the Unsupervised strategy, the first component accounted for 21.5% and the second component for 15%, with a high degree of overlap among the three groups’ data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Implementing the PLS-DA strategy distinguished the differences between the OVX group and the other two groups clearly, although there was still some minor overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the model could select some differentially expressed metabolites using VIP scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), a fivefold cross-validation (CV) indicated suboptimal values for R<sup>2</sup>, Q<sup>2</sup>, and accuracy indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>：PLS-DA CV details). The permutation test also suggested a risk of model overfitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As the predictive performance of both the PCA and PLS-DA models fell short of expectations, the sPLS-DA model was tested, showing optimal performance in the fivefold CV results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>，<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). According to the VIP scores, L-AABA and Methylpicraquassioside A were identified as the top differentially expressed metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>：VIP scores for differential metabolites). Similarly, in the random forest tree model, L-AABA was identified as the most important metabolite for classification accuracy evaluation (Mean Decrease accuracy; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>：Mean Metabolic Accuracy of differential metabolites in random forest tree model).

To this end, we comprehensively employed various methods to assess the differential features of metabolites between OVX and the other two groups (t-test, PCA, PLS-DA and Orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA), Random Forest, and Empirical Bayesian Analysis of Metabolomics (EBAM)). When comparing data of the subgroups, we recalibrated the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). The Fold Change (FC) threshold for the t-test was set to 2, and the p-value was 0.05. Compared to the Sham group, in the OVX group, Adenylsuccinic acid, 4-Hydroxybutyric acid, Cholic acid, O-dodecanoylcarnitine, L-Hexanoylcarnitine, Adenosine 3’-monophosphate, 1-Methylguanine, O-decanoyl-L-carnitine, and Butyrylcarnitine were significantly upregulated, while Uracil, Uridine, Ribothymidine, and L-AABA were significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>：Details of t-test for differential metabolites between Sham group and OVX group).

The hierarchical clustering dendrogram clearly distinguished the samples of different subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). The hierarchical clustering heatmap visually displayed the above results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). Although PCA analysis as an unsupervised analysis could effectively differentiate between the OVX and OVX + E groups, it faced difficulties in distinguishing differences between the OVX and Sham groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). In contrast, supervised methods were more adept at discerning intergroup differences, but these models also had certain limitations.

The modeling in this study is consistent with previous research results, where estrogen levels significantly decrease after ovariectomy, and exogenous estrogen supplementation can restore estrogen to physiological levels. Correspondingly, the SBP, DBP, and PP of the OVX group are significantly higher than those of the control group (Sham group), while after estrogen supplementation (OVX + E group), the above blood pressure parameters can return to the level of the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pitha et al., 2023</xref>). The phenotypic changes mentioned above support further exploration of the mechanisms related to estrogen and hypertension.</p><p>Through various statistical analysis methods, we attempt to identify the most important mediator between estrogen and postmenopausal hypertension from a large number of differential metabolites. After extensive screening, we believe that L-AABA is the most promising biomarker. L-AABA plays a crucial role in certain metabolic pathways in the human body and can be used as a supplement to support overall health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). It is an optically active form of α-aminobutyric acid (AABA), a non-essential amino acid primarily derived from the breakdown metabolism of methionine, threonine, and serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haschke-Becher et al., 2016</xref>). It serves as a biomarker for various diseases such as esophageal variceal bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ai et al., 2022</xref>) and septic liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rudnick et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies have linked AABA to female osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Panahi et al., 2022</xref>), a common condition in postmenopausal women, similar to postmenopausal hypertension. Our research found a significant downregulation of AABA in the aortic tissues of the OVX group, and estrogen supplementation could reverse the decrease in AABA levels, indicating that AABA may act as a protective factor in postmenopausal hypertension.</p><p>Based on our knowledge, AABA plays an important role in cardiovascular diseases: elevated levels of AABA were found in the heart tissues of dilated cardiomyopathy Syrian hamster models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maekawa et al., 2013</xref>), significant increase of serum AABA in patients with atrial septal defect compared to healthy volunteers, and the ability of AABA levels to decrease to that of healthy volunteers after ductal occlusion, animal experiments have confirmed that AABA can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in mice by increasing circulation and myocardial glutathione levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irino et al., 2016</xref>). It is worth noting that there has been no research exploring the correlation and potential mechanisms of AABA with hypertension. Current studies believe that high-intensity interval exercise has a corrective effect on hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sosner et al., 2019</xref>), and research has found that high-intensity interval exercise can increase plasma AABA concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borges et al., 2024</xref>), consistent with the trend of our experiments, suggesting that AABA may be a protective factor for hypertension. Although it is currently unclear whether AABA is involved in the improvement of hypertension, existing research results are enough to provide some hints for future research: vascular remodeling is a classic change in the pathophysiological process of hypertension and early vascular remodeling allows vessels to adapt to transient changes in hemodynamics and play compensatory protective effects. However, when blood pressure continues to increase, vessels cannot continue to compensate and undergo adverse restructuring, ultimately leading to a vicious cycle of lumen narrowing and rising blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbons and Dzau, 1994</xref>). Although the related mechanisms of vascular remodeling in hypertensive patients have not been fully elucidated, current research suggests that the accumulation of macrophages in the vascular lumen and the inflammation resulting from it play an important role in the progression of vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakker et al., 2006</xref>). It is worth noting that recent studies have confirmed that AABA can regulate the polarization and function of M1 macrophages by promoting oxidative phosphorylation and inhibiting glycolysis through the Warburg effect and gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Our rat-specific pathway enrichment results also coincidentally enriched in three important metabolic pathways: Warburg effect, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Based on the above experimental results, we propose the following hypothesis: the low estrogen state caused by menopause leads to a decrease in L-AABA in the aorta, mediates macrophage activation, causes vascular remodeling, and ultimately leads to the occurrence of postmenopausal hypertension. Our team is conducting further research to verify the above points.</p><p>Enrichment analysis results indicate that the top three differential metabolites are amino acids and peptides, fatty acids and conjugates, and monosaccharides, which is in line with expectations as sugars, fats, and proteins are the three main types of metabolites in the human body. To avoid biases in research results caused by species differences, we further analyzed the specific metabolic pathways in rats, and the results show that the Warburg effect, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis are the most enriched metabolic pathways. This suggests that sugar metabolism is the most significantly affected aspect of aortic metabolism in a low estrogen state. Current research generally believes that enhanced Warburg effect and glycolysis-mediated pulmonary vasoconstriction are key mechanisms in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rafikov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunham-Snary et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that changes in aortic Warburg effect and glycolysis may be involved in the occurrence of Postmenopausal Hypertension. Furthermore, researchers from the United States have found that the main culprit mediating the Warburg effect in tumors is macrophages in tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reinfeld et al., 2021</xref>). Whether aortic remodeling in postmenopausal women is also mediated by macrophage glucose metabolism reprogramming is a research direction worthy of exploration. Finally, in the exploration of key enzymes, we found deoxyuridine phosphorylase and O<sup>2</sup> transport (diffusion) as the top two candidates. In pancreatic cancer, UPP1 mediates the redox balance, survival, and proliferation of tumor cells under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nwosu et al., 2023</xref>), and considering the enrichment of O<sup>2</sup> transport-related enzymes, the UPP-mediated hypoxic adaptation mechanism may also be an important participant in Postmenopausal Hypertension.</p><p>The current study is an exploratory work on the relationship between low estrogen and Postmenopausal Hypertension. Although some meaningful findings have been obtained, there are still some aspects that need further improvement. Firstly, there are several ways to construct animal models of menopause, including X-ray induced ovarian injury animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ling et al., 2017</xref>), ovariectomized animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">da Rocha et al., 2012</xref>), and chemical-induced ovarian failure model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Van Kempen et al., 2011</xref>). Among them, the ovariectomy animal model is the most commonly used at present, but it has limitations in simulating the drastic fluctuations in estrogen levels after ovariectomy. Secondly, the hypothesis that L-AABA regulates macrophage function to mediate blood pressure regulation has not been experimentally confirmed. Lastly, there is a lack of direct evidence of metabolic changes from human samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models</title><p>The experimental animals for this study were purchased from the Department of Laboratory Animal Science at Peking University Health Science Center.

Approval for the experimental protocol was obtained from the Laboratory Animal Welfare Ethics Committee (No. LA2018092). Twenty-four 12-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats (Without any genetic modification) of SPF grade were randomly assigned to three groups: the Sham surgery group (Sham), ovariectomy group (OVX), and ovariectomy group treated with estrogen (OVX +E). These animals were housed under controlled conditions, including temperature (22–26°C), humidity (50–60%), and a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, provided with a non-soy diet and ad libitum access to water. Surgery was performed one week after acclimatization. The Sham group underwent skin incision and closure, while the OVX and OVX +E groups underwent ovariectomy. On the 14th day post-surgery, all rats received subcutaneous injections of specific drugs between 9am and 10am daily for four weeks. Rats in the OVX +E group were administered 17β-estradiol (25 μg/kg/day; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in ethanol and diluted with sterile sesame oil (10 mg/0.1 mL, 0.25 mL/kg; GLBIO, Montclair, California, USA). The other groups were given an equal volume of sterile sesame oil. Starting from the third day post-operation, vaginal exfoliated cells were smeared daily for 7 days consecutively to confirm the successful establishment of the model.

After blood pressure values stabilized, data collection began on the seventh day. The CODA-HT6 non-invasive blood pressure system (Kent Scientific Corporation, CT, USA) was used for the measurements. The cuff was positioned 1 cm from the tail base, attaching the VPR sensor to the tail. The tubing and VPR sensor were gradually inflated until the tail was completely blocked off, and then gradually deflated. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured when blood flow was detected in the artery. The peak slope of the blood pressure change as determined by VPR revealed the diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
