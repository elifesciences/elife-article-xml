Anabolic metabolism produces biomass during development, growth, cell turnover, and wound healing, while catabolic processes degrade nutrients to generate energy and metabolic building blocks. Animals must be able to regulate their metabolism in response to nutrient availability and to meet growth and energy demands. Metabolism can be regulated by different mechanisms, including the allosteric modulation of metabolic enzyme activity and the transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes. Changes in metabolic enzyme level and/or activity can result in changes in metabolic flux, which is defined as the turnover rate of metabolites through enzymatically controlled pathways. Metabolic flux can result in the accumulation or depletion of metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Knaap and Verrijzer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang and Lei, 2018</xref>). These metabolites may interact with enzymes directly to allosterically affect the enzyme’s catalytic properties. Alternatively, metabolites can alter the transcriptional regulation of metabolic enzymes by interacting with transcription factors (TFs) and changing their activity or localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desvergne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giese et al., 2019</xref>). A classic example of the transcriptional regulation of metabolism is the activation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in mammals by SREBP that responds to low levels of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espenshade, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor for two metabolic enzymes: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. Methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase (EC 5.4.99.2) catalyzes the third step in the breakdown of the short-chain fatty acid propionate, while methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13) converts homocysteine into methionine in the Methionine/S-adenosylmethionine (Met/SAM) cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The Met/SAM cycle is part of one-carbon metabolism, which also includes folate metabolism and parts of purine and thymine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ducker and Rabinowitz, 2017</xref>). The one-carbon cycle produces many important building blocks for cellular growth and repair, including nucleotides and SAM, the major methyl donor of the cell. SAM is critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, an important component of cellular membranes, as well as for the methylation of DNA, RNA, and histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). Both vitamin B12-dependent metabolic pathways have been well studied at the biochemical level; however, little is known about how these pathways are regulated transcriptionally.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two mechanisms of gene regulation by low vitamin B12 dietary conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of vitamin B12-related metabolic pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

We previously discovered that perturbations of the canonical propionate breakdown pathway, either genetically or by low dietary vitamin B12, results in the transcriptional activation of five genes comprising an alternative propionate breakdown pathway, or propionate shunt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). Activation of the propionate shunt occurs only with sustained propionate accumulation and absolutely depends on the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) <italic>nhr-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>nhr-10</italic> functions together with <italic>nhr-68</italic> in a type one coherent feedforward loop known as a persistence detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>).

We find that B12-mechanism-II is activated upon perturbation of the Met/SAM cycle, either genetically or nutritionally, due to low dietary vitamin B12. This mechanism requires another NHR, <italic>nhr-114</italic>, which responds to low levels of SAM. B12-mechanism-II not only activates Met/SAM cycle gene expression, it also activates the expression of the vitamin B12 transporter <italic>pmp-5</italic> and the methionine sulfoxide reductase <italic>msra-1</italic>, and represses the expression of the cystathionine beta synthase <italic>cbs-1.</italic> The regulation of the latter two genes increases influx and reduces efflux of the Met/SAM cycle, respectively. These findings indicate that low Met/SAM cycle activity is sensed and transcriptionally adjusted to be maintained in a tightly controlled regime. Taken together, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> the genetic or nutritional perturbation of the two vitamin B12-dependent pathways is sensed by two transcriptional mechanisms via different NHRs. These mechanisms likely provide the animal with metabolic adaptation to develop and thrive on different bacterial diets in the wild.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low dietary vitamin B12 activates two transcriptional mechanisms</title><p>As in humans, vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor in two <italic>C. elegans</italic> pathways: the canonical propionate breakdown pathway and the Met/SAM cycle, which is part of one-carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These pathways are connected because homocysteine can be converted into cystathionine by the cystathionine beta synthase CBS-1, which after conversion into alpha-ketobutyrate is converted into propionyl-CoA. When flux through the canonical propionate breakdown pathway is perturbed, either genetically or nutritionally, that is, when dietary vitamin B12 is low, a set of genes comprising an alternative propionate breakdown pathway or propionate shunt is transcriptionally activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macneil and Walhout, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Watson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). Low vitamin B12 results in an accumulation of propionate, which, when sustained, activates a gene regulatory network circuit known as a type one coherent feedforward loop with an AND-logic gate composed of two transcription factors, <italic>nhr-10</italic> and <italic>nhr-68</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). The first gene in the propionate shunt, <italic>acdh-1</italic>, acts as a control point: its expression is induced several hundred fold when vitamin B12 is limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macneil and Walhout, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Watson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We have previously used transgenic animals expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the <italic>acdh-1</italic> promoter as a vitamin B12 sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacNeil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). In these <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> animals, GFP expression is high throughout the intestine on an <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet, which is low in vitamin B12, and GFP expression is very low on a <italic>Comamonas aquatica</italic> DA1877 diet that is high in vitamin B12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacNeil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). Low GFP expression resulting from vitamin B12 supplementation to the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet can be overcome by addition of propionate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). The activation of <italic>acdh-1</italic> expression in response to accumulating propionate is completely dependent on <italic>nhr-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we found that while GFP levels are reduced in the anterior intestine, there is still remaining GFP expression in the posterior intestine in <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> transgenic animals lacking <italic>nhr-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Since <italic>nhr-10</italic> is absolutely required to mediate the activation of <italic>acdh-1</italic> by propionate, this means that there is another, propionate-independent mechanism of activation. Importantly, the residual GFP expression in <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic>; Δ<italic>nhr-10</italic> was completely repressed by the supplementation of vitamin B12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). This result was confirmed by inspecting our previously published RNA-seq data: in Δ<italic>nhr-10</italic> animals there is residual endogenous <italic>acdh-1</italic> expression which is eliminated by the addition of vitamin B12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). These results demonstrate that there is another mechanism by which low vitamin B12 activates gene expression that is independent of propionate accumulation, which occurs when flux through the canonical propionate breakdown pathway is perturbed. We refer to the activation of gene expression in response to canonical propionate breakdown perturbation as ‘B12-mechanism-I’ and the other, propionate-independent mechanism as ‘B12-mechanism-II’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Met/SAM cycle perturbations activate B12-mechanism-II</title><p>To determine the mechanism by which ‘B12-mechanism-II’ is activated, we used the <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> vitamin B12 sensor in the Δ<italic>nhr-10</italic> mutant background, which cannot respond to B12-mechanism-I. We first performed a forward genetic screen using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) to find mutations that activate GFP expression in <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic>;Δ<italic>nhr-10</italic> animals in the presence of vitamin B12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In these animals, GFP expression is off and we looked for those RNAi knockdowns that activated GFP expression in the presence of vitamin B12. Out of more than 1400 genes tested, RNAi of only five genes resulted in activation of GFP expression: <italic>metr-1</italic>, <italic>mtrr-1</italic>, <italic>sams-1</italic>, <italic>mthf-1</italic>, and <italic>mel-32</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Four of these genes were also found in the forward genetic screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

These results show that genetic perturbations in Met/SAM cycle genes activate B12-mechanism-II, even in the presence of vitamin B12. This indicates that reduced activity of the Met/SAM cycle, either due to genetic perturbations or as a result of low dietary vitamin B12 activates B12-mechanism-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, genetic perturbations in either pathway that uses vitamin B12 as a cofactor activate the vitamin B12 sensor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>B12-mechanism-II activates Met/SAM cycle gene expression in response to Met/SAM cycle perturbations</title><p>To ask what other genes are activated by B12-mechanism-II, we performed RNA-seq using four Met/SAM cycle mutants identified in the forward genetic screen.

There are two components to this question: (1) which TF(s), and (2) which metabolite(s) mediate Met/SAM cycle gene induction? We first focused on identifying the TF(s) involved in B12-mechanism-II. Previously, we identified more than 40 TFs that activate the <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> vitamin B12 sensor in wild type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacNeil et al., 2015</xref>).

The TFs <italic>nhr-23</italic> and <italic>lin-26</italic> were not found to be involved in B12-mechanism-I and could therefore potentially be involved in B12-mechanism-II. However, RNAi of these TFs causes severe developmental delay across all strains and thus their contribution could be less specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, we asked whether Δ<italic>nhr-114</italic> mutant phenotypes could be rescued by vitamin B12 supplementation. Indeed, we found that both sterility and slow development of Δ<italic>nhr-114</italic> mutants fed <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 could be rescued by supplementation of vitamin B12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The Met/SAM cycle generates SAM, the major methyl donor of the cell that is critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It has previously been shown that perturbation of <italic>sams-1</italic>, which converts methionine into SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), leads to a strong reduction in fecundity and large changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, these phenotypes can be rescued by supplementation of choline, which supports an alternative route to phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the primary biological function of the Met/SAM cycle is to produce methyl donors that facilitate the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. We found that the Δ<italic>nhr-114</italic> mutant phenotypes can also be rescued by either methionine or choline supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although Gracida and Eckmann did not find that methionine rescued <italic>nhr-114</italic> RNAi knock down animals, it is possible this was due to methodological differences. For example, they added bulk L-amino acids and at only one concentration. The actual concentration of ingested methionine might have been masked by other amino acids or was simply too low to provide an observable rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gracida and Eckmann, 2013</xref>). Rescue of <italic>nhr-114</italic> mutant phenotypes by choline and methionine support the hypothesis that low levels of phosphatidylcholine are the underlying cause of the Δ<italic>nhr-114</italic> mutant phenotypes on low vitamin B12 diets, when B12-mechanism-II cannot activate Met/SAM cycle gene expression. This result provides further support for the functional involvement of <italic>nhr-114</italic> in the Met/SAM cycle, and leads to the prediction that <italic>nhr-114</italic> activates Met/SAM cycle gene expression in response to genetic or nutritional perturbation of the cycle’s activity. To directly test this prediction, we performed RNA-seq on <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> and <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP;</italic>Δ<italic>nhr-10;metr-1(ww52)</italic> animals supplemented with vitamin B12 and subjected to <italic>nhr-114</italic> or vector control RNAi.

Overall, the induction of 32 of the 110 genes that are upregulated by Met/SAM cycle perturbations requires <italic>nhr-114</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

SAMS-1 converts methionine into SAM, and methionine levels are greatly increased in <italic>sams-1</italic> mutant animals, while being reduced in <italic>metr-1</italic>, <italic>mtrr-1</italic>, and <italic>mthf-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Since methionine levels are elevated in <italic>sams-1</italic> mutants, and because methionine supplementation cannot suppress GFP expression in these mutants, these results indicate that low methionine is not the direct activator of B12-mechanism-II, but rather that it is either low SAM, or low phosphatidylcholine, both of which require methionine for their synthesis. In <italic>metr-1</italic> and <italic>mthf-1</italic> mutants methionine supplementation supports the synthesis of SAM and phosphatidylcholine, and in these mutants, methionine supplementation would therefore act indirectly. We did observe a mild reduction in GFP levels upon methionine supplementation in <italic>sams-1(ww51)</italic> animals likely because it is not a complete loss-of-function allele, and/or functional redundancy with three other <italic>sams</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish between the possibilities of low SAM or low phosphatidylcholine activating B12-mechanism-II, we next focused on <italic>pmt-2</italic>. PMT-2 is involved in the second step of the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yilmaz and Walhout, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The expression of <italic>pmt-2</italic> is repressed by vitamin B12, but not activated by propionate, is not under the control of <italic>nhr-10</italic> or <italic>nhr-68</italic>, and is activated in Met/SAM cycle mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). We reasoned that <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi might allow us to discriminate whether low SAM or low phosphatidylcholine activates B12-mechanism-II. Specifically, we would expect <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi to activate B12-mechanism-II if low phosphatidylcholine is the main cause, and consequently that GFP expression would increase. Due to the severe growth delay caused by RNAi of <italic>pmt-2</italic>, we diluted the RNAi bacteria with vector control bacteria. We found that <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi decreased GFP expression particularly in <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic>;Δ<italic>nhr-10</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">6</xref>). Predictably, choline supplementation rescued the growth defect caused by <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi. While it is possible that RNAi may cause off-target effects, the rescue by choline suggests that the knock down by <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi is specific. Importantly, in both choline-supplemented and dilute RNAi conditions, <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi repressed <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic>. Therefore, we conclude that low phosphatidylcholine is not the inducer of B12-mechanism-II. Instead, our results support a model in which low SAM levels activate B12-mechanism-II. <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi likely represses the <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> transgene because SAM levels increase when the methylation reaction converting phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine, which depends on SAM is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, our data support a model in which low Met/SAM cycle activity results in low SAM levels, which activates B12-mechanism-II.</p><p>Next, we asked whether <italic>nhr-114</italic> is required for the transcriptional response to low SAM. Since SAM is not stable and may not be easily absorbed by <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used methionine supplementation, which supports SAM synthesis, except in <italic>sams-1</italic> mutant animals. We performed RNA-seq in wild type and Δ<italic>nhr-114</italic> mutant animals with or without methionine supplementation and found that Met/SAM cycle genes are repressed by methionine supplementation in wild type, but not Δ<italic>nhr-114</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Therefore, low SAM levels due to vitamin B12 depletion activate B12-mechanism-II in an <italic>nhr-114</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>B12-mechanism-II activates influx and represses efflux of the Met/SAM cycle</title><p>Some of the most strongly regulated vitamin B12-repressed genes include <italic>msra-1</italic> and <italic>pmp-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). In the forward genetic screen, we identified a mutation in <italic>pmp-5</italic> that activates the <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> transgene in ∆<italic>nhr-10</italic> mutant animals in the presence of supplemented vitamin B12. As mentioned above, <italic>pmp-5</italic> is an ortholog of human <italic>ABCD4</italic>, which encodes a vitamin B12 transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coelho et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, increased B12 transport may be used by the animal as a mechanism to increase Met/SAM cycle activity. <italic>msra-1</italic> encodes methionine sulfoxide reductase that reduces methionine sulfoxide to methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This gene provides an entry point into the Met/SAM cycle by increasing levels of methionine. This observation prompted us to hypothesize that perturbation of Met/SAM cycle activity, either by low dietary vitamin B12 or by genetic perturbations in the cycle, may activate the expression of these genes. Indeed, both genes are induced in the Met/SAM cycle mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Further, both genes are repressed by methionine supplementation, in an <italic>nhr-114</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). As a putative transporter of vitamin B12 from the lysosome to the cytosol, <italic>pmp-5</italic> is also important for vitamin B12-mechanism-I. Indeed, pmp-5 is upregulated in response to propionate supplementation, and is also regulated by <italic>nhr-10</italic> and <italic>nhr-68</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also noticed that the expression level changes of <italic>cbs-1</italic> are opposite of those of <italic>msra-1</italic> and <italic>pmp-5: cbs-1</italic> is activated by vitamin B12, repressed in Met/SAM cycle mutants, and activated by methionine in an <italic>nhr-114</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). As mentioned above, <italic>cbs-1</italic> encodes cystathionine beta synthase, which converts homocysteine into cystathionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Reduced <italic>cbs-1</italic> expression upon Met/SAM cycle perturbations would therefore likely prevent carbon efflux. Finally, <italic>nhr-114</italic> expression itself is repressed by both vitamin B12 and methionine and activated by perturbations in Met/SAM cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). This suggests that <italic>nhr-114</italic> activates its own expression, similarly as the auto-activation of <italic>nhr-68</italic> in response to propionate accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>nhr-114</italic> expression is not under the control of B12-mechanism-I because it does not change when propionate is supplemented or when <italic>nhr-10</italic> is deleted. However, <italic>nhr-114</italic> is mildly repressed in Δ<italic>nhr-68</italic> mutants. This suggests that there may be some crosstalk between the two B12 mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, B12-mechanism-II is employed when Met/SAM cycle activity is perturbed to increase Met/SAM cycle gene expression as well as Met/SAM cycle activity and influx, and to decrease Met/SAM cycle efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title><italic>nhr-114</italic> transcriptionally regulates Met/SAM cycle influx and efflux.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, C</bold>) RNA-seq data from each of the experiments for <italic>msra-1</italic> (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>pmp-5</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), <italic>cbs-1</italic> (<bold>C</bold>) and <italic>nhr-114</italic> (<bold>D</bold>).

This B12-mechanism-II is different from B12-mechanism-I, which we previously reported to transcriptionally activate a propionate shunt in response to persistent accumulation of this short-chain fatty acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). B12-mechanism-I is activated under low dietary vitamin B12 conditions, or when the canonical vitamin B12-dependent propionate breakdown pathway is genetically perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). B12-mechanism-I is elicited by two TFs, <italic>nhr-10</italic> and <italic>nhr-68</italic> that function as a persistence detector in a type I coherent feed-forward loop with AND-logic gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). We unraveled B12-mechanism-II in animals lacking <italic>nhr-10</italic> that cannot employ B12-mechanism-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>). B12-mechanism-II targets the other vitamin B12-dependent metabolic pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: the Met/SAM cycle. It is activated by low activity of this cycle that results in low levels of SAM and the activation of another NHR TF, <italic>nhr-114</italic>, which is not involved in B12-mechanism-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The discovery that Met/SAM cycle activity is sensed by a gene regulatory network resulting in the adjustment of Met/SAM cycle gene expression and in- and efflux modulation indicates that the animal strives to maintain the activity of this cycle in a tight metabolic regime to support development and homeostasis. Too little activity hampers the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, an essential membrane component required for proliferation and growth, thereby inducing sterility and developmental delay. It is more difficult to assess why excessive Met/SAM cycle activity could be deleterious. One possibility may be the connection between Met/SAM cycle activity and folate status. When homocysteine levels are increased, the <italic>metr-1</italic> reaction is driven toward methionine production and consequently 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-meTHF) and folate are depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hasan et al., 2019</xref>). The folate cycle is essential in maintaining nucleotide and NADPH pools, which are required for biomass and redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Locasale, 2013</xref>). SAM is not only required for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, but also it is the methyl donor for histone methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>). High production of SAM could result in extensive histone modifications, which may result in aberrant overall gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mentch et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that <italic>sbp-1</italic> is important for the expression of Met/SAM cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, however, <italic>sbp-1</italic> is not specific to B12-mechanism-II as its perturbation also affects the response to propionate accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulcha et al., 2019</xref>) (this study). Since <italic>sbp-1</italic> functions at a high level in the intestinal gene regulatory network, that is, it influences many gene expression programs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacNeil et al., 2015</xref>), it is likely that <italic>sbp-1</italic> responds to multiple different metabolic imbalances and activates each B12-mechanism. In support of this, <italic>sbp-1</italic> activates both <italic>nhr-68</italic> and <italic>nhr-114</italic>, which are important for B12-mechanism-I and B12-mechanism-II, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacNeil et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies will reveal the detailed wiring of <italic>sbp-1</italic>, <italic>nhr-10</italic>, <italic>nhr-68</italic>, and <italic>nhr-114</italic> into increasingly intricate gene regulatory networks.</p><p>The precise molecular mechanism by which the different NHRs mediate the two B12-mechanisms remains to be elucidated. We have previously shown that NHR-10 physically interacts with the <italic>acdh-1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuxman Bass et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not detect any insightful physical promoter-DNA or protein-protein interactions for either NHR-68 or NHR-114, and therefore it is not yet known which promoters or other TFs these TFs bind to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuxman Bass et al., 2016</xref>). It is also not yet clear how high propionate or low SAM levels are sensed. Since NHRs are liganded TFs, an interesting possibility would be that these metabolites function as ligands where propionate would interact with and activate NHR-10 and/or NHR-68, and SAM would interact with and inhibit NHR-114. Alternatively, the ratio between SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) could be sensed by <italic>nhr-114</italic>, either directly or indirectly. Future detailed studies of propionate shunt and Met/SAM cycle gene promoters will likely provide insights into the molecular mechanisms governing both B12-mechanisms.</p><p>We have used the <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> dietary reporter as a crucial tool to elucidate B12-mechanism-I and B12-mechanism-II. While the reason for activating <italic>acdh-1</italic> expression by B12-mechanism-I is clear (it supports an alternate propionate breakdown mechanism), the reason for inducing this gene in response to Met/SAM cycle perturbations remains unclear. There are two possibilities: either perturbations in the Met/SAM cycle produce propionate which requires ACDH-1 to be degraded, or ACDH-1 catalyzes another reaction in addition to the conversion of propionyl-CoA into acrylyl-CoA. Future studies are required to determine if and how <italic>acdh-1</italic> functions in Met/SAM cycle metabolism.</p><p>Taken together, we have uncovered a second mechanism of gene regulation by

Genomic DNA was prepared by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Fragmentation was carried out on a Covaris sonicator E220 and 300–400 bp size fragments were collected using AMPure beads. Libraries were prepared and barcoded using the Kapa hyper prep kit (KK8500). Samples were sequenced at the core facility of the University of Massachusetts Medical school on an Illumina HiSeq4000 using 50 bp paired-end reads. After filtering out low-quality reads, 300 million reads were recovered resulting in an 18X average coverage of the genome. Reads were mapped to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reference genome version WS220 and analyzed using the CloudMap pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minevich et al., 2012</xref>) where mismatches were compared to the parental strain as well as to the other sequenced mutants. Variants with unique mismatches were validated by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR (RFLP) and sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNAi screen</title><p>RNAi screening was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conte et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, RNAi clones were cultured in 96 well deep-well dishes in LB containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and grown to log-phase at 37°C. Clone cultures were concentrated to 20-fold in M9 buffer and 10 µL was plated onto a well of a 96-well plate containing NGM agar with 2 mM Isopropyl β- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Fisher Scientific). Plates were dried and stored at room temperature. The next day approximately 15–20 synchronized L1 animals per well were plated, followed by incubation at 20°C. Plates were screened 72 hr later. The metabolic gene RNAi screen using VL868 [<italic>wwIs24[Pacdh-1::GFP + unc-119(+)];nhr-10(tm4695)</italic>] animals was performed twice. The TF RNAi screen using the Met/SAM cycle mutants generated by EMS was performed six times. All final hits were sequence-verified and retested on 35 mm NGM agar plates with approximately 200 animals per condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Expression profiling by RNA-seq</title><p>Animals were treated with NaOH-buffered bleach, L1 arrested and plated onto NGM plates supplemented with 20 nM vitamin B12 and fed <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50. 400 late L4/early young adult animals were picked into M9 buffer, washed three times and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (ThermoFisher), followed by DNase I (NEB) treatment and purified using the Direct-zol RNA mini-prep kit (Zymo research). RNA quality was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and expression of known genes were measured via qRT-PCR for quality control. Two biological replicates were sequenced by BGI on the BGISEQ-500 next generation sequencer platform using 100 bp paired-end reads. A minimum of approximately 40 million reads was obtained per sample. Raw reads were processed on the DolphinNext RSEM v1.2.28 pipeline revision 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yukselen et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, the reads were mapped by bowtie2 to genome version c_elegans.PRJNA13758 (WormBase WS271), and then passed to RSEM for estimation of TPM and read counts. Default parameters were used for both bowtie2 and RSEM.</p><p>For later RNA-seq experiments we have developed a more cost-effective, in-house method for RNA-sequencing. Briefly, multiplexed libraries were prepared using Cel-seq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashimshony et al., 2016</xref>). Two biological replicates were sequenced with a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (75 Cycles) on a Nextseq500 sequencer. Paired end sequencing was performed; 13 cycles for read 1, six cycles for the illumina index and 73 cycles for read 2. Approximately 12 million reads per sample was achieved.</p><p>The libraries were first demultiplexed by a homemade python script, and adapter sequences were trimmed using trimmomatic-0.32 by recognizing polyA and barcode sequences. Then, the alignment to the reference genome was performed by STAR with the parameters ‘—runThreadN 4 <monospace>--alignIntronMax</monospace> 25000 <monospace>--outFilterIntronMotifs</monospace> RemoveNoncanonicalUnannotated’. Features were counted by ESAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Derr et al., 2016</xref>) with the parameters ‘-task score3p -wLen 100 -wOlap 50 -wExt 1000 -sigTest. 01 -multimap normal -scPrep -umiMin 1’. Features in ‘c_elegans.PRJNA13758.WS271.canonical_geneset.gtf’ were used as the annotation table input for ESAT, but pseudogenes were discarded. The read counts for each gene were used in differential expression analysis by DEseq2 package in R 3.6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Love et al., 2014</xref>). A fold change cut off of greater than 1.5 and <italic>P</italic> adjusted value cut off of less than 0.01 was used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this is a very nice paper providing a number of novel and interesting insights into the transcriptional control of metabolism. As you will see below, there are a number of relatively small issues that related to data analysis and clarity of presentation which should be all very straightforward to address. We do not expect that a properly revised manuscript will need to be sent out for review again.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Giese et al. have discovered a novel autoregulatory mechanism termed as 'vitamin B12-mechanism-II' that is activated in response to vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in Met/SAM cycle arm of one-carbon metabolism. When SAM synthesis is low due to vitamin B12 deficiency or genetic perturbations of Met/SAM cycle enzymes, this results in upregulation of multiple Met/SAM cycle genes by the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-114. In addition, low levels of SAM due to vitamin B12 deficiency results in activation of the vitamin B12 transporter <italic>pmp-5</italic> and increased influx and reduced efflux of SAM precursors in the Met/SAM cycle in an <italic>nhr-114</italic>-dependent manner. The authors further speculate that reduced SAM level acts as the direct sensor for the activation of vitamin B12-mechanism-II.</p><p>This study makes a major conceptual contribution to our understanding of vitamin B12-dependent metabolism and the gene regulatory networks that are activated in response to B12 deficiency. The experiments are carefully designed to unravel the epistatic nature of interactions in this complex metabolic signaling pathway.</p><p>There are only two concerns regarding interpretation of the data shown in this manuscript: (i) many crucial interpretations are based on a <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> reporter (which is fine), but the GFP intensity is not quantified, and (ii) the genetic interactions proposed in the model are primarily derived from gene expression changes measured via RNA-seq for only two biological replicates. In some cases, the effect sizes are quite large, but statistical significance should be reported especially for two-way interaction (epistatic) data.</p><p>1) Subsection “Low dietary vitamin B12 activates two transcriptional mechanisms”: Given the data shown in Figure 1B, it cannot be interpreted conclusively that the activation of <italic>acdh-1</italic> expression in response to accumulating propionate is completely dependent on <italic>nhr-10</italic>. This is because the experiment lacks the propionate only control. The authors should quantify the GFP signal intensity change in wild-type and <italic>nhr-10</italic> mutant worms after addition of propionate alone. Alternatively, the authors can rephrase this sentence in the context of propionate accumulation in the presence of exogenously added vitamin B12 + propionate.</p><p>2) Subsection “Low dietary vitamin B12 activates two transcriptional mechanisms”: The GFP expression levels should be quantified in Figure 1B. It is not apparent that the GFP signal intensity in untreated <italic>nhr-10</italic> mutant worms is lower than that in untreated wild-type worms, though the tissue-specific localization of the GFP signal seems different in the two strains.</p><p>3) Subsection “<italic>nhr-114</italic> mediates Met/SAM cycle activation in response to low Met/SAM cycle flux”: The data shown in Figure 4D are central to the model proposed in this paper. Hence, these results need to be backed by statistical testing. The authors can perform two-way ANOVA (or two-way repeated measures ANOVA) on the RNA-seq data for these six Met/SAM cycle genes. If statistical significance is not obtained from the two replicates used in RNA-seq, the authors should validate the expression changes of these six genes across the different conditions using qRT-PCR for additional biological replicates.</p><p>4) “However, while choline supplementation repressed GFP expression in <italic>sams-1</italic>(<italic>ww51</italic>) mutants, methionine supplementation did not (Figure 5D)”: This claim can be made only if the GFP signal intensity is quantified in the panels of Figure 5D. Based on the representative image, there seems to be a reduction in GFP intensity in the <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic>; ∆<italic>nhr-10</italic>; <italic>sams-1</italic>(<italic>ww51</italic>) strain after methionine supplementation, which the author also discuss later in the same section.</p><p>5) “The expression of <italic>pmt-2</italic> is repressed by vitamin B12, but not activated by propionate, is not under the control of <italic>nhr-10</italic> or <italic>nhr-68</italic>, and is activated in Met/SAM cycle mutants (Bulcha et al., 2019) (Figure 5F; Supplementary file 2)”: Some statistical testing is required to make this claim (similar to the statistical comparisons performed in Figure 5A and E). If statistical significance is not obtained from the two replicates used in RNA-seq, the authors should validate the expression changes using qRT-PCR for additional biological replicates.</p><p>6) “Methionine and choline supplementation suppress B12-Mechanism-II”: <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi decreases GFP expression not only in <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic>; ∆<italic>nhr-10</italic> animals, but also induces a very strong reduction in GFP expression in <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> wild-type animals. What might be the potential cause of this? In other words, how does depletion of <italic>pmt-2</italic> prevent <italic>acdh-1</italic> activation via B12-mechanism-I? Does <italic>pmt-2</italic> RNAi prevent propionate accumulation in wild-type worms?</p><p>7) Subsection “Methionine and choline supplementation suppress B12-Mechanism-II”, last paragraph: These results should be backed by statistical testing.

This finding is consistent with the model proposed in the paper and the authors should discuss this in the manuscript.</p><p>9) Figure 6A-D: Statistical tests should be performed for the differences in gene expression across conditions and p values should be reported in the figure.</p><p>10) Subsection “B12-mechanism-II actives influx and represses efflux of the Met/SAM cycle”: The authors should discuss why depletion of <italic>nhr-10</italic> and <italic>nhr-68</italic>, regulators of vitamin B12-mechanism-I, also results in reduced <italic>pmp-5</italic> expression.</p><p>11) Subsection “B12-mechanism-II actives influx and represses efflux of the Met/SAM cycle”: p value for statistical test performed should be depicted on the figure (<italic>nhr-114</italic> expression in wild-type vs. <italic>nhr-68</italic> mutant).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Previously this group identified a new shunt pathway for propionate breakdown, which (in contrast to the canonical pathway) does not involve a vitamin B12-dependent step and which is transcriptionally activated by low vitamin B12 levels. Accumulating propionate induces the first gene in this new shunt pathway, <italic>acdh-1</italic>, and this induction is completely dependent on <italic>nhr-10</italic>. In this manuscript, the authors find that even in the absence of <italic>nhr-10</italic>, <italic>acdh-1</italic> is induced at a low level, indicating a propionate-independent mechanism to induce <italic>acdh-1</italic>. The propionate-independent mechanism is induced by low vitamin B12, which leads to low SAM and requires another NHR, <italic>nhr-114</italic>. This pathway induces expression of Met/SAM cycle genes as well as other genes that help to compensate for the low vitamin B12. This paper illustrates the power of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to uncover the transcriptional mechanisms that control basic metabolic pathways and are still not well understood. The experiments and analysis in this paper are well done.</p><p>It would be helpful if the second and third paragraph in the Introduction referenced and mapped to the overview in Figure 1A. MS and MUT should be indicated in Figure 1A.</p><p>Figure 7 is confusing. What do the different colors mean? Why are there both positive and negative signals between B12 and the Met/SAM cycle? A more detailed figure legend would certainly help. Ideally, the legend would briefly review the meaning/evidence for each of the positive/negative signals.</p><p>I would like the authors to comment on the findings of Gracida and Eckmann that Trp, but not other amino acids, could rescue the sterility of <italic>nhr-114</italic> mutants, while the authors found that methionine (and choline and B12) could rescue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The Walhout lab had previously demonstrated that dietary deficiency in vitamin B12 results in compensatory transcriptional responses. They had found that propionate accumulation due to vitamin B12 deficiency activates expression of set of genes that encode for components of a propionate shunt system. These activations are dependent on <italic>nhr-10</italic>. They refer to this pathway as &quot;B12-mechanism-I&quot;. Their discovery was aided by use of a reporter, <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic>, whose expression is upregulated upon vitamin B12 deficiency. However, <italic>Pacdh-1::GFP</italic> is not fully shut down in <italic>nhr-10</italic> mutants when subjected to low B12 levels The current paper details the discovery of what they refer to as &quot;B12-mechanism-II'. Using a combination of forward and reverse genetic screens, gene expression studies, metabolite measurements, and metabolite add back experiments, the authors show that low concentrations of SAM underlie this second mechanism and that the noted gene upregulations are dependent on <italic>nhr-114</italic>.</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent paper and well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The experiments are logical and well executed. The data are sufficiently robust and well controlled. The conclusions are supported by corroborative pieces of evidence. The authors should be commended for their clear writing, especially since the pathways are hard to keep track of and the discoveries depend on complex combinations of conditions. I also thought that the authors did an excellent job pointing out unanswered question in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>I am happy to say that I have no major concerns about the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60259.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) Subsection “Low dietary vitamin B12 activates two transcriptional mechanisms”: Given the data shown in Figure 1B, it cannot be interpreted conclusively that the activation of acdh-1 expression in response to accumulating propionate is completely dependent on nhr-10.
