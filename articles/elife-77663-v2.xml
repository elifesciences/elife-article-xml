restoration of tissue homeostasis. In this study, we used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic lines of mice to investigate whether epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium have their origins in one or more of the mesenchymal cell types present in the stromal compartment of the endometrium. Using scRNAseq, we identified a novel population of PDGFRb + mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. To confirm our hypothesis we used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts (PDGFRa+) and stromal perivascular cells (NG2/CSPG4+). We demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons both to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response (Asherman’s syndrome, endometriosis) as well as other mucosal tissues which have a variable response to wounding.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human uterus is a formidable organ. From puberty to menopause, it completely sheds off its internal lining every 28 days or so, creating what is in effect a large open wound. Unlike the skin or other parts of the body, however, this tissue can quickly repair itself without scarring. This fascinating process remains poorly understood, partly because human samples and animal models that mimic human menstruation are still lacking. This makes it difficult to grasp how various types of uterine cells get mobilised for healing.</p><p>To fill this gap, Kirkwood et al. focused on fibroblasts, a heterogenous cell population which helps to support the epithelial cells lining the inside of the uterus. How these cells responded to the advent of menstruation was examined in female mice genetically manipulated to have human-like periods. A method known as single-cell RNAseq was used to track which genes were active in each of these cells before, one day and two days after period onset. This revealed the existence of a subpopulation of cells which only appeared when wound healing was most needed.</p><p>These ‘repair-specific’ fibroblasts expressed a mixture of genes; those typical of fibroblasts but also some known to be active in the epithelial cells lining the uterus. This suggests that the cells were in the process of changing their identity so they could remake the uterine layer lost during a period. And indeed, labelling these fibroblasts with a fluorescent tag showed that, during healing, they had migrated from within the uterine tissue to become part of its newly restored internal surface. These results represent the first evidence that fibroblasts play a direct role in repairing the uterus during menstruation.</p><p>From endometriosis to infertility, the lives of millions of people around the world are impacted by disorders which affect the uterine lining. A better understanding of how the uterus can fix itself month after month could help to find new treatments for these conditions. This knowledge could also be useful for to address abnormal wound healing in the skin and other tissues, as this process often involves fibroblasts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endometrium</kwd><kwd>repair</kwd><kwd>mesenchyme to epithelial transition</kwd><kwd>pericyte</kwd><kwd>PDGFR alpha</kwd><kwd>scarless</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N013166/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkwood</surname><given-names>Phoebe M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N024524/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkwood</surname><given-names>Phoebe M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>Douglas A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Isaac</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>219542/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Neil C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Repetitive injury, inflammation, and fibrosis resulting in disordered tissue architecture is a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenhalgh et al., 2015</xref>). The endometrium, a complex hormone responsive multicellular tissue, exhibits remarkable resilience in its ability to respond to the monthly wound of ‘menstruation’ without fibrosis and with a response that is both rapid and scar-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ludwig and Spornitz, 1991</xref>). A critical ‘trigger’ for menstruation in women is the rapid fall in circulating concentrations of progesterone that occurs as a result of the involution of the ovarian corpus luteum in a non-fertile cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maybin and Critchley, 2011</xref>). Menstruation is considered an inflammatory event with a ‘cascade’ of changes including an increase in synthesis of pro-inflammatory factors such as prostaglandins, cytokines, and chemokines which is accompanied by infiltration of immune cells of the myeloid lineage (neutrophils, monocyte/macrophages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Salamonsen, 2012</xref>). Increased production of prostaglandins is associated with arteriole vasoconstriction which results in local hypoxia, stabilisation of HIF1alpha and increased expression of genes such as <italic>VEGF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Critchley et al., 2006b</xref>). Whilst we have a good appreciation of the mechanisms that contribute to the tightly regulated breakdown and shedding of a portion of the endometrium at menses gaps remain in our understanding of the processes that contribute to rapid, fibrosis/scar-free restoration of an intact luminal epithelium over the tissue surface. It is also important to separate the mechanisms responsible for menstrual repair, which occurs at a time in the cycle when ovarian-derived steroids are low, from endometrial regeneration/proliferation which occurs subsequently in response to rising levels of follicle-derived oestrogens during the proliferative phase of the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maybin and Critchley, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several different mechanisms have already been proposed as contributing to the luminal repair process including, activation of progenitor/stem cells in the stroma and/or epithelium, epithelial cell proliferation/migration and transformation of stromal cells into epithelial cells (mesenchyme to epithelial transition, MET) each of which are discussed briefly below.</p><p>The ability of the endometrium to rapidly regenerate during each menstrual cycle has prompted researchers to explore a role for putative stem/progenitor cells residing in either the stroma and/or the epithelial compartments in endometrial repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gargett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cousins et al., 2021</xref>). The Gargett group have identified populations of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells; eMSC with clonogenic and broad multilineage potential in both human endometrial tissue and menstrual fluid and characterised them as PDGFRB+/CD146+/ SUSD2+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gargett et al., 2016</xref>). Notably in human endometrial tissue sections these cells had a perivascular location and a putative pericyte identity. A role for progenitor cells residing in the basal glandular epithelium has also been proposed with a recent review highlighting a number of marker proteins employed to establish their identity including SOX9 and SSEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cousins et al., 2021</xref>). Another source of putative stem cells that may contribute to endometrial repair processes and/or endometrial pathology is the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaitu’u-Lino et al., 2012</xref>) although evidence for the contribution of bone marrow-derived stem cells is somewhat limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajanova et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>During the first 2 days of menstruation rapid shedding of the luminal portion of the tissue (functional layer) leaves a denuded (basal) stroma interspersed with glandular ‘stumps’. This phenomenon was beautifully documented in the elegant studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ludwig and Spornitz, 1991</xref>. In the 1970’s Ferenczy proposed that new epithelial cells arose from proliferation of intact surface epithelium bordering denuded stroma and the basal glands that were exposed when the functional layer was shed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferenczy, 1976b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferenczy, 1976a</xref>). He noted that the re-epithelialisation of the human endometrium was rapid (~48 hr) and did not appear to involve mitosis of the epithelial cells (migration?). These mechanisms of epithelial repair were later endorsed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ludwig and Spornitz, 1991</xref> who also observed fibrin mesh formation on the denuded surface in the early days of menstruation and growth of an epithelial monolayer in spirals which would appear to be consistent with them being associated with the residual stumps of endometrial glands. When Garry and colleagues used a more dynamic approach involving pressure-controlled, continuous flow hysteroscopy they found evidence that loss and repair of the surface occur synchronously at different places within the endometrial cavity a process they called ‘piecemeal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garry et al., 2009</xref>). They also reported epithelial cells of the glands underwent apoptosis and were shed with the decidual tissue mass. Apoptosis of glandular epithelial cells in carefully dated human endometrium has also been documented using staining for cleaved caspase 3 and shown to be high in both late secretory and menstrual phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together the data from Garry et al and Armstrong et al challenges the earlier papers citing the glands as the source of new luminal cells.</p><p>There is also evidence that cells within the stromal compartment may change their identity to adopt an epithelial phenotype (mesenchyme to epithelial transition, MET) and thereby contribute to the luminal surface. This was first proposed in the 1960’s by Baggish et al who evaluated sections of menstruating human endometria and noted hyperchromatic stromal cells between gland stumps that appeared to take part in re-epithelisation by a process simulating metaplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baggish et al., 1967</xref>). In the 1970’s the involvement of the stroma was challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferenczy, 1976b</xref>) but has been supported by more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garry et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically in 2009 the authors reported that the denuded basalis endometrium was rapidly covered with a fibrinous mesh within which new surface epithelial cells were present which appeared to arise from the underlying stroma.</p><p>To complement studies on human tissue samples and studies in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Critchley et al., 2006a</xref>) we have used a highly reproducible mouse model that recapitulates key features of human menstruation in response to withdrawal of progesterone including vascular breakdown (vaginal bleeding), spatial and temporal hypoxia, cell apoptosis, expression of matrix metalloproteinases and influx of myeloid immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maybin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cousins et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cousins et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, as in the human endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garry et al., 2009</xref>), restoration of an intact luminal epithelial layer occurs within two days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with some of the reports on repair processes in human endometrium we found evidence for epithelial cell migration and proliferation of residual epithelial cells (Ki67+) but no significant proliferation of basal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>). Other groups have also used similar mouse models to explore the dynamic changes during a menstrual-like event. Kaitu’u-Lino et al used a mouse model in combination with pulse labelling of cells with BrdU, and reported that a population of epithelial progenitor cells residing in the basal glands might contribute to postmenstrual repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaitu’u-Lino et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaitu’u-Lino et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In our endometrial repair/menstrual model one of our novel findings was the existence of stromal cells that co-expressed vimentin (stromal cell marker) and cytokeratin (epithelial cell marker) specifically residing in areas denuded of epithelium which suggested to us that stromal cells might be changing their phenotype via MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we have used single cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing to specifically address which, if any, of the stromal mesenchymal cell subpopulations we previously identified in the mouse endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkwood et al., 2021</xref>) might contribute to the rapid restoration of the intact luminal epithelial cell layer observed in our mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cousins et al., 2016a</xref>).

The human endometrium is unusual in its ability to experience cyclical episodes of breakdown/shedding (wounding) which occur in parallel with repair processes that leave the tissue intact without an obvious scar. We used a previously validated mouse model that mimics the key features of human menstruation in which we made some preliminary observations that aligned with studies suggesting MET of stromal cells might contribute to the rapid repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>). In the work presented here we have identified a new population of repair-specific PDGFRb + cells that responded to changes in the endometrial environment induced by progesterone withdrawal by upregulating expression of genes associated with MET/epithelial cell identify. To best understand how this population might influence our understanding of endometrial repair we designed further experiments to answer two specific questions. First – what was the originating cell type of this transient population? Second – what was its fate?</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to explore whether we could substantiate our hypothesis that MET was occurring in stromal cells exposed by shedding of the decidual mass in our mouse model of menstruation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore we decided to use <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-BAC-eGFP reporter mice in our menstrual model as we had previously shown eGFP was only expressed in stromal cell populations during the oestrus cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkwood et al., 2021</xref>). Comparison between scRNAseq datasets from cycling mice identified three populations of mesenchyme cells that were unique to endometrial tissue recovered 24 or 48 hr after withdrawal of progesterone at a time when the tissue in the process of active breakdown/repair. One population was very closely associated with the previously identified pericyte cell population with sequence analysis suggesting it might represent a subgroup of cells that had some minor changes in function possibly associated with loss of some of the vascular compartment. A second population was only present at 48 hr and based on expression of several genes associated with apoptosis we concluded that it represented stromal cells that were not going to survive in repairing tissue and that cell death was one potential fate of the GFP + cells. The most interesting population of GFP + cells (F4) were unique to the 24 hr tissue with a transcriptome that included expression of both canonical mesenchymal and epithelial cell markers as well as a number of genes such as <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (beta-catenin) and <italic>Twist</italic> which have been implicated cell transitions between mesenchyme and epithelium. Notably it has previously been reported that mice with stabilisation of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>, a gene that plays an important role in Wnt signalling, had smaller uteri, endometrial gland defects, and were infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2013</xref>). Further analysis using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry confirmed the existence of GFP + EPCAM + cells in the 24 hr samples.</p><p>These results backed up our previous observation that MET occurred in regions of tissue associated with endometrial repair and are in agreement with studies exploring the fate of mesenchyme cells after parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). For example, Huang et al used a knock-in strategy with cells expressing LacZ induced by <italic>Amhr2-Cre</italic>: in virgin females the reporter was specific to stromal cells but post-partum they found labelled cells in both luminal and glandular epithelium. In another study using a SM22a-Cre driver, expression of which was reported to be restricted to a subset of CD34 +mesenchymal cells, reporter gene expression (GFP) was also detected in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). Whilst authors of all these papers concluded their results were consistent with stromal MET this interpretation has been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, Ghosh et al conducted a comprehensive examination of embryonic and adult reproductive tracts using LacZ reporter lines driven by promoters for the genes <italic>Amhr2, Sm22, Cspg4, Thy1</italic> and <italic>Pdgfrß</italic> all of which are expressed in mesenchyme. They specifically questioned whether epithelial cells expressing reporter proteins in the adult endometrium arose from MET or were induced at a time when cells had meso-epithelial characteristics. In all cases, they attributed epithelial expression in adult epithelial cells to activation of the promoters during embryonic life ruling out MET in adult cycling mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of the results obtained using <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-BAC-eGFP reporter mice was that the knockin strategy used to generate the line meant GFP was only expressed in cells when the <italic>Pgdfrb</italic> promoter was active. We have previously established that the expression of GFP in the endometrium of adult female mice was identical to the native PDGFRβ protein and was stroma-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkwood et al., 2021</xref>). A comparison between GFP expression in cycling mice those using uteri recovered after induction of endometrial shedding/repair led us to conclude that the presence of GFP in the epithelial cells was most likely because the turnover of the GFP was slow enough for it to persist after the <italic>Pgdfrb</italic> promoter was no longer active. This would be consistent with reports that eGFP protein was engineered to have increased fluorescence and slower turnover in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>; although the half-life of the protein varies in different cell models a paper exploring in vivo expression in cancer reported it to be ~15 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danhier et al., 2015</xref>). These results were also considered consistent with detection of less GFP in EPCAM + epithelial cells at 48 than 24 hr when this was evaluated using flow cytometry.</p><p>Therefore, to make a more robust case for MET of endometrial stromal cells we expanded our scRNAseq datasets by analysing the epithelial cells (EPCAM+) from tissue recovered from both cycling mice and those in which endometrial repair was well advanced (48 hr). We then complemented these findings by undertaking lineage tracing studies in two new lines of mice using a strategy that induced expression of a tdTm reporter protein in adulthood to avoid any confounding effects of MET that might occur during development of the uterus. Analysis of EPCAM + cells resulted in identification of nine subpopulations of epithelial cells based on cluster analysis and comparisons to genes previously identified as being expressed in different locations including the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) and glands (<italic>Foxa2</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelleher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>When we combined our eGFP + and EPCAM + scRNAseq datasets three broad groups of cell types was present: perivascular, fibroblast and epithelial with the repair-specific transient population of cells (24 hr specific, F4) appearing as a distinct fibroblast subpopulation which on trajectory analysis appeared to form a ‘bridge’ between the previously identified fibroblast clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkwood et al., 2021</xref>) and the new epithelial datasets. Based on previous reports that identified cells with stem-like properties in a perivascular location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gargett et al., 2016</xref>) we had initially anticipated pericytes might have been mobilised to undergo MET however the trajectory data suggested we might be wrong. To complement and extend the transcriptional profiling and to gain a fuller picture of the source of the putative MET cells we compared results from two new lines of mice. One in which we targeted fibroblasts using a Cre under the control of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> and a second line in which all perivascular/vSMC were targeted using the <italic>Cspg4</italic> (NG2) promoter. We used a TAM-dependent induction schedule that we refined so that there was robust transgene induction but no residual impact on the response of the tissue to decidualisation and induction of endometrial injury. The results obtained were unequivocal and supported not only MET of fibroblasts but also their incorporation into the restored luminal epithelium in a layer adjacent to epithelial cells which had not arisen by MET but were likely to have migrated from residual epithelial cell remnants left at time of shedding. These novel findings provide robust evidence that the endometrium can use multiple mechanisms including recruitment of mesenchyme cells to rapidly restore its integrity a feature of the tissue that is important for its normal functioning and for fertility. In future studies, it would be interesting to use cell ablation strategies specifically targeting F2 to investigate whether repair is delayed if they are not present, whether any other fibroblasts replace them and the relative contributions of the other mechanisms previously identified (epithelial proliferation and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>) to the acute phase of restoration of luminal epithelial integrity.</p><p>The generation of these scRNAseq datasets have allowed us to make some preliminary comparisons to results from studies using this technique to explore cell heterogeneity in human endometrium and human endometrial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Queckbörner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Queckborner and colleagues focused their analysis cells from 3 donors obtained during in the proliferative phase of their menstrual cycle (6864 cells) using a protocol that enriched for stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Queckbörner et al., 2021</xref>). They subtyped two populations of perivascular/pericyte cells with different expression levels of MY11D and CSPG4 both of which we have previously mapped to perivascular populations in the mouse endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkwood et al., 2021</xref>). They subtyped the stromal fibroblasts into 10 closely related clusters of fibroblasts and concluded that the markers for progenitor cells were not specific enough. They didn’t analyse any tissues/cells from the menstrual phase so there are no comparable data to ours. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref> incorporated tissues from across the menstrual cycle in their analysis including 6 that were assigned to the menstrual phase according to their supplementary data although these were identified as days 4–11 of the cycle which might be after the most rapid phase of repair (anticipated to be on days 1–3). They reported a previously uncharacterised ciliated epithelial subtype and changes in luminal epithelium and stroma that were discrete to the window of implantation but nothing specific to repair mechanisms. Cao et al focused their attention on the perivascular cell population performing sequence analysis of CD140b+CD146+ (eMSC) cells isolated from menstrual phase (days 2–3) and secretory phases (n=3 women in each group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). They identified two subclusters in cultured cells from the menstrual phase with the larger cluster having high expression of PDGFRβ/PDGFRα consistent with a fibroblast identity. When they compared their data to the Wang dataset they noted significant changes in gene expression patterns and concluded that the cell transcriptomes had been influenced by cell culture which may compromise attempts to compare between in vitro and in vivo data.</p><p>In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2022</xref> used a single-cell approach to interrogate tissue recovered from menstrual effluent from patients with an without a diagnosis of endometriosis 9 of which were classified as ‘controls’ (8/9 had normal cycle length 26-31d). Cluster analysis showed a high proportion of immune cells, five closely related stromal cell populations and three epithelial cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2022</xref>). Comparison between the genes that defined each subpopulation of stromal cells (GFBP1, MGP, IL11, SRGN, HSPA6) with our current dataset did not find any that corresponded to F4 which is probably unsurprising as these signatures were based on shed cells not those that remained in situ and therefore able to contribute to the new luminal epithelium. In contrast, we did find some homologies within the dataset published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2022</xref> whose analysis included single-cell sequencing of full thickness endometrium from the proliferative and secretory phases (no menstrual tissue). Their stromal cell subclusters included one enriched for SFRP4 which they also showed provided a positive stimulus to regeneration in a rat endometrial injury model. Comparison with our own datasets identified <italic>Sfrp4</italic> expression was highest in our F2 and F4 populations, very low in F1/F3 and absent from the epithelial cells: two of the factors secreted by the SFRP4 cells were also higher in the mouse F4 than other cell clusters (PENK, GLIPR1). Whilst further work is needed to validate whether a population equivalent to F4 is present in the menstrual endometrium looking for SFRP4 cells might provide a useful starting point and it is also notable that the authors found the SFRP4 cells to be distinct to putative progenitors identified as SUSD2 + which were enriched in the perivascular population.</p><p>In summary, we describe novel data and new datasets that show MET can contribute to the rapid scar-free healing of the endometrial luminal epithelium when this occurs in response to an endometrial ‘wound’ at the time of menstruation. The cell type involved in this MET is a PDGFRα+stromal cell and not the NG2 + pericytes. Further studies on the origin of these cells and their contribution to repair will require new studies using CRE lines which are specific to F2 for lineage tracing and cell ablation. The current findings also provide a platform for further analysis of the fibrosis-resistant phenotype of endometrial fibroblasts, comparisons to conditions where their function is abnormal (Asherman’s syndrome, endometriosis) and comparison to other mucosal barrier tissues such as that found in the oral cavity as recently described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 2021</xref>. We postulate that manipulation of putative MET progenitors/specific cell types in the disease setting may provide novel strategies in the management and/or treatment of disorders associated with poor response to healing or excess fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>In <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-BAC-eGFP reporter mice, eGFP expression is driven by the regulatory sequences of the <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> gene and is therefore expressed by all cells in which the promoter is active.

We therefore selected mice which would express Cre recombinase in response to induction of the promoters of these genes as appropriate for segregating cells representing these two subpopulations in our mouse model of endometrial repair. <italic>Pdgfra</italic>Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> mice express a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER<sup>T2</sup>) under the control of the mouse <italic>Pdgfra</italic> promoter/enhancer.

For TMX administration, in initial screening experiments an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 100 µl was given to each mouse (standard 20 g weight) for 3 consecutive days (TMX dose 100 mg/kg). In later experiments the method was refined and TMX was administered via oral gavage (daily, 3x100 µl/day). To optimise an appropriate TMX wash out period prior to the mouse model of ‘menstruation’ (endometrial shedding and repair), uterine weights and the stromal to epithelial cell ratio (as determined by flow cytometry analysis) were analysed in mice treated with TMX or vehicle (sesame oil) and uterine tissues collected 24 hr, 1 week, 4 weeks and 8 weeks later. After 4 weeks following the final tamoxifen administration, tissue analysis was comparable to controls (Vehicle treated, no TMX). To validate timing so that the mouse model of ‘menstruation’ still worked, the decidualisation response (≥1 uterine horn decidualised) and corresponding uterine weights were analysed in mice in which reporter expression was induced with TMX and uterine tissues collected 24, 48, and 72 hr following the withdrawal of progesterone (onset of ‘menses) and compared to those where no TMX administration had occurred. No significant differences were observed indicating that a tamoxifen induction 4 weeks prior to the start of the mouse model of ‘menstruation’ had no deleterious effects on the model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mouse model of ‘menstruation’ (endometrial shedding and repair)</title><p>All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) and under licensed approval from the UK Home Office. The mouse model of ‘menstruation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (i)) was conducted according to standard protocols that have been described in detail in previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cousins et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cousins et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were ovariectomised (d0) and given daily injections of β-oestradiol (E2) in sesame oil (100 ng/100 µl, d7-9). A progesterone (P)-secreting pellet was inserted (sub-cutaneous) on d13; mice also received daily injections of E2 (5 ng/100 µl; d13-15). A critical step in the model is the transformation of stromal fibroblasts into cells with a decidual phenotype achieved by introduction of a small amount of oil via the vagina (d15). Removal of a progesterone-secreting pellet 4 days later (d19) results in a rapid fall in progesterone culminating in breakdown and shedding of the decidual mass leaving parts of the endometrial lining with a surface denuded of epithelial cells (24 hr; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>). Within 3 days (72 hr after pellet removal) the integrity of the luminal epithelial layer is fully restored and gross uterine architecture resembles that of mice prior to ovariectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (ii)).</p><p>In those studies using mice in which transgene expression was induced using TMX the protocol was modified to ensure there were no agonist or antagonist impacts of the drug on the endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gielen et al., 2008</xref>) which could alter responsiveness to exogenous E2. Pilot studies were conducted and a 4 w wash out period applied to all TMX-treated mice before they were used in the menstruation model.</p><p>The minimum number of experimental animals to provide statistically significant data has been used. Extensive experience with the mouse model of simulated menstruation protocol has found that an n=9 mice per experimental group is sufficient to detect meaningful changes in parameters of interest (cell frequency, cell number, gene expression). This is supported by data in published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cousins et al., 2016a</xref>) and in agreement with previous consultation on experimental design provided by an expert statistician to support past and current research grants. To mitigate against losses and the potential need to use non-parametric methods a group size of 10 mice per experimental group was used in experimental planning.</p><p>In the current study, while individual uterine horns were analysed as distinct samples given the potential for each to exhibit varying degrees of decidualisation in response to the stimulus, each mouse used in the protocol was considered an individual biological replicate to account for biological variation. To generate technical replicates, each protocol was performed at least twice per outcome being analysed ie time point of the post-menstrual tissue repair window being analysed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tissue recovery and processing</title><p>To preserve and detect fluorescent signal from transgenes, uteri were fixed in 4% (w/v) PFA for 2 hr at 4 °C, rinsed thoroughly in PBS and stored overnight in 18% (w/v) sucrose at 4 °C before embedding in OCT medium and storage (–80 °C).

Genome alignment, filtering, barcode and UMI counting were performed using the ‘cellranger-count’ function and ‘refdata-cellranger-mm10-1.2.0’ transcriptome as supplied by 10 x genomics. For downstream QC, clustering and gene expression analysis the <italic>Seurat</italic> R package (V3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stuart and Satija, 2019</xref>) was utilised with R version 4.0.2 in line with analyses performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkwood et al., 2021</xref>. Briefly, the data was filtered based on standard QC metrics: number of unique genes detected in each cell, nFeature_RNA &gt;200 &amp; &lt;5000; the percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome (&lt;10%); and the percentage of reads that map to ribosomal proteins (&lt;10%). The <italic>Scrublet</italic> python package was used to further identify and remove putative doublets from scRNA seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>). Following filtering, data was normalised and scaled and PCA analysis used to detect highly variable features/genes. Unsupervised clustering based on the first 20 principal components of the most variably expressed genes was performed using a graph based approach (‘FindNeighbours’, ‘FindClusters’; resolution = 0.2). Clusters were visualised using the manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method and identified by analysing the expression of canonical cell markers.</p><p>Differential gene expression analysis was performed (‘FindAllMarkers’) to identify genes expressed by each cell cluster when compared to all other clusters, using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test and p-value threshold of &lt;0.05.

To complement these analyses, annotated gene sets were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) under the C5 ontology gene sets with a focus on genes associated with EMT/MET: ‘GOBP_epithelial_to_mesenchymal_transition’ and ‘GOBP_mesenchymal_to_epithelial_transition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Seurat</italic> (V3) was used to integrate mesenchymal and epithelial scRNAseq datasets as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stuart and Satija, 2019</xref>. This method uses the FindIntegrationAnchors() function to identify cross-dataset ‘anchors’ ie. pairs of cells in each dataset that are in a matched biological state. These ‘anchors’ are then used to align the datasets using the IntegrateData() function. The standard <italic>Seurat</italic> integration workflow is used both to correct for technical differences between datasets (batch correction based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and influenced by mutual nearest neighbours (MNN)) and make comparisons across experimental conditions. Following integration, data processing, clustering and visualisation was performed as described above (normalisation, scaling, PCA analysis, clustering).</p><p>In silico trajectory analysis was performed using <italic>Monocle3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). Monocle3 works on the basis that cells in different functional ‘states’ express different sets of genes, and if/as cells move between these states, they undergo a process of transcriptional re-configuration where some genes are activated whilst others are silenced. Monocle3 uses an algorithm to learn if there is a sequence of gene expression changes between single cells that connect clusters through a putative differentiation trajectory. This analysis generates ‘roots’, ‘branches’ and ‘end-points’; ‘roots’ are points in the trajectory/cluster where the transcriptome of individual cells is most similar to their neighbours that is the region in the cluster that may represent a differentiated phenotype; ‘branches’ represent cellular differentiation points that cells would go through to travel from one part of the trajectory to another; and ‘end-points’ are the final states of a predicted differentiation path representing the fully differentiated cells. RNA velocity analysis was performed using <italic>scVelo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>) which uses a mathematical model of splicing kinetics to determine the directionality of genetic changes between neighbouring cells. Briefly, a ratio of pre-mature (unspliced) to mature (spliced) mRNA counts is calculated for each gene and velocities obtained as residuals from this ratio. The velocities are combined to estimate the future state of each cell and predict the directionality of cell-to-cell transitions.</p><p>The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE198556.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were performed under a license granted by the UK Home Office (PPL 70/8945) and were approved by the University of Edinburgh Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Details of antibodies used in the study.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Primary and secondary antibodies with associated working dilutions used to detect proteins in mouse uterine tissues.

This included a high percentage of mitochondrial gene expression (% mito.genes) indicative of apoptotic/lysing cells, expression of key apoptosis-associated genes (<italic>Cas3</italic>, <italic>Cas9</italic>, <italic>Trp53</italic>, <italic>Bak</italic>) and GO analysis revealing DNA damage pathways. We have added text to the Results section to make it clear that this conclusion in the current paper is based on in silico data. We have also referenced our previous study using the same model (Armstrong et al. 2017) which detected high levels of apoptosis (based on cleaved caspase staining) in the stromal compartment 24h after removal of the P4 pellet (page 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a couple of bioinformatic techniques that need a little more detail in the methods section. First is the use of GSEA supporting the data presented in Figure 2E.</p></disp-quote><p>References and details of the MSigDB datasets that were downloaded to contribute to the analysis reported in Figure 2E have been added to the methods section (page 17) to clarify that these were annotated datasets defined as being involved in EMT/MET.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, and most importantly, is the approach used to combine datasets that result in the data presented in Figure 4 – this is very important to the work as it established the link between the fibroblast and epithelial clusters. Were batch effects considered in this analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes batch correction was part of the Seurat integration workflow and more details have been added to the M and M section on page 17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4D seems to imply a small number specific genes in establishing the epithelial aspect of similarity. Is further comment needed?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4D we explored the relationship between F4 and the other subclusters using a range of accepted canonical cell type-associated genes – the results obtained complemented the other bioinformatic data (e.g. Figure 4A) and showed F4 as expressing genes usually considered as associated with either mesenchymal or epithelial lineages. However, it was also noted that F4 did not express the whole array of keratins and mucins as the ‘pure’ epithelial populations do. We have added extra text to results on page 6 to clarify our interpretation of these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Monocle is not the only approach to trajectory analysis. Were others used as well? The authors may want to consider presenting RNA velocity analysis – I suspect it will support the monocle data.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes we did other analyses but had not included them so we appreciate the suggestion. We have now added Velocity analysis to the paper as a new supplementary figure. Information about the results of the trajectory analysis have been added (page 8) plus methods (page 17). The velocity analysis backs up the monocle data by showing F4 originating in the F2 subpopulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify the meaning of &quot;root&quot; in describing the monocle analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for being too brief in the methods. Monocle3 ‘learns’ if there is a sequence of gene expression changes between neighbouring cells and builds the trajectory based on this. Once it learns overall trajectory it places cells at its position in this trajectory and this generates roots and branches. Roots are points in the trajectory/cluster where the cells are most similar to each other in terms of transcriptome ie. the region in the cluster that might represent a differentiated/distinct phenotype. Branches represent cellular decisions/differentiation points that cells would go through to travel from one part of the trajectory to another. Extra text has been added to the methods so that the reader will better understand what the figure shows (page 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What do the grey dots mean in Figure 5A.</p></disp-quote><p>Black dots are the roots, black lines are the trajectory branches and grey dots are ends of the inferred trajectories ie. the end-point of a differentiation path representing a cluster of fully differentiated cells. In addition to information in methods we have updated the legend to figure 5 to explain the colours of dots/lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have several key points to suggest the authors to consider prior to publication.</p><p>1. To further prove the clinical relevance of the findings, I would suggest the authors to check whether this phenomenon could also be observed in human samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We regularly evaluate all the human studies that are published on endometrium some of which we have mentioned in our discussion. One of the challenges is that many studies lack sufficient depth of read in scRNAseq to identify subpopulations of stromal cells and it is rare for them to include samples from late secretory/menstrual samples. However since our paper was submitted we have found 2 new papers with some scRNAseq data that may be relevant – one of these Shih et al. (BMC Med 2022) analysed cells in menstrual effluent and the other Wu et al. (Cell Discovery 2022) identified an SFRP4+ stromal cell subpopulation. The Wu et al. paper is particularly interesting as when we searched our dataset for this gene (as well as factors made by these cells) we found that they were expressed in both F2 and F4. We have included these papers and discussed their findings in an additional paragraph added to the Discussion (page 12/13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. As the menstrual period is intricately regulated by periodal hormonal change, is this subset of fibroblasts responsible of endometrial repair at menstruation also hormone-dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>Results from our study (and those of other investigators) have shown that luminal epithelial repair during the initial phase of menstruation can occur independent of E2 and at a time when progesterone is low – our mice are ovx and ovarian hormone levels are low in women at this time. We have not investigated the hormone dependence of F2 in intact mice during the normal cycle but based on our previous findings using human stromal fibroblasts we would anticipate responses to androgens, oestrogens and progestins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Is it possible to identify the origin of this subset of fibroblasts? Whether they derive from differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in the uterine wall or directly from differentiation of endometrial stem cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We designed our experiments to focus on the acute phase of experimental repair – first to see if we could identify any population(s) that might transform into epithelia (using PDGFRb-GFP as a global marker of mesenchyme which included putative progenitor cells identified in previous studies) and then to follow up on the initial findings by using lineage tracing for two different mesenchyme populations (fibroblasts vs pericytes/SMC). When we started the study we thought a progenitor population might be the one contributing to epithelial repair but we found no evidence of this (see Discussion). Our study does not address the origin of the fibroblasts in the F2 population as the lineage tracing only targeted cells induced 1 month previously but we speculate this could be addressed by performing longer term lineage tracing studies focused on the fate of progenitors/stem cells which may reside closer to the myometrium (basal compartment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would be recommended to further analyze the chemokine and cytokine profiles of this subset of fibroblasts to reveal their possible functions.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis strategy was informed by the results of the informatics and as shown in the GO analysis illustrated in Figure 2B suggested the main functional processes associated with the F4 transcriptome were response to wounding, differentiation, epithelium differentiation, response to hypoxia all of which led us to focus on more towards MET/EMT than inflammation. In our previous evaluation of mesenchyme subsets in the cycling endometrium (Kirkwood et al. 2021, FASEBJ) we found the pericytes (P1) and the F1 subpopulation of fibroblasts had transcription profiles which matched to GO terms associated with regulation of immune response so we did not do further work on this aspect in the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. What would happen if this subset of fibroblasts are genetically depleted?</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting question that would need to be addressed in a future study. In the study in which we first identified MET as a possible mechanism contributing to repair (Cousins et al. 2014) we also highlighted roles for epithelial proliferation and epithelial migration in the rapid restoration of the lumen (in agreement with results in human studies).</p><p>Based on these findings we speculate deletion of F2 would most likely delay but not completely block the repair process. We have added some extra text to the discussion to follow up on your question (page 13).</p></body></sub-article></article>
