Phenol-soluble modulins (PSM) comprise the structural scaffold of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms through self-assembly into functional amyloids, but the role of individual PSMs during biofilm formation remains poorly understood and the molecular pathways of PSM self-assembly are yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate high degree of cooperation between individual PSMs during functional amyloid formation. PSMα3 initiates the aggregation, forming unstable aggregates capable of seeding other PSMs resulting in stable amyloid structures. Using chemical kinetics we dissect the molecular mechanism of aggregation of individual PSMs showing that PSMα1, PSMα3 and PSMβ1 display secondary nucleation whereas PSMβ2 aggregates through primary nucleation and elongation. Our findings suggest that various PSMs have evolved to ensure fast and efficient biofilm formation through cooperation between individual peptides.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>functional amyloids</kwd><kwd>chemical kinetics</kwd><kwd><italic>S. aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>phenol soluble modulins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002739</institution-id><institution>Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AUFF-E-2017-7-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andreasen</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inter-molecular cross-seeding between phenol-soluble modulins facilitates rapid and efficient self-assembly in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> biofilms revealing a complex molecular interplay between distinct phenol-soluble modulins orchestrating functional amyloid formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aggregated proteins in the form of functional amyloids are widespread in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pham et al., 2014</xref>).

In their soluble monomeric form they hinder host immune response by recruiting, activating, and lysing human neutrophils while also promoting biofilm dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). However, self-assembly of PSMs into amyloid fibrils fortify the biofilm matrix to resist disassembly by mechanical stress and matrix degrading enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleem et al., 2017</xref>).

Despite the formation of functional amyloids in <italic>S. aureus</italic> by PSMs, many questions remain about the intrinsic molecular mechanism by which they self-assemble and what molecular events trigger the formation of fibrillar structure from their monomeric precursor peptide.

Recently, kinetic models of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knowles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meisl et al., 2016</xref>) have been effectively applied to numerous model systems in biomolecular self-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisl et al., 2014</xref>). Through these models, the aggregation kinetics ascertain the rates and reaction orders of the underlying molecular events, allowing for the determination of the dominating molecular mechanism of formation of new aggregates. Aggregation kinetics of all seven PSMs peptides (PSMα1–4, PSMβ1 and 2, and δ-toxin) was monitored using Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LeVine, 1993</xref>). For PSMα1, PSMα3, PSMβ1, and PSMβ2 reproducible aggregation curves were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), while for the rest of the PSM peptides (PSMα2, PSMα4, and δ-toxin) no reproducible aggregation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>). An increase in ThT fluorescence is observed for PSMα4 although this was not sigmoidal in shape and also not reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The timescale for the completion of aggregation differs significantly between the PSM ranging from ~1 hr for PSMα3 and up to ~70 hr for PSMα1. Furthermore, the aggregation of PSMβ1 was carried out at concentrations of microgram per milliliter compared to concentrations at milligram per milliliter for the other PSM peptides since at higher concentrations of PSMβ1 the lag-time during aggregation becomes monomer independent suggesting a saturation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental kinetic data for the aggregation of phenol-soluble modulin (PSMs) peptides from monomeric peptides.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Aggregation of PSMα1 (0.05–1.0 mg/mL) fitted to a secondary nucleation model.

High quality global fits were achieved for all four peptides assuming a secondary nucleation mechanism for PSMα1, PSMα3, and PSMβ1, and a primary nucleation and elongation mechanism for PSMβ2. The presence of a single dominating aggregation mechanism for all four peptides is seen in the linear correlation between the half-time and the initial monomer concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meisl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a–d</xref>). In this simple nucleation-elongation (or linear self-assembly) model, the protein monomers form an initial nucleus with rate constant (<italic>k<sub>n</sub></italic>) and reaction order (<italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic>) which grow by elongation through the addition of monomers to the fibrils ends with rate constant (<italic>k<sub>+</sub></italic>).

Secondary nucleation dominated aggregation mechanisms have previously been reported for disease-related amyloid fibrils, for example Aβ peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisl et al., 2014</xref>), insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foderà et al., 2008</xref>), α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaspar et al., 2017</xref>), and islet amyloid poly peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruschak and Miranker, 2007</xref>) whereas the nucleation-elongation model has previously been linked to functional amyloids from <italic>E. coli</italic> and Pseudomonas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreasen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In order to confirm the dominating mechanism of aggregation of the four peptides based on chemical kinetics, seeded aggregation in a regime of very low seed concentrations (nano-molar range) to monomeric concentration was conducted. This type of experiments delivers a direct means of probing the ability of fibrils to self-replicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arosio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buell et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of preformed fibril seeds can accelerate the aggregation process by two different mechanisms, namely elongation and surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation. The presence of low amounts of seeds eliminates the rate limiting step of primary nucleation when secondary nucleation is present but no changes in the kinetics will be observed when only primary nucleation and elongation is present as the low amounts of seed do not eliminate the need for more nuclei to be formed before the elongation process dominates. Indeed a decrease in the lag phase was observed with increasing seed concentration for PSMα1, PSMα3, and PSMβ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f and h</xref>), supporting the observation that secondary nucleation is the dominating molecular mechanism for the formation of new aggregates of PSMα1, PSMα3, and PSMβ1 peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). The seeding effect is more clearly visible in PSMα1 in comparison to PSMα3 and PSMβ1. However, if we do the comparison through raw data we have found that almost 50% reduction in lag phase was observed in the presence of low regime of the preformed seeds in PSMβ1. Despite the very fast kinetics of PSMα3, the reduction in lag phase was significant and can be clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The aggregation kinetics of PSMβ2 was not affected by the presence of low amounts of seeds confirming the lack of self-replication processes in the form of surface catalyzed secondary nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). The general mechanism underlying formation of new aggregates from monomers of the PSM peptides from both primary and secondary pathways is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Elongation rates differ by a factor of 1000 between fastest and slowest PSM</title><p>The relative contributions of elongation rate constant (<italic>k<sub>+</sub></italic>) were investigated in the presence of high concentration of preformed fibril seeds. The global fitting of the kinetic data yields a product of the elongation rate constant and the primary nucleation rate constant (<italic>k<sub>n</sub>k<sub>+</sub></italic>); however, in the presence of high amounts of preformed seeds, the intrinsic nucleation process becomes negligible, and hence the aggregation under this type of experiments is only dependent on elongation of the aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). The initial increase in aggregate mass was measured through linear fits to the early points of the aggregation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasmussen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weiffert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a, c, e and g</xref>). The estimated elongation rate constants for PSMα1 and PSMβ2 were found to be 0.2 mM/h<sup>2</sup> and 0.5 mM/h<sup>2</sup> respectively, differing by a factor of ~2, which is insignificant. Contrary to PSMα1 and PSMβ2 the estimated elongation rate constant for PSMβ1, which aggregates at very low monomeric concentrations, was found to be 0.2 µM/h<sup>2</sup> and hence a factor 1000 smaller than for PSMα1 and PSMβ2. In contrast, the elongation rate constant of PSMα3 was found to be 16.6 mM/h<sup>2</sup> exceeding the values of PSMα1 and PSMβ2 ~80- and ~35-fold, respectively. The stronger effect of elongation of PSMα3 in comparison with the other three peptides suggests that interactions with the fibrils of PSMα3 could be important during the assembly reactions in biofilm formation compared with the assembly of free monomers of other peptides into fibrils.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Secondary structure analysis confirms α-helical structure of PSMα3 and β-sheet structure for other PSMs</title><p>The changes in secondary structure of the peptides following aggregation was monitored using benchtop circular dichroism (Jasco), synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The CD spectra (Jasco) of monomers of all PSMs peptides prior to aggregation all show double minima at 208 and 222 nm indicative of α-helical structure consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Da et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Towle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Additionally, based on peak intensity at 190 and 210 nm, higher degree of α-helical secondary structure is observed for PSMα1 and PSMα3 in comparison to PSMα4 and PSMβ peptides also consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laabei et al., 2014</xref>). This observed increase in α-helicity in PSMα1 and PSMα3 peptides compared to PSMα4 could be due to the presence of helix stabilizing alanine residue at fifth position in PSMα1 and PSMα3 in comparison to the presence of the helix destabilizing glycine in PSMα4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laabei et al., 2014</xref>). Upon aggregation the SRCD spectrum of the peptides changes displaying a single minimum at approximately 218 nm (typical β-sheet signal) for PSMα1 and PSMα4, and at 220 nm for PSMβ1 and PSMβ2 indicative of β-sheet rich structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The peak positions for PSMα1 and PSMα4 are in good agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marinelli et al., 2016</xref>); however, we also find amyloid-like structures in the β-group of PSMs. Despite the lack of sigmoidal aggregation curves, for PSMα4 changes in the SRCD spectrum upon incubation was observed. This indicates a transition from α-helical structure to a structure with increased β-sheet content upon aggregation and is consistent with the data previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dueholm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Romero et al., 2010</xref>). The SRCD spectrum of aggregated PSMα3 is still displaying a double minimum with minima shifted to 208 nm and 228 nm indicative of α-helical structure being present in the aggregates although this helical structure is different from that observed in the monomeric peptide. This observation is consistent with the reported cross-α-helical structure of PSMα3 aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tayeb-Fligelman et al., 2017</xref>). To further probe the contribution of the individual structural components to the SRCD spectra each spectrum was deconvoluted using the analysis programs Selecon3, Contin, and CDSSTR in the DichroWeb server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Whitmore and Wallace, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Whitmore and Wallace, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed the major structural contribution to the SRCD spectrum for PSMα3 aggregates is α-helical (~70%). For PSMα1 and PSMα4 the major structural components are β-sheet (33% and 35% respectively) and unordered structure (39% and 34% respectively). Despite the single minima indicative of predominantly β-sheet structure observed for PSMβ1 and PSMβ2 the major structural components are α-helix (35% and 40% respectively) and unordered structure (33% and 35% respectively) with less contribution from β-sheet structure (24% and16 % respectively). Monomeric δ-toxin exhibited high degree of α-helicity structure based on CD peak intensity at 190 and 208 nm consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laabei et al., 2014</xref>). However, no significant structural changes were observed for PSMα2 and δ-toxin, which upon incubation at tested conditions still displayed spectra characteristic of α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is also consistent with the previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marinelli et al., 2016</xref>). However, we observe only one minimum at around 208 nm of δ-toxin in comparison to monomeric δ-toxin, which possess two minima at around 208 and 224 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

Cross-seeding experiments using 20% preformed fibril seeds of PSMα3, PSMβ1, and PSMβ2 and monomers PSMα1 were performed. It can be seen that compared to the non-seeded aggregation seeds of all the other aggregating PSM peptides PSMα3 and PSMβ1–2 accelerated the aggregation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Although the resulting ThT fluorescence intensity is lower than the unseeded aggregates the lag-phase is no longer present when seeds of the other PSM peptides are present. Unlike PSMα1 and PSMβ1 the fast aggregating PSMα3 is cross-seeded by PSMα1 and PSMβ2 but not PSMβ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This indicates that the cross-seeding capability of the PSM peptide aggregates is selective rather than universal among the PSM peptides. Similar to PSMα3 the aggregation of PSMβ2 is accelerated by only PSMα1 and PSMβ1 whereas PSMα3 seeded interestingly enhanced the lag phase of PSMβ2 dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Due to the presence of 20% preformed fibril seeds the initial ThT fluorescence signal is higher for the seeded experiments compared to the unseeded experiments for all the different PSM peptides.

Furthermore, there is no correlation between the presence or absence of secondary nucleation in the dominating aggregation mechanism for the individual peptides and the cross-seeding capacity. PSMβ2 that aggregate through a nucleation-elongation dominated aggregation mechanism can be seeded with some (PSMα1 and PSMβ1) but not all of the peptides (PSMα3) which aggregate through a mechanism dominated by secondary nucleation. On a similar note not all the PSM peptides that aggregate through a mechanism dominated by secondary nucleation can cross-seed each other as PSMβ2 is not cross-seeded by PSMα3. We therefore suggest a model describing the delicate interplay between individual PSM peptides in the formation of biofilm where the fast aggregating PSMα3 initiates the aggregation by forming unstable fibrils. These fibrils can then accelerate the aggregation of PSMα1 that forms stable fibrils capable of accelerating the aggregation of the majority of the remaining PSM peptides (PSMα2, PSMα3, PSMβ1, PSMβ2, and δ-toxin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In this way the fast kinetics of PSMα3 may act as a catalyst for the whole system of aggregation of PSMs peptides during biofilm formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PSMs peptides are major determinants and play an important and diverse role in the biofilm matrix in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peschel and Otto, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have shown that PSMs from <italic>S. aureus</italic> form functional amyloids that contribute to biofilm integrity and provide resistance to disruption, which is critical to the virulence of medical device-associated infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marinelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). However, there have been no efforts to date to establish a general picture for the self-assembly of PSMs peptides that brings together all the species in the aggregation cascade. In the present study, we have conducted a combination of detailed kinetic analysis with structural and morphological analysis to gain insights into the molecular and mechanistic steps, to determine how functional amyloid of PSMs, the biofilm determinant of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, forms and grows. This study involves studying separately the different process involved in the aggregation reaction, i.e., initial nucleation steps, growth of fibrils, and their amplification.</p><p>Earlier computational analysis of PSMs sequences (smallest staphylococcus toxins) already suggested that the peptides of individual families might display differential self-assembly properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marinelli et al., 2016</xref>). We first determined the rates of the various microscopic steps (concentration dependent) associated with the aggregation of PSMs peptides. Our results have shown that under quiescent conditions, a dominant contribution to the formation of new aggregates is a fibril catalyzed secondary nucleation pathway that is shared by different variant of the α-PSMs family, which sustain the integrity of biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>), along with the β-PSM family (PSMβ1). In contrast to this, nucleation and elongation are the only processes contributing to the aggregation of PSMβ2, since the influence of secondary process that gives rise to self-replication of aggregates is negligible for this peptide. It is remarkable that even though PSMα1 and PSMα3 possess seven identical and additional 10 similar amino acids in their sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleem et al., 2017</xref>), they show distinct aggregation behavior as PSMα3 aggregates approximately 50 times faster than PSMα1, which specifies that the existence of distinct residue in PSMα3 might play a significant role in lowering the energy barrier for the steps in the conversion process of monomers to fibrils as observed for Aβ peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meisl et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore the fibrils formed by PSMα3 was found to be initially unstable as also observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tayeb-Fligelman et al., 2017</xref>) but upon further incubation the fibrils associate laterally to form more mature stable fibrils while fibrils of PSMα1 was stable without the need for lateral association.</p><p>In the current study at quiescent conditions no aggregation kinetics were observed for PSMα4 despite observing β-sheet structure using CD and FTIR and monitoring very thin fibrils with TEM. Previous reports on the aggregation of PSMα4 involved incubation of up to 28 days or incubation under shaking conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marinelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>). As shaking conditions during aggregation is known to increase fragmentation due to shear forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>) shaking conditions were excluded in the present study. Compared to the other PSM peptides PSMα4 is the one with both the lowest solubility score and the lowest calculated aggregation propensity when computing these using the CamSol algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sormanni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sormanni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). This could possibly explain the need for long incubation time and shaking conditions during aggregation.</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>Solubility score of phenol-soluble modulin peptides.</title><p>Solubility score of different peptides calculated using the Camsol web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-mvsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.php/login">http://www-mvsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.php/login</ext-link>).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Peptide Name</th><th>Solubility Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>PSMα1</td><td>0.826149</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>PSMα2</td><td>0.883944</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>PSMα3</td><td>1.282062</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>PSMα4</td><td>0.022660</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>PSMβ1</td><td>1.038055</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>PSMβ2</td><td>0.907007</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>δ-toxin</td><td>1.242128</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Functional amyloids from gram-negative bacteria are mainly composed of a single protein such as CsgA in <italic>E. coli</italic> curli and FapC in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dueholm et al., 2010</xref>). Along with the proteins incorporated into the functional amyloids a whole range of auxiliary proteins is expressed simultaneously. In the gram-positive bacteria <italic>S. aureus</italic> the functional amyloids in biofilms is made up of the different PSM peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). The model suggested here accounts for the role of individual PSM peptides during formation of functional amyloids to stabilize the biofilm, hence allowing the bacteria an efficient way to form functional amyloids in a very short amount of time but at the cost of stability. The stability is later gained by the aggregation of other PSM. The most proinflammatory and cytotoxic PSMα3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) boosts the reaction of PSMα1 kinetics followed by enhancement of aggregation kinetics of rest of the PSMs peptides, which likely play a key role in stabilizing the biofilm matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>) and influences the biofilm development and structuring activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Periasamy et al., 2012</xref>). The highly stable amyloidal structures thus serve as the building blocks cementing the biofilm and creating the rigidity that can explain the resistance of amyloid-containing biofilms. Overall, we note that the rates of individual kinetic steps in the process can differ by several orders of magnitude between different variants, whereas in previous reports a vast structural diversity of amyloid-like structures have also been reported for PSM peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>). Further, in vitro studies also confirmed that contrary to what previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>), not all PSMs form amyloid structures even at higher concentrations under the conditions tested here. Moreover, cross-seeding results show that given the right conditions, all tested PSMs can aggregate into ThT-binding species.</p><p>We conclude that the outcomes presented in this article may have significant implications for understanding the aggregation process of PSMs peptides during biofilm formation. These findings indicate a molecular interplay between individual PSM peptides during accumulation of PSMs amyloid fibrils in biofilms. This also suggests an important approach for suppressing the biofilm growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> as PSMs have critical role during infection and represent a promising target for anti-staphylococcal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>). Recently potential inhibitors of Aβ aggregation in Alzheimer’s and α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease have been found to inhibit self-replication by secondary nucleation being the most promising candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm forming amyloids this could also be a potential strategy as several of the PSM peptides aggregated through a secondary nucleation dominated mechanism. This could be possible by using inhibitors of amyloid formation as numerous studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of aggregation also tend to inhibit biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arita-Morioka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arita-Morioka et al., 2015</xref>). In the context of the development of biofilm formation, the key processes and mechanisms revealed in this study are likely to contribute to the difficulty in controlling and to understanding the role of amyloid growth as a potentially limiting factor of biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">PSMα1</td><td valign="top">GenScript Biotech, TheNetherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Formylation <break/>(N-terminal)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">PSMα2</td><td valign="top">GenScript Biotech, TheNetherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Formylation (N-terminal)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">PSMα3</td><td valign="top">GenScript Biotech, TheNetherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Formylation (N-terminal)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">PSMα4</td><td valign="top">GenScript Biotech, TheNetherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Formylation (N-terminal)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">PSMβ1</td><td valign="top">GenScript Biotech, TheNetherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Formylation (N-terminal)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">PSMβ1</td><td valign="top">GenScript Biotech, TheNetherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Formylation (N-terminal)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">δ-toxin</td><td valign="top">GenScript Biotech, TheNetherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Formylation (N-terminal)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">2,2,2-Trifluoro-acetic acid</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Sigma T6508</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Thioflavin T</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Sigma T3516</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Aldrich-105228</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DMSO</td><td valign="top">Merck</td><td valign="top">CAS# 67-68-5</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Amylofit</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amylofit.ch">https://www.amylofit.ch</ext-link>. <break/>cam.ac.uk/</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Dichroweb</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/html/home.shtml">http://dichroweb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/html/home.shtml</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_018125">SCR_018125</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">CamSol</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-vendruscolo.ch.cam.ac.uk/.uk/camsolmethod">http://www-vendruscolo.ch.cam.ac.uk/.uk/camsolmethod</ext-link>.</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">OPUS 5.5</td><td valign="top">Bruker</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">96-well plate, half area, polystyrene, non-binding surface</td><td valign="top">Corning</td><td valign="top">Product number 3881</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peptides and reagents</title><p>N-terminally formylated PSM peptides (&gt;95% purity) were purchased from GenScript Biotech, The Netherlands.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Meytal Landau (Reviewer #2); Matthew Chapman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but additional experiments are required before it can be published. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can see from the reviewers' comments, a better representation of the results and clear conclusion statements of what is new (identify the major take home message) should be implemented in the revised manuscript. The present data informs on the PSM mutual effects in vitro, but whether this sheds light on the actual interplay is not definitive. In addition, the technical points raised by the reviewers should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Zaman et al., specifically address the basic aggregation mechanism of individual phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), the structural scaffold of the pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms. The aggregation kinetics of individual PSMs (PSMα1-4, PSMβ1-2 and δ-toxin) was determined using the Thioflavin T (ThT) assay. By fitting the aggregation kinetics into pre-defined equations, the authors deduce the aggregation mechanism of the individual PSMs. They find that PSMα1, PSMα3 and PSMβ1 aggregate via secondary nucleation (mechanism for disease related amyloid fibrils – nucleus formation catalysed by existing aggregates), while PSMβ2 aggregates via primary nucleation-elongation (mechanism linked to functional amyloids). They further analysed and compared the elongation rates in the presence of high concentrations of preformed fibril seeds (20-50%), and found that PSMα3 fibrils had the strongest effect on elongation, suggesting that interaction of PSMα3 fibrils contributes to the assembly process during biofilm formation. Secondary structural analysis by SRCD and FTIR revealed that PSMα3 aggregates have a significantly higher content of α-helical structure and are thermally unstable compared to other PSM peptide fibrils. TEM analysis of the aggregates supported the kinetics and secondary structural analysis of the individual PSMs. Finally, the authors performed cross-seeding experiments using 20% preformed fibrils to investigate the interplay between the PSMs. They show that fibrillation of the different PSMs is coordinated, enabling the rapid formation of an initially unstable amyloid structure into a very stable biofilm structure. The interplay between PSMs in biofilm formation offers new insights into the higher-order peptide-peptide interactions and may be useful for drug design towards treatment strategies of infections with biofilm-forming pathogens.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The idea of cross-talk between individual PSMs, the main message of the story, in the context of biofilm formation is attractive. However, the conclusion that PSMα1 seeds accelerate the aggregation of all other PSM peptides, based on data shown in Figure 4A, is overstated.

Since the stability of PSMα3 is specifically discussed, monitoring the spectra at 222mm is more relevant. Also, I am not sure if I understand the interpretation here. PSMα3 is stable as a helix in the monomeric and fibril forms, thus how does monitoring the secondary structure changes reflects fibril stability? If the fibrils disassemble into monomers, then it is still helical. The same goes for the Urea experiment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).

The aggregation kinetics of individual PSMs (PSMα1-4, PSMβ1-2 and δ-toxin) was determined using the Thioflavin T (ThT) assay. By fitting the aggregation kinetics into pre-defined equations, the authors deduce the aggregation mechanism of the individual PSMs. They find that PSMα1, PSMα3 and PSMβ1 aggregate via secondary nucleation (mechanism for disease related amyloid fibrils – nucleus formation catalysed by existing aggregates), while PSMβ2 aggregates via primary nucleation-elongation (mechanism linked to functional amyloids). They further analysed and compared the elongation rates in the presence of high concentrations of preformed fibril seeds (20-50%), and found that PSMα3 fibrils had the strongest effect on elongation, suggesting that interaction of PSMα3 fibrils contributes to the assembly process during biofilm formation. Secondary structural analysis by SRCD and FTIR revealed that PSMα3 aggregates have a significantly higher content of α-helical structure and are thermally unstable compared to other PSM peptide fibrils. TEM analysis of the aggregates supported the kinetics and secondary structural analysis of the individual PSMs. Finally, the authors performed cross-seeding experiments using 20% preformed fibrils to investigate the interplay between the PSMs. They show that fibrillation of the different PSMs is coordinated, enabling the rapid formation of an initially unstable amyloid structure into a very stable biofilm structure. The interplay between PSMs in biofilm formation offers new insights into the higher-order peptide-peptide interactions and may be useful for drug design towards treatment strategies of infections with biofilm-forming pathogens.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The idea of cross-talk between individual PSMs, the main message of the story, in the context of biofilm formation is attractive. However, the conclusion that PSMα1 seeds accelerate the aggregation of all other PSM peptides, based on data shown in Figure 4A, is overstated. The amount of ThT binding is really low and the extent of aggregation with PSMα1 seeds appears not more prominent than the aggregation of the individual PSMs (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the presentation of our results in Figure 4 to better show the acceleration of aggregation in the presence of seeds compared to the non-seeded data. The ThT signal in the plate reader assay is highly dependent on the gain setting in the plater reader. Hence a low gain setting will result in a low signal which is not equivalent to low amount of aggregation. Another factor to consider is the fact that some aggregates show low ThT signal despite the presence of high amounts of aggregates due to other factors such as lateral association which can render ThT binding sites unavailable due to steric hindrance. Hence, we are confident that despite low ThT signal for some of the aggregates our results are not overstated but do indeed reflect the molecular interactions between individual PSM peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statement &quot;Pre-formed seeds of PSMβ2 were able to accelerate the aggregation of PSMα1 and PSMβ1 while also inducing aggregation of PSMα2 and δ-toxin, Figure 4D&quot;, is not convincing based on the present figure display.

For further clarification, we have modified our figure display so that the figure now displays the individual PSM peptide monomers in the absence and presence of preformed fibril seeds rather than focusing on the seed type.

To determine whether or not fragmentation or secondary nucleation is active, we performed this experiment within a low regime of preformed seeds (nM range) to find generation of new aggregates. This strategy is used to distinguish fragmentation or secondary nucleation from potentially very complex and poorly understood primary nucleation processes (Cohen et al., 2012). It also confers which mechanism is dominated as preformed seeds accelerate the reaction such as it reaches completion before the equivalent reaction without preformed seeds. The seeding effect is more clearly visible in PSMα1 in comparison to other two peptides. However, if we do the comparison through raw data we have found that almost 50% reduction in lag phase was observed in presence of low regime of the preformed seeds in PSMβ1. In the absence of preformed seeds, aggregates are only generated at a slow rate during the first 8 hours (Figure 1C) of the time course of the reaction, as indicated by the constant (approximately zero) slope of the rate profile by primary or secondary nucleation. When preformed seeds are added at the beginning of the reaction, the kinetic profile reaches saturation before the corresponding reaction without preformed seeds. The rapid increase in the slope after 3 hours (Figure 1F) indicates rapid creation of new aggregates. It means that there will be more number of growing ends in presence of low amount of seeds, which accelerates the reaction of PSMβ1. The kinetic data without preformed seeds shows that primary nucleation is not rapidly creating new aggregates at this time, and by definition, the addition of seeds cannot affect primary nucleation, pinpointing the origin of the new aggregates as the effect of secondary pathways (Cohen et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Table 1 and figures – &quot;MRE&quot; needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>As per reviewer’s suggestion, we have explained it in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1—figure supplement 5 – I wonder if controls at the same PSM concentration with no seeds should be added to the extrapolation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

PSMα3 is stable as a helix in the monomeric and fibril forms, thus how does monitoring the secondary structure changes reflects fibril stability? If the fibrils disassemble into monomers, then it is still helical. The same goes for the Urea experiment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).

In the aggregated form the minima at approx. 222 nm becomes the most predominant minima compared to the minima at 208 nm. This is probably due to a shift in the contacts stabilizing the helical structure from intramolecular one in the monomeric species to intermolecular contacts in the aggregates species. Along with this the minimum shifts to a slightly higher wavelength. We chose to monitor the changes in CD signal at 220 nm since this wavelength would report on changes to both the β-sheet structure seen for the other PSM peptides along with the changes in the α-helical spectra of PSMα3 when changing from the monomeric α-helical to the aggregated α-helical structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The Results section indicates use synchrotron CD, but the methods also indicate regular CD (Jasco instrument).

Zoom-in view into the flat graphs is needed as well (Similar to Figure S7, but for all of them). This is a major results in this paper and needs to be made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have added the non-seeded aggregation data to Figure 4 while also changing the layout of Figure 4 to focus on the individual PSM monomeric type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Concentration of the seeds should be uniformed in the units reported (concentration in nM or %) to better compared graphs in Figure 1 and Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this. We have added the concentration of seeds in nM/µM along with the information of the % of seeds to make it more uniform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The schematic representation in Figure 4E is not intuitive (arrows need to be replaced or explained).</p></disp-quote><p>As per reviewer’s suggestion we have replaced the curved arrow with normal arrows to indicate which way the reaction is proceeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Subsection “PSMα1 display promiscuous cross-seeding while other PSMs display selective cross-seeding abilities”: &quot;Like PSMα3, PSMβ1 is only capable of accelerating the aggregation of PSMα1&quot;. – Both also accelerated PSMβ2 if I understand correctly (hard to appreciate from the graphs, as I indicated).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for allowing us to specify this. As mentioned previously we have changed the way the data in Figure 4 is presented. This makes it easier to apprehend the cross-seeding capacity. As a consequence, we have also made changes to the text where the results are presented. Hence this has been clarified in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Subsection “PSMα1 display promiscuous cross-seeding while other PSMs display selective cross-seeding abilities”: &quot;None of the other PSM peptides were able to induce aggregation of these two PSM peptides which also do not aggregate on their own under conditions&quot; – add except from PSMα1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this typo.

Were the seeds tested by TEM? Dissolving and measuring concentration? Since this is the major result of the paper, I feel that more validations are needed for the properties of the seeds.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to clarify this. All seeded were prepared using the same protocol namely collecting aggregates from a plate reader experiment followed by pelleting the aggregates using centrifugation where the supernatant with any remaining non-aggregate species is removed. The aggregates are then resuspended in the original volume of buffer and sonicated using a probe sonicator. Hence any differences in the seeds are not from the preparation of the seeds but from the aggregates/seeds themselves. This protocol for seed preparation is commonly used to study seeding in protein aggregation and has not previously been observed to alter the aggregates/seeds (Ohhashi et al., 2005 and Pfamatter et al., 2017). We therefore feel confident that the effects seen during cross-seeding experiments are due to the interactions between the PSM peptides and the seeds and are not caused by differences in the seed preparation protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) How does the primary nucleation and elongation mechanism for PSMβ2 reconciles with the cross-seeding effect by PSMα1, PSMα3 and PSMβ1?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for allowing us to clarify this point. The presence or absence of secondary nucleation dictates which aggregation mechanism the dominating one during the aggregation of the peptide when starting from a homogeneous monomeric population of the peptides. Hence it only gives information on whether the surface of the aggregates formed are capable of acting as a catalyst for the production of new aggregation nuclei from monomers of the same peptide. We see no apparent connection between the dominant aggregation mechanism and the cross-seeding. Not all peptides that aggregate via a secondary nucleated dominated mechanism can cross-seed each other (PSMβ1 does not accelerate the aggregation of PSMα3). The peptides that aggregate via a secondary nucleated dominated mechanism can be cross-seeded by PSMβ2 which on its own aggregates in a primary nucleation and elongation dominated mechanism (PSMα1 aggregation is seed by PSMβ2). Furthermore, PSMβ2 cannot be cross-seeded by all the peptides that aggregate via a secondary nucleated dominated mechanism (PSMα3 does not accelerate the aggregation of PSMβ2). The same goes for the induction of aggregation in the PSMs that do not aggregate on their own (PSMβ2 does not induce aggregation in PSMα2 and PSMα4 but does induce aggregation in δ-toxin.</p><p>We have added a few lines in the revised paper to point this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) In the Discussion section, PSMa3 is suggested to &quot;..sustain the integrity of biofilms&quot;. But it is yet unclear if this peptide is actually a part of the biofilm (it was not found in a MS analysis). It is also not clear if it is present in the same vicinity as the other PSMs after secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree we agree with the reviewer that until now it is not clear that this peptide is actually a part of biofilm and is present in the same vicinity as the other PSMs after secretion. However, earlier studies demonstrated that <italic>S. aureus</italic> produces amyloid-like fibers that contribute to biofilm integrity (Schwartz et al., 2012; Marinelli et al., 2016). Further, they do not observe PSMα3 aggregates during LC-MS/MS analysis after formic acid treatment. We make a general hypothesis that those PSMs that form fibers may provide structural integrity to biofilms. However, at the same time some in vivo studies should be performed to make a solid conclusion for PSMα3 role in biofilm integrity. To address this, we have corrected it in our revised manuscript and made a more general statement by avoiding the name of specific PSMs, which play a significant role in biofilm structural integrity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Since ThT/TEM/CD/FTIR measurements were already performed for most PSMs (citations and comparisons are missing here), a clear statement of what is especially novel here is required. Overall, a more focused and specific interpretation of the results is needed, while conclusions about the in-vivo setting should be tuned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that various studies have performed for most of the PSMs using biophysical techniques. We have incorporated more literature references in in our manuscript to relate our results to those already published. However, there have been no efforts to date to establish a general picture for the self-assembly mechanism of the individual PSMs peptides nor has the interactions between PSM during aggregation been established. We have put further emphasis on the novel results obtained here while making a more general hypothesis on how they aggregate and communicate with each other hence tuning down the conclusions on the in vivo settings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors describe in vitro aggregation studies of the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) from S. aureus. The aggregation kinetics and molecular mechanisms of PSM amyloid formation are detailed. Importantly, the manuscript also describes work on co-aggregation or cooperation between the different PSMs. The authors take the observations on how individual PSMs aggregate and speculate on how the PSMs collectively contribute during the biofilm formation process. I have some comments and suggestions that could be addressed that might strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1G - PSMβ2 seems to be following the nucleation-elongation model at the concentrations tested. It would be interesting to see if this model is still followed at lower concentrations like the concentrations used of PSMβ1 (Figure 1C). Also, it would be helpful to have the units added to each of the panels in Figure 1. That might also involve altering the panels a bit so that it is clear on visual inspection which curves are seeded reactions and which are unseeded.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for allowing us to elaborate on this point. We did test lower concentrations of PSMβ2 in the same range as those tested for PSMβ1. However, at concentrations below 50 µg/mL of PSMβ2 the ThT fluorescence signal become low to the point where the data becomes non-reproducible and below 30 µg/mL we see no ThT signal above the background signal. We therefore strongly believe that the aggregation models described in the paper represents the actual aggregation mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1H - Self-seeding of PSMβ2 at the low concentrations of seed almost seems to flatten the slope of the curve (or slightly increase the lag phase). According to the nucleation-elongation model, no kinetic changes should occur in presence of low amounts of seeds. Is this reproducible?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the slope of the curve for PSM β2 in the presence of law amounts of seeds is flattened slightly compare to the non-seeded aggregation curve. However, this is due to the fact that the two experiments are conducted with peptide from two different productions batches. We have consistently observed batch to batch variations in the aggregation behavior especially with the longer peptides PSMβ1 and PSMβ2. This is something which is often seen when working with synthetically produced peptides. The aggregation kinetics are reproducible within each batch and the aggregation data from different bathes can be described by the same aggregation mechanism which is why we feel confident in our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1—figure supplement 4 - The figure legend mentions &quot;three&quot; straight line plots. I think it should be four.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this typo.

According to heat denaturation of PSMα3 fibers (Figure 2E), 7-day old fibers are more resistant to denaturation as compared fibers that are only 1 hour old.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the 1 hour PSMα3 fibril samples for the chemical denaturation analysis. As per reviewer’s request we have added this information in the methods section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4 – It would be helpful to show individual graphs of the cross-seeding reaction be shown i.e. seeded vs unseeded? This way it might be easier to compare the effect of various seeds on the aggregation kinetics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have modified the representation of the data in Figure 4 from focusing on seed type to focusing on the individual PSM peptide monomers. We have also included the non-seeded aggregation data to better compare the effects of the individual seeds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4 – At 0.25mg/ml concentration the lag time for PSMβ1 becomes independent of the monomer concentration (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). However, in Figure 4, the concentration of PSMβ1 used is 0.25mg/ml, how was this done?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for typological error. We have used 0.025 mg/ml (PSMβ1) for cross-seeding experiments and this has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4E – The biofilm formation model suggests that PSMα3 form unstable fibrils which are the accelerated by stable PSMα1 fibrils. PSMα1 fibrils are also suggested to be accelerating the fibril formation by other PSMs. However, the data supporting this model comes from Figure 4A-D where sonicated fibers were added as seeds. Do the authors think that unsonicated fibers will also cross-seed? Can the authors teste this as in nature sonication is not possible?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we are looking at conditions which do not occur in vivo by adding sonication to the aggregated species. However, in order to investigate the elongation or the cross-seeding capacity of the peptides we find that this is a necessary technique to use. It has been shown that the sonication of fibrillates proteins do not alter the structure of the fibrils but only acts to break the fibrils into shorter pieces (Ohhashi et al., 2005 and Stathopulos et al., 2008). This in turn produces more growing ends from which the fibrils can elongate. We therefore strongly believe that even unsonicated fibrils are capable of acting as seeds also in a cross-seeding setting between different PSM peptides however this seeding will happen only at the growing ends and with less growing ends the seeding will happen in a slower manner than in our experiments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Regarding the significance of self-seeding – authors please insert a statement in the manuscript text like: &quot;The seeding effect is more clearly visible in PSMα1 in comparison to other two peptides. However, if we do the comparison through raw data we have found that almost 50% reduction in lag phase was observed in presence of low regime of the preformed seeds in PSMβ1.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have inserted a statement similar to that suggested by the editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should discuss in the text why many of the curves in Figure 4 do not start at 0. Is the initial ThT fluorescence due to ThT binding to the seeds or due to rapid reaction kinetics?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following to subsection “PSMα1 display promiscuous cross-seeding while other PSMs display selective cross-seeding abilities” to address this concern: “Due to the presence of 20% preformed fibril seeds the initial ThT fluorescence signal is higher for the seeded experiments compared to the unseeded experiments for all the different PSM peptides. This effect is due to binding of ThT to the preformed fibril seeds at the beginning of experiment.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
