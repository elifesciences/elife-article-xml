On the one hand, numerous studies implicated this area in decisions driven by effort or action cost. On the other hand, work on economic choices between goods (under fixed action costs) found that neurons in ACCd encoded only post-decision variables. To advance our understanding of the role played by this area in decision making, we trained monkeys to choose between different goods (juice types) offered in variable amounts and with different action costs. Importantly, the task design dissociated computation of the action cost from planning of any particular action. Neurons in ACCd encoded the chosen value and the binary choice outcome in several reference frames (chosen juice, chosen cost, chosen action). Thus, this area provided a rich representation of post-decision variables. In contrast to the OFC, neurons in ACCd did not represent pre-decision variables such as individual offer values in any reference frame. Hence, ongoing decisions are unlikely guided by ACCd. Conversely, neuronal activity in this area might inform subsequent actions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dorsal anterior cingulate cortex</kwd><kwd>economic choice</kwd><kwd>subjective value</kwd><kwd>effort</kwd><kwd>reference frame</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DA032758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padoa-Schioppa</surname><given-names>Camillo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grants 31571102 and 91632106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Xinying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Base B16018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Xinying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NYU-ECNU Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science at NYU Shanghai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint Research Institute Seed Grants for Research Collaboration</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Xinying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grants 15JC1400104 and 16JC1400101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Xinying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018SHZDZX05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Xinying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In economic choices under variable action costs, in contrast to the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex represents not pre-decision but post-decision variables, thus might inform subsequent actions based on reward and effort associated with the choice outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Economic choices involve the computation and comparison of subjective values, which integrate multiple attributes relevant to the decision. In particular, obtaining rewards often entails different levels of physical effort. We previously showed that economic choices under variable action costs can take place in a non-spatial representation (goods space) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). In the experiments, monkeys chose between two juices offered in variable amounts and associated with different action costs. The task design dissociated the computation of action costs from action planning. A group of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encoded offer values integrating juice type, juice amount, and action cost. Moreover, another group of cells in OFC encoded the choice outcome before presentation of the action targets, indicating that decisions were made in goods space. However, it remained unclear whether and how other brain regions contribute to this choice process. When goods available for choice bear different action costs, the decision necessarily reflects aspects of the action. Thus, signals from the ACCd and/or other motor regions could provide an input for the computation of subjective values in OFC.</p><p>There are several reasons to believe that ACCd might be important for choices under variable action cost. First, both anatomic and functional evidence indicates that ACCd plays a role in linking actions and rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bush et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calderazzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hadland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayden and Platt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Paus, 2001</xref>). Second, ACCd has been implicated in various types of decision making, including strategic decision making, social decision making, and cost-benefit tradeoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klein-FlÃ¼gge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rangel and Hare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rushworth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wallis and Kennerley, 2010</xref>). More importantly, previous studies found that neuronal activity in this region integrates expected reward and action cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kennerley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kennerley and Wallis, 2009</xref>) and reflects effort-discounted subjective values in an action-based reference frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>). In rodent studies, lesion of the medial frontal cortex (MFC, roughly homologous to the primate ACCd) disrupts reward and effort tradeoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rudebeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Walton et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study showed that chemogenetic modulation of the rodent ACCd altered the animalâs effort-exerting behavior in conditions that require a choice, but not when choices were not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hart et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, we examined the neuronal representations in ACCd in an economic choice task with equal action cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>). We discovered that ACCd only encodes post-decision variables, namely, <italic>chosen value</italic>, <italic>chosen juice,</italic> and <italic>movement direction</italic>. However, based on its engagement in effort-based decisions, ACCd may contribute to the computation of <italic>offer values</italic> when decisions require the integration of action costs. To test this possibility, in the current study, we introduced action cost as an additional value attribute. The action cost was operationalized by requiring the animal to make saccades of different amplitudes. Critically, the action cost was indicated to the animal before and independent of the instruction associated with any particular action. We report the following results. First, action costs taxing the oculomotor system induced appreciable behavioral effects as the animals âchoicesâ were biased in favor of low-cost offers. Second, contrary to reasonable predictions, neurons in ACCd did not encode <italic>offer values</italic> in any reference frame. Conversely, neurons in ACCd encoded different variables associated with the choice outcome. Third, in contrast to OFC, where neurons encoded choice outcome in juice-based and cost-based reference frames with approximately equal strength, the encoding of choice outcomes in ACCd was heavily skewed in favor of a cost-based reference frame. Taken together, these results extend previous observations on good-based choices and support the hypothesis that ACCd plays a role in guiding motor systems based on reward and effort associated with the choice outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design and choice patterns</title><p>We designed a task in which animals chose between two juices offered in variable amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We dissociated the spatial location of the offers from the saccades necessary to obtain them and we introduced a delay between the presentation of the offers and the saccade targets. Moreover, offers were associated with radial eye movements in different directions, and different saccade amplitudes imposed variable action costs. We reasoned that if the initial fixation point is straight ahead of the subject, the action cost associated with an eye movement is essentially independent of the saccade direction (isotropic) and only depends on the saccade amplitude. Each offer provided information about all the attributes of value â juice type indicated by symbol color, quantity indicated by symbol number, and action cost indicated by symbol shape, while the animal was unable to plan the saccade necessary to obtain the offer. For any given trial, one âofferâ was defined by a juice type, its quantity, and its action cost. An âoffer typeâ was defined by two offers (e.g., [1A+:3Bâ]), in which âââ indicates high action cost (long saccade) and â+â indicates low action cost (short saccade). A âtrial typeâ was defined by two offers and a choice (e.g., [1A+:3Bâ, A]). Thus, a âtrial typeâ encompasses task-related factors in goods space.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and behavioral analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) At the beginning of the trial, the monkey fixated a center point on the monitor. After 1.5 s, two offers appeared to the left and right of the fixation point. The offers were represented by sets of color symbols, with the color indicating the juice type, the number of symbols indicating juice amount and the shape of the symbols indicating the action cost associated with the offer (crosses, low cost; diamonds high cost). The offers remained on the monitor for 1 s, then they disappeared. The monkey continued fixating the center point for another 1 s. At the end of this delay, two saccade targets (two color dots) appeared. The two saccade targets were located on two (invisible) concentric rings centered on the fixation point. The animal maintained fixation for a randomly variable delay (0.6â1.2 s) before the center fixation point was extinguished (âgoâ signal), at which point the monkey indicated its choice with a saccade.

Trials were divided into two groups depending on whether juice A was offered at low cost or at high cost. The gray sigmoid is displaced to the right, indicating that the relative value of juice A was higher when juice A was offered at low cost. This effect was consistent across sessions for both monkeys. Our data set included 141 behavioral sessions from both animals. For a quantitative analysis of choice patterns, we constructed a logistic model that provided measures for the relative value of the two juices (Ï), the difference in action cost (Î¾), the choice hysteresis related to the chosen juice (Î·) and to the chosen cost (Ï), and the spatial biases related to the offer position (Î´) and to the target position (Îµ) (see Materials and methods, Equation 1). We first examined the distribution of Î¾ across sessions. The difference in saccade amplitude had a significant effect on choices in both animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, monkey B, median(Î¾) = 0.27, p &lt; 10<sup>â9</sup>; monkey L, median(Î¾) = 0.18, p &lt; 10<sup>â11</sup>; Wilcoxon signed-rank test).</p><p>In addition to action cost, we also examined other factors that may influence the animalâs choice. These factors include the monkeyâs tendency to choose on any given trial the same juice chosen and received in the previous trial (choice hysteresis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>). This effect was quantified by the normalized coefficient Î· (Equation 1, median(Î·) = 0.16, p &lt; 10<sup>â19</sup>; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We also tested whether the animalâs choices were affected by the cost associated with the offer chosen in previous trial (cost hysteresis). This effect, quantified by the normalized coefficient Ï (Equation 1), was not significant across sessions (median(Ï) = â0.008, p = 0.58; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The normalized coefficient Î´ quantified offer-based spatial biases. Across sessions, this effect was statistically significant but rather small (median(Î´) = â0.03, p = 0.04; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Finally, the normalized coefficient Îµ quantified target-based spatial biases. Similar to offer-based spatial biases, this effect was statistically significant but very small in amplitude (median(Î´) = 0.017, p = 0.027; Wilcoxon signed-rank test).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Encoding of choice outcome in multiple reference frames</title><p>We recorded and analyzed the activity of 688 neurons from the ACCd of two monkeys (B, 318 cells; L, 370 cells). Firing rates were analyzed in nine time windows aligned with different behavioral events (see Materials and methods). A âneuronal responseâ was defined as the activity of one neuron in one time window as a function of the trial type. Inspection of individual responses (see Materials and methods) indicated that many neurons in ACCd were modulated by the trial type and encoded variables related to the choice outcome. More specifically, ACCd neurons appeared to encode decision variables in the frames of reference defined by the juice type and/or the action cost. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates a few examples.

In contrast, we did not find any offer value signal in any of these reference frames. Moreover, few neurons in ACCd encode variables <italic>value ratio</italic> and <italic>cost/benefit conflict</italic>, which essentially capture the decision difficulty. Overall, this result demonstrates a prevailing coding of post-decision variables in ACCd.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dimensional integration in chosen value cells</title><p>Previous studies showed that the activity of <italic>chosen value</italic> cells in the OFC depended on the juice type, juice quantity, and action costs. Here, we assessed whether <italic>chosen value</italic> cells in the ACCd also reflected the action cost. To do so, we defined two variants of the variable <italic>chosen value</italic> (juice) â one cost-affected and one cost-independent. We assessed which variant better fit neuronal responses. For each response, we considered the two R<sup>2</sup> and we computed the difference ÎR<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>2</sup> <sub>cost-affected</sub>âR<sup>2</sup><sub>cost-independent</sub> and we examined the distribution for ÎR<sup>2</sup> across the population. We did not want to bias the results in favor of either variant. Thus, for this analysis we identified neuronal responses encoding the <italic>chosen value</italic> (juice) as follows. For each response, we considered the two R<sup>2</sup> obtained from the two variants of <italic>chosen value</italic> variable both âexplainingâ the response (p &lt; 0.05), and we assigned the maximum R<sup>2</sup> to the response. We then assigned each response to one of the selected variables accordingly. As any neuron could be tuned in multiple time windows, we aggregated the <italic>chosen value (juice</italic>) coding responses in the time windows after offer presentation but before target presentation (including post-offer, late-delay, mem-delay, and pre-target windows) and those in the time windows after target presentation (including post-target, pre-go, pre-juice, and post-juice windows) and analyzed them separately.</p><p>We discovered that in the post-offer time windows, the distribution of ÎR<sup>2</sup> was significantly biased toward negative values (mean(ÎR<sup>2</sup>) = â0.013, p &lt; 10<sup>â8</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, <italic>chosen value</italic> responses integrate only juice type and quantity in the early time windows before action planning is possible. In the post-target time windows, the distribution of ÎR<sup>2</sup> was not statistically different from 0 (mean(ÎR<sup>2</sup>) = â0.0034, p = 0.25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that action cost was integrated by <italic>chosen value</italic> responses later in the trial. Moreover, the difference across early and late time windows was marginally significant (mean (ÎR<sup>2</sup>) = 0.0096, p = 0.052; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

First, we noted that neurons in the OFC and ACCd do not encode the same set of variables. In particular, pre-decision variables such as <italic>offer value (juice</italic>) and <italic>offer value (cost</italic>) are encoded in the OFC but not the ACCd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). On the other hand, choice outcome in spatial (<italic>chosen offer location</italic>) and action-based (<italic>chosen target location</italic>) reference frames were represented in ACCd but not in OFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

However, within each brain region, encoding of the binary choice outcome signal differs. In OFC, it was skewed toward the juice-based reference frame (variable <italic>chosen juice</italic>); in ACCd, it was heavily skewed toward the cost-based reference frame (variable <italic>chosen cost</italic>).</p><p>In summary, our analyses revealed that in the cost-involved decision making, ACCd is primarily engaged in encoding the value and cost associated with the chosen option.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our experiments, monkeys performed economic choices between goods defined by three attributes â juice type (flavor), quantity, and action cost. Importantly, all three attributes were communicated to the animal early in the trial during offer presentation, well before the location of the eventual saccade targets were indicated. Hence animals could make their decision independently of action planning. Choices were influenced by all three attributes. In a previous study using the same choice task, the analysis of neuronal responses in central OFC (area 13 m) provided evidence that decisions were resolved in goods space. In the current study, we investigated the contribution of ACCd to this decision process. Neuronal coding in ACCd was consistent with good-based decisions. Furthermore, neurons in ACCd did not encode offer values and did not appear to encode any variable that would provide input to the ongoing decision. Conversely, neurons in ACCd encoded variables related to the choice outcome in multiple reference frames, including variables <italic>chosen value</italic>, <italic>chosen offer location only</italic>, <italic>chosen target location only</italic>, <italic>chosen cost,</italic> and <italic>chosen juice</italic>. Consistent with other reports on the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mashhoori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>), multiplexing of information on chosen cost and chosen target location was observed in time windows after target presentation. Importantly, <italic>chosen offer location only</italic> and <italic>chosen target location only</italic> were not significantly represented in the OFC. Thus, ACCd may function as a hub for broadcasting information associated with the choice outcome given its simultaneous representation of decision output in juice-based, cost-based, spatial-based, and action-based reference frames.</p><p>In our earlier study of anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>), we tested the role of this region in economic choice by recording neuronal activity from both the dorsal and ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus while monkeys performed a choice task involving the tradeoff of juice type and quantity. We observed that neurons in both regions encode only post-decision variables, namely <italic>chosen value</italic> and <italic>chosen juice</italic>, but not pre-decision variables in either juice-based or spatial reference frames. The results indicated that ACCd does not contribute to economic choice in the context of goods consisting of the attribute of juice taste and quantity. However, the outcome does not exclude a possible contribution of ACCd in other choice contexts, especially when choices are affected by action costs. One prevailing hypothesis is that when action costs are integrated into the computing of subjective value for choice, the neural locus of value computation and choice may include ACCd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>). Our present results do not support this proposal. Indeed, activity in ACCd did reflect the aspect of physical effort, but not in such a form that would contribute to the encoding of subjective value.</p><p>Our results provide additional evidence disambiguating the role of ACCd in effort-based decisions. One proposal argues that in effort-based decisions, ACCd integrates multiple attributes and compute the utility of an offer to guide optimal choice. This view has gained support from both single-unit studies in non-human primates and human fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Croxson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kennerley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">PrÃ©vost et al., 2010</xref>). However, a non-human primate study showed that lesion of ACCd did not affect the animalâs choices, which require the integration of reward and effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kennerley et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, rodent electrophysiological studies demonstrated that encoding of effort was immediately preceding the execution of effort rather than at the time of decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hashemnia et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this outcome, rats with ACCd lesions were far more likely than controls to abort a high reward/high effort choice at the point where they encountered the ramp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holec et al., 2014</xref>). These results suggest that the ACCd is needed when deciding to maintain a previously chosen course of action against a high effort. In this view, the ACCd encodes the amount of effort necessary to achieve a particular goal thus provides a signal that allows other systems to prepare for exerting the appropriate amount of effort. In our study, we did not find a systematic representation of the action cost associated with any specific offer. However, there was significant encoding of the chosen action cost in the late phase of the trial, when actions were planned. Moreover, <italic>chosen value</italic> signals were much more sustained in ACCd. Taken together, our findings support the view of ACCd in regulating downstream systems based on the outcome of decisions.</p><p>The fact that we used the same experimental design and the same animals in our OFC and ACCd studies allowed us to compare the contribution of OFC and ACCd to economic choice under variable action costs. We first discovered that the percentage of task-relevant cells was strikingly similar in these two regions. At the same time, these two regions did not encode the same set of task-relevant variables. Most importantly, OFC but not ACCd encoded offer values in cost-based reference frame, integrating all choice-relevant attributes. In our paradigm, goods and values might be represented in the frames of reference defined by the juice type, the action cost, the spatial location of the offer, or the spatial location of the saccade target. Neurons in ACCd did not appear to encode offer values in any of these reference frames. On the other hand, neurons in ACCd encoded the saccadic action of the animal â a signal that was absent in OFC. Furthermore, encoding of the chosen value was more sustained in the ACCd as indicated by significantly higher percentage of neurons encoding this variable in late-delay and mem-delay time windows. Lastly, in ACCd, percentage of neurons encoding the <italic>chosen cost</italic> was substantially higher than that encoding the <italic>chosen juice</italic>. Our discovery that few neurons in ACCd encode <italic>chosen juice</italic> likely reflects the fact that it is the OFC but not the ACCd that receives direct input from the primary taste cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rolls, 2015</xref>). Overall, these findings differentiate the ACCd from the OFC in informing the motor system of the expected reward and cost associated with the outcome of the choice.</p><p>In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>, compared the neuronal coding in ACCd and OFC in a choice task involving cost-benefit tradeoff. Our findings differ in two aspects. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>, reported contralateral action value coding in ACCd while we did not discover significant offer value coding in either spatial- or action-based reference frames in our ACCd recordings. Second, they reported that there was no action-based value representation in the OFC, therefore concluded that OFC does not integrate action cost in economic choice. Two elements may help explain the discrepancies between our findings in ACCd and OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>) and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>. First, we recall that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>, only tested value-related variables such as the benefit, cost, and discounted value in action-based reference frame. Most importantly, they did not test the variable that is related to the saccade direction, which is highly correlated with the spatial value signal. As a consequence, contralateral value signal may not be significant if chosen target location was included in their regression analysis. Indeed, in our analysis, saccade direction (or <italic>chosen target location</italic>) was identified as one of the variables that explained a significant portion of neuronal activity in ACCd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). The second and often overlooked aspect is that value may be encoded in schemes other than the action-based reference frame. In their study, each unique combination of reward quantity and cost was presented by a unique picture. Thus, information on good attributes were conveyed to the animal with an âintegratedâ visual representation. Accordingly, a distinct group of neurons may have been recruited to encode the reward and cost conjunctively represented by a unique fractal, which would result in 16 groups of <italic>offer value</italic> coding neurons.</p><p>To conclude, our findings demonstrate that choice outcome coding dominates the neuronal representations in ACCd during economic choice. When action cost was introduced as an additional value attribute, neurons in ACCd expanded the scope of encoding incorporating choice outcome signals in the cost-based reference frame. However, the detailed neuronal reorganization during this process remains unknown. To uncover this process, future studies should monitor the same population of neurons during such reorganization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Choice task</title><p>All experimental procedures conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Washington University.</p><p>The experimental procedures were as described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). Briefly, two rhesus monkeys (B, male, 9.0 kg; L, female, 6.5 kg) participated in the experiments. Before training, a head-restraining device and an oval recording chamber were implanted on the skull under general anesthesia, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</xref>). During the experiments, animals sat in an electrically insulated enclosure (Crist Instruments) with their head restrained. The eye position was monitored with an infrared video camera (Eyelink; SR Research). The behavioral task was controlled through a custom-written software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.monkeylogic.net/">http://www.monkeylogic.net/</ext-link>) based on Matlab (MathWorks).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the choice task. In each session, an animal chose between two juices offered in variable amounts and at different action cost. The offers were represented by sets of color symbols, with the color indicating the juice type, the number of symbols indicating juice amount, and the shape of the symbols indicating the action cost (cross for low cost; diamond for high cost). The trial started with the animal fixating the center fixation point. After 1.5 s, two offers appeared on the two sides of the fixation point. The offers remained on the monitor for 1 s. The monkey continued fixating for another 1 s, after which two saccade targets appeared. The two saccade targets, represented by two dots with matching color to that of the two offers, were located on two concentric rings centered on the fixation point. The radius for low-cost targets was 3.5â4Â°; the radius for high-cost targets was 10â16Â°. In each trial, one of the saccade targets was placed on the low-cost (small radius) ring while the other saccade target was placed on high-cost (large radius) ring. The two targets were always placed on opposite sides of the center fixation point. The angle defining their position was selected on every trial among four possible values, corresponding to 22.5Â°, 157.5Â°, 202.5Â°, and 337.5Â° from azimuth. Thus, for each juice, there were eight possible saccade target positions (2 distances Ã 4 angles). The monkey maintained center fixation for a randomly variable delay (0.6â1.2 s), at the end of which the fixation point was extinguished (go signal). At that point, the animal was allowed to indicate its choice with a saccade. The animal had to maintain peripheral fixation for an additional 0.75 s, at the end of which the chosen juice was delivered. In each session, the two juice quantities varied pseudo-randomly from trial to trial. The spatial positions of the offers, the action costs, and the angle of the saccade targets varied pseudo-randomly and were counter-balanced across trials. Different pairs of juices were used across sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Neuronal recordings</title><p>Procedures for surgery, neuronal recordings, and spike sorting were similar to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</xref>). In brief, the recording chamber (main axes, 50 mm Ã 30 mm) was centered on stereotaxic coordinates (A30, L0), with the longer axis parallel to the coronal plane. Neuronal recordings were guided by structural MRI obtained for each animal before and after the implant. In monkey B, we recorded from both hemispheres and recording locations ranged A28-A38 in the anterior-posterior direction (with the corpus callosum extending anteriorly to A36). In monkey L, we recorded from the left hemisphere and recording locations ranged A25-A34 in the anterior-posterior direction (with the corpus callosum extending anteriorly to A31). Tungsten electrodes (125 Âµm diameter, FHC) were advanced using custom-built motorized micro-drives, with a 2.5 Âµm resolution. We typically used four electrodes in each session. Electrical signals were amplified and band-passed filtered (high pass: 300 Hz, low pass: 6 kHz; Lynx 8, Neuralynx, Inc). Action potentials were detected on-line and waveforms were saved to disk (25 kHz sampling rate; Power 1401, Spike 2; Cambridge Electronic Design). Spike sorting was conducted off-line (Spike 2; Cambridge Electronic Design) and only cells that appeared well isolated and stable throughout the session were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Analysis of choice patterns</title><p>All analyses were conducted in Matlab (MathWorks). On any given trial, one âofferâ was defined by a juice type, its quantity, and its action cost (e.g., 3Bâ). An âoffer typeâ was defined by two offers (e.g., [1A+:3Bâ]). In this notation, âââ indicates high action cost (long saccade) and â+â indicates low action cost (short saccade). A âtrial typeâ was defined by two offers and a choice (e.g., [1A+:3Bâ, A]). Of note, the position of each saccade target was defined by a distance (two possible values) and an angle (four possible values). For the purpose of all the analyses, we turned the angle into a binary variable corresponding to whether the target associated to juice A or the chosen target was placed in the contralateral or ipsilateral hemifield.</p><p>In the behavioral analysis, we examined several factors that could affect choices, including the juice quantity, the action cost, the outcome of the previous trial (choice hysteresis), a term capturing a visual side bias, and a term capturing a saccade side bias.

In this formulation, each factor (action cost, hysteresis, spatial biases) is quantified as a value term, and all values are expressed in units of juice B.

The factor a<sub>1</sub> can be thought of as an inverse temperature capturing the steepness of the sigmoid once all the effects included in the logistic regression are accounted for.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Task-related responses</title><p>Each cell was analyzed in relation to the choice pattern recorded in the same session. In each trial, the neuronal activity was analyzed in nine time windows aligned with different behavioral events: pre-offer (0.5 s before the offer), post-offer (0.5 s after offer on), late-delay (0.5â1.0 s after offer on), mem-delay (0â0.5 s after offer off), pre-target (0.5 s before target on), post-target (0.5 s after target on), pre-go (0.5 s before the âgoâ), pre-juice (0.5 s before juice delivery), and post-juice (0.5 s after juice delivery). To identify task-related responses, each neuronal response was submitted to two 3-way ANOVAs (factors [trial type Ã offer A location Ã target A location]; factors [trial type Ã chosen offer location Ã chosen target location]). We imposed a significance threshold p &lt; 0.001. Responses that passed this criterion for at least one factor in either ANOVA were identified as âtask relatedâ and included in subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Variable selection analysis</title><p>Our goal was to identify the variables encoded in ACCd during economic choices under variable action cost. Our strategy was to define a large number of variables neurons in this area might conceivably encode, and to use procedures for variable selection to identify a small subset of variables that would best explain the population. Our analysis combined the approach previously adopted to analyze ACCd activity during standard choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>) with that adopted for OFC activity recorded using the present task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). The variables defined <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and included in the analysis are essentially the same defined for OFC activity in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). Concurrently, earlier work found that many neurons in ACCd encoded the movement direction, alone or convolved with other decision variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>). Importantly, the present task dissociated the spatial location of the chosen offer from the movement direction. Thus, neuronal responses were analyzed with an ANCOVA using the variables defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> as regressors and grouping data by whether the chosen offer or chosen target was on the ipsilateral or on the contralateral hemifield (binary variable). For early time windows (before target presentation), the categorical variable included in the ANCOVA was <italic>chosen offer location</italic>; for late time windows (after target presentation), the categorical variable was <italic>chosen target location</italic>.</p><p>In preliminary analyses, we tested different models of the ANCOVA and observed that the interaction term was rarely significant. We thus report here only the results obtained using the âparallel linesâ model. This model assumes that the encoding of the factor (variable) and the group (chosen location) are statistically independent. A variable was said to âexplainâ the response if the factor in the ANCOVA was significant (p &lt; 0.05). For each variable, the ANCOVA also provided an R<sup>2</sup>. This was the total R<sup>2</sup>, computed including both the factor and the group. For variables that did not explain the response, we arbitrarily set R<sup>2</sup> = 0. These criteria were used for all variables except the <italic>chosen offer location only</italic> and <italic>chosen target location only</italic>, for which we proceeded as follows. We computed the âhorizontal linesâ model of the ANCOVA, which assumes that firing rates only depend on the group (chosen offer location or chosen target location). Variables <italic>chosen offer location only</italic> or <italic>chosen target location only</italic> were thus said to explain the response if the group was significant in this analysis (p &lt; 0.05). From this model, we also obtained the R<sup>2</sup>, which was set equal to 0 if the group was not significant. Importantly, the R<sup>2</sup> thus obtained for the variable <italic>chosen offer location only</italic> or <italic>chosen target location only</italic> was always lower than that obtained for any other variable that explained the response. Hence, for any given response, <italic>chosen offer location only</italic> or <italic>chosen target location only</italic> provided the best explanation (highest R<sup>2</sup>) only if it provided the sole explanation.</p><p>The detailed procedures used in the variable selection analysis were described in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>) and we performed the analysis based on the neuronal activity across all nine time windows. Two procedures â stepwise and best-subset â identified a small number of variables that best explained the neuronal data set. The âexplanatory powerâ of any subset of variables was defined as the total number of responses collectively explained by those variables. In the stepwise procedure, we selected at each step the variable that provided the highest number of best fits within any time window. We then removed from the data set all the responses explained by this variable and we repeated the procedure on the residual data. The procedure was repeated until when the marginal explanatory power of any additional variable fell &lt;2%. In the best-subset procedure, we identified the subset of n variables that collectively provided the highest explanatory power. Importantly, the best-subset procedure warrants optimality and the two procedures applied to our data set provided identical results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Dimensional integration in chosen value signals</title><p>We examined the integration of multiple determinants into single value signals for <italic>chosen value (juice</italic>) responses. To do so, we defined two variants of the variable <italic>chosen value (juice</italic>) â one cost-affected and one cost-independent. We sought to assess which variant better fit neuronal responses. For each response, we considered the two R<sup>2</sup> and we computed the difference ÎR<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>2</sup><sub>cost-affected</sub> â R<sup>2</sup><sub>cost-independent</sub> and we examined the distribution for ÎR<sup>2</sup> across the population. We did not want to bias the results in favor of either variant. Thus, for this analysis we identified neuronal responses encoding the <italic>chosen value (juice</italic>) as follows. For each response and each value variable, we considered the two R<sup>2</sup> obtained from the two variants, and we assigned the maximum R<sup>2</sup> to the response. We then assigned each response to one of the selected variables accordingly.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

The main results provide evidence against the notion that ACC contributes to evaluation of potential actions. Instead, neurons predominantly coded for post-decision variables, such as cost of the chosen target and the juice type of the chosen offer, but not pre-decision variables, such as offer values. This is in contrast to the orbitofrontal cortex, where neurons encoded effort associated with choice options. Together, the results are convincing and highlight potentially unique roles of ACC neurons in learning and decision making.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuronal Activity in Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex during Economic Choices under Variable Action Costs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Erin Rich as the Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alicia Izquierdo (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers felt that this study provides important new information about primate ACC. The behavioral task is powerful and the analyses of both the choice behavior and neural data are rigorous. The fact that the results in the present study can be directly compared to OFC broadens the interpretation and importance of the study. In discussion, there were four points that the reviewers deemed most important to address. Further detail on each can be found in the individual reviewer comments appended below.

When the authors previously studied ACC, they discarded the conflict monitoring hypothesis â a hypothesis that is well established for ACC hemodynamic responses â for ACC single cell activity based on neural data from 'difficult' decisions (Cai and Padoa- Schioppa, 2012). The definition of difficulty they used, then, was descriptive and based on reaction times (RTs). They defined the most difficult trials as those trials with the longest RTs and discovered that those trials had options with similar offer values. This definition of choice difficulty appears to be contrived from evidence accumulation models/tasks, where normatively harder judgments elicit longer RTs. However, there is no normative economic reason that trials with similar offer values are more difficult or should cause conflict. After all, according to theory, choosing between two options with the same value is as easy as flipping a coin. Here, it seems like the authors could have a more fitting definition of conflict. For example, conflict can be operationalized by considering trials when the animal must choose between a high value/high-cost option and a low-value/low-cost option. In that case, the costs and benefits are in conflict. What do the RTs look like? Do the RTs indicate conflict resolution? If so, is this reflected in neuronal responses?â</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. First, we would like to clarify that both in this study and in our previous study of ACC (Cai and Padoa-Schioppa 2012) we imposed a delay between offer presentation and the go signal. Such delay is critical to disentangle value comparison from action selection. However, the delay effectively dissociates reaction times from the decision difficulty. Normally, we operationalize the decision difficulty (or conflict) with the variable value ratio = chosen value / unchosen value. In an early behavioral study conducted in capuchin monkeys, where no delay was imposed between offer presentation and the go signal, we found that reaction times were strongly correlated with the value ratio, as one would naturally expect (Padoa-Schioppa, Jandolo et al., 2006). In the previous study of ACC (Cai and Padoa-Schioppa 2012) we referenced that earlier result but, again, we did not analyze reaction times.</p><p>Coming to the present study, we addressed this question by including in the variable selection analyses the two variables value ratio and cost/benefit conflict = cost of A * sign (offer value A â offer value B) (see also Table 2). The results of the updated analysis are illustrated in the new Figure 4. In essence, including these two variables did not affect the results of the variable selection analysis. That is, both the stepwise and best-subset methods selected the variables chosen value, chosen cost, chosen juice, chosen offer location only and chosen target location only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It was felt that a strength of the study is the contrast between ACC and OFC, and this should be highlighted more in the manuscript, including the addition of formal comparisons with figures.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is related to the following comment from Reviewer 1:</p><p>âThe differences between OFC and ACC encoding offer value variables are discussed qualitatively, but it would be helpful to add formal comparisons to Figure 7.â</p><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for appreciating the strength of this study in contrasting between ACC and OFC. We did not include the variables offer value (juice) or offer value (cost) in the analysis of Figure 7 in the original analysis because neither variable was picked up by the variable selection analysis. However, to validate the conclusions, we have now analyzed these two variables as if they were selected by the variable selection analysis. We thus conducted two analyses to compare the percentage of neurons encoding offer value (juice) and offer value (cost) in ACCd and OFC. First, for each brain region, we performed a binomial test to assess whether the percentage of cells encoding either variable was significantly above chance level (5%). Second, for each variable â offer value (juice) and offer value (cost) â we performed a Chi-squared test to assess whether the percentage of cells encoding it differed significantly across areas. The outcomes of these analyses are summarized in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table2">Author response table 2</xref>. For offer value (juice), the percentage of encoding neurons exceeded chance level in OFC (before target presentation) but not in ACC. Moreover, the percentage of neurons encoding offer value (juice) in OFC was significantly higher than that in ACCd in all time windows before target presentation. For offer value (cost), the encoding was significantly above chance only in OFC (post-offer window). Furthermore, the percentage of cells encoding this variable was significantly higher in OFC than in ACC (post-offer and late-delay time windows). In conclusion, the difference between the two areas was statistically significant.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides"

(Note that the correlation depended on the set of offer types and on the animalâs choices). Notably, variables were substantially correlated in most sessions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71695-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>âA second possibility is that the difference between 4A and B is driven in part byreducing each neuron's encoding to only one of the predictors.

Consider a response encoding variable X at the first order (i.e., a response explained by X better than by any other selected variable), to establish whether adding a second variable Y to the regression provides a significantly better account, we compute F<sub>Y|X</sub> = (n-3) * (R<sup>2</sup><sub>XY</sub> â R<sup>2</sup><sub>X</sub>) / (1- R<sup>2</sup><sub>XY</sub>). In the equation, R<sup>2</sup><sub>X</sub> is obtained from the linear regression on X only; R<sup>2</sup><sub>XY</sub> is obtained from the bi-linear regression on X and Y; and n is data points in the regression. We compute for each of the variables Y we wish to test as potentially encoded as the second variable, and we take the maximum F = max{F<sub>Y|X</sub>}. We then set a threshold F corresponding to a desired p = 0.05/N (N = number of potential second order variables). If F passes the criterion, we identify the second order variable encoded by the response. If F does not pass the criterion, we conclude that the response does not encode other variables (of those we defined and analyzed). For each neuron, chosen value was set as variable X because chosen value is the dominant variable encoded by ACCd, and the rest of the variables as Y. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the first column indicates the number of responses that provide the best fit for chosen value in a single linear regression (y = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>*chosen value). The other columns indicate the number of responses that encode a secondary variable in addition to chosen value. For responses encoding chosen value, there was no consistent encoding of a secondary variable.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71695-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, it was felt that the emphasis in the discussion of Hosokawa et al., could be shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>We shortened the discussion from 3 paragraphs to 1 paragraph as follows.</p><p>âIn another study, Hosokawa, Kennerley et al., (2013) compared the neuronal coding in ACCd and OFC in a choice task involving cost-benefit tradeoff.

To make it clearer, we added on line 163 âout of the total 688 neuronsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors could cite other relevant theoretical perspectives and previous work that are much in alignment with their present findings: for example on mixed selectivity to produce higher dimensionality for complex cognition (Fusi et al. Curr Op Neurobiol 2016) and multiplexing of spatial position and choice related information in ACC (Mashhoori et al. 2018 eLife).</p></disp-quote><p>We added these references (lines 260 â 263).</p></body></sub-article></article>
