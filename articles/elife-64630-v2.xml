tagged proteins in cells and tissues. APEX, an ascorbate peroxidase, has proven to be one of the most versatile and robust genetic tags for ultrastructural localization by electron microscopy (EM). Here, we describe a simple method, APEX-Gold, which converts the diffuse oxidized diaminobenzidine reaction product of APEX into a silver/gold particle akin to that used for immunogold labelling. The method increases the signal-to-noise ratio for EM detection, providing unambiguous detection of the tagged protein, and creates a readily quantifiable particulate signal. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this method for detection of membrane proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. The method can be combined with different EM techniques including fast freezing and freeze substitution, focussed ion beam scanning EM, and electron tomography. Quantitation of expressed APEX-fusion proteins is achievable using membrane vesicles generated by a cell-free expression system. These membrane vesicles possess a defined quantum of signal, which can act as an internal standard for determination of the absolute density of expressed APEX-fusion proteins. Detection of fusion proteins expressed at low levels in cells from CRISPR-edited mice demonstrates the high sensitivity of the APEX-Gold method.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic tags for electron microscopy (EM) have made protein ultrastructural localization possible within the three-dimensional (3D) environment of cells, tissues, and whole organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lam et al.,

APEX, a modified ascorbate peroxidase derived from soybean, is a simple highly versatile marker for EM detection. The wide applicability of its use is demonstrated by studies utilizing APEX and its derivative, APEX2, for detection of fusion proteins in cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirabayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meiring et al., 2019</xref>). APEX has also been combined with nanobody-based detection systems for rapid localization of GFP- and mCherry-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2018</xref>), and used to detect protein interactions using split GFP and nanobodies or using a novel split-APEX system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2019</xref>). These applications are compatible with 3D EM techniques in which the reaction product can be produced within the depth of the specimen, rather than on the surface as occurs with labelling on sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Martell et al., 2012</xref>), and can also be used with methods that require cryo-preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsang et al., 2018</xref>). Despite its versatility, the relatively diffuse diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction product can make distinguishing the APEX reaction from electron-dense cellular components difficult and often requires an expert to interpret the images. This is especially apparent when APEX-tagged proteins have multiple subcellular localizations, for example, a soluble and a membrane-localized distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Follett et al., 2016</xref>). A method which allows researchers to obtain a particulate signal from a genetic tag that could be equated to the actual number of antigens present would be a huge breakthrough in the field.</p><p>In this study, we describe the use of a method for converting the DAB reaction produced by a cytoplasmically exposed APEX tag into a particulate marker. This method produces an easily detectable gold particle at the site of the fusion protein with high resolution and specificity, allowing simple correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), use in 3D EM techniques, and simple quantitation.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Design</title><p>In order to convert the DAB reaction product to a particulate marker, we tested a number of protocols with a particular focus on silver/gold (Ag/Au) enhancement methods originally developed for amplification of the DAB signal obtained with peroxidase-labelled antibodies on histological sections. The criteria for enhancement of the APEX-DAB reaction product for EM were: (1) production of a uniformly sized particle with high specificity, (2) high sensitivity with low background and no self-nucleation, (3) high resolution, and (4) ease of use, that is, using conventional fixation and processing schemes, readily available laboratory reagents, and in ambient light conditions rather than a darkroom. The optimal protocol which satisfied these criteria was a modified Ag/Au enhancement method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sedmak et al., 2009</xref>) as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, similar to that used to visualize luminal APEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mavlyutov et al., 2017</xref>). After fixation and a conventional incubation with DAB/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to reveal the oxidized DAB reaction product, cells were incubated sequentially with a silver nitrate solution (containing hexamethylenetetramine and disodium tetraborate) and then with gold chloride. This resulted in local production of stabilized gold particles in the range of 10–15 nm in diameter as the argyrophilic oxidized DAB reaction product converts the metal salts to colloidal particles at the site of the fusion protein. Gum arabic was included to provide consistent uniform nucleation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>APEX-Gold particulate labelling of genetically-tagged proteins of interest.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the APEX-Gold method. Cells were transfected with Cavin4-APEX2 (<bold>B,D,E</bold>) (control light microscopy experiments are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) or LifeAct-APEX2 (<bold>C,F</bold>), fixed, treated with diaminobenzidine (DAB), and then incubated with Ag/Au reagents in the presence of gum arabic.

The APEX-Gold method satisfies the criteria of specificity, low background, sensitivity, resolution, and ease of use. Untransfected cells show negligible Ag/Au particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and labelling is tightly restricted to caveolae with an average of 18.4 nm from the caveolar membrane to the centre of the particulate reaction product when imaged using transmission EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). The experimental process is very simple and robust; all incubations are done in the light and require no specialist chemicals or equipment. The method has been used successfully in over 20 different biological replicate experiments using the Cavin4-APEX2 and LifeAct-APEX2 systems. Critically, it results in an unambiguous particulate reaction product that is clearly definable without expert interpretation. Sections were generally viewed without further on-grid staining to maximize detection of gold particles. However, visualization of the electron-dense APEX-Gold particles is readily compatible with on-grid staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We also tested the compatibility of the method with freeze substitution/low temperature embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D,E</xref>). This makes APEX-Gold potentially compatible with double labelling, with the APEX-fusion protein being expressed endogenously in the cells and then sections labelled for other proteins of interest. The APEX-Gold method is also simple to use in CLEM approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>) and can be checked by dot blot in parallel to the EM experiment to ensure the protocol is standardized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; see Materials and methods for a standard protocol).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>APEX-fusion protein density determination using an internal standard and low level protein detection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic explaining the cell-free caveolae-APEX2-Gold system. (<bold>B</bold>) A431 cells were incubated with in vitro synthesized CAV1-APEX2 cell-free caveolae for 5 min at 37°C before fixation and processing for APEX-Gold detection.

We made use of the ability of mammalian caveolin-1 (CAV1), the major structural protein of caveolae, to generate nanovesicles with a defined number of caveolin proteins when expressed in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jung et al., 2018</xref>) (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). CAV1-APEX2 was expressed in a cell-free Leishmania lysate (GFP-tagged and -untagged; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and the GFP-tagged protein characterized by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The resulting vesicles contained a quantum of fluorescence consistent with approximately 110 GFP-CAV1-APEX2 molecules per vesicle. We then compared the enzymatic activity of the cell-free synthesized GFP-CAV1-APEX-fusion protein with commercial horseradish peroxidase using dot blots. The cell-free synthesized APEX2 fusion protein had higher activity per µg of protein than the commercial HRP preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Enhancement of the signal using the APEX-Gold protocol caused a slight increase in sensitivity of detection and a colour change in the dot blot providing a simple assay to check for successful enhancement.</p><p>We next used the uniformly sized in vitro generated GFP-CAV1-APEX2 vesicles for comparative studies in cells. The lysate containing the GFP-CAV1-APEX2 vesicles was added to cultured A431 cells for 5 min at 37°C prior to fixation, DAB treatment, and APEX-Gold enhancement. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the GFP-CAV1-APEX2 vesicles were observed on the surface of the cells and in endosomes and are clearly decorated with the APEX-Gold enhanced particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Under these enhancement conditions, an average of 16.9 Ag/Au particles per vesicle (mean ± 4.3 SD, n = 26) was observed in the approximately 100-nm-thick section. This value could be used as a standard to examine the efficiency of APEX-Gold particulate formation, when coupled with the previously established molecules per vesicle (~110). This proof of principle experiment using exogenously added Caveolin-APEX vesicles as a standard demonstrates the potential of the APEX-Gold method for determination of the density of unknown proteins.</p><p>While these experiments illustrated the potential of APEX-Gold for quantitative studies, it was apparent from close examination of labelled CAV1-APEX that separating individual nucleation events for the densely packed APEX2-tags was problematic. We observed a varied distribution of gold sizes which we hypothesize are a consequence of fusion of multiple individual particulates into a single APEX-Gold product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We speculated that a low abundance antigen might be detected with high efficiency if the APEX2-tagged proteins are well spaced. To test this we examined an APEX2-tagged tropomyosin isoform. APEX-tagged tropomyosin is a good candidate to obtain precise physical organization because it is an extended molecule (~35 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sousa et al., 2010</xref>) and so the APEX molecules should be well spaced along the actin filament. We utilized a recently characterized CRISPR-generated mouse line that expresses tropomyosin 3.1 (Tpm3.1) C-terminally tagged with APEX2 from the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meiring et al., 2019</xref>). In these mice, exon 9d of the tropomyosin gene is fused to APEX2 via a 10 amino acid linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meiring et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Western blotting of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from Tpm3.1-APEX2 heterozygous mice showed that expression of the fusion protein is lower than that of the endogenous Tpm3.1 protein (~5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). We then subjected the MEFs to the APEX-Gold method for detection of the fusion protein. Light microscopic studies revealed that specific labelling was associated with putative stress fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and this was confirmed by correlative EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>) that showed a dense and highly specific particulate labelling associated with bundles of actin, with an average of 10.6 nm from the particle to the centre of bundle mass when imaged using transmission EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). In addition, particulate labelling was more uniform in size distribution compared to CAV1-APEX vesicles and followed distinct tracks suggestive of individual actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>). The precise arrangement of tropomyosin on individual actin filaments is not yet known but the gold spacing along actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) demonstrates the sensitivity of the method and the feasibility of this approach. Moreover, the greater uniformity of the gold reaction product in the Tpm.3.1-APEX2 MEFs suggests that the packing or density of tags may impact gold size distribution. These results clearly demonstrate the power of the APEX-Gold technique for detecting proteins at low expression levels and/or proteins expressed from endogenous loci.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present a simple technique for identification of a protein of interest by transmission EM using a genetic tag to generate a particulate signal. The method has high resolution, low background, and is sensitive enough to detect proteins expressed at or below endogenous levels. We provide a defined standard for calibration to ensure reproducibility and show that the method is compatible with 3D EM techniques such as serial block-face SEM, array tomography, FIB SEM, and electron tomography.</p><p>The APEX system has proven to be a powerful new addition to the biologist’s arsenal of techniques with wide applications in EM and in proteomics. The original APEX system involving a fusion with the protein of interest has been extended to new modifications including nanobody-based detection of fluorescent proteins and protein complexes and a split-APEX which only yields an active enzyme if brought together by two partner proteins. All of these applications are compatible with the APEX-Gold method for conversion of DAB to an Ag/Au particle. The APEX-Gold method is so simple that it should be used in parallel to light microscopy as an initial step in protein localization. In fact, through the use of nanobody-APEX constructs, a co-transfection with a GFP-tagged protein can yield CLEM images in a very short timeframe. The technique produces a particulate signal which is clearly distinguished from any cellular feature and is readily quantitated. By combining with an APEX-fusion protein of known signal density (here demonstrated by cell-free generated vesicle of a defined APEX density as a calibration standard), it is possible to quantitatively compare particle density to antigen density. While we demonstrated this principle by using exogenously added cell-free synthesized caveolin-AP vesicles, an APEX-tagged antigen generated by CRISPR technology that is present at known density in a specific region of the cell could also be used as a standard.</p><p>We were able to use the APEX-Gold method to localize low levels of APEX2-tagged proteins and to estimate the sensitivity of the technique. We utilized cells from mice genetically modified to express APEX2 fused to Tpm3.1 which have been previously characterized in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meiring et al., 2019</xref>). Embryonic fibroblasts from the mice express the Tpm3.1-APEX2 fusion protein at approximately 5% of endogenous levels. Tpm3.1 is expressed at a concentration of 30 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meiring et al., 2018</xref>) and so 5% represents a concentration of 1.5 µM. This equates to a cellular Tpm3.1-APEX2 copy number of approximately 1 million Tpm3.1 homodimers per cell with 250,000 predicted to be associated with actin and the remainder cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meiring et al., 2018</xref>). This level of expression resulted in an excellent signal-to-noise ratio for the APEX-Gold particles on actin filaments, facilitated by the spacing of the gold along the filaments which is related to the size and organization of the tropomyosin oligomers. This demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of antigen detection and lays the foundation for truly quantitative immuno-EM in cells and tissues for the first time.</p><p>APEX-Gold represents a significant advance in protein distribution analysis by EM. Compared with current APEX methods which rely on subjective interpretation of a diffuse DAB reaction product, the improved signal-to-noise ratio and a particulate, quantitative readout indicate that this method should become the gold standard for localization of genetically tagged proteins in EM.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The method used here, which we have optimized for APEX localization, is based on well-established methods for histological and EM visualization of the insoluble DAB product of peroxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danscher and Nörgaard, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dobó et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Newman and Jasani, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pohl and Stierhof, 1998</xref>), combined with the methods of silver reduction and gold toning developed for photography in the 19th century (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellis, 1975</xref>). These methods have been developed and used in many laboratories to allow enhancement of the DAB reaction for light microscopic applications, for converting the DAB signal to an easily detected particulate marker to allow discrimination from any cellular structures, and to increase the sensitivity of DAB detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dobó et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Newman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sedmak et al., 2009</xref>). The three principle steps involve: (1) production of the polymerized DAB product, (2) the reduction of silver ions to submicroscopic metallic silver by the argyrophilic DAB polymer, and (3) substitution of metallic silver by gold (gold toning), through the simple reaction Ag + Au<sup>+</sup>→ Ag<sup>+</sup>+ Au to produce the more inert gold particle that can resist subsequent osmium treatment. A further refinement is the use of gum arabic which was introduced for gold enhancement by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danscher, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danscher and Nörgaard, 1983</xref> to allow precise control of Ag/Au nucleation and more uniform particle generation.</p><p>While the benefits of the APEX-Gold method are clear, this approach still comes with certain caveats that must be considered prior to performing these analyses. First, it is necessary to take care to precisely control the development time for particulate deposition with the silver enhancement and subsequent gold toning. We optimized the development conditions to suit the size distribution of the particulate reaction product for detection of APEX-tags at a local density that was suitable for visualization of caveolar-proteins and actin-associated proteins at a reasonable magnification. Increased development times can increase the particle size, facilitating their identification, but can cause appearance of artefactual self-nucleated particles at sites lacking APEX (hence the need for careful control experiments). Increased enhancement times can also cause more variable particle size including the appearance of ‘fused’ gold particles where individual APEX molecules are closely packed and so not clearly resolved as individual gold particles after enhancement (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This can cause potential difficulties for quantitation and for applications in double labelling, for example, when the APEX-Gold method is combined with on-section labelling of Tokuyasu sections or freeze-substituted Lowicryl sections. It is also possible that the enhancement might differ when the APEX molecule is present in different cellular compartments (e.g. cytosol versus endosome lumen). However, these issues are dependent on the system being studied; in experiments involving detection of tropomyosin-APEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>), gold particles were generally well spaced and well resolved as individual particles and of uniform size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This suggests that variation is dependent on the density of the antigen of interest. Optimization of the enhancement time is required to allow detection of individual gold particles without formation of single large particles from multiple closely packed APEX molecules. Careful examination of the labelling pattern for Cavin4 reveals larger particles close to the caveolar membrane, and smaller particles in the neighbouring cytosol. This difference in size may be explained by the existence of Cavin4 in different oligomeric states on the caveolar membrane and in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kovtun et al., 2014</xref>), that is, it reflects a real biological difference which could be used to infer the state of the protein in particular sites. This problem can potentially be avoided by expressing low levels of APEX-tagged proteins, as shown here for cells expressing an APEX-tagged tropomyosin isoform. We have also only shown proteins directly tagged with APEX2 in this study. However, the system is readily compatible with the use of conditionally stabilized APEX-nanobodies to a GFP- or mCherry-tagged protein of interest as used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2018</xref>). This would affect the ability to correlate the APEX-Gold signal with the density of the protein of interest but has advantages for CLEM approaches or for detection of protein complexes by using split GFP. Despite these caveats, the APEX-Gold method can provide superior signal-to-noise ratios, allows absolute quantitation of particulate signals, is compatible with 3D EM methods and automated segmentation, and has resolution equal to, or higher than, immunogold labelling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Full details and unique repository identifiers are given in key resources table. A<sub>1</sub>AR-APEX2 was produced by gateway cloning, whereby human A<sub>1</sub>AR in pENTR/D/TOPO vector was recombined into pEF5/FRT/V5-DEST-APEX2. The resultant expression vector encoded the human A<sub>1</sub>AR with C-terminally tagged APEX2, adjoined by a glycine-serine-rich linker.

Cells were left for 24 hr, then fixed and processed for EM 24 hr later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EM eLine</title><p>SEM array tomography was carried out in an Electron Beam Lithography system, the Raith eLINE PLUS. The system is equipped with the dual detector (Inlens, SE) and a laser interferometric stage. Prior to the image acquisition, the scan field was calibrated at 25,000× with the laser stage. The displayed image was captured at 2 kV with 30 µm aperture (beam current of 30 pA), using the SE detector, at a working distance of 2.2 mm. The use of laser interferometric stages allows near-perfect stitching of scan fields by overlapping just five pixels at the edge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Focussed ion beam</title><p>FIB-SEM tomography of the sample was carried out on a FEI Scios DualBeam FIB-SEM system equipped with a 30 kV Ga + column and a Pt gas injection system (FEI). The sample was tilted to 52° so that its top surface was aligned parallel to the focal plane of the FIB. A protective layer of Pt was deposited onto the top surface directly above the volume of interest. A trench was milled at one end of the volume of interest using a 7 nA beam current. The purpose of the trench was to provide the SEM with an unobstructed view of the exposed cross-section and to allow for the escape of sputtered material. Fiducial marks were milled into both the top surface of the sample and the sidewall of the trench. The surface of the exposed face was planarized by milling using successively lower ion beam currents, down to 100 pA. The Auto Slice and View automation package (FEI) was used to sequentially mill away 10-nm-thick segments of material followed by SEM imaging of each newly exposed surface using the In-lens Trinity ‘T1’ BSE detector. An electron beam acceleration voltage of 2 kV and current of 50 pA was used. The stage remained stationary during the entire sequence so that the surface of each cross-section is tilted 38° from the SEM column and in-column detector. The respective fiducial marks were detected by the automation package prior to each milling and imaging step and used to correct for image drift of the electron and ion beam, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Tomography</title><p>The 200-nm-thick sections were cut on a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome. Grids were assembled into an Autogrid (Thermo Fisher) and loaded onto a 200 kV Thermo Fisher Talos Arctica fitted with a Falcon 3EC (Thermo Fisher) camera operated in linear mode and at room temperature (RT). Bidirectional dual axis tilt series were acquired at 1° increments from −60° to +60° under the control of Tomography software (Thermo Fisher). Tilt series were reconstructed using weighted back-projection with IMOD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Serial block-face EM</title><p>Images were additionally collected using a VolumeScope serial block-face EM (SBEM; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) equipped with a low-vac backscatter detector (VS-DBS; Thermo Fisher).

Comparison of the brightness values obtained for the two constructs suggests that vesicles produced using the CAV1-GFP-APEX2 construct comprised approximately 110 GFP-CAV1-APEX2 molecules.</p><p>Single-molecule spectroscopy was performed using an AttoBright instrument optimized for the detection of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). A 488 nm laser was focussed into the sample solution using a C-Apochromat 40×/1.2 W water immersion objective lens (Zeiss) and the fluorescence emission was filtered using a 500–550 nm bandpass filter. Samples were diluted 1:5 directly from cell-free expression with buffer EB and placed in a custom-made silicone 192-well plate with a 70 × 80 mm<sup>2</sup> glass coverslip (ProSciTech). For single-molecule burst brightness analysis, the frequency of events for each range of GFP fluorescence intensity was counted and plotted on a histogram.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the help of staff and use of facilities in the Microscopy Australia NCRIS Facility at the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis at The University of Queensland.

Prior work developed the label known as APEX, an ascorbate peroxidase enzyme, for ultrastructural localization by electron microscopy. APEX labeling depends on oxidizing a small molecule, diaminobenzidine, but the resulting contrast is sometimes too weak or diffuse for quantitative labeling or detection of low-abundance proteins. Here, Rae et al. have developed an extension of APEX labeling, named APEX-Gold, which harnesses the oxidized diaminobenzidine reaction product of APEX to generate silver/gold heavy atom particles near the labeled protein. APEX-Gold labeling, therefore, has increased signal-to-noise and is suitable for quantitative studies of even low-abundance proteins, and is compatible with a diverse array of electron microscopy methods.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;APEX-Gold: A genetically-encoded particulate marker for robust 3D electron microscopy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yannick Schwab (Reviewer #2); Paul Verkade (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Rae et al. reports a new protocol for labeling genetically-tagged proteins of interest with heavy atom particles for visualization by electron microscopy. The optimized protocol builds on the use of the enzyme APEX2, fused to the target protein of interest. The contrast enhancement may be useful in diverse 3D EM techniques. Also, reviewers were enthusiastic about the prospects for quantitative studies, even for low-levels of endogenous expression, because the new method appears to improve the proportionality of the signal such that the number of APEX2 tags in a sample correlates with the number of heavy atom particles. The apparent simplicity of the protocol raises the potential for it to become a standard in the field of EM labeling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The technique is to improve the contrast of APEX2 labeling, yet, it seems that on most of the EM images, post-staining was not performed? Could the authors comment, or also show images from post-stained sections? This is particularly obvious on the supplementary Fig6a, which is supposed to also display a non-transfected cell. In fact, this cell is almost invisible due to the absence of contrast.</p><p>2. The experiments on freeze-substituted material show staining that does not appear associated with caveola. Has this been analyzed? Could this be a limitation of the workflow? We understand the strong interest in adapting the technique to post-embedding, on-section immuno-labeling, but this would only be valid if the initial staining was not affected. Please clarify the methods section for this part of the manuscript as no information is available on the initial fixation (prior to FS). Are the cells also fixed with high levels of glutaraldehyde? Or are they mildly fixed to enable better success for on-section immunolabelling?</p><p>3. We do not fully understand the take-home-message from the last set of experiments, intending to set a labeling standard. Is the intention to prove the labeling can be quantitative? Have the authors tried to relate the number of particles to the number of APEX2 fusion proteins expected to be expressed at these vesicles (as suggested by the FCS experiment)? This might require further experiments or explanations. Overall, the issue of quantifying size distributions needs more explication and discussion. What is the detection limit? Can image analysis tools automate identification and measurement?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64630.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Routinely we keep staining to a minimum to make sure all gold particles are visualized, but we have now provided a new image in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 2A to show the morphology after on-grid staining. We have changed the text to emphasize this point on page 4 as follows:</p><p>“Sections were generally viewed without further on-grid staining to maximize detection of gold particles. However, visualization of the electron dense APEX-Gold particles is readily compatible with on-grid staining (Figure 1-supplement figure 2A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We were also puzzled by this and so we tested the use of a more rapid processing scheme including a 1h cryoprotectant infiltration and embedding at low temperature with HM20 resin. As shown in the revised figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 4D,E), this newly optimised protocol yields gold particles that are clearly visible and well-retained after the freezing, freeze substitution, and low temperature-embedding in HM20. We provide these images as a proof-of-principle demonstration that the technique is compatible with these methods and can be compatible with on-section labelling methods. This is now described on page 4 as follows:</p><p>“We also tested the compatibility of the method with freeze substitution/low temperature embedding (Figure 1-supplement figure 4D,E). This makes APEX-Gold potentially compatible with double labeling, with the APEX fusion protein being expressed endogenously in the cells and then sections labeled for other proteins of interest.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify the methods section for this part of the manuscript as no information is available on the initial fixation (prior to FS). Are the cells also fixed with high levels of glutaraldehyde? Or are they mildly fixed to enable better success for on-section immunolabelling?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and apologise for the oversight. In fact, we did employ a mild fixation of 4% pfa/0.1% glutaraldehyde prior to cryoprotection and freezing. This is now described on page 14. The relevant passage reads:</p><p>“<bold>Cells grown on Thermanox coverslips were fixed with 4% PFA and 0.1% GA then DAB treated and underwent the APEX-Gold enhancement described earlier.”</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. We do not fully understand the take-home-message from the last set of experiments, intending to set a labeling standard. Is the intention to prove the labeling can be quantitative? Have the authors tried to relate the number of particles to the number of APEX2 fusion proteins expected to be expressed at these vesicles (as suggested by the FCS experiment)? This might require further experiments or explanations. Overall, the issue of quantifying size distributions needs more explication and discussion. What is the detection limit? Can image analysis tools automate identification and measurement?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rewritten this section with further explanation. There were two aims for the experiments with CAV1-APEX2 vesicles. The first was to make a preparation of APEX particles that can act as a positive control for the method by use of a simple dot blot; This can be run alongside the experiment to ensure that the enhancement process works. This is a simple but very important step for the successful adoption of a new method by different laboratories (one problem with enhancement methods is that a failed experiment is only revealed after processing, sectioning, and then viewing in the electron microscope). We now stress this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Secondly, the CAV1-APEX vesicles have a defined number of APEX molecules and so can potentially be used as a standard for quantitation. In the revised manuscript we now provide the quantitation of APEX-gold per vesicle (page 5) and provide images showing how the counting was performed (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). We outline the existing challenges with the method (including ‘fused gold particles’ and the possibility that the enhancement might vary in different compartments) in the methodological consideration (previously entitled ‘Limitations’) section. Most importantly, we hope that these experiments stimulate the use of standards to add more quantitation to APEX-based localization studies and we now make this point more clearly in the Discussion.</p><p>“As shown in Figure 2B the GFP-CAV1-APEX2 vesicles were observed on the surface of the cells and in endosomes and are clearly decorated with the APEX-Gold enhanced particles (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). […] This proof of principle experiment using exogenously added Caveolin-APEX vesicles as a standard demonstrates the potential of the APEX-Gold method for determination of the density of unknown proteins.”</p><p>On Page 7 we provide a description and discussion of this approach for application to molecular quantitation of electron microscopy data:</p><p>“By combining with an APEX-fusion protein of known signal density (here demonstrated by cell-free generated vesicle of a defined APEX density as a calibration standard) it is possible to quantitatively compare particle density to antigen density. While we demonstrated this principle by using exogenously added cell-free synthesized caveolin-AP vesicles, an APEX-tagged antigen generated by CRISPR technology that is present at known density in a specific region of the cell could also be used as a standard.”</p><p>We further outlined some of the caveats in using this approach in the final section entitled ‘Methodological Considerations’. The relevant passage now reads:</p><p>“Increased enhancement times can also cause more variable particle size including the appearance of ‘fused’ gold particles where individual APEX molecules are closely packed and so not clearly resolved as individual gold particles after enhancement (see for example Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). […] Optimisation of the enhancement time is required to allow detection of individual gold particles without formation of single large particles from multiple closely-packed APEX molecules.”</p><p>Our experiments detecting APEX-tagged tropomyosin from genetically-modified mice demonstrate the sensitivity of the technique, as described in the Discussion. While we can state that the method can detect an endogenous protein expressed at 5% of endogenous levels we cannot provide any further estimate of sensitivity as this will depend on the optimisation of the enhancement conditions for particular targets of interest. This experiment emphasizes the power of the technique when the APEX-tagged protein is expressed at levels below endogenous levels (ie. with gold particles well separated) and its compatibility with image analysis tools for detection, as used in Figure 2—figure supplement 2D,D’.</p></body></sub-article></article>
