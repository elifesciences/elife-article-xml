To bridge the divide between these approaches, we present the single-molecule adenine methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay (SAMOSA). SAMOSA is a high-throughput single-molecule sequencing method that combines adenine methyltransferase footprinting and single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing to natively and nondestructively measure nucleosome positions on individual chromatin fibres. SAMOSA data allows unbiased classification of single-molecular 'states' of nucleosome occupancy on individual chromatin fibres. We leverage this to estimate nucleosome regularity and spacing on single chromatin fibres genome-wide, at predicted transcription factor binding motifs, and across human epigenomic domains. Our analyses suggest that chromatin is comprised of both regular and irregular single-molecular oligonucleosome patterns that differ subtly in their relative abundance across epigenomic domains. This irregularity is particularly striking in constitutive heterochromatin, which has typically been viewed as a conformationally static entity. Our proof-of-concept study provides a powerful new methodology for studying nucleosome organization at a previously intractable resolution and offers up new avenues for modeling and visualizing higher order chromatin structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>high-throughput sequencing</kwd><kwd>nucleosomes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007100</institution-id><institution>Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramani</surname><given-names>Vijay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsieh</surname><given-names>Laura J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM123977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodarzi</surname><given-names>Hani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM127020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Narlikar</surname><given-names>Geeta J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel single-molecule sequencing method reveals previously unappreciated heterogeneity in nucleosome positioning on individual chromatin fibers across the human genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nucleosome is the atomic unit of chromatin. Nucleosomes passively and actively template the majority of nuclear interactions essential to life by determining target site access for transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>), bookmarking active and repressed chromosomal compartments via post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), and safeguarding the genome from mutational agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papamichos-Chronakis and Peterson, 2013</xref>). Our earliest views of the beads-on-a-string arrangement of chromatin derived from classical electron micrographs of chromatin fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olins and Olins, 1974</xref>), which have since been followed by both light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2010</xref>) and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song et al., 2014</xref>) studies of in vitro-assembled and in vivo chromatin. In parallel, complementary biochemical methods using nucleolytic cleavage have successfully mapped the subunit architecture of chromatin structure at high resolution. These cleavage-based approaches can be stratified into those that focus primarily on chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>) (i.e. measuring ‘competent’ active chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weintraub and Groudine, 1976</xref>]), and those that survey nucleosomal structure uniformly across active and inactive genomic compartments. Understanding links between chromatin and gene regulation requires sensitive methods in all three of these broad categories: in this study, we advance our capabilities in the third, focusing on a novel method to map oligonucleosomal structures genome-wide.</p><p>Nucleolytic methods for studying nucleosome positioning have historically used cleavage reagents (e.g. dimethyl sulphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 1986</xref>], hydroxyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tullius, 1988</xref>], nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hewish and Burgoyne, 1973</xref>]) followed by gel electrophoresis and/or Southern blotting to map the abundance, accessibility, and nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs) of chromatin fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richard-Foy and Hager, 1987</xref>). More recently, these methods have been coupled to high-throughput short-read sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zentner and Henikoff, 2014</xref>), enabling genome-wide measurement of average nucleosome positions. While powerful, all these methods share key limitations: measurement of individual protein-DNA interactions inherently requires destruction of the chromatin fibre and averaging of signal across many short molecules. These limitations extend even to single-molecule methyltransferase-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krebs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nabilsi et al., 2014</xref>), which have their own biases (e.g. CpG/GpC bias; presence of endogenous m<sup>5</sup>dC in mammals; DNA damage due to bisulphite conversion), and are still subject to the short-length biases of Illumina sequencers. While single-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pott, 2017</xref>) and long-read single-molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>) genomic approaches have captured some of this lost contextual information, single-cell data are generally sparse and single-molecule Array-seq data must be averaged over multiple molecules. Ultimately, these limitations have hindered our understanding of how combinations of ‘oligonucleosomal patterns’ (i.e. discrete states of nucleosome positioning and regularity on single DNA molecules) give rise to active and silent chromosomal domains.</p><p>The advent of third-generation (i.e. high-throughput, long-read) sequencing offers a potential solution to many of these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shema et al., 2019</xref>).

We first present proof-of-concept of SAMOSA using gold-standard in vitro assembled chromatin fibres, demonstrating that our approach captures single-molecule nucleosome positioning at high-resolution. We next apply SAMOSA to oligonucleosomes derived from K562 cells to profile single-molecule nucleosome positioning genome-wide. Our data enables unbiased classification of oligonucleosomal patterns across both euchromatic and heterochromatic domains. These patterns are influenced by multiple epigenomic phenomena, including the presence of predicted transcription factor binding motifs and post-translational histone modifications. Consistent with estimates from previous studies, our approach reveals enrichment for long, regular chromatin arrays in actively elongating chromatin, and highly accessible, disordered arrays at active promoters and enhancers. Surprisingly, we also observe a large amount of heterogeneity within constitutive heterochromatin domains, with both mappable H3K9me3-decorated regions and human major satellite sequences harboring a mixture of irregular and short-repeat-length oliognucleosome types. Our study provides a proof-of-concept framework for studying chromatin at single-molecule resolution while suggesting a highly dynamic nucleosome-DNA interface across chromatin sub-compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-molecule real-time sequencing of adenine-methylated chromatin captures nucleosome footprints</title><p>Existing methyltransferase accessibility assays either rely on bisulfite conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krebs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nabilsi et al., 2014</xref>) or use the Oxford Nanopore platform to detect DNA modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oberbeckmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shipony et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesized that high-accuracy PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing could detect m<sup>6</sup>dA deposited on chromatin templates to natively measure nucleosome positioning. To test this hypothesis, we used the nonspecific adenine methyltransferase EcoGII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2018</xref>) to footprint nonanucleosomal chromatin arrays generated through salt-gradient dialysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), using template DNA containing nine tandem repetitive copies of the Widom 601 nucleosome positioning sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>) separated by ~46 basepairs (bp) of linker sequence followed by ~450 bp of sequence without any known intrinsic affinity for nucleosomes. After purifying DNA, polishing resulting ends, and ligating on barcoded SMRTBell adaptors, we subjected libraries to sequencing on PacBio Sequel or Sequel II flow cells, using unmethylated DNA and methylated naked DNA as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After filtering low quality reads, we analyzed a total of 33,594 single molecules across all three conditions. Across both platforms, we observed higher average interpulse duration (IPD) in samples exposed to methyltransferase, consistent with a rolling circle polymerase ‘pausing’ at methylated adenine residues in template DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further inspection of footprinted chromatin samples sequenced on either platform revealed strong specificity for altered IPD values only at thymines falling outside Widom 601 repeat sequences, in contrast with fully methylated naked template and unmethylated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). These patterns were subtly influenced by the associated 10-mer context of sequenced bases, consistent with possible enzymatic biases, but also previous observations of sequence-influenced shifts in polymerase kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2013</xref>).

We then paired this approach with a simple peak-calling strategy to approximate nucleosomal dyad positions. To benchmark this pipeline, we first calculated the distance between called nucleosome dyads and expected 601 dyad positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Observed dyads were highly concordant with expected positions (median ±median absolute deviation [MAD]=4 ± 2.97 bp), consistent with our data accurately capturing the expected 601 dyad. We next calculated the expected distances between nucleosomes given our dyad callset (i.e. a computationally defined nucleosome repeat length [NRL]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Compared with the expected repeat length of 193 bp, our calculated results were similarly accurate at both two-dyad resolution (pairwise distance between adjacent dyads; median ±MAD = 193±7.40 bp) and averaged single-molecule resolution (median ±MAD = 192±1.30 bp). Both these measurements were qualitatively uniform across all molecules, independent of the positions of individual nucleosomes along individual array molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Finally, we directly visualized the modification probabilities of individual sequenced chromatin molecules and observed that modification patterns occurred in expected linker sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and not in unmethylated or fully methylated control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>). These results demonstrate that EcoGII footprinting is specific for unprotected DNA and that kinetic deviations observed in the data are not simply the result of primary sequence biases in the template itself. We hereafter refer to this approach as SAMOSA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SAMOSA captures regular nucleosome-DNA interactions in vivo through nuclease-cleavage and adenine-methylation simultaneously</title><p>Having shown that SAMOSA can footprint in vitro assembled chromatin fibres, we sought to apply our approach to oligonucleosomal fragments from living cells.

To better annotate each of these clusters, we characterized each with respect to methylation extent and distribution of computed single-molecule NRLs. We first inspected the average modification probabilities of each molecule across clusters, finding that these averages were largely invariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that our clustering approach does not simply classify oligonucleosomes based on the amount of methylation on each molecule. We next estimated within-cluster heterogeneity in single-molecule NRLs using a simple peak-calling approach. We scanned each autocorrelogram for secondary peaks, and annotated the location of each peak to compute an estimated NRL. We then visualized these distributions as violin plots for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Our data broadly fall into two categories: irregular clusters made up of molecules spanning multiple NRLs and lacking a strong regular periodicity, and highly regular clusters with defined single-molecule NRLs ranging from ~172 bp (i.e. chromatosome plus 5 bp DNA) to &gt;200 bp. Based on the median NRLs and regularities inferred from these analyses, we named these clusters irregular-short (IRS), irregular-long (IRL), irregular-170 (IR170), regular repeat length 172 (NRL172), regular repeat length 187A and B (NRL187A/B), and regular repeat length 192 (NRL192). The difference between irregular and regular clusters is clear when closely inspecting histograms of NRL calls from selected clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as well as the modification patterns on individual molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Failure to detect a peak within a single-molecule autocorrelogram could be due to multiple factors, including technical biases (e.g. random undermethylated molecules). We observed, however, that more ‘missing’ NRL estimates occurred in irregular clusters, suggesting that at least a fraction of failed peak calls occurred due to lack of intrinsic regularity along individual footprinted molecules. These analyses together demonstrate that SAMOSA data can be clustered in an unbiased manner, thus enabling estimates of the equilibrium composition of the genome with respect to oligonucleosome regularity and repeat length.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SAMOSA captures the transient nucleosome occupancy of transcription-factor-binding motifs</title><p>We next explored the extent to which our data captures chromatin structure at predicted K562 transcription factor (TF)-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>).

In total, we defined 13 discrete states of template accessibility across all surveyed molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>; cluster sizes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We interpreted these states on the basis of methyltransferase accessibility as: methyltransferase-resistant motifs (MR); nucleosome-occluded motifs (NO1-8); stochastically accessible motifs (wherein motif accessibility is slightly elevated near the DNA entry/exit point of a footprinted nucleosome; SA1-2); accessible motifs (A); and hyper-accessible motifs (HA). Notably, the patterns within these clusters were evident at single-molecule resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Most transcription factors (excepting PU.1 and GATA1—the latter of which may productively bind nucleosomal DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>]) were significantly enriched for specific states as defined above, and all control regions were markedly depleted for molecules harboring the accessible ‘A’ and ‘HA’ states, hinting at the biological relevance of these patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We speculate that the broad distribution of these states across both TF-binding sites and controls represent distributions of nucleosome ‘registers’ surrounding typical transcription factor binding motifs (i.e. states MR; NO-1–8). A fraction of these registers (i.e. states SA1/2) may stochastically permit transcription factor binding (perhaps through transient unwrapping of the nucleosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>]), enabling formation of a new nucleosome register (i.e. state ‘A’), and subsequent generation of a highly accessible state (‘HA’; model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The relative fraction of molecules in an ‘SA’ state could conceivably be modulated by TF intrinsic properties (e.g. ability to bind partially nucleosome-wrapped DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zaret and Mango, 2016</xref>]), or extrinsic factors (e.g. local concentration of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>]).

To control for the impact of GC-content on these analyses, we also included GC-/repeat content matched control molecules for each epigenomic mark surveyed.

A striking finding of our analyses was that each epigenomic domain surveyed was comprised of a highly heterogeneous mixture of oligonucleosome patterns. In most cases, these patterns differed only subtly from control molecules with respect to regularity and NRL. In specific cases, we observed small effect shifts in the estimated median NRLs for specific domains—for example, a shift of ~5 bp (180 bp vs. 185 bp) in H3K9me3 chromatin with respect to random molecules, and a shift of ~4 bp (182 bp vs 186 bp) for H3K36me3. These shifts were also evident in the fraction of molecules with successful peak calls: H3K4me3 decorated chromatin, for example, had markedly fewer (78.0% vs 88.6%) successful calls compared to control molecules, a finding consistent with the expected irregularity of active promoter oligonucleosomes.

One possible explanation for this is that epigenomic domains subtly, but significantly, vary in their relative composition of distinct oligonucleosome patterns, and the resulting average of these differences is the signal captured in MNase-Southern and other cleavage-based measurements. We tested this hypothesis by constructing a series of statistical tests to determine whether each of the seven defined oligonucleosome patterns were significantly enriched or depleted across chromatin domains and matched control regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; reproducibility analyses summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results suggest that chromatin domains are demarcated by their relative usage of specific oligonucleosome patterns. Consistent with expectations, active chromatin marked by H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 are punctuated by a mixture of irregular oligonucleosome patterns (namely, clusters IRL and IR170). For transcription elongation associated H3K36me3 decorated chromatin, both short-read mapping in human and long-read bulk array regularity mapping in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have suggested relatively short, regular nucleosome repeat lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valouev et al., 2011</xref>). Our data partially corroborate this finding in human K562 cells: H3K36me3-domains are punctuated by irregular IRS oligoncleosome patterns (Fisher’s Exact Odds Ratio [O.R.]=1.13; <italic>q</italic> = 1.71E-50) and regular, short NRL172 patterns (O.R. = 1.39; <italic>q</italic> = 3.69E-170).</p><p>Our assay also allows us to assess compositional biases in heterochromatic domains. Short-read-based human studies and classical MNase mapping of constituve heterochromatin have suggested that H3K9me3-decorated chromatin harbor (i) long nucleosome repeat lengths on average, and (ii) are highly regular. These estimates are susceptible to artifacts, as heterochromatic nucleosomes are expected to be both strongly phased and weakly positioned. Our data partially disagree with prior estimates—across both H3K9me3 and Satellite molecules we observe enrichment for irregular IRS nucleosome conformers (Satellite O.R. = 1.13; <italic>q</italic> = 5.71E-11; H3K9me3 O.R. = 1.35; <italic>q</italic> = 3.95E-23).

These analyses demonstrate that prior NRL estimates by short-read sequencing may have been confounded by in vivo heterogeneity in nucleosome positions, that heterochromatic nucleosome conformations can be both irregular and diverse, and finally, highlight the value of SAMOSA for accurately studying nucleosome structure in heterochromatin.</p><p>Taken as a whole, our data suggest two fundamental properties of human epigenomic domains: first, epigenomic domains are comprised of a diverse array of oligonucleosome patterns varying substantially in intrinsic regularity and average distance between regularly spaced nucleosomes; second: epigenomic domains are demarcated by their usage of these oligonucleosome patterns. We find that all epigenomic states are characterized by a diverse mixture of oligonucleosomal conformers—many conformational states are neither significantly depleted nor enriched with respect to all molecules surveyed, further hinting at the diverse composition of chromatin domains genome-wide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present the SAMOSA, a method for resolving nucleosome-DNA interactions using the EcoGII adenine methyltransferase and PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing. Our approach has multiple advantages over existing methyltransferase-based sequencing approaches: first, by using a relatively nonspecific methyltransferase, we avoid the primary sequence biases associated with GpC/CpG methyltransferase footprinting methods; second, by natively detecting modifications using the single-molecule real-time sequencer, we reduce enzymatic sequence bias and avoid sample damage associated with sodium bisulphite conversion; finally, and most importantly, our approach unlocks the study of protein-DNA interactions at length-scales previously unallowed by Illumina sequencing.</p><p>Our study does have limitations. While the current SAMOSA protocol enriches fragments ranging from ~500 bp to ~ 2 kb in size, high-quality PacBio CCS sequencing is compatible with fragments ranging from 10 to 15 kbp. We anticipate that with further optimization (e.g. optimization of digestion conditions), SAMOSA will be applicable to longer arrays, enabling kilobase-domain-scale study of single-molecule oligonucleosome patterning. Indeed, our preliminary SAMOSA experiments varying digestion conditions demonstrate the feasibility of such variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, our approach involves methylating fibres following solubilization of oligonucleosomal fragments, and is thus unlikely to capture protein-DNA interactions weaker or more transient than the stable nucleosome-DNA interaction. Such transient interactions could be captured in future work by modifying the protocol to footprint nuclei prior to MNase-solubilization. Third, our proof-of-concept was performed in unsynchronized K562 cells, and thus we cannot yet address the contribution of a biological process like the cell cycle to the observed heterogeneity. Finally, as a proof-of-concept our approach falls short of generating a high-coverage reference map of the K562 epigenome; as sequencing costs for PacBio decrease and sequence-enrichment technologies (<italic>e.g.</italic> CRISPR-based enrichment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ebbert et al., 2018</xref>; SMRT-ChIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2016</xref>]) for the platform mature, SAMOSA may routinely be used to generate reference datasets with hundred-to-thousand-fold single-molecular coverage of genomic sites of interest.</p><p>Our data confirms that the human epigenome is made up of a diverse array of oligonucleosome patterns, including highly regular arrays of varying nucleosome repeat lengths, and irregular arrays where nucleosomes are positioned without a detectable periodic signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldi et al., 2020</xref>). Our results broadly agree with a recent approach employing electron tomography to map the in situ structure of mammalian nuclei, which found chromatin to be highly heterogeneous at the length scale of multi-nucleosome interactions, and failed to detect evidence of a 30 nm fibre or other homogeneous higher order compaction states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ou et al., 2017</xref>). At the sequencing depth presented here, these oligonucleosome patterns significantly, if subtly, vary across different epigenomic domains. Surprisingly, we find that both mappable (H3K9me3 ChIP-seq peaks) and unmappable (human satellite sequence) constitutive heterochromatin are enriched for irregular oligonucleosome patterns in addition to expected regular arrays—the presence of these irregular fibres may have been previously missed due to an understandable reliance on bulk averaged methods (e.g. MNase-Southern) for studying constitutive heterochromatin. This is strongly supported by orthogonal analysis of heterochromatin-spanning K562 reads generated using the recently published, conceptually similar Fiber-seq method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stergachis et al., 2020</xref>), which also reveal that H3K9me3 domains are enriched for irregular chromatin fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given the robustness of this finding, it is tempting to speculate that this irregularity may be linked to the dynamic restructuring of heterochromatic nucleosomes by factors like HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanulli et al., 2019</xref>), which may promote phase-separation of heterochromatin. While stratification of analyzed satellite sequences into H3K9me3-decorated alpha/beta, and H3K9me3-free gamma satellite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2009</xref>) provides correlative support for this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), future studies combining SAMOSA with cellular perturbation of heterochromatin-associated factors are necessary to directly address this possibility.</p><p>More generally, future work employing our technique must focus on questioning the biological significance of this global heterogeneity: for example, is the fraction of stochastically accessible transcription factor binding sites (i.e. motif ‘site exposure’ frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>]) important for TF-DNA binding in nucleosome-occluded genomic regions? What is the interplay between transcription factor ‘pioneering’ and stochastic site accessibility? What are the global roles of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes (i.e. SWI/SNF; ISWI; INO80; CHD) in maintaining these patterns genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2020</xref>)? Our approach also unlocks a set of conceptual questions regarding the nature of chromatin secondary structure. Significant genome-wide efforts have revealed that metazoan epigenomes are punctuated by regions of concerted histone modification and subnuclear positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filion et al., 2010</xref>), but approaches for studying the distribution of oligonucleosomal patterns associated within these same regions are lacking. Given recent work suggesting that NRLs can specify the ability of nucleosomal arrays to phase separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely that SAMOSA and similar assays may provide an important bridge between in vitro biochemical observations of chromatin and in vivo genome-wide <italic>‘</italic>catalogs’ of oligonucleosome patterning.</p><p>SAMOSA adds to the growing list of technologies that use high-throughput single-molecule sequencing to explore the epigenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shipony et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stergachis et al., 2020</xref>). We foresee the broad applicability of this and similar approaches to dissect gene regulatory processes at previously intractable length-scales. Our approach and associated analytical pipelines demonstrate the versatility of high-throughput single-molecule sequencing—namely the ability to cluster single-molecules in an unsupervised manner to uncover molecular states previously missed by short-read approaches. Our analytical approach bears many similarities to methods used in single-cell analysis, and indeed many of the technologies and concepts typically used for single-cell genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trapnell, 2015</xref>) (e.g. clustering; trajectory analysis) will likely have value when applied to single-molecule epigenomic assays. Our approach also follows in the footsteps of multi-omic Illumina assays like NoME-seq and MapIT, representing the first of what we anticipate will be many ‘multi-omic’ third-generation sequencing assays. As third-generation sequencing technologies advance, it will likely become possible to encode multiple biochemical signals on the same single-molecules, thus enabling causal inference of the logic and ordering of biochemical modifications on single chromatin templates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of nonanucleosome arrays via salt-gradient dialysis</title><p>The nonanucleosome DNA in a plasmid was purified by Gigaprep (Qiagen) and the insert was digested out with EcoRV, ApaLI, XhoI and StuI.

Control molecules were drawn as above, using the gkmSVM package to find GC/repeat content matched genomic regions for each peakset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-11"><title>Selection of satellite-containing reads</title><p>Circular consensus reads with minimum length of 1 kb bearing satellites were identified using BLAST searching against a database containing DFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hubley et al., 2016</xref>) consensus sequences for alpha (DF0000014.4, DF0000015.4, DF0000029.4), beta (DF0000075.4, DF0000076.4, DF0000077.4, DF0000078.4, DF0000079.4), and gamma (DF0000148.4, DF0000150.4, DF0000152.4) satellites using blastn with default parameters. Satellite containing reads were further filtered such that they contained at minimum two hits to satellite consensus sequences and matches spanned at least 50% of the consensus sequence. These labels were then used to separate out sequences for the analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Daniele Canzio (UCSF), Hiten Madhani (UCSF), Srinivas Ramachandran (CU Denver), and Christopher Weber (Stanford) for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript.

in size.

The approach employs EcoGII-modulated m<sup>6</sup>dA deposition on accessible non-nucleosomal DNA (inkers, nucleosome free regions) released from nuclear after mild MNase cleavage. The DNA modification is then read-out using PacBio sequencing. Mapping nucleosome positions along longer DNA stretches can provide information on variation in nucleosomal arrays, and how that relates to chromatin state and factor binding etc. The assay is validated using a reconstitute chromatin template and then applied to K562 cells, revealing significant variation in nucleosome positioning and nucleosome repeat lengths at transcription factor binding sites, and throughout domains with various histone modifications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the approach works well and promises to address important questions, but the current work does not yet take full advantage of the single molecule nature of the assay and as such falls a bit short compared to very related methods that have recently been published (the works cited in the manuscript, and recently published work from the Stamatoyannopoulos lab). Can the authors acquire sufficient read coverage so that specific sites, e.g. specific CTCF sites are analyzed multiple times so that variation in the cell population at defined sites can be explored?</p><p>Many of the claims made about the potential of the method are insufficiently supported by the data provided. It appears that additional data is required to support the conclusions made from SAMOSA with respect to existing chromatin information, such as signal differences as a function of transcription factor binding (see below). The authors need to fully address these points in order for this manuscript to be considered for publication.</p><p>1) The authors should make an attempt to investigate where sequence bias influences a methylation call in their datasets. Clearly the pattern on the in vitro chromatinized template suggests that on average their methylated calls are correct. However, there appear to be clear positions in their chromatinized template datasets where this is not the case, i.e. lines in Figure 1—figure supplement 6A representing methylation calls in unmethylated template DNA and unmethylated calls on fully methylated template DNA. Upon close examination, this also seems the case in the chromatinized template, with certain positions inflexibly methylated/unmethylated and at odds with the surrounding linker/nucleosome patterning (Figure 1D). The authors should use K-mer analysis of methylated A's genome-wide to detect sequence bias in either the methyltransferase or sequencing platform.</p><p>2) It seems reasonable that the clustered data by NRL estimate (Figure 3) should correlate with existing measurements (i.e. MNase-seq). The authors should identify regions of the genome with strong enrichment for the seven clusters and compare this to nucleosome repeat length as can be estimated using conventional MNase measurements, i.e. the average distance between 5' mapping read positions across the genome (Valouev et al., 2011, Teif et al., 2012). Some agreement (for at least a few of these clusters with very regular nucleosomes) would strengthen the conclusions made by this approach, especially where there are irregular positioning patterns. Additionally, for these clusters the authors should display raw read alignment/methylation calls for SAMOSA at a few representative loci, where a sense of the raw data can be gleaned.</p><p>3) The comparisons of SAMOSA at different TF bound regions is likely influenced by the fraction of actually TF-bound molecules present in the original cellular sample. For example, CTCF is known to occupy it's strong motifs in the majority of cells, while few other factors have such regular binding/residency (Kelly et al., 2012 NomeSeq data at CTCF sites). It seems reasonable that some cluster fractions should scale with the enrichment for the factor (for at least CTCF and REST, the strong binding/nucleosome positioners), especially those associated with chromatin accessibility at the motif (i.e. A-accessible, HA-hyper-accessible). The authors should try to illustrate this, as well as representative read alignments/methylation calls at a few loci where these signals are prevalent.</p><p>4) The meta-plotted data seems noisy for most TFs profiled (Figure 4A-L) and the authors should show that their replicates agree with each other in terms of the relative size of clusters and at the metaplot level. Similarly, the data shown in Figure 5 should be broken into replicates. It is difficult to know to what extent the differences quoted are quantifiable/reproducible. For example, in panel A the reported deviation seems quite large around the median to make strong claims: e.g. &quot;In specific cases, we observed small effect shifts in the estimated median NRLs for specific domains-for example, a shift of ~5 bp (180 bp vs. 185 bp) in H3K9me3 chromatin with respect to random molecules.…&quot;. This should also apply to the analysis done in Figure 5B and C, where it is difficult to get a sense of reproducibility from cluster size and the heatmap of Odds ratio and q-values.</p><p>The use of mild MNase is presented as an advantage, but is it really necessary? Adding EcoGII to isolated nuclei may work as well as shown in the recent Stamatoyannopoulos paper in Science.</p><p>In Figure 5, controls are randomly chosen nucleosomes, but it would be interesting to see what unmarked nucleosomes show. For example, unmarked alpha-satellite should be dominated by highly regular arrays with a 171-bp repeat length present in higher-order repeats corresponding to active centromeres, which consist of nucleosomal complexes that lack Histone H3 (CENP-A instead). The authors speculate that satellite irregularity might result from dynamic restructuring by HP1, and this predicts that other (H3-containing) unmarked satellites that lack H3K9me3 and presumably lack HP1 will be in regular arrays.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59404.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the approach works well and promises to address important questions, but the current work does not yet take full advantage of the single molecule nature of the assay and as such falls a bit short compared to very related methods that have recently been published (the works cited in the manuscript, and recently published work from the Stamatoyannopoulos lab).

In preparing this revision, we have addressed all of the major comments of reviewers, save one suggesting generating a high-coverage K562 dataset covering e.g. the same CTCF site multiple times (which we discuss in detail below). Our response broadly spans three areas: (1) providing dditional data while acknowledging existing challenges for sequencing individual sites to high coverage; (2) arguing how our manuscript uniquely leverages SAMOSA’s single-molecule resolution to uncover novel biological patterns, and (3) actively addressing all reviewer questions regarding the reproducibility of our primary findings.</p><p>Additional data and the challenge of high-coverage single-molecule sequencing. We completely agree that generating long-read datasets that demonstrate high (i.e. 50X – 1000X) coverage of individual TF binding sites is a desirable goal! However, we feel it important to highlight a key difference between SAMOSA and Illumina-based techniques that makes studying individual sites at high-coverage a challenge to be tackled in a separate study. Illumina sequencing methods are compatible with strategies like hybrid-capture or bisulfite PCR to deeply interrogate specific epigenomic regions<sup>1,2</sup>. Conversely, SAMOSA (and, indeed, the recently published Fiberseq work of Stergachis et al<sup>3</sup>) relies on native detection of modifications on unmodified and unamplified single templates. While this has significant benefits (i.e. non-destructive modification detection; access to long chromatin templates), it also makes deep sequencing of individual sites in a human-sized genome costly. Our eventual goal with SAMOSA is to generate high-coverage, haplotype-resolved maps, which will likely require additional methods development to selectively enrich for sites of interest. As such, we feel that deeply sequencing e.g. the K562 epigenome is beyond-scope for this proof-of-concept manuscript. In agreement with this point, we note that the Stergachis et al. paper does <italic>not</italic> provide a high-coverage K562 epigenome (reported coverage of 3.7X) – the majority of their study centers on the much smaller <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (S2 cells). Still, to comply with the reviewers’ request for additional K562 SAMOSA data, we have sequenced additional experiments in the K562 cell line (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1). These shallowly-sequenced datasets further demonstrate the reproducibility of SAMOSA experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B), as well as the ability to tune SAMOSA fragment length distributions by altering MNase digestion conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Leveraging single-molecule SAMOSA data using novel analytical strategies. We have taken steps to clarify how our study uniquely leverages the single-molecule nature of our assay. The majority of this paper inherently relies on SAMOSA’s single-molecule resolution, as we use the unbiased leiden community detection algorithm<sup>4</sup> to define both genome-wide (from all sequenced molecules), and TF-centric clusters of single molecules on the basis of their respective m<sup>6</sup>dA methylation patterns. These analyses are only made possible by having access to individual sequenced templates, as opposed to population averages across genomic sites (i.e. Illumina data). Ultimately, we hope that the molecular and analytical methods outlined here provide a valuable jumping-off point for the broader application of long-read single-molecule footprinting to the study of gene regulation. In the revision, we specifically highlight this aspect of our study in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Our approach and associated analytical pipelines demonstrate the versatility of high-throughput single-molecule sequencing – namely the ability to cluster single-molecules in an unsupervised manner to uncover molecular states previously missed by short-read approaches. Our analytical approach bears many similarities to methods used in single-cell analysis, and indeed many of the technologies and concepts typically used for single-cell genomics<sup>5</sup> (e.g. clustering; trajectory analysis) will likely have value when applied to single-molecule epigenomic assays.”</p><p>Addressing questions of reproducibility across SAMOSA replicates, and validating the primary biological conclusions of our study. We recognize the need to more concretely demonstrate the reproducibility of our SAMOSA experiments and experimental findings. To this end, we have followed all of the remaining reviewers’ suggestions, including (i) adding supplementary figures faceted by biological replicates, (ii) validating the primary finding of our paper (heterogeneity of chromatin fibre structures, and enrichment for irregular fiber composition in constitutive heterochromatin) using data from Stergachis et al., and finally (iii) we have provided additional light sequencing data of a set of K562 SAMOSA libraries to demonstrate that SAMOSA signals are en masse reproducible, and can be used to profile longer chromatin fibres by tuning MNase digest conditions. Moreover, we have ensured that our revised manuscript has no broad biological claims beyond those firmly supported by our replicated analyses – namely, the finding that chromatin domains are comprised of many different fibre types, and that specific irregular or regular fibre types are differentially employed by specific chromatin domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of the claims made about the potential of the method are insufficiently supported by the data provided. It appears that additional data is required to support the conclusions made from SAMOSA with respect to existing chromatin information, such as signal differences as a function of transcription factor binding (see below). The authors need to fully address these points in order for this manuscript to be considered for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>In our primary submission, we strove to present proof-of-concept of the SAMOSA method while avoiding broad biological claims unfounded by our data. As you will see below, we have addressed the primary issues raised by reviewers, which largely pertain to the reproducibility of our replicates and major findings. Moreover, we have softened the tone of the manuscript in cases where reviewers disagreed with claims as stated. For example, we have removed text and figures concerning the coverage of SAMOSA libraries versus other approaches, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors should make an attempt to investigate where sequence bias influences a methylation call in their datasets. Clearly the pattern on the in vitro chromatinized template suggests that on average their methylated calls are correct.

Upon close examination, this also seems the case in the chromatinized template, with certain positions inflexibly methylated/unmethylated and at odds with the surrounding linker/nucleosome patterning (Figure 1D). The authors should use K-mer analysis of methylated A's genome-wide to detect sequence bias in either the methyltransferase or sequencing platform.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fantastic suggestion, and one that we have now included in our revised manuscript. To address this question, we have analyzed positive control methylation samples and negative controls from our array experiments and quantified interpulse duration (IPD) differences observed as a function of different <italic>k</italic>-mers (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Specifically, we examined distributions of normalized IPD values (before our methylation calling) of represented 10-mer sequences in both the negative and positive control. We binned the adenines in our template DNA by sequence context from 2 basepairs (bp) upstream to 7 bp downstream of the template adenine, the context previously found to significantly determine IPD values<sup>6</sup>. We then visualized the average IPD of individual 10-mer sequences as a heatmap for negative, combined, and positive controls. Briefly, we find that a portion of sequence contexts show incomplete methylation in our positive control, and that GATC motifs are constitutively methylated in unmethylated controls. Given that array DNA was propagated in <italic>Dam</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria (necessary due to synthetic lethality of <italic>Dam</italic><sup>-</sup>/<italic>RecA</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>E. coli</italic>), this finding is completely expected (and explains the ‘stripes’ seen in new Figure 1—figure supplement 6). These contexts also appear to reveal a slight sequence specificity of EcoGII, which appears to methylate A/T-rich contexts slightly less efficiently. We have added this figure to the manuscript and added associated text explaining these biases:</p><p>“These patterns were subtly influenced by the associated 10-mer context of sequenced bases, consistent with possible enzymatic biases, but also previous observations of sequence-influenced shifts in polymerase kinetics (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).”</p><p>Explicitly modeling the native kinetic differences by which the PacBio polymerase navigates modified and unmodified <italic>k</italic>-mers is a significant computational undertaking by itself; we hope that this type of <italic>k</italic>-mer stratification will ultimately enable more sophisticated analysis of relationships between sequence context and interpulse duration on the PacBio platform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It seems reasonable that the clustered data by NRL estimate (Figure 3) should correlate with existing measurements (i.e. MNase-seq).

Additionally, for these clusters the authors should display raw read alignment/methylation calls for SAMOSA at a few representative loci, where a sense of the raw data can be gleaned.</p></disp-quote><p>A major advantage of SAMOSA and similar approaches is that they capture nucleosomal patterning that is inherently obfuscated by mapping MNase fragment-ends or midpoints (due to both inherent fibre irregularity, or lack of consistent phase of regular fibres across many haplotypes). Still, we appreciate the need to validate the major conclusion of our proof-of-concept study, which is that constitutive heterochromatic domains harbor a mixture of short NRL fibres and irregular chromatin fibres, and that e.g. Polycomb-repressed domains are enriched for the longest NRL fibres. To do this, we have assessed the reproducibility of our principle biological claims in two ways. First, we have stratified our data by replicate, and can show that the relative cluster enrichment / depletion we see for each chromatin state is highly reproducible between replicates (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Second, we have sought out an orthogonal way to validate these findings, by reprocessing the recently published data of Stergachis et al., who use a completely different enzyme and set of reaction conditions to footprint K562 chromatin (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). We reprocessed data from the Stergachis et al. K562 dataset and clustered 2.5E5 molecules using our analytical pipeline. We find that molecules fall into five broad clusters (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A)—one irregular cluster (annotated as IR<sub>S</sub> for Irregular-Stergachis <italic>et al</italic>), and four regular clusters sorted by increasing estimated NRL. We then estimated the relative usage of these clusters across epigenomic domains as in our initial manuscript (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). Consistent with our initial findings, we find that H3K9me3 decorated chromatin is enriched for fibre-type IR<sub>S</sub> and the shortest NRL class of fibres. Additionally, we also find that this reanalysis confirms our finding that H3K27me3 domains harbor the longest NRLs. Taken together, this reanalysis serves as a powerful confirmation of our preliminary findings. Finally, given the low per-site coverage of our data, we believe that the single-molecule representations shown in our submission (i.e. individual molecules and associated signal; for example Figure 4M) are the most honest representation of our raw data—the alternative would be showing between 1 – 3 molecules covering a given site, which is such a low number of observations that readers may wrongly ascribe biological relevance to observed methylation patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The comparisons of SAMOSA at different TF bound regions is likely influenced by the fraction of actually TF-bound molecules present in the original cellular sample.

It seems reasonable that some cluster fractions should scale with the enrichment for the factor (for at least CTCF and REST, the strong binding/nucleosome positioners), especially those associated with chromatin accessibility at the motif (i.e. A-accessible, HA-hyper-accessible). The authors should try to illustrate this, as well as representative read alignments/methylation calls at a few loci where these signals are prevalent.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting analysis, and have promoted this panel to the main text (new Figure 5A). To the point of examining the relative enrichment / depletion of individual sites, we note that this analysis requires very high coverage of individual predicted binding sites. As generating high coverage of individual CTCF sites is beyond scope for this study, we did not include such an analysis in our original submission or revision but we agree that it will be interesting to pursue after e.g. target enrichment methods are well-optimized for unamplified PacBio sequencing libraries. Moreover, we have (as discussed below), carried out reproducibility analyses across our replicates to demonstrate that the clusters shown in Figure 4 and their respective enrichment across different TFs surveyed are reproducible (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We have tried to address this honestly in our manuscript in the following clause:</p><p>“While correlation of our replicates demonstrates the reproducibility and robustness of these findings (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), future experimental follow-up coupling our protocol with perturbed biological systems and deeper sequencing are necessary to quantitatively interrogate this model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The meta-plotted data seems noisy for most TFs profiled (Figure 4A-L) and the authors should show that their replicates agree with each other in terms of the relative size of clusters and at the metaplot level.

For example, in panel A the reported deviation seems quite large around the median to make strong claims: e.g. &quot;In specific cases, we observed small effect shifts in the estimated median NRLs for specific domains-for example, a shift of ~5 bp (180 bp vs. 185 bp) in H3K9me3 chromatin with respect to random molecules.…&quot;. This should also apply to the analysis done in Figure 5B and C, where it is difficult to get a sense of reproducibility from cluster size and the heatmap of Odds ratio and q-values.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention. We have repeated this analysis stratified by replicate and included these as Figure 5—figure supplement 1. This analysis firmly shows that our observed cluster sizes, patterns, and enrichment / depletion across the different TF binding sites surveyed here are reproducible. Regarding our description of the NRL deviations observed in our data, we agree that these deviations are quite large, and hence noted that any observed shifts are very small effects (i.e. not a ‘strong claim’ of effect). Regardless, the reproducibility of our NRL class enrichments across replicates (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), and the replication of these trends in a completely different dataset (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) sufficiently speak to the robustness of the biological claims made in this proof-of-concept paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of mild MNase is presented as an advantage, but is it really necessary? Adding EcoGII to isolated nuclei may work as well as shown in the recent Stamatoyannopoulos paper in Science.</p></disp-quote><p>As our reanalysis of Stergachis et al’s K562 data demonstrates, the reaction conditions for Fiberseq appear to enable footprinting of fibers in constitutive heterochromatin; modifying our existing SAMOSA workflow to include m<sup>6</sup>dA methylation before MNase digestion is an exciting idea that could be pursued in later studies. We note this in the revision as follows:</p><p>“Second, our approach involves methylating fibres following solubilization of oligonucleosomal fragments, and is thus unlikely to capture protein-DNA interactions weaker or more transient than the stable nucleosome-DNA interaction. Such transient interactions could be captured in future work by modifying the protocol to footprint nuclei prior to MNase-solubilization.”</p><p>At the same time, the use of mild MNase and solubilization <italic>is</italic> an advantage because it provides two orthogonal measures of chromatin structure. First, our molecules have 2 MNase-cleavages that footprint protein-DNA interactions (as shown in Figure 4A-G). Second, our footprinted fibres have m<sup>6</sup>dA signal that provides single-molecule nucleosome positioning information. In this way, our assay combines information captured by an assay like Array-seq<sup>7</sup> with methylation footprinting. In our revision, we also demonstrate that the MNase digestion in the SAMOSA protocol is tunable: we provide SAMOSA data for three additional digestion conditions, resulting in different fragment length distributions, while still maintaining the classical periodic patterning of m<sup>6</sup>dA modification signal seen in previous SAMOSA experiments (shown in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5, controls are randomly chosen nucleosomes, but it would be interesting to see what unmarked nucleosomes show.

The authors speculate that satellite irregularity might result from dynamic restructuring by HP1, and this predicts that other (H3-containing) unmarked satellites that lack H3K9me3 and presumably lack HP1 will be in regular arrays.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks to the reviewer for this insightful suggestion! To address this, we have stratified the ‘Satellite’ label into alpha-, beta-, and gamma-satellite sequences, and repeated our enrichment analysis across the 7 fibre types originally described in our manuscript. While alpha and beta satellite sequences are enriched for the irregular fibre type (which we speculate may in part be mediated by HP1-driven chromatin deformation), gamma satellite sequence is instead depleted for irregular fibres and enriched for long NRL regular fibres. Consistent with the reviewers’ astute observations, and the work of Kim et al., gamma-satellite is <italic>expected</italic> to be unmarked by H3K9me3<sup>8</sup>. Given that this strengthens our prior speculation that the irregular fibres we are observing could be due to HP1-mediated deformation of heterochromatin, we have added this analysis (new Figure 6—figure supplement 3) and associated text to the revision, as replicated below:</p><p>“Given the robustness of this finding, it is tempting to speculate that this irregularity may be linked to the dynamic restructuring of heterochromatic nucleosomes by factors like HP1<sup>9</sup>, which may promote phase-separation of heterochromatin. While stratification of analyzed satellite sequences into H3K9me3-decorated alpha / beta, and H3K9me3-free gamma satellite provides correlative support for this notion (Figure 6—figure supplement 3), future studies combining SAMOSA with cellular perturbation of heterochromatin-associated factors are necessary to directly address this possibility.”</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Krebs, A.
