pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, preferring PA14 over laboratory <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (OP50). Despite this natural attraction to PA14, prior PA14 exposure causes the worms to instead avoid PA14. This behavioral switch can happen quickly – even within the duration of the choice assay. We show that accurate assessment of the animals’ true first choice requires the use of a paralytic (azide) to trap the worms at their initial choice, preventing the switch from attraction to avoidance of PA14 within the assay period. We previously discovered that exposure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to 25°C plate-grown PA14 at 20°C for 24 hr not only leads to PA14 avoidance, but also to four generations of naïve progeny avoiding PA14, while other PA14 paradigms only cause P0 and/or F1 avoidance. We also showed that the transgenerational (P0-F4) epigenetic avoidance is mediated by P11, a small RNA produced by PA14. P11 is both necessary and sufficient for TEI of learned avoidance. P11 is highly expressed in our standard growth conditions (25°C on surfaces), but not in other conditions, suggesting that the reported failure to observe F2-F4 avoidance is likely due to the absence of P11 expression in PA14 in the experimenters’ growth conditions. Additionally, we tested ~35 genes for involvement in TEI of learned pathogen avoidance. The conservation of multiple components of this sRNA TEI mechanism across <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and in multiple <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species suggests that this TEI behavior is likely to be physiologically important in wild conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transgenerational</kwd><kwd>inheritance</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>small RNA</kwd><kwd>RNA interference</kwd><kwd>sid-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1GM119167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Coleen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ford Foundation Fellowships</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seto</surname><given-names>Renee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Rebecca S</given-names></name><name><surname>Seto</surname><given-names>Renee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deviating from established protocols is the most likely reason why Gainey et al.

About a third of these species are of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>), and many of those <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species are pathogenic to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Therefore, the development of multiple strategies to detect and avoid these pathogens that act at different timescales is critical for <italic>C. elegans’</italic> fitness and survival.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> and a clinical isolate of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, PA14, have been studied as a model of host–pathogen interactions for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). PA14 kills <italic>C. elegans</italic> through several distinct mechanisms (e.g. slow and fast killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahajan-Miklos et al., 1999</xref>]) and typically <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults may only survive for a few days on PA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tan et al., 1999</xref>), cutting its reproductive period short. <italic>C. elegans’</italic> survival depends on the expression of antimicrobial genes that are induced downstream of innate immune signals in response to PA14 exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Troemel et al., 2006</xref>) and changes to developmental rates and decisions that increase the odds of the next generation’s survival.</p><p>In addition to the activation of pathogen survival genes and effects on reproduction and development, <italic>C. elegans</italic> also changes its behavior in the presence of PA14. Despite its potential to kill <italic>C. elegans,</italic> worms are initially attracted to PA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), because <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot distinguish pathogenic from nonpathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species that may serve as nutritious food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>). Specific mechanisms to detect, leave, and avoid PA14 are activated via secreted bacterial metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prakash et al., 2021</xref>) or through internal signals that indicate illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melo and Ruvkun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh and Aballay, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Another mechanism of learned avoidance can be activated upon exposure to pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and is mediated by specific bacterial small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>). These distinct avoidance pathways are triggered by specific molecular cues, are independently regulated, and act on different timescales. Specifically, PA14 metabolites induce a distinct, ASJ-mediated avoidance pathway in P0s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>); 4 hr of PA14 exposure induces avoidance directly in the worms and increased attraction in the F1s, while 8 hr of treatment can induce F1 avoidance but does not persist beyond F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), and specific bacterial small RNAs from PA14 as well as from wild <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species induce avoidance after 24 hr of treatment that is maintained through four generations of progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>). Through extensive mutant analyses, we have found that this transgenerational avoidance mechanism requires a wide range of machinery, including RNA interference components, germline components, the Cer1 Ty3 Gypsy retrotransposon, and neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Here, we discuss the molecular conditions that are necessary to induce the bacterial small RNA-induced pathway of transgenerationally inherited learned avoidance behavior. Our results suggest that one major difference in the execution of the assay itself, the presence or absence of the paralytic sodium azide, may account for some reported discrepancies in naïve and learned chemotaxis results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gainey et al., 2024</xref>). Perhaps more importantly, PA14 must be grown under conditions that induce the expression of the small RNA, P11, which is necessary and sufficient for transgenerational inheritance of learned pathogen avoidance; P11 regulates nitrogen fixation in PA14, and these conditions promote biofilm formation and thus may be important signals for <italic>C. elegans</italic> to detect the pathogen. These two factors, P11 expression and azide presence in the assay, are critical in obtaining consistent naïve and learned avoidance results. Together with the identification of genes and pathways that are involved, we are beginning to understand the molecular requirements for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of learned avoidance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Choice assays require a paralytic to accurately capture first choice</title><p>Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> has several different mechanisms of pathogen avoidance that can be detected via different signals (olfactory cues, gustatory cues, illness-induced signals, bacterial metabolites, bacterial RNAs, etc.), pathogen avoidance behavior has been tested using several different assays (as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu and Zhang, 2020</xref>). Among these are variations on the bacterial choice assay, which is modeled on standard chemotaxis choice assays (two small bacterial spots with azide to trap worms at their first choice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee and Mylonakis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>), variations on single-worm head-turning assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ha et al., 2010</xref>), and the leaving assay (PA14 spot in middle of plate, no other bacteria, no azide, and monitored over long periods for worms leaving the spot, e.g. 8–24 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horspool and Chang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh and Aballay, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wolfe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Filipowicz et al., 2022</xref>). Each assay measures responses on a specific timescale; e.g., the two-bacteria choice assay measures initial preference of a population of animals over an hour, the head-turning assay measures immediate preference of individual animals, and the leaving assay (which is often performed overnight) measures final preference over many hours of PA14 exposure. Therefore, the conditions used in one assay might not be appropriate for all assays.</p><p>The standard bacterial choice assay is performed on plates, with two small spots of bacteria (here, PA14 and OP50) separated by several centimeters that the worms must traverse in response to olfactory cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); monitoring the accumulation of worms as they become paralyzed with the anesthetic sodium azide at each bacterial spot allows the experimenter to accurately assess the worm’s first choice. Studies by many groups, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Filipowicz et al., 2022</xref>, and others over the past two decades have previously demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> are initially attracted to PA14 without prior exposure to the pathogen (‘naïve’) but switch their behavior to avoidance of PA14 following exposure to PA14. Our lab has also consistently replicated those naïve attraction and learned avoidance results: in fact, we see that the mild naïve attraction to PA14 is fairly consistent between individual plates and individual replicates over many experiments across several studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>). This initial naïve attraction to PA14 serves as a necessary baseline for all further experiments. That is, if no naïve attraction to PA14 is observed and instead the worms already avoid PA14 prior to PA14 exposure, it might be difficult to observe any additional learned avoidance of PA14 after training. Failure to observe naïve attraction to PA14 might also suggest that the experimenters’ assay conditions are not the same as those used by previous groups. A recent study failed to consistently observe this initial naïve avoidance of PA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gainey et al., 2024</xref>); therefore, we investigated possible origins of this deviation in these results from other groups’ previously published results.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The omission of the paralytic sodium azide from choice assays has significant effects on naïve choice assays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of PA14 and worm growth conditions, worm training, and choice assay parameters.

We note that these no-azide results are almost identical to the results that Gainey et al. reported for their naive P0s, while the +azide results are similar to our previously published naïve data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), as well as published data from other labs.</p><p>To better understand the source of the discrepancy with the Gainey et al. results, we first investigated the worms’ behavior at 4°C after the hour of the assay at room temperature; while we do see that the worms continue to move (4°C does not immediately paralyze worms), in fact, the final choice index of the population was already reached at the end of the room temperature period <italic>before</italic> they were placed in the cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, t=0); therefore, the discrepancy in attraction to/avoidance of PA14 seems to have occurred during the initial part of the assay, when the worms were choosing for 1 hr at room temperature without azide. This may be particularly relevant for the Gainey et al. study, as they reportedly moved the worms at different times (‘<italic>These no-azide assay plates were moved to 4°C after 30–60</italic> min’), which likely induced further variance. We also observed worms still traveling away from the PA14 spot at 1 hr, further underscoring the point that performing the assay without azide fails to trap the worms at their first choice, even if the worms are transferred to 4°C, because the worms have already made the switch from attraction to avoidance by that point.</p><p>The simplest interpretation of the discrepancy between the ±azide assay conditions is that the worms are initially attracted to and choose PA14; in the presence of azide, the worms remain at this first-choice spot, but over the course of an hour-long choice assay in the absence of azide, the worms learn to avoid PA14 and migrate to the OP50 spot. This phenomenon was already carefully demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>, with a time-course assay: in the absence of azide to trap the worms, the worms are initially attracted to PA14, but by 45 min the worms show no preference for PA14, and by 1 hr the worms instead avoid PA14 – i.e., within the time of the hour-long assay, in the absence of azide to trap the worms at their first choice, they learn to avoid PA14. Under the no-azide assay conditions, it would be difficult to observe any additional learned avoidance that is the result of training, since the learned preference for OP50 (PA14) is already very high when the worms have been allowed to change from their first choice to their second choice. Therefore, the simplest interpretation is that one cannot accurately measure naïve preference in the absence of azide, and one cannot subsequently properly assess subsequent learned avoidance after training without azide. It is notable that the overwhelming majority of Gainey et al.’s experiments were done without azide; because a third party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>) already showed that there is a substantial difference when no azide is used, as we have shown here, Gainey et al.’s no-azide data cannot be compared with assays done with azide, including all of our work.</p><p>We repeated this ±azide preference assay with another <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> pathogen, <italic>P. fluorescens 15</italic> (PF15), that we have also found to induce transgenerational avoidance for five generations via small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>) and observed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). That is, the preference for PF15 is similar to worms’ preference for PA14 over OP50, but in the absence of azide, the worms learn to avoid PF15, as they did with PA14. Therefore, we conclude that the inclusion of azide in the choice assay is necessary to properly assess the worms’ first choice; in the absence of azide, the worms’ naïve choice is not being measured, so it cannot be used to then compare with post-training behavior to assess learned or inherited avoidance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transgenerational inheritance of learned avoidance is consistent and distinct from other avoidance paradigms</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> uses many different environmental cues to inform its behavioral decisions; in fact, avoidance of PA14 can be induced by bacterial metabolites, by olfactory cues, by gustatory cues, and by innate immunity pathways.

In fact, the average level of avoidance induced by <italic>E. coli</italic>-P11 training is consistent in P0 and F2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), and with the F2 avoidance levels induced by PA14 training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), consistent with our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>).

Therefore, it appears that there are PA14 growth conditions that can induce some mechanisms of P0 and F1 avoidance, but will not induce transgenerational avoidance, because no P11 is expressed in PA14 under those conditions.</p><p>To more carefully address this hypothesis, we examined the levels of P11 sRNA from PA14 grown at 25°C on plates, 15°C on plates, and 37°C in liquid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>). When comparing 25°C plates with 15°C plates, we observed a 6.8-fold decrease in P11 levels at the lower temperature, and a 13.7-fold decrease in P11 when PA14 is grown in liquid rather than on plates, even at high temperatures. Therefore, it is clear that the growth of PA14 in non-25°C/plate-grown conditions may fail to elicit a P11-mediated avoidance response, because no P11 is expressed in PA14 under those conditions. Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gainey et al., 2024</xref>, did not verify P11 expression in their bacterial cultures, it is not surprising that they also failed to observe P11-induced avoidance in the F2 generation in those experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TEI of learned avoidance requires components of RNA processing pathways</title><p>Previously, we showed that many components of small RNA uptake, RNA interference, small RNA processing pathways, and the germline are necessary for transgenerational inheritance of learned avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>).

Switching behavioral responses from attraction to avoidance for a few generations may also increase the survival of the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore et al., 2019</xref>) by reducing the chances of interactions with the pathogens. Of the many cues that induce avoidance, only the bacterial small RNA pathway induces transgenerational inheritance of learned pathogen avoidance, and this pathway is molecularly distinct from other pathways that induce avoidance only in the P0 or F1 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>). That is, if PA14 is grown under conditions in which P11 is <italic>not</italic> expressed, the bacteria may still induce P0 and even F1 avoidance due to the presence of olfactory, metabolite, and other cues, but avoidance in the F2 generation and beyond will be absent. Therefore, if F2 avoidance is not observed, it might be due to the lack of P11 expression in those conditions, and conversely, avoidance in the P0 and F1 conditions should not be misconstrued as positive evidence of P11 expression.</p><p>P11 sRNA is a regulator of PA14’s nitrogen assimilation operon, which includes nitrite and nitrate reductases (NirB, NirD, and NasC) that control the production of ammonium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marogi et al., 2024</xref>). Nitrogen assimilation appears to be critical for growth on surfaces at specific temperatures, including inside its host, <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marogi et al., 2024</xref>). Nitrogen assimilation is an energetically costly process, and PA14 tightly regulates this operon via control of the P11 expression. Interestingly, loss of P11 reduces ammonia production and thus reduces <italic>C. elegans’</italic> chemoattraction to PA14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marogi et al., 2024</xref>); therefore, differences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior when treated with PA14 vs ΔP11-PA14 mutants can be due to both the loss of the P11 small RNA itself and also due to the loss of ammonia production. Therefore, any growth conditions that result in disruption of P11 expression might also contribute to decreases in naïve attraction that Gainey et al. observed, i.e., if PA14 is grown under conditions where P11 sRNA is not expressed, not only would training on this bacteria not induce transgenerational inheritance of avoidance due to the lack of P11 signal, but these conditions might also decrease <italic>C. elegans’</italic> naïve attraction to this PA14, further reducing behavioral differences between naïve and trained chemotaxis indices. Thus, growth conditions that decrease P11 expression might have a large effect on both naïve and trained chemotaxis choice indices, and thus on the interpretation of these effects. Because P11 sRNA is both necessary and sufficient for the transgenerational inheritance of pathogen avoidance, and its expression level is acutely sensitive to both temperature and physical environmental conditions, it would be important to confirm P11 expression levels (e.g. via qPCR) in PA14 rather than assuming that P11 is constitutively expressed, particularly when attempting to report the lack of an F2 effect. Unfortunately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gainey et al., 2024</xref> never carried out any tests of P11 sRNA in PA14, so it is impossible to now know how the PA14 growth conditions in any of their experiments might have affected P11 levels and subsequent <italic>C. elegans</italic> responses. Additionally, learned avoidance in the P0 and F1 generations has no relationship to the P11 pathway and therefore cannot be used as confirmation of P11 expression.</p><p>In addition to P11, we also previously found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> ingestion and processing of specific bacterial small RNAs produced by <italic>P. vranovensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>) and PF15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>) induce pathogen avoidance that lasts through the F4 generation. These specific small RNAs are Pv1 and Pfs1 (from <italic>P. vranovensis</italic> and PF15, respectively), and they each contain a stretch of either 17 (P11) or 16 (Pv1, Pfs1) nucleotides in predicted stem loops that are a perfect match to specific exons of the gene <italic>maco-1</italic> (P11, Pv1) or <italic>vab-1</italic> (Pfs1), which are then downregulated upon treatment with these pathogenic bacteria or these small RNAs.

The downregulation of <italic>vab-1</italic> upon PF15 or Pfs1 sRNA treatment also results in the downregulation of <italic>maco-1</italic> expression levels (as shown by RNA-seq in P0 mothers), suggesting that <italic>vab-1</italic> is upstream of <italic>maco-1</italic>; qPCR confirmed that <italic>maco-1</italic> is downregulated in the F2 generation of <italic>E. coli</italic>-Pfs1-trained mothers as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>). Therefore, the transgenerational bacterial small RNA–<italic>C. elegans</italic> avoidance mechanism induced by at least three different <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species through three different small RNAs requires the downregulation of <italic>maco-1</italic>, which results in <italic>daf-7</italic> changes in the ASI; perfect matches between bacterial small RNAs and their <italic>C. elegans</italic> target genes are required for the F2–F4 heritable shift from attraction to avoidance. Thus, the role of <italic>maco-1</italic> in this pathway has been confirmed through multiple avenues of experimentation.</p><p>Through extensive mutant analyses (testing of almost 40 mutants over the course of six studies), we have found that this sRNA mechanism of transgenerational inheritance of learned pathogen avoidance requires a wide range of machinery involved in bacterial small RNA uptake, RNA processing, signaling, and neuronal behavioral execution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These genes include RNA interference components, Argonautes, and RNA-dependent polymerases; germline components such as P-granule, piRNA components, COMPASS, and chromatin modifiers; the Cer1 Ty3 Gypsy retrotransposon; and neuronal genes (<italic>maco-1</italic>/macoilin, <italic>vab-1/</italic>Ephrin receptor, <italic>vab-2</italic>/Ephrin) as well as the <italic>daf-7</italic>/TGF-beta ligand in the ASI neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also ruled out several genes that function in other forms of pathogen avoidance, such as imprinting, innate immunity signaling, microRNA, and viral RNAi processors, and other transposable elements, further distinguishing the bacterial small RNA TEI pathway from other avoidance mechanisms that may only function in the P0 or F1 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Through tissue-specific rescue experiments, we also showed that <italic>dcr-1</italic> functions in the intestine and <italic>prg-1</italic> is necessary in the germline for small RNA-mediated learned pathogen avoidance. Our studies of other bacterial species have identified not only additional bacterial small RNAs that are ‘read’ by <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sengupta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>), but also have identified additional <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene targets that function in the pathway (e.g. <italic>vab-1</italic>, which regulates <italic>maco-1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seto et al., 2025</xref>). It should be noted that in each of these mutant experiments, wild-type worms were tested as controls; therefore, our wild-type naïve attraction and learned avoidance results have been replicated many times over the course of these six studies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we have investigated two experimental factors that might affect investigators’ interpretation of PA14 training-induced avoidance choice assays: the expression of P11 sRNA in PA14 and proper execution of the choice assay itself. It would be incorrect to assume that because F2 avoidance is not demonstrated under all PA14 growth conditions that ‘<italic>the published model is unlikely to be relevant in a natural environment</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gainey et al., 2024</xref>). Instead, our results suggest the opposite: that the worms’ ability to interpret P11 expression is due to P11’s importance in regulating nitrogen fixation under biofilm-inducing conditions that also induce a pathogenic state that is important for <italic>C. elegans</italic> to remember over several generations. <italic>C. elegans</italic> appears to have evolved a mechanism to use P11 and other specific small RNAs as biomarkers of future infection, as the presence of those specific small RNAs correlates well with pathogenesis – and the specific small RNA detected by <italic>C. elegans</italic> in each case might be tightly correlated with the pathogenic potential of that particular <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species. Furthermore, the fact that we found that other <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species, including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> from the worm’s microbiota, use the same bacterial sRNA/<italic>C. elegans</italic> target gene mechanism indicates that this natural example of trans-kingdom signaling and transgenerational avoidance is highly conserved. In those bacteria, the key small RNAs appear to be constitutively expressed, and thus even more likely to be encountered by <italic>C. elegans</italic> upon ingestion. Together, these data suggest that the transgenerational inheritance of small RNA-induced learned bacterial avoidance is likely to be widespread in the wild, indicating its likely importance as a mechanism to promote long-term survival of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in its natural habitat.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General worm maintenance</title><p>Worm strains were maintained at 20°C on high growth medium (HG) plates (3 g/L NaCl, 20 g/L bacto-peptone, 30 g/L bacto-agar in distilled water, with 4 mL/L cholesterol [5 mg/mL in ethanol], 1 mL/L 1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mL/L 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 25 mL/L 1 M potassium phosphate buffer [pH 6.0] added to molten agar after autoclaving) on OP50 using standard methods.

The authors test the impact of procedural alterations made in another study, by Gainey et al., which claimed that transgenerational inheritance in this paradigm lacks robustness, despite this observation having been reported in multiple papers from the Murphy lab. The authors of the present study show that by following a non-standard avoidance protocol, Gainey et al. likely biased their measurements in a way that made it hard to observe learned avoidance. The authors also highlight the importance of bacterial growth conditions, showing that expression of the trigger molecule, the bacterial P11 RNA, which is necessary and sufficient to drive the transgenerational inheritance of the avoidance phenotype, is influenced by temperature. As expression of P11 was not verified by Gainey et al., this provides another explanation for the inability to observe transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Together, the authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> and powerful arguments that the original phenomenon is robust and that it can be reproduced in the Murphy lab by following their original protocol precisely, including the use of azide to immobilize the worms at the food source. Overall, this study not only provides guidance for investigators in this experimental paradigm, but it also provides additional understanding of the differences between naïve preference, learned preference, and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The present study is therefore of broad interest to anyone studying genetics, epigenetics, or learned behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105673.2.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Kaletsky et al is a response to a paper recently published by Craig Hunter's group (Gainey et al 2024). The Murphy lab has previously shown that learned avoidance of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to PA14 can be transmitted through four generations. In a series of detailed studies, they defined the mechanism of this transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI), identifying both PA14 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> factors required for this effect (Moore et al., 2019, Kaletsky et al., 2020; Moore et al., 2021). PA14 produces a small RNA, P11, that is necessary and sufficient for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of avoidance behaviour in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In the worm, P11 decreases maco-1 expression, which in turn regulates daf-7.</p><p>In the study by Gainey et al (eLife 2024), the authors report their attempt at replicating the original findings of the Murphy lab using a modified experimental setup. The Gainey study observed avoidance of PA14 and upregulation of daf-7::GFP in the F1 progeny of trained parents, but not in subsequent generations. Importantly, although they examined a number of different deviations of the protocol, they did not repeat the original experiment using the exact protocol outlined in the Moore or Kaletsky papers. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that &quot;this example of TEI is insufficiently robust for experimental investigations&quot;.</p><p>The manuscript by Kaletsky et al. attempts to provide an explanation as to why Gainey et al., were unable to observe transgenerational avoidance of PA14. They identify two discrepancies in the methodology used between the two studies and examine the possible impacts of these.</p><p>One of the primary differences in protocols between the two papers is how avoidance is measured. The Murphy group uses the traditional method of adding azide to bacterial spots on the choice plates to trap worms once they have come close to the food spot. The animals are on the plate for 1 hour but most have likely been immobilized before this time point. Gainey et al. omit the azide and instead shift animals to 4C after 30-60 minutes of exposure to immobilize the worms for counting. Kaletsky et al show that the choice of assay has a significant impact on measuring attraction and avoidance.</p><p>While Gainey et al., assert that the addition of azide had no discernable effect on the choice assay results, these data are not shown in their paper. Kaletsky et al. test these conditions head-to-head with the same 1 hour exposure time, showing that with azide, the initial response to PA14 in untrained worms is attraction. By contrast, in the absence of azide, when cold temperature is used to immobilize the worms , the response recorded is aversion to PA14. The choice assay generated by Kaletsky et al without azide is consistent with the choice assays in untrained worms shown in the Gainey paper, demonstrating that this is likely one factor that contributed to the different outcomes reported in the Gainey paper.</p><p>Kaletsky et al. propose that learned aversion to PA14 may be occurring within the 1-hour exposure time when worms are not trapped in their initial decision with the use of azide. This is consistent with previous findings from another group (Ooi and Prahlad 2017), showing that 45 minutes of exposure is sufficient to overcome the attraction to PA14 and shift to avoidance of PA14. Importantly, the Gainey paper notes exposure times between 30 and 60 minutes before shifting worms to 4C to count, this window may have generated additional variability between assays.</p><p>The second possibility explored by Kaletsky et al. is that the expression of P11 differed between the studies. Because P11 is required for TEI, differences in P11 expression is a reasonable explanation for different observations between studies. Unfortunately, in the Gainey study, P11 levels were not measured; it is therefore not possible to know whether low or absent levels of P11 explain the inability to observe TEI. Nevertheless, Kaletsky et al. test the potential for changes in one growth condition, temperature, to influence the production P11. Indeed, the expression of P11 differs in PA14 grown at different growth temperatures, providing an additional explanation for the discrepancies.</p><p>While it is possible that temperature is the culprit, it may be another culture condition or media component suppressing P11 expression. Nevertheless, the fact that expression of P11 can so easily be modified demonstrates that P11 expression is not immune to differences in culture conditions. Given its role in nitrogen fixation, I would be surprised if it was not regulated by environmental conditions. Differences in iron content between media batches are notorious for altering bacteria phenotypes. Although outside the scope of this study, with the connection to biofilm formation, I would be curious if iron levels had an impact on P11 expression. All in all, the data highlight the fact that P11 levels should be measured if TEI is not seen.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent study that has provided additional understanding of the difference between naïve preference and TEI and provides guidance for investigators in replicating TEI experiments. The manuscript is very well written and provides additional understanding regarding the replication of TEI in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript provides an important discussion about differences in methodology and how they might reflect specific biology. Many examples of experimental deviations that have large impacts have simple biological explanations. I believe the authors have done an excellent job making this point.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>None noted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105673.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In addition to the study by Kaletsky et al.

From the Hunter lab publication, the authors tried to eliminate genetic drift of the pathogenic bacterial strains and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as well as several experimental conditions, including assay temperature conditions and the effect of light.</p><p>The papers (Moore et al. 2019, Kaletsky et al. 2020, Moore et al. 2021 and Sengupta et al. 2024) that the Gainey et al. manuscript brings into question discovered that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> can produce a small RNA (sRNA), P11, that is necessary and sufficient for pathogen avoidance of the future generation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (up to F4 generation). The Gainey et al. manuscript does not assess the status of P11 production in their work.</p><p>Here, the Murphy group has made several new discoveries that highlight the differences with the work performed in the Hunter lab. One, the assay used to test attraction and avoidance of <italic>C. elegans</italic> for pathogenic bacteria differs amongst the two groups. In the Murphy lab papers, and many others in this field, the assay is established whereby worms can decide between spots of non-pathogenic bacteria (<italic>E. coli</italic>) or pathogenic (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) on a single plate separated by a few centimeters. Also included in each spot is an aliquot of NaN3 to freeze the animals upon entry into their first bacterial choice. <italic>C. elegans</italic> will initially choose the pathogenic bacteria as its first choice and then learn to avoid the pathogenic spot thereafter. Therefore, establishing this first baseline attraction point is essential for determining future avoidance events. The Hunter lab did not use NaN3 and instead relied upon moving plates to 4°C to slow the worm's movements to count the population. Furthermore, the Hunter lab allowed the &quot;choice&quot; to proceed for an hour before moving to 4°C, making capture of the initial attraction phase of the choice assay difficult to discern since the worms could move freely from their initial choice due to the lack of the paralyzing NaN3.</p><p>The second major advance that the Murphy group has found is that the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> prior to being used for the choice assay is critical. Growth on plates at 25°C, but not 20°C on plates or in liquid at 37°C, can produce the transgenerational inheritance of pathogen avoidance. Interestingly, P11 is only produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at 25°C grown on plates. The Hunter group grew the Pseudomonas bacteria at 37°C in liquid with gentle shaking and then spotted onto assay plates followed by growth for 2 days at 25°C and then equilibrated to room temperature before the choice assay. The Hunter lab did not check the status of P11 production in any of their experiments.</p><p>The results from the Murphy group are solid and they go on to find genetic requirements in <italic>C. elegans</italic> required for the transgenerational response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and P11. Furthermore, they repeat their results with additional members of the Pseudomonas clade and find the same transgenerational avoidance response and new sRNAs responsible for the avoidance response to the newly tested Pseudomonas members.</p><p>Overall, the discrepancies between the Hunter work and the numerous papers for the Murphy group would tend to complicate this area of research. However, this eLife paper plainly illustrates the straightforward nature of the experimental setup and reconfirms the necessary and sufficient nature of P11 in orchestrating the multigenerational response to pathogenic Pseudomonas. It appears that ensuring the production of P11 from the Pseudomonas culture and ensuring that the assay captures the initial bacterial choice are essential to observe the transgenerational inheritance of the avoidance phenotype.</p></body></sub-article></article>
