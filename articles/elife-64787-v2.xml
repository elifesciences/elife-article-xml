implicated in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes via its ability to support release of ATP and other cellular metabolites for local intercellular signaling. However, to date, there has been no direct demonstration of large molecule permeation via the Panx1 channel itself, and thus the permselectivity of Panx1 for different molecules remains unknown. To address this, we expressed, purified, and reconstituted Panx1 into proteoliposomes and demonstrated that channel activation by caspase cleavage yields a dye-permeable pore that favors flux of anionic, large-molecule permeants (up to ~1 kDa). Large cationic molecules can also permeate the channel, albeit at a much lower rate. We further show that Panx1 channels provide a molecular pathway for flux of ATP and other anionic (glutamate) and cationic signaling metabolites (spermidine). These results verify large molecule permeation directly through caspase-activated Panx1 channels that can support their many physiological roles.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pannexin 1 (Panx1) is a widely expressed homo-heptameric membrane channel that plays a critical role in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Among others, this includes cell clearance after apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poon et al., 2014</xref>), blood pressure regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Good et al., 2018a</xref>), stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargiotas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Good et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thompson, 2015</xref>), and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weaver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Individual Panx1 subunits consist of a four-transmembrane α-helical bundle with a cytoplasmic loop between TM2 and TM3; the N- and C-termini also reside on the cytoplasmic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Penuela et al., 2013</xref>). These channels are broadly similar to a subset of mammalian large-pore ion channels that include connexin gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panchin et al., 2000</xref>), calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siebert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>), and SWELL1 (LRRC8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abascal and Zardoya, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>). Despite a conserved subunit topology, recent cryoEM structures revealed that these different channels exist in a variety of oligomeric states (from hexameric to undecameric) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>). Of interest here, activation of these channels has been associated with both ionic current and large molecule permeation. In particular, channel activation is associated with release of metabolites (often ATP) that are critical for their roles in intercellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lutter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siebert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taruno, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the two decades since their discovery, much has been learned about the functional properties of Panx1 channels. Panx1 ionic currents have occasionally been detected under unstimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>), but that basal activity does not appear to be associated with large molecule permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, transmembrane permeation of large fluorescent dyes and ATP occurs when Panx1 is activated by various mechanisms (e.g., stretch, elevated external K<sup>+</sup>, ionotropic and metabotropic receptor signaling, and caspase-mediated cleavage at a C-terminal site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iglesias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silverman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weilinger et al., 2016</xref>). Among these, caspase-mediated activation is a well-characterized mechanism in which cleavage of the channel C-tails, as occurs during apoptosis or pyroptosis, is accompanied by uptake of dyes indicative of cell death (e.g., Yo-Pro-1 and To-Pro-3) and release of ATP and UTP that serve as ‘find-me’ signals to direct phagocytic clearance of cell corpses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, Panx1 cleavage elicits efflux of additional metabolites from apoptotic cells, which function as local ‘good-bye’ signals with anti-inflammatory, wound healing, and cell proliferative actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, all studies to date have been performed using intact cells. Therefore, this previous work does not demonstrate that large molecule permeation occurs directly via the channel itself or exclude a secondary release mechanism. Moreover, recently available Panx1 channel structures from both intact (inactive) and caspase-cleaved (activated) channels reveal a central pore with an extracellular constriction that has a diameter of ~9 Å, which would appear to be too small to enable large molecule permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the ability of caspase-activated Panx1 to support metabolite release remains uncertain.</p><p>In this study, we developed a proteoliposome system for reconstitution of purified Panx1 and channel activation by caspase-mediated cleavage. By combining lipid bilayer electrophysiology, flow cytometry, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and radioactive metabolite uptake assays, we characterized the large molecule permeation properties of cleavage-activated Panx1.

These currents were blocked by the Panx1 inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX). In addition, and also similar to hPANX1, single fPanx1 channels were silent in excised inside-out patches until activated by Casp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>); the cleavage-activated channels were inhibited by CBX and displayed a unitary conductance of 91.4 ± 13.5 pS (N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>).

Prior to application of caspase, large ‘flickery’ currents were occasionally observed at extreme potentials (e.g., +140 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and this often signified successful incorporation of fPanx1 into the bilayer. However, before caspase addition, fPanx1 channel activity was not observed at physiological potentials, even in a bath solution containing 200 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). After caspase addition, channel currents with discrete openings and closings became apparent across a wide range of physiological voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>); this activity was not seen when caspase was applied to plain lipid bilayers (i.e., with no channel added; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), indicating that measured currents reflected cleavage activation of the bilayer-incorporated fPanx1 channels.</p><p>The properties of caspase-activated fPanx1 channels in bilayers were similar, but not identical, to those of heterologously expressed recombinant fPanx1 channels recorded in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). The individual bilayers usually included multiple active channels that presented with either of two distinct conductance levels: one set had a unitary conductance of ~100 pS, similar to that recorded in mammalian cells, and the second displayed a larger unitary conductance of ~189 pS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). For both, the open channel I-V relationships were approximately ohmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), unlike the outwardly-rectifying single channel conductance observed for recombinant caspase-activated Panx1 in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>). These differences may be due to species variants and/or the fact that the bilayer recordings were obtained in symmetrical solutions across a non-native membrane composed of non-physiological lipids (e.g., without cholesterol, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), etc.). Nevertheless, the purified fPanx1 channel is clearly activated by caspase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Panx1 forms a dye permeable pore</title><p>Caspase-mediated activation of Panx1 is associated with transmembrane flux of various metabolites and fluorescent dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, all previous experiments have been performed with Panx1 expressed in cells, either endogenously or heterologously. Therefore, a secondary mechanism of Panx1-dependent large molecule flux could not be excluded. To address this directly, we tested whether large molecule permeation can occur upon caspase cleavage-based activation of fPanx1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes (containing phosphatidylcholine, total brain lipid extract, cholesterol, and PIP<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>In a first set of studies, we examined whether caspase-cleaved fPanx1 is capable of forming a dye permeable pore. After overnight treatment with Casp3 (or buffer alone), liposomes were incubated with the anionic fluorescent dye, Sulforhodamine B (SR-B), and eluted through G25 spin columns for analysis on a fluorescence plate reader. Uptake of SR-B into liposomes was observed only when they contained fPanx1 and were treated with caspase. In addition, dye uptake was inhibited when caspase-treated fPanx1-containing proteoliposomes were treated with CBX before and during the dye incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To quantify this dye uptake, and verify that the dye was indeed associated with proteoliposomes containing fPanx1-GFP, we analyzed SR-B uptake in Casp3-treated and control proteoliposomes by ImageStream flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As depicted in the representative images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), SR-B was only observed in proteoliposomes that were treated with Casp3. A high GFP signal was present in the proteoliposomes that were not exposed to caspase, verifying the presence of GFP-tagged fPanx1 in those proteoliposomes that did not accumulate SR-B. Normalized frequency histograms of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for GFP and SR-B quantify results from this exemplar experiment. Compared to untreated proteoliposomes, a larger fraction of Casp3-treated proteoliposomes contained SR-B (83.6% vs. 20.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and at ~10-fold higher MFI levels. We found a concomitant, albeit modest, leftward shift in the GFP signal after caspase treatment, reflecting cleavage of the outward-facing fPanx1 C-tail (exposed to caspase) and the associated removal of the C-terminal GFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); the retained GFP signal in the caspase-treated proteoliposomes may reflect uncut channels or channels with their GFP-tagged C-tails oriented into the proteoliposome. In multiple independent experiments and proteoliposome preparations, Casp3 treatment of fPanx1 proteoliposomes resulted in a decrease in GFP signal and a concomitant increase in SR-B signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that caspase-cleaved fPanx1 channels generate a pore that is large enough for permeation of the SR-B dye.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dye uptake in caspase-treated <italic>Xenopus</italic> Pannexin 1 (fPanx1)-containing proteoliposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proteoliposomes containing fPanx1were incubated overnight with recombinant Caspase-3 (Casp3) and for 3 hr with sulforhodamine B (SR-B) dye prior to analysis by ImageStream flow cytometry.

Likewise, SR-B fluorescence was unaffected following Casp3 application in particles that were devoid of GFP fluorescence, likely representing liposomes that did not incorporate any fPanx1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>red</italic>). In other controls, SR-B fluorescence was retained in liposomes, either with or without GFP fluorescence (i.e., with or without fPanx1) when they were not exposed to Casp3; and SR-B fluorescence was also unaffected by Casp3 in liposomes that did not contain fPanx1 (i.e., empty liposomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, this TIRF-based assay verifies that caspase cleavage activation of fPanx1 elicits dye efflux from fPanx1-containing proteoliposomes.</p><p>The TIRF assay was also used to examine the kinetics of dye release from proteoliposomes, thereby enabling flux measurements between fluorescent dyes of different charge and size. To examine charge effects, we assessed the release of a cationic dye, Rhodamine B (RhB), which is slightly smaller than the anionic SR-B (480 Da vs. 559 Da; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like SR-B, RhB was released from proteoliposomes, and this release was also dependent on caspase-mediated cleavage of fPanx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). The rate of dye efflux, obtained from fits to mono-exponential decay curves of the fluorescent signal for each proteoliposome, was positively correlated with the fraction of fPanx1 cleavage (i.e., reduction in GFP fluorescence) for both SR-B and RhB dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Notably, despite the smaller size of RhB, the efflux rate was significantly slower than for SR-B due to the cationic charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>To examine the effect of size on efflux rates, we tested two additional anionic fluorescent dyes of increasing size, Alexa 594 and Alexa 555 (880 Da and 980 Da, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These larger dyes permeated caspase-cleaved fPanx1 at rates substantially slower than the smaller SR-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Of note, however, despite being approximately two times larger, these anionic dyes transited the channel at rates comparable to the cationic dye RhB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Finally, we also examined two larger dyes (ATTO 550 (+), 1363 Da; and Dextran 3000 (−), 3000 Da; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and neither of those were able to permeate caspase-activated fPanx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The permeation properties of these dyes were not related to the relative amounts of GFP cleavage, which were comparable in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the channel favors anionic over cationic permeants and reveal that the pore size is sufficient to accommodate molecules up to 980 Da.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Panx1 is a conduit for anionic and cationic metabolites</title><p>Panx1 is commonly characterized as an ATP-release channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taruno, 2018</xref>) and recent work provides compelling evidence that caspase cleavage-based activation of Panx1 can also lead to release of multiple additional metabolites (e.g., spermidine) that mediate important intercellular signaling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>). To test whether ATP and other metabolites permeate directly through caspase-activated fPanx1 channels, we developed a filtration-based assay for uptake of radiolabeled metabolites in proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We performed this assay with select metabolites that have been proposed to permeate cleavage-activated fPanx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>), including anionic (α-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate) and cationic ([<sup>3</sup>H]-spermidine) metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, we found that uptake of α-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamate, and [<sup>3</sup>H]-spermidine into proteoliposomes required caspase-activated fPanx1; uptake was not observed when liposomes did not contain fPanx1 or when the channel was not activated by Casp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). We also tested whether ATP and spermidine could flux via caspase-activated Panx1 when included together in the same assay, rather than independently. Under these conditions, we again found uptake of both ATP and spermidine into caspase-cleaved Panx1-containing proteoliposomes, albeit at slightly lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The widespread acceptance of this idea is based on a wealth of data obtained from more intact systems, including those that implicated caspase-activated Panx1 as the likely transmembrane flux pathway for large molecule permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poon et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, the dye/metabolite permeation associated with apoptosis requires Panx1 expression, caspase activation, and an intact C-terminal caspase cleavage site; it is blocked by Panx1 channel inhibitors, indicating that ongoing channel activity is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2011</xref>). This dye and metabolite permeation occurs not only during cell death, but is also observed when the channels are activated by C-terminal truncation independent of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sandilos et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, ATP release and dye uptake closely parallel the quantized channel activation associated with individual subunit C-tail removal, further implicating the Panx1 channel as the permeation pathway for large molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>). Despite this substantial body of evidence, this previous work was all based on experiments in intact cells, where secondary release mechanisms could not be excluded, and it has been suggested based on other channel properties (i.e., preferential anion selectivity and single channel conductance) that caspase-cleaved Panx1 is not compatible with large molecule permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Dahl, 2018</xref>). The present data demonstrate dye and metabolite permeation directly through purified Panx1 channels reconstituted in proteoliposomes to convincingly dispel this conflicting idea and clearly establish that dye/metabolite flux can indeed occur directly through caspase-activated Panx1 channels.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Channel properties of Panx1 channels in bilayers and cells</title><p>Similar to electrophysiological measurements of fPanx1 and hPANX1 recorded in inside-out patches from mammalian cells, we found that fPanx1 was silent in planar lipid bilayers until activated by caspase cleavage. In native cell membranes, caspase-cleaved hPANX1 and fPanx1 generate outwardly-rectifying currents with a single channel conductance of ~90 pS at depolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>). However, different conductance levels for channels attributed to Panx1 have been observed in various cell systems after different forms of activation, reportedly up to ~500 pS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we observed two main, non-rectifying conductance levels from purified fPanx1 channels in bilayers after caspase activation (~100 pS; ~190 pS). In lipid bilayer recordings of purified hPANX1 reported during preparation of this work, Mou et al. detected a ~ 30 pS channel in <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract, although these recordings were in the absence of any specific form of activation and were not accompanied by open-closed transitions; the C-tail-cleaved channels, by contrast, yielded a number of extremely large open channel conductance states (i.e., 750 pS, 1.3 nS, and 1.8 nS; at +100 mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mou et al., 2020</xref>). There have been other reports of constitutive Panx1 channel activity (i.e., in the absence of stimulation), and although these channels display a unitary conductance similar to that of channels stimulated by Casp3 cleavage (~70–80 pS), they do not appear to support ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>). It was recently proposed that a second permeation pathway, visible as a side tunnel in the structure of hPANX1, could support atomic ion flux through unstimulated and C-tail-intact channels in the absence of large molecule permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>); this intriguing idea will need to be explored further (e.g., with single channel recordings of hPANX1 with intact C-termini). At this point, the mechanisms controlling basal and stimulated channel activity, and the factors that determine the vast range of reported Panx1 channel conductance levels, remain to be determined and may be related to any number of cell specific factors (e.g., channel-interacting proteins, different lipid composition in native cell membranes and bilayers).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A preference for anion versus cation selectivity</title><p>In ion substitution experiments, obvious shifts in reversal potential (E<sub>rev</sub>) were observed when Cl<sup>−</sup> was exchanged with other negatively charged counterions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Dahl, 2018</xref>). These shifts in E<sub>rev</sub> were strongly affected by mutations in R75, a positively charged residue next to W74, the narrowest pore constriction site identified in multiple recent structural reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>).

On this basis, it has been inferred that the channel is exclusively anion-selective and impermeable to cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Our data likewise reveal permeation of anionic dyes and signaling molecules (ATP, glutamate), with a clear preference for anionic over cationic dyes. However, we also detected flux through the channel of a positively charged dye (RhB) and metabolite (spermidine), indicating that cationic molecules can also traverse the channel. In addition, we observed simultaneous Panx1-mediated flux of both ATP and spermidine when assessed in combination. This supports the previous observation from apoptotic T cells that multiple important signaling metabolites can be released via caspase-activated channels in a complex milieu containing numerous permeants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Permeant size considerations and pore architecture</title><p>Our data reveal a negative correlation between dye size and permeation rate – larger dyes were associated with slower permeation.

The architecture and contours of the transmembrane pore were remarkably similar for all constructs analyzed, despite those including full length (presumably inactive) and C-terminal cleaved/truncated (presumably activated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). The narrowest pore constriction was formed by a ring of seven W74 residues on the extracellular surface of the channel, with a diameter of ~8–10 Å. This constriction appears to be too small to accommodate large dyes or even hydrated ATP, although this may be influenced by the shape and flexibility of the permeant molecule and/or the pore itself. Moreover, upon activation by cleavage (or truncation) at the C-terminal caspase site, Panx1 transitions between open and closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the available structures may have captured the channel in a state that is ‘open’ for atomic ions but remains ‘closed’ for large molecules. The possibility of multiple open conformations or separate permeation pathways for ions and large molecules in both Panx1 channels and in CALHM1 channels have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaete et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). If those distinct conformations exist, the dye/metabolite flux we present indicates that Panx1 cleavage by caspase is permissive for conformations that allow large molecule permeation, perhaps by removing a physical block to pore access while allowing open-closed transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sandilos et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary</title><p>Examination of dye and metabolite flux through purified Panx1 channels reconstituted in proteoliposomes demonstrates directly that molecules up to ~1 kDa are capable of permeating caspase cleavage-activated fPanx1.

Briefly, Multi Electrode Cavity Array (MECA4) chips (Ionera, Freiburg, Germany) were filled with 150 μL of solution containing 200 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, and 0.2 mM EDTA; adjusted to pH 7.6. Lipid bilayers were formed by painting the chips with 10 mg/mL 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) dissolved in octane. Purified fPanx1-eGFP (2–5 μL) was added at the cis (ground) side of the bilayer. After channel reconstitution, the current was recorded in a range of voltages (±200 mV). Activity at extreme potentials (&gt;140 mV) was indicative of channel presence in the bilayer. Then, 2 μL of Casp3 (~0.4 mg/mL) was added to the cis side of the bilayer. After channel activation, Casp3 was gently washed out to keep symmetrical ionic composition on both sides of the bilayer. After treatment with caspase, the current was recorded again in a range of voltages (±200 mV). Recordings were performed at 20 kHz using Element Data Recorder 3.8.0 software and further analyzed with Clampfit 10 software (Axon Instruments, San Jose, CA).

Purified and activated Casp3 was added in the internal solution (2 µg/mL) to cleave and activate fPanx1-eGFP before bath application of CBX (50 µM). CBX-sensitive currents from fPanx1-eGFP or hPANX-TEV were obtained from ramp voltage commands, and normalized to the peak current to compare current–voltage relationships of fPanx1-eGFP and hPANX-TEV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single channel recordings</title><p>We examined single channel activity of caspase-activated fPanx1-GFP in transfected HEK293T cells (as above).

After seal formation (≥10 GΩ) and patch excision, the bath solution was exchanged to an inside-out solution containing 150 mM CsCl, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.3). Patches were held at +50 to +80 mV (Δ 10 mV), and only those patches that were silent initially after excision were used (i.e., those without native channel activities). Purified Casp3 was applied in the proximity of the patch to a final bath concentration of ~1–2 µg/mL. Stable steady-state channel activity was recorded ~5–10 min after Casp3 addition before switching to an inside-out bath solution containing CBX (50 μM).

It has been suggested that these channels when activated can transport ATP and other bulky metabolites. However, those studies cannot rule out the possibility that these ions flux through secondary pathways that are stimulated by the channel. Here, using a purified reconstituted system, the authors provide the most definitive evidence that Pannexin 1 when activated by caspase can flux large bulky metabolites such as ATP and spermidine. This study resolves a key question and has important physiological significance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Caspase-activated Pannexin 1 channels favor anionic molecules and support flux of ATP and other signaling metabolites&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Narahari et al., reports comprehensive assessment of permeation properties of the frog Panx1 channel using liposomes reconstituted with purified fPanx1 proteins. In the past, much had been done using cell-based assay, however, there has not been any liposome based assays with purified protein. Such assays provide definitive characterization of the intrinsic functional properties of the protein. Here, the authors first conducted a lipid-bilayer electrophysiology by fusing the fPanx1 proteolipomes and clearly recapitulated caspase-3 cleavage dependent current formation. They also detected influxing of fluorescent dyes into the proteoliposomes and effluxing of fluorescent dyes from liposomes packaged from the proteoliposomes by TIRF microscopy (measurement of fluorescence decay from single proteoliposomes). The quality control of the experiments is excellent (e.g. verification of caspase cleavage, protein quality, detection of reconstitution, size estimation of proteoliposomes under electron microscopy, etc). This work represents the first solid case where Panx1 activity can be clearly measured using an in vitro liposome assay. Using these established assays, the authors assessed permeation of dyes with different sizes to measure pore sizes. Furthermore, the authors assessed uptake of tritiated ATP, glutamate, and spermidine to show that both cationic and anionic metabolites can permeate with higher selectivity to anionic metabolites. This work clearly addresses a key outstanding question in the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors have placed an excessive emphasis on differences in permeability of cationic vs. anionic molecules by including this in the titles, since only one direct quantitative comparison was made. The observed differences between SR-B over positively charged RhB, while consistent with small anion selectivity assessed previously by electrophysiology, represent only a partial characterization and might be also reflect other reasons. This can be easily addressed by rewording the title. Please see our suggestions below.</p><p>1) In Figure 1B, it is not clear from the single channel traces where the Closed state is in some of the traces in the right side.

We also note in the figure legend that molar quantities should not be compared across compounds due to the different assay conditions. That is, we used 4 μCi of each metabolite in the assays, and thus the final concentrations and hot:cold ratios were different. In addition, we used spermidine at much lower final concentration due to its “detergent” properties (see Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction.

Sf9 only minimally contain cholesterol/sterol. Could that affect functions of the purified Panx1? Alternatively, could the addition of cholesterol change conductance?</p></disp-quote><p>We reconstituted purified Panx1 into either cholesterol-containing proteoliposomes for flux assays or cholesterol-free lipid bilayers for planar lipid bilayer recordings.</p><p>Cholesterol/sterols can modulate channel activity in numerous ion channel families (Levitan, Singh and Rosenhouse-Dantsker, 2014), and thus it is possible that the absence of cholesterol could affect Panx1 channel activity in the bilayer recordings. The only other lipid bilayer recordings of the purified channel were obtained with hPANX1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract (from Avanti), which is also devoid of cholesterol (Mou et al., 2020). In that case, Mou et al., recorded multiple single channel current amplitudes from caspase-cleaved hPANX1 channels that are much larger (even up to 1.8 nS) than we see in bilayers or cells (~100 pS). For our bilayer recordings, we also find an additional larger conductance level (~190 pS). At this point, the various factors that can influence these channel recordings, perhaps including cholesterol, remain to be determined.</p><p>We now specifically mention that the non-physiological lipids used for our bilayer recordings did not include cholesterol (or PIP2), and that this could have contributed to variations in channel properties (subsection “Pannexin 1 forms a dye permeable pore”). We also now note the composition of lipids in the proteoliposomes at the point where the flux assays are first described (subsection “Pannexin 1 forms a dye permeable pore”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 2D, comparison between the left and right panels is not simple. Can the authors indicate studies in the same sets of vesicles using similar colors? Can they generate a graph that shows a comparison of the changes of GFP and SRB for each set?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated Figure 2D to be color coded by experiment. We have also added a supplemental graph (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) that shows the changes in GFP and SRB for each of the experiments on a single graph. Finally, we have included the corresponding flow cytometry-style dot plots to show the caspase-evoked changes in GFP and SR-B for each of the individual experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Have the authors attempted an experiment like those in Figure 4 including both ATP and spermidine together (and separately counting 3H and 32P) to provide a direct comparison of the permeabilities of these two molecules?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now performed experiments to measure ATP and spermidine flux simultaneously in the same experiment (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). In this combined experiment, we find uptake of both ATP and spermidine into the caspase-cleaved Panx1-containing proteoliposomes (subsection “Pannexin 1 is a conduit for anionic and cationic metabolites”). Thus, flux of one metabolite does not preclude flux of the other and, by comparison with Figure 4B,D, uptake appears to be blunted for both under these conditions (with perhaps a bigger effect on spermidine). We note here that this implies competition of these metabolites for the permeation pathway; it also suggests that the system is not at equilibrium. A kinetic analysis with more time points would be required to determine whether ATP is the preferential permeant in this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It would be nice if the authors included a short section in the Discussion considering why other investigators have previously found some permeation through un-cleaved Panx1 channels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a short Discussion section noting that some investigators have described permeation through unstimulated Panx1 channels (subsection “Channel properties of Panx1 channels in bilayers and cells”). Unfortunately, as elaborated at length in an earlier review (see Chiu et al., 2018), we do not have a satisfactory explanation for why some groups record such unstimulated channel activity. Thus, we cannot offer much by way of speculation in this regard. We now note that “the mechanisms controlling basal and stimulated channel activity, and the factors that determine the vast range of reported Panx1 channel conductance levels, remain to be determined” (subsection “Channel properties of Panx1 channels in bilayers and cells”).</p><p>For our part, we have only observed hPANX1 channel activity after some channel-activating mechanism (i.e., Casp3 cleavage or GPCR signaling) (Billaud et al., 2015; Chiu et al., 2017; Sandilos et al., 2012); the absence of any unstimulated activity also appears to be the case for fPanx1 channels, as demonstrated here. We have seen activity from unstimulated mouse Panx1 channels when they are expressed heterologously (e.g., Sandilos et al., 2012), as others have as well (e.g., Ma et al., 2012; Romanov et al., 2012). Notably, in expression systems those constitutively active mouse channels do not appear to release ATP (Romanov et al., 2012), whereas native mPanx1 channels do not appear to generate basal activity in mouse thymocytes even as caspase-mediated channel activation can provoke ATP release and dye uptake from those same cells (Chekeni et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2011).</p><p>Indeed, two important issues in this regard remain unresolved: (1) Do native channels display constitutive activity in the absence of stimulation? and (2) Is any such constitutive activity associated with large molecule permeation?</p><p>Recently, Ruan et al., suggested that a side tunnel they identified in the structure of hPANX1 could provide a constitutive atomic ion flux pathway through unstimulated and C-tail intact channels while not allowing large molecule permeation (Ruan et al., 2020). We now mention this possibility in the new discussion of basal channel activity (subsection “Channel properties of Panx1 channels in bilayers and cells”); we had earlier noted this idea when discussing potential separate pathways for atomic ions and large molecules (subsection “Permeant size considerations and pore architecture”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Channel permeation does not depend only on the charge and mass of the permeant but also on its shape (second largest diameter). The authors might include a supplemental figure showing images of the size and shapes of the different permeants that they have tested. It could be briefly addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a supplemental figure showing the chemical structures of each of the different dyes and metabolites tested in our study, along with their charge and molecular weight (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also now point out that permeation properties of the channel “may be influenced by the shape and flexibility of the permeant molecule and/or the pore itself” (subsection “Permeant size considerations and pore architecture”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Title: How about &quot;ATP and bulky signaling metabolites can flux through Caspase activated Pannexin 1 channels&quot; or something along those lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have re-titled the paper as: “ATP and large signaling metabolites flux through caspase-activated Pannexin 1 channels”</p></body></sub-article></article>
