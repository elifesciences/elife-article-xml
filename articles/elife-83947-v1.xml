biology, and clinical translation. However, high-throughput proteomic experiments often require high sample amounts and can be less sensitive compared to conventional proteomic experiments. Here, we introduce and benchmark Zeno SWATH MS, a data-independent acquisition technique that employs a linear ion trap pulsing (Zeno trap pulsing) to increase the sensitivity in high-throughput proteomic experiments. We demonstrate that when combined with fast micro- or analytical flow-rate chromatography, Zeno SWATH MS increases protein identification with low sample amounts. For instance, using 20 min micro-flow-rate chromatography, Zeno SWATH MS identified more than 5000 proteins consistently, and with a coefficient of variation of 6%, from a 62.5 ng load of human cell line tryptic digest. Using 5 min analytical flow-rate chromatography (800 µl/min), Zeno SWATH MS identified 4907 proteins from a triplicate injection of 2 µg of a human cell lysate, or more than 3000 proteins from a 250 ng tryptic digest. Zeno SWATH MS hence facilitates sensitive high-throughput proteomic experiments with low sample amounts, mitigating the current bottlenecks of high-throughput proteomics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>high-throughput screening</kwd><kwd>liquid chromatography</kwd><kwd>data-independent acquisition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>031L0220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>161L0221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demichev</surname><given-names>Vadim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200829/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-SyG-2020 951475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The study of the proteome hence requires the ability to address both its large dynamic range and complexity, as well as the dynamic nature of biological systems. While proteomics typically aims to quantify as many proteins as possible, many of the biological questions that are to be addressed also necessitate the processing of large sample series. For example, a minimal drug treatment experiment of a wild-type and a single mutant cell line, with five drug concentrations, five time points, and triplicate measurements, already produces 150 samples. Epidemiological studies, exemplified by the Fenland study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>), can reach tens of thousands of samples. Processing such high sample amounts requires fast and robust measurement technologies that are quantification precise and cost effective.</p><p>In bottom-up proteomics, data-dependent acquisition (DDA) selects precursors from full-scan MS<sup>1</sup> mass spectrum for fragmentation, generating tandem (MS/MS or MS<sup>2</sup>) mass spectra that can be matched to spectra in a database. While DDA ensures selectivity, it can result in high numbers of missing values that can originate from, for example, the stochastic nature of precursors selected for fragmentation, which limits the application in high-throughput studies. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) techniques such as SWATH acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gillet et al., 2012</xref>) address this problem by generating fragment ion spectra from all precursor ions that fall within a predefined precursor m/z range window. DIA shifted the data-processing strategies from an established spectrum-centric processing model to a peptide-centric model, requiring a shift in algorithm design and assumptions. DIA methods have facilitated applications in large-scale proteomics, including systems biology studies in various model organisms, disease states, and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zelezniak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grobbler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gillet et al., 2012</xref>), with one of the most common clinical applications being the discovery of (compound) biomarkers for disease in body fluids, particularly blood serum or plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anjo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gajbhiye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Russell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pires et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Throughput, the required measurement precision, and sample amount are major factors that need to be balanced when conducting large-scale proteomics measurements. Moreover, particular attention has to be given to batch effects that exist within large proteomic experiments. Proteomics has historically relied on nano-flow chromatography, which is highly sensitive as sample dilution is minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muntel et al., 2019</xref>), but the low flow rate requires a longer gradient time, which is more susceptible to technical distortions. Moreover, columns compatible with nano-LC systems typically require exchange after a maximum of a few hundred injections, which together prolongs the acquisition time and leads to complex batch effects in larger studies. Recent advances in instrumentation and software have facilitated the use of faster gradients and higher chromatographic flow rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Messner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vowinckel et al., 2018</xref>). These accelerate proteomic experiments and allow highly precise measurements. These come, however, at the cost of a higher sample amount required and can yield lower proteomic depth.</p><p>Here, we present a new acquisition technique, Zeno SWATH MS, that exploits a linear ion trap, the Zeno trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Loboda and Chernushevich, 2009</xref>), in combination with SWATH MS acquisition, in order to increase the sensitivity of DIA-MS acquisition, specifically in combination with micro-flow-rate and analytical flow-rate chromatography. We demonstrate that Zeno SWATH MS increases sensitivity and expands the proteomic dynamic range coverage, generating new possibilities in the design of high-throughput proteomic experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Zeno SWATH MS increases proteomic depth and quantification precision</title><p>The sensitivity of SWATH MS in time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers is largely determined by the MS/MS duty cycle. The pulse in the TOF accelerator, which results in a small proportion of ions situated at the right position of entering TOF, has a disproportionate impact on lower-m/z ions, resulting in a duty cycle of TOFs of only 5–25%. Here, we describe a setup of the Zeno trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Loboda and Chernushevich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), where all fragment ions are trapped in an axial pseudopotential well and then released by potential energy with timing aligned to the next pulse at the accelerator, allowing a duty cycle increase, thus increasing intensity 4–20 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2021</xref>). We speculated that the Zeno trap could be employed in combination with SWATH MS to boost the MS/MS sensitivity, facilitating higher identification and quantification performance while requiring lower sample amounts.</p><p>To generate platforms for medium- and high-throughput proteomic experiments, we coupled a ZenoTOF 7600 system (SCIEX) equipped with a Zeno trap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to both a micro-flow LC system (ACQUITY M-Class, Waters) and an analytical flow-rate LC (1290 Infinity II, Agilent), respectively. For data processing, we applied our deep-neural-network-based software suite, DIA-NN, which has been specifically optimised for handling complex data arising from fast chromatographic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>First, we examined how consistently precursor (i.e. peptide at a specific charge state) and protein intensities were measured between triplicate injections of 62.5 ng K562 human cell line standard, comparing the performance of Zeno SWATH MS with SWATH MS on the same instrument setup. Peptides were separated using the micro-flow LC running at a flow rate of 5 µl/min, 20 min micro-flow gradient chromatography (Materials and methods). For analysis, we used an experimental spectral library generated using the ZenoTOF 7600 system (Materials and methods). Zeno SWATH MS yielded 5179 consistently quantified proteins among an average of 6226 proteins identified in triplicates. These were quantified with a median coefficient of variance (CV) of 6%, and 89% of identifications or 4602 shared proteins were quantified with a CV better than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). At the precursor level, on average 49,172 precursors were identified, of which 40,209 were repeatedly quantified. Of these, 77% were quantified with a CV of less than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Zeno SWATH MS showed a considerable improvement in quantification consistency compared to conventional SWATH MS using the same chromatography, mass spectrometry, and sample. SWATH MS consistently quantified 2743 proteins, of which 76% or 2083 proteins were quantified with a CV &lt;20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). At the precursor level, SWATH identified an average of 21,771 precursors in triplicate injections, of which 16,022 were consistently quantified, with a median CV of 11%.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison between SWATH and Zeno SWATH MS in proteome coverage and quantification precision and using 5 µl/min, 20 min micro-flow-rate chromatography.</title><p>(<bold>a,b</bold>) Reproducibility of protein identification using SWATH MS and Zeno SWATH MS on human cell line standard (K562) separated by micro-flow chromatography with a 62.5 ng load.

The multiple-species benchmarks evaluate both the identification and quantification precision, which is determined by the ability of the proteomic method to deconvolute the multiplexed proteomes. Herein, we assessed how well the known ratios between two-species lysates – human and yeast lysates mixed in the defined proportions: 1:1 (A/B) for human, 2:1 for yeast (Materials and methods) – were recovered in triplicates using SWATH MS and Zeno SWATH MS, followed by a library-free analysis in DIA-NN. We injected triplicates of 1 µl of both mixtures (65 ng [mixture A] and 47.5 ng [mixture B]) with micro-flow-rate chromatography.

Further, 3282 human and 1692 yeast proteins were quantified with Zeno SWATH MS, showing a ratio close to the known ratio (1:1 (A/B) for human, 2:1 for yeast) in at least two replicates in each of mixture A and B, with a median CV value for human proteins measured in triplicates of mixture A and B of 6.9% and 7%, respectively.

Analytical flow-rate chromatography is also attractive for practical reasons, because columns equilibrate quickly, and the problem of dead volumes and sample carryover is substantially reduced. In our recent studies, we reduced the time between injections to 3 min or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Messner et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, for applications such as neat-plasma proteomics or drug screens, we have previously demonstrated proteomic experiments using flow rates of 800 µl/min, and obtained quantification of precise proteomes with gradient times that ranged from 30 s to 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Messner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Messner et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, even with the slowest of these gradients – 5 min of active separation – the throughput of a proteomics study is increased to 180 samples per day on a single instrument. The downside so far is a reliance on relatively large sample amounts, which restricts the application space and shortens the instrument cleaning cycles. We therefore examined whether Zeno SWATH MS’s performance would allow us to conduct proteomic experiments with analytical flow-rate chromatography and lower sample amounts.</p><p>We used the ZenoTOF system coupled to the 1290 Infinity II HPLC system (Agilent), running at 800 µl/min, with a 5 min gradient chromatography. We analysed the K562 human cell line standard in a concentration series, injecting increasing amounts from 4 ng to 2 µg. The obtained raw data were analysed using a spectral library. On average, Zeno SWATH MS identified 29,681 precursors and 4907 proteins with a 2 µg load of sample on the column, whereas SWATH MS identified 17,212 precursors or 3250 proteins with the same amount of sample (protein data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, respective precursor data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

We and others have previously presented high-throughput proteomic experiments using micro-flow-rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vowinckel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruderer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zelezniak et al., 2018</xref>) and analytical flow-rate chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Messner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Messner et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, the latter presents highly desirable properties to increase the throughput of proteomic experiments, for example, ease of use, the ability to run fast gradients, and high reproducibility. The disadvantage of higher flow rates is however the higher dilution, resulting in a requirement for higher sample amounts and, typically, a decrease in the proteomic depth. However, new acquisition techniques can mitigate these problems.</p><p>The fast acquisition speed required to conduct proteomic experiments with fast chromatography is often reached using TOF mass spectrometers. Nonetheless, in TOF instruments, all fragment ions are recorded in parallel (quasi-simultaneously), where the ions spread by m/z across the distance between the exit of the collision cell and the TOF accelerator. When the subsequent pulse is observed at the accelerator, only a small proportion of the total fragment ion population is situated at the right location to enter the TOF, leading to a proportion of ions not being able to be detected, thus limiting sensitivity. This disproportionately impacts low-m/z ions, with the duty cycle of TOFs falling in the range of only 5–25%, depending on concentration range and m/z. Because of this duty cycle deficiency, many ions (especially low-m/z ions) are not detected in low-abundance samples, resulting in TOF-MS/MS not fully realising its full sensitivity potential. A linear ion trap introduced after the collision cell (Q2) – the Zeno trap – can compensate for these limitations in TOF-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Loboda and Chernushevich, 2009</xref>). When the Zeno trap is enabled, the fragment ions in the selected mass range are trapped in an axial pseudopotential well created by an additional RF (‘AC’) voltage applied with the same amplitude and phase to all four rods of the trap in a required focal point. Subsequently, the release of the ions occurs by potential energy with timing aligned to the next pulse at the accelerator, enabling a &gt;90% duty cycle, thus increasing intensity 4–20 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2021</xref>) without loss of mass accuracy and resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To use the Zeno trap technology in high-throughput proteomics, we have established and benchmarked a DIA method termed Zeno SWATH MS. To achieve this, we modified the instrument acquisition software on a Zeno TOF 7600 system that is equipped with the Zeno trap to be able to acquire data in DIA mode, coupled the system to different chromatographic systems, and optimised acquisition parameters. We then tested Zeno SWATH MS on tryptic digests generated of protein extracts derived from a human cell line standard (K562), human plasma, as well as from yeast cultures, <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, and chickpea seedling samples. Furthermore, we benchmarked the method on two-species mixtures of yeast and human cell line standard samples. In all cases, we identified more precursors and proteins, and quantified those with higher precision using Zeno SWATH MS in comparison to SWATH MS on the same instrument, as well as its predecessor, the TripleTOF 6600. We show that gains mostly result from the better identification and quantification of low-abundant precursors. Moreover, we report that Zeno SWATH MS can generate deep proteomes from low sample amounts, even when used in conjunction with 800 µl/min analytical flow-rate chromatography. For instance, on most matrices, we quantified a similar number of precursors from 62.5 ng of tryptic digest using Zeno SWATH MS as from 500 ng of the same tryptic digest using SWATH MS. Lowering the sample dependency in high-throughput proteomics has at least three different applications: First, high-throughput proteomics can be extended to studies where only low amounts of material are available. Second, injecting lower amounts of samples decreases the cleaning cycles of mass spectrometers and increases their uptime. Third, injecting lower sample amounts allows one to reduce costs. Reassuringly, Zeno SWATH MS improves both the number of proteins identified and quantification precision in all chromatographic methods tested. To this end, further applications of Zeno SWATH MS remain to be explored. For instance, our benchmark experiments were acquired with a ZenoTOF 7600 system running SCIEX OS 2.1.6, with an ionisation threshold for Zeno SWATH MS to prevent detector damage (‘ion striking’) caused by excessive ions hitting the detector at the same time. This detector protection procedure limits the maximum injection amount in our benchmark to 62.5 ng, preventing us from testing the effect of high amounts of sample on the MS system. The ionization threshold (which limited the load to 62.5 ng) was experimental in nature at the time performing experiments, however, further re-optimizations to this threshold occurred enabling higher loads with Zeno SWATH MS with newer releases of SCIEX OS.</p><p>Beyond the here investigated application of Zeno SWATH MS for medium-to-high flow-rate chromatography or high-throughput proteomics, the gain in sensitivity and expansion of proteomics coverage can be useful for a range of other applications. For instance, when coupled with nano-flow chromatography systems, the sensitive Zeno SWATH MS might benefit the field of single-cell proteomics. Moreover, further improvements in sensitivity in high-throughput proteomics are still possible in the future. For instance, our lab has previously introduced a scanning SWATH acquisition technique that significantly increased the identification rate of proteins using the TripleTOF 6600 system (SCIEX), particularly in ultra-fast proteomic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Messner et al., 2021</xref>). Scanning SWATH combines the benefits of data-dependent and data-independent techniques by employing a ‘sliding’ quadrupole (Q1) to assign precursor masses to MS/MS traces, allowing for a faster Q1 scan than stepwise SWATH acquisition. A combination of the Zeno trapping technology with scanning SWATH is technically possible and might result in further gains in the sensitive analysis of proteomes at high throughput.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>Water was from Merck (LiChrosolv LC-MS grade; Cat# 115333), acetonitrile was from Biosolve (LC-MS grade; Cat# 012078), 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT; Cat# 6908.2) from Carl Roth, iodoacetamide (IAA; Bioultra; Cat# I1149) and urea (puriss.

The competency of such an MS system for very low input materials as e.g. encountered in emerging single-cell proteomic workflows, typically employing nanoflow chromatography, was thus not part of the study.</p><p>Accordingly, a medium- (micro-flow) and very high ('analytical'-flow) throughput LC method were screened on the three MS (parameter) setups using human cell lysate digests typically utilized in such technical evaluations. Well-received, the authors further extended their analysis (for the new instrument) across additional sample types of clinical and extended biological interest and spanning different levels of complexity and dynamic range of contained protein analytes.</p><p>In addition, the authors also performed a controlled ratio 2-species mixture experiment which allows detailed benchmarking of proteome coverage as well as the quality of protein quantification in a known differential comparison for the medium throughput (micro-flow) method.</p><p>The data quite convincingly demonstrate an increased sensitivity of the instrument based on similar identification performance in DIA bottom up proteomics from ca. 3- to 8-fold lower input peptide mass. However, I see a number of shortcomings mainly in the presentation and in part the completeness of the work, with specific comments below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the accurate summary of our manuscript, and we addressed his specific requirements, outlined below in a point to point reply.</p><p>We further would like to comment that we concentrated on medium-to-high flow rates and microflow chromatography, as we see the main application of the new acquisition technology in medium- and large-scale screening approaches in systems biology and biomedicine. We totally agree with the reviewer that single-cell biology is another exciting new application for proteomics too, yet in its earlier stages, and we would choose another setup (i.e. nano flowrate chromatography and not high flowrates) for this application. That said, we agree with the reviewer that, plausibly, Zeno trapping can be useful in single-cell proteomics as the sensitivity increases. We added a final paragraph to the Discussion section and highlight this potential application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>– Are the key conclusions convincing?</p><p>1. The concluded 10x sensitivity increase is overstating the observed numbers (x5-x8). In addition, the authors should at least discuss other changes than the Zeno trap incurred in the Zeno SWATH vs non-Zeno-SWATH DIA setups, particularly changes in accumulation times per m/z range, with Zeno Swath accumulating ~42 % longer per cycle spanning the same m/z range (85 vs 60 windows with 11ms per window) in the uflow method set and ~ 18 % longer in the high-flow method set (same window number but 13 ms vs. 11 ms dwell time per window). This should be discussed as one of the optimizations/factors contributing to the increased sensitivity observed in Zeno Swath measurements vs conventional SWATH.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for having used the placative 10-fold increased sensitivity from the precursor ID increases obtained with lower sample amounts. We revised the manuscript now considerably and express gains in IDs with specific numbers, rather than giving an ‘order of magnitude’ range.</p><p>Benchmarking two different proteomic methods has a typical caveat—that one may not be able to use the exact same settings on the different methods if one does not want to discriminate against one method. Expressed in other words – for our specific case – do I want to quantify the pure impact of the Zeno trap itself, or do I want to evaluate the performance of a workflow that uses the Zeno Trap, versus a workflow that does not use the Zeno Trap? Both are legitimate questions, but we believe the second is more relevant for most of the readers. In our specific case, several method parameters differ between SWATH and Zeno SWATH for the reason that due to the higher ion transmission, the detector saturates earlier in Zeno SWATH than it does in SWATH mode, which results in slightly different acquisition schemes being optimal for either SWATH or Zeno SWATH, respectively.</p><p>On our specific platform, when using the 60 window acquisition scheme in Zeno SWATH, using our chromatography, and when more than 62.5 ng of sample is injected, the number of ions that hit the detector exceeds a threshold set to protect the detector from damage. Once this threshold is exceeded, the instrument firmware stops acquiring. This is why we cannot inject very high amounts of digest on our instrument when running Zeno SWATH acquisition. To keep the ion counts below the ion striking threshold in Zeno SWATH, we used a smaller window size (resulting in lower ion transmission per unit time), and in order to compensate for that, we increased the window number to 85 at 62.5 ng load as well as all dilution series.</p><p>In order to address the reviewer’s point, we tested to quantify the impact of the different windows. We conducted an experiment using SWATH, injected 100 ng of sample, and acquired the data with both 40, 60, and 85 windows. Of note, we observed no strong effect on the number of SWATH windows, and the number of precursors or proteins identified, particularly with respect to 60 and 85 windows. We now clearly state differences in the number of SWATH windows between methods, and their effect in the manuscript (Figure 5).</p><p>Illustrated here is the comparison of different SWATH-MS acquisition schemes (SWATH window number 40, 60, and 85). With 100 ng of K562 standard injected, in the 40 window SWATH method, 26,115 unique precursors from 3,904 proteins were identified; 25,884 precursors from 4,025 proteins were identified by 60 window SWATH-MS; and 25,945 precursors from 3,995 proteins were identified by 85 window SWATH scheme.</p><p>On a similar note, it is also correct that the accumulation time is different between the acquisition schemes that we used for analytical flowrate and for micro flowrate chromatography, running with SWATH and Zeno SWATH MS. Also this is intentional, as the different chromatographic regimes create very different requirements on the acquisition schemes to perform optimally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On that note, it was unclear to me when and where the 40 variable window SWATH method mentioned in the methods was used and where the settings can be found.</p></disp-quote><p>The 40 variable window SWATH method was used on the SCIEX 6600 TripleTOF system for comparison of identification numbers and protein coverage between the two instruments in Figure 2a-c. We apologise that due to the focus on Zeno SWATH, we kept the part about the 6600 too brief. We expanded the Methods section for the 6600:</p><p>“TripleTOF 6600:</p><p>For inter-platform comparison, K562 dilution series were also acquired on a nanoAcquity UPLC System (Waters) coupled to a SCIEX TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer. The peptides were separated with the same 20-min gradient on a Waters HSS T3 column (300 µm × 150 mm, 1.8 µm) using a flow rate of 5 µl/min. The SWATH-MS/MS acquisition scheme was used as described in previous work (40 variable size windows and 35 ms accumulation time [8]).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Since injected material is a critical parameter here, it would be good if it was mentioned also with the key conclusion on the increased number of confidently quantified peptides in microflow (based on the 2-species controlled quantity experiment).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have added a new 2-species deconvolution experiment that shows the performance of Zeno SWATH versus SWATH with 50% lower sample amount. (See below). Furthermore, we now explain better how the injection amounts were chosen. Based on previous works featuring similar benchmarks (Navarro et al. 2016; Meier et al. 2020), we justified the total injection amount to the maximum injectable amount of the MS system and defined the 2-species mixtures ratio for the LFQbench test.</p><p>Methods “to generate the hybridisation of different species samples, tryptic peptides were combined following previous works (Navarro et al. 2016; Meier et al. 2020) featuring similar benchmarks, justified to the maximum injectable amount of MS system to avoid ion striking, the sample mixtures were in the following ratios…”</p><p>– Regarding the confidently quantified peptides, we added LFQbench based on peptides. At both peptide and protein levels, Zeno SWATH shows a strong increase in the number of confident identification (with same injection amount, SWATH quantifies 11,227 precursors from 1,741 human proteins and 4,755 precursors from 776 yeast proteins; Zeno SWATH greatly increases the quantification number to 32,946 precursors from 3,282 human proteins and 13,983 precursors from 1,692 yeast proteins) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2b,c).</p><p>– The additional experiment where we inject 50% of the sample of 2-species sample preparations is included. We find that for both species, a similar strong increase of precise quantification number of proteins from different species is observed (SWATH method: around 1.6-fold increase with double the injection amount; Zeno SWATH: around 1.3-fold increase for both species). Also, even with double the injection amount, SWATH acquisition quantifies fewer proteins compared to Zeno SWATH (Zeno SWATH precisely quantifies (valid ratios with at least two replicates in each of A and B) 2,714 human and 1,299 yeast proteins, while with double the injection SWATH quantifies 1,741 human and 776 yeast proteins). With the same injection amount, Zeno SWATH aquantifies 3,282 human and 1,692 yeast proteins, increasing the confidence quantification number around 2-fold. In general, Zeno SWATH allows more precise quantification of mixed species compared to SWATH acquisition (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2f,g).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Conclusions 'increasing protein identification numbers through the use of analytical-flow-rate chromatography' does not capture the observed data; the use of analytical-flow-rate does not convey an increase in protein identification numbers but enhanced sensitivity rather enables the maintenance of high protein identification numbers / proteome coverage despite/concurrent with analytical-flow chromatography.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for poor phrasing; we never aimed to suggest that high-flow-rate liquid chromatography would give higher ID numbers compared to lower flow rates – the sentence should have said that Zeno SWATH performs better than SWATH on the fast chromatography. We corrected the statement. In addition to further avoiding ambiguity, we give the examples. “For instance, with 250 ng of K562 human cell line standard injected, around 3,000 proteins were quantified with Zeno SWATH MS while a similar protein quantification number can only be reached by SWATH MS with 2µg injection on the same instrument and chromatography”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In titration curve experiments like these, probing proteome coverage from relatively small sample amounts, special care.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the sentence is somewhat cut off, we believe the reviewer refers to the difficulties and considerations to be taken when working with small amounts of samples. We agree. The way we do these experiments is by first injecting several blanks, to exclude numbers that are explained by carryover, and then start with the highest dilution/lowest concentrated sample. The caveat is that like in any proteomic experiment, the values obtained with the lowest sample amounts are the least reliable. In part, this is mitigated in our manuscript by obtaining relatively similar results across the replicates (K562) included in our study. Nonetheless, we outlined this potential caveat in the manuscript.</p><p>Methods: “Before all the dilution series is prepared (as described below), we first inject replicates of blanks (50/50 v/v ACN/H<sub>2</sub>O) to exclude the identification numbers that are explained by carryover, then start with the highest dilution (lowest concentration), and performed triplicate injections to prove similar results among replicates.”</p><p>Results: “The concentration series was acquired starting with the lowest concentrations injected after several blank measurements with a 20-min, 5 µl/min chromatographic gradient (Methods), covering sample amounts ranging from near 1 ng to 500 ng (Methods).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Should the authors qualify some of their claims as preliminary or speculative, or remove them altogether?</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully revised the paper so that we clearly separate claims from preliminary/speculative results.

We have been too hand-waving in descrbing the performance gains as ‘an order of magnitude’ ‘10 fold’ as estimated by the number of IDs gains obtained in the dilution-series experiments. We adjusted the numbers as suggested by the reviewer. We now strictly avoid hand-waving statements and give precise values instead, throughout the text.</p><p>For instance:</p><p>“Interpreting the data in a different way, Zeno SWATH MS identified a similar number of precursors and proteins from 62.5 ng of K562 human cell line standard as SWATH MS did from 500 ng of the same sample on the same instrument (SWATH identified 64,316 precursors or 5,242 proteins from 500 ng)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Would additional experiments be essential to support the claims of the paper? Request additional experiments only where necessary for the paper as it is, and do not ask authors to open new lines of experimentation.</p><p>6.1 Figure 1f, Supplemental Figure 1b, Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 3 lack data for the Zeno SWATH method's performance at higher concentration. Given the fact that there is a clear, continuous trend of significant enhancement of proteomic depth in the highest 3 concentrations sampled by the Zeno SWATH method, I lack an assessment of the upper limit of proteome coverage achievable by the new platform when input material is not limited, or at least learn why injecting more is not advisable on the ZenoTOF 7600 system. It is clear that the region of interest is the lower loads where sensitivity gains are most pronounced, but with the strong trend in IDs per ng injected in the sampled range and discrepant range sampled by the non-Zeno method I feel there is a gap in the dataset and the upper ceiling of proteome coverage could be mapped out more thoroughly (At least for human cell lysate and possibly human plasma where trends appear most (log2-)linear).</p><p>6.2 Similarly, unless constrained for technical or practical reasons, I would suggest to find the ceiling for achievable proteome depth in analytical flow (4, 8 ug?)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As described above, we have already injected up to the maximum limit. On our 7600 instrument, when running. Zeno SWATH MS, cannot analyse higher sample amounts as a detector ion-count threshold is reached (‘ion striking’). We improved the discussion of this instrument limitation in the manuscript, and apologise that this technical limit of the hardware was not sufficiently discussed in the previous manuscript version. However, high amounts can be injected on the 6600 and the 7600 instruments when both are operated with SWATH-MS. This data is included, and we now discuss the ion striking limit much more predominantly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.3 Are the suggested experiments realistic in terms of time and resources?

All other settings were kept default.</p><p>The high-flow K562 human cell line lysate benchmark data was analysed using the DDA-based library described above, with MBR disabled.</p><p>The plasma acquisition analysis was performed as described previously (15). Specifically, the ‘Deep learning-based spectra, RTs and IMs prediction’ option was activated in DIA-NN, to replace all spectra and retention times in the public spectral library (29) with ones predicted in silico. Further, the protein annotation in the library was replaced using the ‘Reannotate’ function in DIA-NN with the annotation from the Human UniProt (33) isoform sequence database (UP000005640, 19 October 2021). The processing was performed using the MBR mode in DIA-NN—a two-step analysis wherein a spectral library (empirical or predicted in silico) is first refined based on the DIA experiment in question, and subsequently used to reanalyse it (20).</p><p>For the analysis of micro-flow K562 human cell line lysate acquisition as well as samples from other species, the respective FASTA databases from UniProt (human: UP000005640 (10 March 2022) yeast: UP000002311_559292 (28 September 2021) <italic>E. coli</italic>: UP000000625 (19 October 2021); chickpea: UP000087171_3827 (22 October 2021)) were used by DIA-NN in library-free mode. Specifically, following a two-step MBR approach described previously (20), an in silico spectral library is first generated by DIA-NN from the FASTA file(s); this library is then refined based on the DIA dataset and subsequently used to reanalyse the dataset, to obtain the final results.</p><p>The data were filtered in the following way. First, a 1% run-specific q-value filter was automatically applied at the precursor level by DIA-NN. Further, to compare the protein identification numbers in the dilution series between different injection amounts and LC-MS modes, a 1% global protein group q-value filter (Lib.PG.Q.Value column in the report) was also applied. For the LFQbench-type two-species benchmarks for quantification accuracy, a 1% global protein group q-value filter and 1% run-specific protein group q-value was used instead (Lib.PG.Q.Value and PG.Q.Value column in the report). We note that in any experiment processed using the MBR mode in DIA-NN, 1% global precursor q-value filtering is also applied automatically (20).</p><p>Coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for each protein or precursor as its empirical standard deviation divided by its empirical mean, and are reported in percentages.

In other words, are the low-load IDs independent of high load IDs? If not (i.e. the different loads were co-analyzed with MBR), what proteome coverage to the low sample loads reach bona fide, without the 'guidance' of high-load IDs?</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified this in the revision, thank you for the suggestion. We are using double-pass analysis: MBR was enabled for a fair comparison in the dilution series. The library-free analysis by DIA-NN is generally supposed to be used with a two-pass strategy, originally described (Demichev et al. 2020) and now termed ‘MBR’ within DIA-NN. That is, ‘bone fide’ IDs during library-free search are supposed to be only used to ‘refine’ the spectral library, which will then be used for the second pass. Otherwise, the data analysis (with DIA-NN or other software) would struggle with lower injection amounts—these are typically challenging when the search space is large due to the library-free mode. We would like to highlight that although the ‘MBR’ in DIA-NN shares the name with the respective algorithm in MaxQuant, the principle of operation here is different and simpler, i.e. in DIA-NN ‘MBR’ just refers to the two-pass analysis strategy with library refinement after the first pass (Demichev et al. 2020). This way, indeed, the numbers reported for each of the runs in the dilution series are increased through the MBR strategy, by virtue of runs being analysed together. Effectively, for the lower injection amounts, this works like analysing those with a project-specific DIA-based spectral library. In order to address the reviewer’s point, we now also added a benchmark of bona fide first-pass ID numbers (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1b), which indicates an even greater advantage for Zeno SWATH over SWATH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.4 Side note: Turning this around, could a high-load injection e.g. from a pool of limited-amount samples serve as a guiding element in a MBR-enabled analysis of a large cohort with limited sample amounts available per biological condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's point of view, thank you for the input. Indeed, this is a main intention of MBR. For example, in the original DIA-NN release (Demichev et al. 2020), we manually performed the two-step ‘MBR’ procedure to improve identifications in mixed-species runs of the LFQbench test: the injections in which yeast or <italic>E. coli</italic> digests were at high concentration helped to increase the IDs in the injections in which the respective digests were at low concentration. However, the concept will be expanded further and explained in a future publication that will detail the new developments inside DIA-NN: we believe a future development of the MBR feature in DIA-NN is out of the scope of this manuscript, which focuses on Zeno SWATH technology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Specific experimental issues that are easily addressable.</p><p>1.1 The authors state the impact on dynamic range of identification when comparing ID sets against an external dataset with presumable cellular concentration numbers.

We created a correlation plot for directly comparing SWATH and Zeno SWATH. Overall, the shared proteins quantified in both methods are highly correlated, with an r² of 0.93. The plot also reflects that the quantities agree extremely well correlated in the upper four orders of magnitudes of the concentration range, and that the noise largely comes from the one order of magnitude that is close to the LOD (in SWATH), were Zeno SWATH performs better. Furthermore, the correlation analysis confirms that most proteins quantified by Zeno SWATH and not SWATH are in the low abundant range (below 10E3).

Indeed the scatter plot turned out to be an excellent visualisation of the increased performance of Zeno SWATH versus SWATH.

Overall, the proteins quantified in both methods are highly correlated, with an r² of 0.94 (human) and 0.95 (yeast). The plot also reflects that the quantities agree extremely well in the upper three orders of magnitudes of the concentration range, and only become noisier in the one order of magnitude that is close to the LOD in SWATH. We also followed the reviewer’s suggestion and created a scatter plot comparing the ratio between the protein quantity (PG.MaxLFQ) of mixture A &amp; B. In general, Zeno SWATH shows better separation and less interference between two species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Wang et al. describe a technical advance in ion usage and sensitivity based on an ion-trap device storing and focusing ions for TOF-based bottom-proteomics measurements. The study demonstrates improved sensitivity relative to previous generation instrumentation and also explores the impact of the specific trap device relative to the general improvements of the remaining MS system. The work outlines a route towards high coverage proteomics at very high throughput and robustness, as desirable in clinical proteomics and prospective personalized medicine approaches. While not all sample types of interest are limited to the amounts where the strongest improvements are seen in the presented data, large scale studies across expansive cohorts will likely be rendered more practical and realistic due to reduced instrument contamination at reduced loads and also further applications beyond those discussed in the manuscript will be rendered feasible on the newer generation instrument.</p><p>The improved ZenoTOF system and SWATH method follows a series of innovations in the mass spectrometry instrumentation, most notably and related the drastic improvement of ion utilization by storage e.g in a trapped ion mobility device earlier in the ion stream where, beyond an accumulation-based boost of sensitivity, ion mobility as a further biophysical properties is assessed in addition to the conventional m/z, as reviewed recently (doi: 10.1016/j.mcpro.2021.100138.). While these developments culminated and have been targeting low-flow, ultra-high sensitivity applications such as single-cell proteomics, the present study takes a different angle towards higher throughput measurements from significantly larger than single cell, but also significantly lower than historically required sample amounts that were prohibitive to a range of applications that are now easier to accomplish thanks to this and related work of the authors and others.</p><p>The presented research appears of broad relevance and interest to the scientific community interested in protein abundance pattern analysis, in particular in larger (clinical) cohorts. Furthermore, the performance metrics on proteomic depth from human cell lysate digests will likely allow researchers with analytical quests other than those exemplified in the manuscript to extrapolate the ZenoTOF and Zeno SWATH suitability for their respective analytical targets.</p><p>Reviewer Field of expertise/background:</p><p>Quantitative proteomics.
