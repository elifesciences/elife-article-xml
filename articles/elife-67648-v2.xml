We discovered a mechanism linking the conserved protein kinase Pak1 with cell shape through the RNA-binding protein Sts5. Pak1 (also called Shk1 and Orb2) prevents Sts5 association with P bodies by directly phosphorylating its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Pak1 and the cell polarity kinase Orb6 both phosphorylate the Sts5 IDR but at distinct residues. Mutations preventing phosphorylation in the Sts5 IDR cause increased P body formation and defects in cell shape and polarity. Unexpectedly, when cells encounter glucose starvation, PKA signaling triggers Pak1 recruitment to stress granules with Sts5. Through retargeting experiments, we reveal that Pak1 localizes to stress granules to promote rapid dissolution of Sts5 upon glucose addition.

Because active growth requires energy, these networks must also respond to changes in the environment such as glucose availability. The p21-activated kinase (PAK) family of protein kinases are key mediators of cell polarity signaling in many eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hofmann et al., 2004</xref>). Following activation by small GTPases like Cdc42, PAKs function in regulating the cytoskeleton and MAPK pathways, and PAK dysregulation is associated with multiple human diseases. For example, PAKs regulate the elaborate architecture of highly polarized neurons, and PAK loss-of-function mutations impair neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and axonal development, leading to connections with autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and other neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Aberrant activation of human PAK1 also drives cell migration and proliferation in multiple forms of cancer including pancreatic, breast, prostate, and thyroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanumuri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rane and Minden, 2019</xref>). Additionally, PAK1 plays a protective role in cardiac diseases including hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanisms that connect PAKs with these diseases include canonical functions mediated through Cdc42 and the cytoskeleton, along with MAPK pathways. However, the diversity of these disease-related defects also suggests additional noncanonical functions and mechanisms that remain less studied. The functions of PAKs in cell morphology and signaling are conserved in a wide range of cell types and organisms including yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hofmann et al., 2004</xref>). This conservation is demonstrated by the finding that expression of human PAK1 suppresses defects associated with loss of the PAK Ste20 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1996</xref>). Full understanding of PAK function in cell polarity and proliferation requires identification of noncanonical substrates and functions for PAK-family proteins.</p><p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is a strong model system to dissect conserved mechanisms controlling cell polarity and morphology due to its simple cylindrical shape, which can be modulated by environmental stresses and growth conditions. Early genetic screens identified different classes of fission yeast morphology mutants, such as round (‘<italic>orb’</italic>), curved, bent, and branched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snell and Nurse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verde et al., 1995</xref>). Genes that result in similar shape defects when mutated may function together in shared and/or overlapping pathways. In this study, we connect three factors identified as <italic>orb</italic> mutants – the protein kinases Pak1 and Orb6, along with the RNA-binding protein Sts5 – in a shared mechanism that controls fission yeast cell shape.</p><p>Fission yeast Pak1, which is also called Shk1 and Orb2, is an ortholog of human PAK1 and was initially identified as an <italic>orb</italic> mutant. Pak1 is essential for cell viability, and conditional <italic>pak1</italic> mutants become round and exhibit reduced viability during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marcus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ottilie et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verde et al., 1998</xref>). Many studies have linked Pak1 function with Cdc42 activation consistent with canonical PAK mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marcus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ottilie et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tu and Wigler, 1999</xref>). However, other studies identified Pak1 activation mechanisms that are independent of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 1999</xref>), consistent with similar activation mechanisms observed in other PAK kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). Active Pak1 regulates components of the Cdc42 network and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moshfegh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vadlamudi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vadlamudi et al., 2002</xref>). Beyond these canonical targets, a recent phosphoproteomic screen identified potential substrates that suggest novel mechanisms for Pak1 function in cell morphology and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Similar to Pak1, the protein kinase Orb6 is a conserved regulator of cell morphology and was identified in genetic screens as an <italic>orb</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verde et al., 1995</xref>). Orb6 is an essential NDR/LATS kinase that regulates cell polarity and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verde et al., 1998</xref>). Orb6 substrates include Cdc42 regulators and components of the exocyst, consistent with regulation of polarized growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tay et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study showed that Orb6 also phosphorylates Sts5, an RNA-binding protein that associates with processing bodies (P bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>), which are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules that regulate translation and degradation of associated mRNAs. Conditional mutants in <italic>orb6</italic> and <italic>pak1</italic> are synthetically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verde et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verde et al., 1995</xref>), suggesting overlapping or connected pathways between these two protein kinases. However, specific connections in their signaling mechanisms have not been identified. In this study, we demonstrate that Sts5 phosphorylation by both Pak1 and Orb6 provides an additive regulatory mechanism for P body assembly, thereby connecting these two kinases through a shared substrate.</p><p>P bodies are biomolecular condensates comprising multiple proteins and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eulalio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao and Parker, 2017</xref>). These cytoplasmic RNP structures are conserved from yeast through mammalian cells and regulate the translation and turnover of associated mRNAs. Fission yeast Sts5, which has similarity to human DIS3L2 and budding yeast Ssd1, associates with P bodies through an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jansen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kurischko et al., 2011</xref>). This association is partly inhibited by phosphorylation of the Sts5 IDR by Orb6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, Sts5 regulates mRNAs connected to cell polarity and was isolated in the same <italic>orb</italic> screens that identified Orb6 and Pak1, suggesting a shared cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snell and Nurse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verde et al., 1995</xref>). Sts5 strongly localizes to RNP structures called stress granules when cells encounter glucose deprivation, thereby facilitating changes in both metabolism and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Stress granules assemble upon stress to regulate mRNA translation and stability. In yeast, stress granules and P bodies colocalize and may share some components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). The signaling mechanisms that connect Sts5 association to stress granules with glucose availability are largely unknown but have the potential to link cellular energy state with cell morphology.</p><p>In this work, we show that Pak1 directly phosphorylates Sts5 to regulate P bodies and cell morphology. Pak1 and Orb6 act synergistically on Sts5 to control cell shape through P body formation. Unexpectedly, glucose starvation induces rapid, PKA-dependent relocalization of Pak1 from the cell periphery to stress granules. Pak1 localization at stress granules is required for rapid dissolution of Sts5 from these structures when glucose is restored. Our results identify a novel nutrient-modulated mechanism connecting a conserved PAK kinase with cell morphology and stress response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA-binding protein Sts5 is a novel Pak1 substrate</title><p>We recently performed an unbiased phosphoproteomic screen that identified Sts5 as a leading candidate for phosphorylation by Pak1 in fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>).

This localization defect was phenocopied by the single S261A mutant but not by S264A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>), demonstrating that S261 is the primary site for regulation by Pak1. These combined data indicate that Pak1 phosphorylates the Sts5 IDR to prevent its localization to punctate granules in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pak1-Orb6-Sts5 regulatory axis controls polarized growth and cell separation</title><p>Recent studies have shown that NDR/LATS kinase Orb6 similarly phosphorylates the Sts5 IDR to regulate its localization to RNP granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>).

While either Sts5-S86A or Sts5-S261A alone increased the number of Sts5 granules per cell, combining these mutations in Sts5-2A substantially increased granule number beyond either single mutant alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Increased Sts5 granule localization correlated with defects in cell morphology, septation, and viability. The single mutants S86A and S261A exhibited increased cell width compared to wildtype cells, but the double mutant Sts5-2A significantly increased cell width over either single mutant alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). This increased width is consistent with a partial <italic>orb</italic> phenotype for the Sts5-2A mutant, which exhibited additional cell polarity defects including an increased fraction of monopolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Beyond cell polarity, the septation index of Sts5-2A was significantly increased over wildtype and the single mutants, consistent with a defect in cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Past studies have shown that Sts5 binds to mRNAs and targets them to P bodies, which contain machinery to reduce mRNA levels and translation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malecki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uesono et al., 1997</xref>). Several transcripts related to cell morphology, including the protein kinases Ssp1 and Cmk2, are major targets of Sts5 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Sts5 localizes to P bodies through its IDR, consistent with the role of such domains in association with biomolecular condensates through a process akin to liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). In many cases, phosphorylation within an IDR prevents accumulation in condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Owen and Shewmaker, 2019</xref>). We hypothesized that phosphorylation by Pak1 and Orb6 could prevent Sts5 clustering and association with P bodies, thereby maintaining full expression of its targets such as Ssp1 and Cmk2. To test this idea, we performed colocalization experiments with Sts5-mNG and Sum2-tdTomato.

In contrast, Sts5-2A-mNG formed granules that colocalized with Sum2 and increased the number of P bodies per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

Why would two different kinases be required for this regulatory mechanism? We considered the possibility that Pak1 and Orb6 might respond to distinct physiological states to link Sts5 regulation with a range of growth conditions. Orb6 regulation of Sts5 has been connected to both cell cycle progression and nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaggi et al., 2012</xref>). We noted that glucose starvation serves as a signal for enhanced recruitment of Sts5 to stress granules in a manner that is reversed by reintroduction of glucose. Therefore, we tested the localization of Pak1, Orb6, and Sts5 during glucose starvation. Sts5 localized to large granules consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, Pak1 was similarly concentrated into cytoplasmic granules, but Orb6 remained diffuse in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine the nature of these granules, we tested their colocalization with the P body marker Sum2 and with the stress granule marker Pabp. P bodies are constitutive structures, while stress granules assemble during under specific conditions such as glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbet and Parker, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). P bodies and stress granules overlap and may share components during stress conditions, particularly in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). Both Pak1 and Sts5 granules colocalized with Sum2 and Pabp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and Pak1 and Sts5 colocalized together at granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We refer to Pak1 and Sts5 localization to stress granules during glucose deprivation due to colocalization with Pabp, but we note that this result formally supports association with the overlapping stress granule and P body structures.

Thus, Pak1 strongly associates with stress granules during glucose starvation but not during all environmental stresses. We tested if other cell polarity kinases, in addition to Pak1, also localized to stress granules during glucose starvation. For this experiment, we screened the localization of a panel of fluorescently tagged kinases in high (2%) versus low (0%) glucose conditions. Pck2 and Kin1 localized to cytoplasmic clusters during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). We note that Pck2 was recently shown to localize to stress granules during high heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanda et al., 2020</xref>).

We conclude that glucose starvation induces the redistribution of Pak1 away from sites of polarized growth and into stress granules, where it colocalizes with its substrate Sts5 and the P body marker Sum2.

Because Pak1 phosphorylates the Sts5 IDR to inhibit its clustering and association with P bodies, we hypothesized that Pak1 might promote Sts5 dissociation from stress granules upon glucose addition. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to prevent Pak1 localization to stress granules. PKA signaling has multiple effects on RNP granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nilsson and Sunnerhagen, 2011</xref>), so we needed a more direct method to disrupt Pak1 localization specifically.

We monitored the dissociation kinetics by measuring the concentration of Sts5-mNG per RNA granule following addition of glucose. In wildtype cells, Sts5 intensity rapidly dropped and plateaued to background levels by 5–6 min after addition of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, the rate of Sts5 loss from granules was reduced in Pak1-CAAX cells. Importantly, the levels of Sts5 at granules were identical in Pak1-CAAX and control cells at the time of glucose addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). However, Sts5 dissociated more slowly in Pak1-CAAX cells, and Sts5 levels did not reach background levels until 10 min in Pak1-CAAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). Reduced Sts5 dissociation kinetics in Pak1-CAAX cells was observed in multiple experimental replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>) and also caused a delay in reducing the number of Sts5 granules following addition of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

These results identify and define a new, bidirectional connection between PAK and RNP granules. This connection ensures proper cell morphology during nutrient-rich conditions and rewires PAK signaling during glucose starvation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The Orb polarity module</title><p>We identified Sts5 as a novel Pak1 substrate through an unbiased phosphoproteomic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>) followed by targeted studies in vitro and in vivo. PAKs are classically known to regulate cell morphology and signaling through Cdc42 and MAPK pathways, but our results demonstrate that Pak1 also acts through Sts5 and P bodies, thereby expanding Pak1 function in cell polarity through a glucose-dependent mechanism. This connection between a PAK and RNP granules provides a new mechanism that may operate in other organisms as well.</p><p>We found that Pak1 acts together with the NDR kinase Orb6 on Sts5. Both kinases phosphorylate the Sts5 IDR but at distinct residues: S86 for Orb6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) and S261 for Pak1. Preventing these modifications with the Sts5-2A mutant led to constitutive P body formation, increased cell width, and decreased viability during stress. Our work supports a model where phosphorylation of the Sts5 IDR by both Pak1 and Orb6 prevents Sts5 incorporation into P bodies. Sts5 binds and recruits mRNAs including <italic>ssp1</italic> into P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of regulation by Pak1 and Orb6 leads to decreased levels of Ssp1 and Cmk2 protein, consistent with translational repression and/or mRNA turnover at P bodies. In this model, phosphorylation by Pak1 and Orb6 may prevent Sts5 aggregates through multiple mechanisms. Past work has shown that phosphorylation by Orb6 enhances Sts5 binding to Rad24, a 14-3-3 protein that sequesters Sts5 away from P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we found that mutating both the Orb6 and Pak1 phosphorylation sites dramatically reduced Sts5-Rad24 interactions. We note that phosphorylation of proteins with IDRs appears to inhibit their incorporation into biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation both in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Owen and Shewmaker, 2019</xref>), meaning that phosphorylation of Sts5 IDR may contribute to both Rad24-dependent and -independent forms of regulation. More generally, the connection between RNPs and cell polarity is an emerging theme that has been described in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerbich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jansen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Our work supports a critical role for regulated assembly of P bodies in the cell polarity program that establishes and maintains cell morphology. Given the conservation of PAKs, NDR kinases, and P bodies, our work has implications for regulation of cell polarity by RNPs in other cell types and organisms.</p><p>In this mechanism, Pak1 and Orb6 appear to play very similar roles in regulation of Sts5, raising the question of why this system uses two distinct upstream kinases. We found that Pak1 but not Orb6 localizes to stress granules upon glucose starvation. This localization was not observed in other stresses or during specific cell cycle stages. Meanwhile, Orb6 activity is cell cycle-regulated, and Orb6 signaling to Sts5 becomes important during nitrogen stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Put together, these observations indicate that Pak1 and Orb6 respond to distinct physiological cues in their regulation of Sts5. In some cases, both Pak1 and Orb6 are active and likely to regulate Sts5 in an additive manner. In other cases, either Pak1 or Orb6 alone is active. By using protein kinases that respond differently to various cues, this mechanism may tune P body regulation to a range of physiological conditions.</p><p>We note that Pak1 (also called Orb2), Sts5 (also called Orb4), and Orb6 were all identified in the same genetic screen for <italic>orb</italic>-shaped mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snell and Nurse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verde et al., 1995</xref>). Our results unite these three factors in a shared regulatory mechanism. We observed increased cell width in the <italic>sts5-2A</italic> mutant, which loses phosphorylation by Pak1 and Orb6. This phenotype represents a partial <italic>orb</italic> shape, confirming its role in this process but also indicating that additional factors contribute to the complete <italic>orb</italic> shape defect. Consistent with this possibility, both Pak1 and Orb6 have additional substrates within the Cdc42 and exocytosis networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tay et al., 2019</xref>). Pak1 and Orb6 may control cell polarity through coordinated regulation of RNPs and Cdc42 signaling, or alternatively by acting independently on these two downstream targets. Additionally, the connection between Pak1, Orb6, and Sts5 raises the possibility that other <italic>orb</italic> genes also function in this mechanism. For example, Orb5 is also called Cka1, the catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snell and Nurse, 1994</xref>). In human cells, CK2 phosphorylates and activates PAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shin et al., 2013</xref>), but this connection has not been tested in fission yeast to our knowledge. Future studies may reveal the involvement of other Orb proteins in this shared regulatory mechanism centered on phospho-regulation of RNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation and function of Pak1 at stress granules</title><p>Our results show that Pak1 is recruited to stress granules during glucose starvation, raising two important questions. First, how is Pak1 recruited to stress granules? We found that Pak1 localization to stress granules is independent of Sts5 but requires PKA signaling. These combined data suggest that Pak1 binds to an unknown factor within RNPs, and this interaction depends on PKA. We note that PKA phosphorylates PAK1 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howe and Juliano, 2000</xref>), raising the possibility of direct regulation. However, PKA has multiple effects on RNP granule assembly during stress and is required for stress granule assembly during glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nilsson and Sunnerhagen, 2011</xref>). The effect of PKA on Pak1 localization may work through these broader effects on stress granules or alternatively on PKA-dependent phosphorylation of other stress granule proteins that bind to Pak1. Future work on PKA substrates within RNP granules could reveal how Pak1 localizes to these sites in a regulated manner.</p><p>A second important question is the function of Pak1 at stress granules. Pak1-CAAX prevented localization to granules and led to slower dissolution of Sts5 upon glucose addition. This result suggests that Pak1 at stress granules is poised to promote rapid release of its substrate Sts5 as cells re-enter polarized growth. This model is consistent with several other protein kinases that localize to RNP granules during specific stress conditions and function to dissolve granules upon removal of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shattuck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yahya et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, stress granules could represent a storage depot for inactive Pak1 when cells stop growth during glucose starvation. In support of this model, PKA inhibits PAK1 kinase activity in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howe and Juliano, 2000</xref>), and several other protein kinases have been shown to be sequestered at RNPs during various stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shah et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies will be directed at testing if/how PKA regulates Pak1 kinase activity during glucose starvation and refeeding. These two possibilities for the role of Pak1 at RNP granules are not mutually exclusive. It seems likely that these sites could both store Pak1 while keeping it close to a key substrate for rapid regulation in response to glucose. Given that the formation and dissolution of RNP granules is highly regulated by protein kinases and by stress conditions, the regulated localization of protein kinases to these sites may generally contribute to rapid control of RNP granules.</p><p>The localization of Pak1 to RNP granules does not appear to involve its canonical ligands within the Cdc42 regulatory module. We did not observe localization of Scd1, Scd2, or Cdc42 at granules. This result is consistent with Pak1 functioning to regulate cell polarity through a new independent mechanism with Sts5, but it also raises questions about how Pak1 is activated at granules. Like other PAKs, Pak1 is thought to adopt an autoinhibited conformation that is relieved by direct binding to activated Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tu and Wigler, 1999</xref>). While Cdc42 may transiently activate Pak1 at granules, several lines of evidence indicate that Pak1 could be active at granules without Cdc42. First, we and other groups have shown that recombinant full-length Pak1 expressed and purified from bacteria displays strong kinase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loo and Balasubramanian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pollard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 1999</xref>), which means that it is not autoinhibited under these conditions. Second, PAKs can also be activated by various classes of lipids and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bokoch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strochlic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zenke et al., 1999</xref>). The proteins that activate PAKs include protein kinases such as PDK, Akt, and CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>), as well as SH3 domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parrini, 2012</xref>). In fission yeast, the SH3 domain protein Skb5 has been shown to enhance Pak1 activity in the absence of Cdc42 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). We do not rule out a possible role for Cdc42 in the function of Pak1 at RNP granules, but these examples show that Pak1 could act at these sites without canonical GTPase-dependent activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study provides a molecular link between cell polarity signaling and the regulated assembly of RNP granules. The underlying mechanism involves two conserved protein kinases acting on a shared substrate to control its recruitment into biomolecular condensates.

Our results also unite two conserved protein kinases in a shared mechanism, raising the possibility for similar connections between PAK and NDR kinases in other organisms. Finally, recruitment of Pak1 and other kinases to RNP granules during stress points to growing roles for these enzymes in controlling the dynamics of granule assembly, disassembly, and function in additional cell types and organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain construction and media</title><p>Standard <italic>S. pombe</italic> media and methods were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>).

The NanoString nCounter Elements XT assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) at the Molecular Biology Core Facility at Dartmouth College. Total RNA was hybridized with user-designed target-specific oligonucleotide probes and TagSets, which can detect gene expression levels by using fluorescently labeled barcoded reporters that recognize sequence-specific tags. Reactions were incubated at 67°C for 18 hr. Subsequently, samples were loaded to the nCounter PrepStation (NanoString Technologies), which automatically performs purification steps and cartridge preparation. Finally, the cartridges containing immobilized and aligned reporter complexes were transferred to the nCounter Digital Analyzer (NanoString Technologies), set at a high-resolution setting, which captures up to 280 fields of view (FOVs) per sample providing all gene counts. Raw data was collected and preprocessed by nSolver Analysis Software v4.0 (NanoString Technologies).

fission yeast as. a model to understand how RNP granules participate in important signal transduction events and how these control cell physiology, via growth/polarity control. The key molecule investigated is the highly conserved Pak1 kinase (well characterized as a Cdc42 GTPase effector). The paper brings together investigation of sts5, pak1-kinase and how these together regulate P bodies during glucose starvation. The work is of broad interest to cell biologists and RNA biologists working across scales.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pak1 kinase regulates ribonucleoprotein granules through Sts5 for polarized growth and the glucose starvation response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Fulvia Verde (Reviewer #2); Dr. Takashi Toda (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please make sure you address the following essential revisions in full, some of which require new experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The usage of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules</p><p>In this manuscript, two types of RNP granules are investigated: one is P body and the other is stress granule (SG). P bodies constitutively exist under all conditions, while SGs assemble only under stressed conditions including glucose starvation. It is true that P bodies coalesce with SGs under stresses, but as far as I am concerned, these two types of RNP granules are different. I think it would be better for the authors to use SGs in the text instead of RNP granules when they describe results under glucose deprivation (Figures 4-7). Also, in Figure 7D, RNP should be replaced with SG.</p><p>2) Binding between Sts5 and 14-3-3</p><p>Previous work (Nuñez et al., 2016) showed that Orb6-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5 promotes binding between Sts5 and 14-3-3, thereby inhibiting its localization to P bodies. Is this also the case for Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5? Or in this case, does phosphorylation of serines (S261, S264) within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) somehow (maybe by disrupting the disordered feature of the IDR?) interfere with the inclusion of Sts5 into P bodies?</p><p>3) A marker of SGs</p><p>This is related to point (1). I think that the authors should have used an authentic marker of SGs, not Sum2 (a marker of P bodies), in experiments under glucose deprivation. At least, co-localization between Sum2 and a marker for SGs under this condition should be shown.</p><p>4) Dissolution of Sts5 from RNP granules upon glucose re-addition: Figure 7</p><p>Tethering experiments presented in Figure 7 are of great interest. The difference with regards to the degree of dissolution of Sts5 between wild type cells and those containing CAAX-tethered Pak1 is modest, yet I think it convincing after I scrutinize all the data including those shown in Supplements. I am interested in the physiological consequences, if any, by this tethering. It looks to this referee that cell shape is substantially different between wild type and Pak1-CAAX strains (shown in the bottom row in Figure 7B). I would like to request showing quantification of cell length and width in these cells. I suspect that cells containing Pak1-CAAX display more roundish morphology upon glucose re-addition, which would represent down-regulation of Sts5 function.</p><p>5) Does loss of sts5 suppresses any viability or cell separation defects of pak1 mutants, similarly to what happens in orb6 mutants?</p><p>6) Following Pak1 kinase activity during glucose deprivation and refeeding could shed light on the dynamics of the Pka1/Pak1 regulatory pathway. Does Pka1 affects Pak1 kinase activity with or without glucose stress and during refeeding?</p><p>7) Do pak1-CAAX mutants display a delay in resuming polarized cell growth following glucose starvation, as compared with controls? This effect would further support a role for Pak1 in Sts5 dissolution and resumption of translation of specific mRNAs.</p><p>(8) The claim that absence of Orb6 and Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5 concentrates Sts5 predominantly to P bodies and causes downregulation of translation of target mRNA should be reconsidered. While Figure 3B shows colocalization among some Sts5(2A)+ and Sum2+ puncta, some Sts5(2A)+ Sum2- and Sts5(2A)- Sum2+ puncta are also present. The effect on translation levels should be validated by investigating at least a few other Sts5 mRNA targets (both the levels of mRNA and their protein products should be tested). The model presented in Figure 3F seems to be premature at this stage.</p><p>9) The difference in the rates of Sts5 puncta dissolution in presence or absence of punctate Pak1 (Figure 7C) is modest. The authors may consider investigating the physiological consequence of the observed difference in dissolution rates, which remains unclear. Further, not all Sts5+ puncta contain Pak1 (Figure 4D). Have the authors considered scoring the dissolution rates of Sts5+ Pak1+ vs. Sts5+ Pak1- puncta separately?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Magliozzi et al. study the interaction of three proteins that have earlier been identified to control cell shape in fission yeast. Two of these are the kinases Pak1 and Orb6. The third is an RNA-binding protein called Sts5. It has been shown earlier that Sts5 uses an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to concentrate in P bodies, and Orb6-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5-IDR reduces the association of Sts5 with P bodies.</p><p>It was unknown if Sts5 is also phosphorylated by Pak1. The authors begin by using biochemistry to show that Pak1 phosphorylates Sts5-IDR at residues S261 and S264. Orb6 has been shown earlier to phosphorylate Sts5 at residue S86. Using non-phosphorylation-competent mutants of Sts5 in vivo, the authors demonstrate that phosphorylation at these residues is important to maintain diffuse distribution of Sts5 in the cytoplasm. In absence of phosphorylation by Orb6 and/or Pak1, increasing fractions of Sts5 protein concentrate in cytoplasmic puncta. This is accompanied by defects in cell morphology, septation and viability. The authors claim that these Sts5+ puncta are P bodies, based on (a) colocalization of some of these puncta with the P body marker Sum2, and (b) decrease of cellular levels of a protein SSp1 concomitant with concentration of Sts5 in puncta (Sts5 is known to bind ssp1 mRNA).</p><p>Next, the authors show that the intracellular localization of Pak1 depends on the amount of glucose in the growth medium (2% vs 0% glucose). In absence of glucose, Pak1 relocates from the cell cortex to join Sts5 in P bodies (tracked by Sum2). This relocalization is dependent on Pka1 (the catalytic subunit of Protein kinase A) in contrast to the Cdc42-associated cell polarity regulatory module. In contrast to Pak1, absence of glucose in the medium did not have any effect on the localization of the other kinase Orb6. In order to address the consequence of relocalization of the kinase Pak1 to P bodies, the authors generated a construct Pak1-CAAX that remained localized to the cortex in absence of glucose. The authors claim that localization of Pak1 to P bodies increase the rate of dissolution of Sts5 puncta.</p><p>Taken together, the authors provide new mechanistic insights into the interplay of Pak1, Orb6 and Sts5 when fission yeast is grown in medium containing different amounts of glucose.</p><p>(1) The claim that absence of Orb6 and Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5 concentrates Sts5 predominantly to P bodies and causes downregulation of translation of target mRNA would need to be reconsidered. While Figure 3B shows colocalization among some Sts5(2A)+ and Sum2+ puncta, some Sts5(2A)+ Sum2- and Sts5(2A)- Sum2+ puncta are also present. The effect on translation levels should be validated by investigating at least a few other Sts5 mRNA targets (both the levels of mRNA and their protein products should be tested). The model presented in Figure 3F seems to be premature at this stage.</p><p>2) The difference in the rates of Sts5 puncta dissolution in presence or absence of punctate Pak1 (Figure 7C) is modest. The authors may consider investigating the physiological consequence of the observed difference in dissolution rates, which remains unclear. Further, not all Sts5+ puncta contain Pak1 (Figure 4D). It would be good to know whether the authors have considered scoring the dissolution rates of Sts5+ Pak1+ vs. Sts5+ Pak1- puncta separately.</p><p>3) The authors could consider revising the Introduction and Discussion section to make them more focused.</p><p>4) The cell outlines in Figure 3B (Sum2-tdTomato panel) are misleading.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors characterize the role of fission yeast Pak1 kinase in the control of mRNA binding protein Sts5 and in P-bodies assembly. Sts5 was previously identified as a substrate of Pak1 kinase in a previous paper by the same group. In this current manuscript the authors characterize the role of Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of two sites (S261 and S264), in the unstructured domain of Sts5, and show that loss of phosphorylation promotes Sts5 assembly. A sts5 mutant mimicking a dephosphorylated state of these two sites presents increased asymmetric cell growth (monopolarity) and increased septation index.</p><p>Interestingly, increased Sts5 assembly and morphological anomalies comprise a phenotype that is very reminiscent of the Sts5-S86A mutant, which is modified on a residue that is phosphorylated by Orb6 kinase and was previously characterized by a different lab. Consistent with previous observations that orb6 and pak1 mutants are synthetically lethal, the S261A mutation displays an additive effect with S86A, in promoting Sts5 granule formation, altering cell morphology, and delaying septation.</p><p>Using the Sum2 protein as a P-bodies marker, the authors show that increased granule assembly of the Sts5 S86A/S261A protein leads to increased numbers of P-bodies; further, this effect leads to decreased Ssp1 protein levels of Ssp1, a protein encoded by one of the Sts5-associated mRNAs, also consistent with previous findings.</p><p>Next, the authors define a crucial difference between Orb6 and Pak1, in that during glucose deprivation, a stress that leads to P bodies assembly, Pak1 kinase localizes to P bodies (and co-localizes with Sts5), while Orb6 kinase does not. Pak1 localization to P-bodies does not include factors that cooperate with Pak1 in the control of cell polarity, such as Scd1, Scd2, or Cdc42 GTPase. The authors note that other kinases, such as Kin1 and Pck2, also have the ability to associate into granules that, in part, include Sum2. Finally, they find that Pak1 localization to P bodies during stress depends on the glucose sensing pathway mediated by Pka1 kinase. Consistent with a potential role for Pak1 kinase in Sts5 granule dissolution, preventing Pak1 localization to the cytoplasm subtly delays Sts5 granule disassembly upon glucose refeeding.</p><p>This paper highlights a novel function for Pak1 kinase in the control of RNP dynamics, and nicely align itself with previously published data. It extends our knowledge of the signal integration that controls the coalescence of Sts5 into granules and the assembly of P-bodies. Further, these observations also identify a role for glucose sensing Pka1 kinase in the control of Pak1 localization to the P-bodies, a function that is independent of the polarity factors Pak1 is known to associate with.</p><p>1. It should be noted that observations regarding Orb6 kinase phosphorylation of Serine 86, and the role of this residue in regulating Sts5 granule assembly were previously published (Chen et al., 2019). The role of Pak1 in Sts5 phosphorylation, and the specific residues phosphorylated by Pak1 kinase were also previously identified (Magliozzi et al., 2020). Therefore, the fact that Orb6 and Pak1 phosphorylate distinct residues of Sts5 or that Orb6 regulates Sts5 IDR is not a novel discovery in this paper (as mentioned repeatedly in lines 83-84 , 99-100, 158-161, 177-78, 186-87, etc.). However, the fact that Pak1 function had additive properties to Orb6 kinase in controlling the state of Sts5 granule assembly, in particular under conditions of glucose deprivation, is a novel, interesting expansion of knowledge.</p><p>2. Importantly, the authors refer to &quot;stress granules&quot; in several titles (line 185, line 225, line 244). These statements do not correspond to the data presented and should be corrected. Stress granules (SG granules) are separate membraneless organelles that contain specific factors, differentiating them from P-bodies. The marker Sum2, which is used in the paper, does not identify stress granules, but rather it colocalizes with Dcp1, a component of P-bodies. Therefore, data presented here supports the role of Pak1 in the control of P-bodies, not stress granules.</p><p>3. The 2% glucose control cells used for experiments shown in Figure 4 (Figure 4, Supplement 1) appear very stressed. P-bodies (as visualized by Sum2) do not condense in healthy, exponentially growing cells. While this effect does not invalidate the results of the experiments shown in Figure 4, it would need to be corrected.</p><p>4. Extending the quantification in Figure 7B, to include numbers of Sts5 granules (not only overall fluorescence intensity) would give a more precise assessment of the effects of Pak1 removal on Sts5 granule disassembly.</p><p>The overall results are interesting and the experiments are solidly performed and analyzed.</p><p>The paper could be strengthened by genetic epistasis experiments and by following up on the novelty of the Pka1-Pak1 regulatory axis.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. Does loss of sts5 suppresses any viability or cell separation defects of pak1 mutants, similarly to what happens in orb6 mutants?</p><p>2. Following Pak1 kinase activity during glucose deprivation and refeeding could shed light on the dynamics of the Pka1/Pak1 regulatory pathway. Does Pka1 affects Pak1 kinase activity with or without glucose stress and during refeeding?</p><p>3. Do pak1-CAAX mutants display a delay in resuming polarized cell growth following glucose starvation, as compared with controls? This effect would further support a role for Pak1 in Sts5 dissolution and resumption of translation of specific mRNAs.</p><p>4. What is the rationale of switching between Tukey's and Dunnett's methods in some of the ANOVA analyses?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Fission yeast RNA-binding protein Sts5 is known to localize to P bodies (intracellular granules consisting of RNAs and proteins (ribonucleoproteins, RNPs)), by which this protein plays an important role in cell morphogenesis and polarity. P bodies-localizing Sts5 binds many species of mRNAs encoding regulatory factors required for polarized cell growth, thereby repressing their translation. The Orb6 kinase (a member of the NDR/LATS kinase family) directly phosphorylates Sts5, which restrains localization of Sts5 to P bodies, resulting in proper polarized growth.</p><p>In this manuscript, Magliozzi and Moseley have shown that Sts5 is phosphorylated also by the Pak1 kinase (the p21-activated kinase). The phosphorylation site is different from that mediated by Orb6. Interestingly, this phosphorylation also inhibits P bodies-localization of Sts5, which acts independently of and additively with Orb6. The authors have found that upon glucose deprivation, Pak1 together with Sts5 is recruited to RNP granules (stress granules, SGs). Localization of Pak1, but not that of Sts5, is dependent upon protein A kinase (PKA) signalling. They propose that Pak1 localization to RNP granules promotes rapid dissolution of Sts5 from SGs upon glucose re-addition.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A technically sound dataset is presented.

Also, in Figure 7D, RNP should be replaced with SG.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this recommendation. We now refer to stress granules for experiments under glucose starvation.

Is this also the case for Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5? Or in this case, does phosphorylation of serines (S261, S264) within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) somehow (maybe by disrupting the disordered feature of the IDR?) interfere with the inclusion of Sts5 into P bodies?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion, which led to new figures in the revised manuscript (Figures3C,D and Figure 3 Supp 1). We tested Sts5-Rad24 interactions using coimmunoprecipitation and found that S261A reduced this interaction similarly to S86A. Further, the double mutant had an additive effect and nearly abolished Sts5-Rad24 interactions. We conclude that Pak1 phosphorylates Sts5 to promote its binding to Rad24, and this interaction prevents protein clustering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A marker of SGs</p><p>This is related to point (1). I think that the authors should have used an authentic marker of SGs, not Sum2 (a marker of P bodies), in experiments under glucose deprivation. At least, co-localization between Sum2 and a marker for SGs under this condition should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this recommendation, which led to new data and a clearer picture of Pak1 localization to stress granules. As shown in the new Figure 5 Supp 2, we found that Pak1 and Sts5 both colocalize with Pabp, in addition to their colocalization with Sum2. Pabp is the major poly-A binding protein and a marker of stress granules. It is important to note that Pabp and Sum2 also colocalize with each other during glucose deprivation, consistent with previous studies showing that P bodies and stress granules are overlapping structures in yeast cells (Buchan et al., <italic>J Cell Biol</italic>., 2008; Protter and Parker, <italic>Trends Cell Biol</italic>., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Dissolution of Sts5 from RNP granules upon glucose re-addition: Figure 7</p><p>Tethering experiments presented in Figure 7 are of great interest.

Does Pka1 affects Pak1 kinase activity with or without glucose stress and during refeeding?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and attempted to address these questions with new experiments. Unfortunately, two technical problems prevented us from obtaining clear answers. First, our preferred method to assay kinase activity (<sup>32</sup>P-ATP) is not currently available to us due to covid-related limitations in access. As an alternative, we attempted to test Pak1 kinase activity with SDS-PAGE band shifts but did not obtain conclusive results. Second, our attempts to isolate Pak1 from cells at timepoints during glucose starvation-refeeding did not yield clean purifications for in vitro testing. We have several ideas for how to address this important question going forward, but clearly it will require an extended period of time to establish reliable assays. To emphasize the importance of the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the following statement into the revised manuscript: “Future studies will be directed at testing if/how PKA regulates Pak1 kinase activity during glucose starvation and refeeding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do pak1-CAAX mutants display a delay in resuming polarized cell growth following glucose starvation, as compared with controls? This effect would further support a role for Pak1 in Sts5 dissolution and resumption of translation of specific mRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion but had difficulty obtaining clear results to this question. In brightfield microscopy videos, we observed a long delay in the resumption of tip growth for Pak1-CAAX versus wild type cells. However, the Pak1-CAAX cells have polarity and tip growth defects even under high glucose conditions, likely because the CAAX motif restricts Pak1 dynamics under all conditions. In our videos, it was not clear if the Pak1-CAAX cells resumed growth isotropically upon glucose addition. In addition, the delay in resuming clearly polarized growth was substantially longer than the delay in Sts5 dissolution, indicating that the growth delay likely reflects myriad changes in this strain. To avoid overinterpreting this result, we would prefer not to include it in this manuscript. We hope to clarify this issue with additional assays and controls in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The claim that absence of Orb6 and Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5 concentrates Sts5 predominantly to P bodies and causes downregulation of translation of target mRNA should be reconsidered. While Figure 3B shows colocalization among some Sts5(2A)+ and Sum2+ puncta, some Sts5(2A)+ Sum2- and Sts5(2A)- Sum2+ puncta are also present. The effect on translation levels should be validated by investigating at least a few other Sts5 mRNA targets (both the levels of mRNA and their protein products should be tested). The model presented in Figure 3F seems to be premature at this stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We extended our results beyond Ssp1 in response to this suggestion. In Figure 4 of the revised manuscript, we report that Cmk2 protein levels are also reduced in the <italic>sts5-2A</italic> mutant, similarly to Ssp1. The transcript levels of both <italic>ssp1</italic> and <italic>cmk2</italic> were previously shown to be upregulated in <italic>sts5∆</italic> cells (Nunez et al., 2016), consistent with lower protein levels in the hyperactive <italic>sts5-2A</italic> mutant.

However, our analysis relied on fixed cells due to technical difficulties including photobleaching during time-lapse experiments. We attempted to address this question using several different approaches including microfluidics and chambered coverslips, but we were unable to reliably track and measure single granules. We will continue to trouble-shoot these issues going forward, but for the revised manuscript we focused on extending our fixed cell approach as in the new Figure 8D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] (1) The claim that absence of Orb6 and Pak1-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5 concentrates Sts5 predominantly to P bodies and causes downregulation of translation of target mRNA would need to be reconsidered.

It should be noted that observations regarding Orb6 kinase phosphorylation of Serine 86, and the role of this residue in regulating Sts5 granule assembly were previously published (Chen et al., 2019). The role of Pak1 in Sts5 phosphorylation, and the specific residues phosphorylated by Pak1 kinase were also previously identified (Magliozzi et al., 2020). Therefore, the fact that Orb6 and Pak1 phosphorylate distinct residues of Sts5 or that Orb6 regulates Sts5 IDR is not a novel discovery in this paper (as mentioned repeatedly in lines 83-84 , 99-100, 158-161, 177-78, 186-87, etc.). However, the fact that Pak1 function had additive properties to Orb6 kinase in controlling the state of Sts5 granule assembly, in particular under conditions of glucose deprivation, is a novel, interesting expansion of knowledge.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to focus on the additive nature of this regulatory mechanism as suggested by the reviewer. It is worth noting that Figure 1 of our current manuscript is dedicated to establishing Sts5-S261 as a direct target of Pak1, which was not established in our 2020 publication and therefore represents a novel finding. Based on this novel finding which required in vitro reconstitution and phosphorylation-site mutants (Figure 1), we can now conclude that Pak1 and Orb6 phosphorylate distinct residues. We have attempted to be explicit and clear that Orb6 phosphorylation of Sts5-S86 was discovered by Chen et al., 2019, while stating that our contribution to understanding this additive mechanism relates to Sts5-S261. We hope that our wording appropriately balances credit for these discoveries, <italic>e.g.</italic> “Recent studies have shown that NDR/LATS kinase Orb6 similarly phosphorylates the Sts5 IDR to regulate its localization to RNP granules (Figure 2A) (Chen et al., 2019; Nuñez et al., 2016). Importantly, Orb6 phosphorylates S86 in the Sts5 IDR (Chen et al., 2019), while we have shown that Pak1 directly phosphorylates S261.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Importantly, the authors refer to &quot;stress granules&quot; in several titles (line 185, line 225, line 244). These statements do not correspond to the data presented and should be corrected. Stress granules (SG granules) are separate membraneless organelles that contain specific factors, differentiating them from P-bodies. The marker Sum2, which is used in the paper, does not identify stress granules, but rather it colocalizes with Dcp1, a component of P-bodies. Therefore, data presented here supports the role of Pak1 in the control of P-bodies, not stress granules.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this clarification. Based on this comment, we performed a series of additional colocalization experiments using a stress granule marker Pabp-mRFP. During glucose starvation, Sts5, Pak1, and Sum2 all strongly colocalized with Pabp (new Figure 5 Supp 2). Based on this result, we state in the revised text: “We refer to Pak1 and Sts5 localization to stress granules during glucose deprivation due to colocalization with Pabp, but we note that this result formally supports association with the overlapping stress granule and P body structures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The 2% glucose control cells used for experiments shown in Figure 4 (Figure 4, Supplement 1) appear very stressed. P-bodies (as visualized by Sum2) do not condense in healthy, exponentially growing cells. While this effect does not invalidate the results of the experiments shown in Figure 4, it would need to be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>These cells were cultured in rich media and displayed no defects in growth rate or other proxies for cell health. Previous studies have shown that P bodies are constitutive structures that can be observed in exponentially growing fission yeast cells (Nilsson and Sunnerhagen, <italic>RNA</italic>, 2011; Wang et al., <italic>Mol Cell Biol</italic>, 2013; Wang et al., <italic>RNA</italic>, 2017) as well as budding yeast cells (Nissan and Parker, <italic>Methods in Enzymology</italic>, 2008). Consistent with these previous studies, we routinely observe P bodies in unstressed cells. These P bodies then become significantly enhanced upon stress such as glucose starvation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
