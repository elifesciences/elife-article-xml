CS occurs when the acquisition of resistance to one antibiotic produces increased susceptibility to a second antibiotic. Recent studies have focused on CS strategies designed against ABR mediated by chromosomal mutations. However, one of the main drivers of ABR in clinically relevant bacteria is the horizontal transfer of ABR genes mediated by plasmids. Here, we report the first analysis of CS associated with the acquisition of complete ABR plasmids, including the clinically important carbapenem-resistance conjugative plasmid pOXA-48.

There is therefore an urgent need for new treatment strategies to fight against resistant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baym et al., 2016</xref>). Among the most promising alternatives, much attention has focused on collateral sensitivity (CS). CS occurs when the acquisition of resistance to one antibiotic causes increased susceptibility to a second antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szybalski and Bryson, 1952</xref>) and can be exploited for the design of multi-drug strategies that select against ABR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imamovic and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lázár et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the development of resistance might be prevented by treatments based on the sequential cycling of antibiotics whose resistance mechanisms produce reciprocal CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imamovic and Sommer, 2013</xref>). Several studies have cataloged CS networks emerging from mutations in chromosomal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imamovic and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lázár et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maltas and Wood, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Podnecky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roemhild et al., 2020</xref>) and plasmid genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dortet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fröhlich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosenkilde et al., 2019</xref>), but the CS effects produced by the horizontal acquisition of ABR plasmids remain poorly understood.</p><p>Mobile genetic elements, especially plasmids, play a crucial role in the dissemination of ABR genes between clinical pathogens and are one of the major drivers of the alarming worldwide rise in ABR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Partridge et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the evolutionary advantage conferred by plasmids in the presence of antibiotics, plasmid acquisition tends to produce common metabolic alterations in the host bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">San Millan et al., 2018</xref>), that typically translate into a fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">San Millan and MacLean, 2017</xref>). We reasoned that the physiological alterations produced upon acquisition of ABR plasmids might lead to exploitable CS responses. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the collateral effects associated with the acquisition of six natural plasmids carrying clinically relevant ABR genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MG1655. Our results reveal that most ABR plasmids, including the clinically important carbapenem-resistance conjugative plasmid pOXA-48, produce CS events of moderate effect.

For this analysis, we determined the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC, see Materials and methods) using the broth microdilution method for plasmid-free MG1655 and each of its six plasmid-carrying derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). We analyzed the collateral antibiotic susceptibility effects associated with the presence of each plasmid, measured as the fold-change in the antibiotic MIC between plasmid-carrying and plasmid-free bacteria. As expected from their genetic content, all plasmids conferred resistance to ß-lactam antibiotics and most of them conferred additional resistance to other antibiotics from unrelated families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Initially, we defined CS events as those plasmid-antibiotic combinations showing a minimum twofold reduction in MIC (calculated as the fold-change of the median MIC value obtained from four to five independent MIC determinations). We then performed additional MIC determinations (up to 10 replicates each) for the antibiotic-plasmid combinations that fulfilled this criterion to increase the robustness of our analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). This led to the identification of seven CS instances producing a consistent ≥2-fold reduction in antibiotic susceptibility, of which six showed significant reductions in antibiotic susceptibility (pOXA-48–azithromycin, pCF12–azithromycin, pOXA-48–colistin, pCF12–kanamycin, pKAZ3–kanamycin, and pKAZ3-gentamicin; Mann-Whitney U test; p&lt;0.015 in all cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of note, CS to tetracycline elicited by pKA2Q did not reach statistical significance (Mann-Whitney U test; p=0.2), yet we decided to maintain it for subsequent analysis.</p><p>To further validate MIC results, we conducted two complementary series of experiments for the seven cases of plasmid-induced CS: (i) complete growth curves under a range of antibiotic concentrations and (ii) disk-diffusion antibiograms on agar plates. Analysis of the area under the growth curve, which integrates all growth parameters (maximum growth rate, lag duration and carrying capacity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DelaFuente et al., 2020</xref>), confirmed significant plasmid-mediated CS effects at different antibiotic concentrations for six of the combinations (pOXA-48–azithromycin, pCF12–azithromycin, pOXA-48–colistin, pCF12–kanamycin, pKAZ3–kanamycin, and pKA2Q–tetracycline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). The disk-diffusion results largely agreed with the MIC and growth-curve data, showing a general trend toward an increased diameter of the antibiotic inhibition zone in plasmid-carrying strains compared with plasmid-free MG1655 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These differences were statistically significant for pCF12–kanamycin, pCF12–azithromycin, pOXA-48–azithromycin, pOXA-48–colistin, and pKA2Q–tetracycline (unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction; p&lt;0.044 in all cases). Overall, six of the seven CS instances initially identified were validated with at least one of the additional methods (growth curves or disk-diffusion assays), and four of them showed full agreement across all three methods. The disk-diffusion assays produced notably robust results with minimum hands-on time, suggesting that this technique is appropriate for screening CS responses in large strain collections. Together, these results demonstrate that ABR plasmids produce moderate but significant CS to different antibiotics, comparable to that generated by ABR chromosomal mutations in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imamovic and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lázár et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Podnecky et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conservation of pOXA-48-mediated CS</title><p>The success and applicability of CS-informed therapeutic strategies are crucially dependent on the conservation of CS across diverse genetic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Podnecky et al., 2018</xref>).

In contrast, CS to colistin was conserved in only two of the tested strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We rationally selected four <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates and their pOXA-48 carrying derivatives showing the following defined CS profiles: to colistin only (Ec10), to azithromycin only (Ec21 and Ec25), or to both antibiotics (Ec18). MG1655 was included as a control. Plasmid-bearers and plasmid-free strains were propagated separately in the presence of a single antibiotic or with sequential exposure to both antibiotics over 2 days. On the first day of the experiment, 24 bacterial populations of each strain were inoculated into media containing either colistin (4 mg/L) or azithromycin (8 mg/L). After 22 hr, populations able to grow were transferred to fresh media containing colistin or azithromycin in a full factorial experimental design. This approach gave rise to four antibiotic treatments: two single-drug treatments (denoted Azi→ Azi and Col→ Col) and two treatments in which the antibiotic changed (Azi→ Col and Col→ Azi). In 11 of the 20 possible strain-treatment combinations, pOXA-48–carrying populations showed higher mortality rates than their plasmid-free counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; log-rank test p&lt;0.001 in all cases). As we used fixed antibiotic concentrations, the results of this experiment are likely to depend on the interplay between the particular resistance levels of each strain and the order in which the antibiotics are used. This may explain why we failed to observe significant differences in the cases in which the antibiotic treatment produced a sudden drop in viability for both plasmid-bearers and plasmid-free strains. Nevertheless, the mortality patterns observed were consistent with the CS patterns obtained in the disk-diffusion technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For instance, plasmid-carrying MG1655 and Ec18 strains, which show CS to both antibiotics, exhibited significant reductions in survival in all treatments. In contrast, for strain Ec10, which shows CS exclusively to colistin, selective killing was observed only when the treatment included colistin as the first antibiotic (Col→ Col or Col→ Azi).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Plasmid-mediated CS can be exploited to preferentially kill plasmid-carrying bacteria.</title><p>Survival curves of plasmid-free (gray solid lines) and plasmid-carrying (red dashed lines) bacterial populations in response to constant or sequential antibiotic treatments.

These findings thus serve as a stepping stone toward the development of new approaches aimed at blocking plasmid-mediated horizontal spread of ABR genes. These anti-plasmid strategies could help to tackle the alarming clinical and community spread of ABR. However, the molecular basis of plasmid-associated CS is currently unknown. The feasibility of rational broad-spectrum anti-plasmid strategies will depend on gaining comprehensive knowledge about the molecular mechanisms that increase antibiotic susceptibility upon plasmid acquisition. Until these therapies are available, CS-informed empirical treatment of plasmid-carrying bacteria has the potential to help resolve antibiotic resistant infections. In this regard, our results suggest that colistin and azithromycin may be valuable antibiotics for the treatment of pOXA-48–carrying enterobacteria. Both antibiotics are already used to treat enterobacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lübbert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morrill et al., 2015</xref>), and colistin in particular is currently used as a last resort antibiotic against carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodriguez-Baño et al., 2018</xref>). A limitation of our experimental setup is that plasmid-bearers and plasmid-free populations were subjected to antibiotic treatments separately. More experiments are thus required to confirm that CS-informed treatments can eradicate plasmid-carrying bacteria from mixed populations and to gauge the clinical relevance of our results. In addition, future studies should focus on determining the best treatment option. Sequential treatments offer a promising strategy, as they better exploit evolutionary trade-offs (such as CS) to constraint ABR development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roemhild and Schulenburg, 2019</xref>). Combination therapies might also provide a valuable strategy as long as both antibiotics act synergistically to inhibit bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tamma et al., 2012</xref>). In summary, although extensive work will be needed before these therapies are available, the findings presented here open new avenues of research aimed at understanding plasmid-associated CS and pave the way for the development of new CS-based treatment strategies to combat plasmid-mediated ABR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions</title><p>All experiments were performed in liquid Lennox lysogeny broth (LB; CONDA) or on LB agar (15 g/L) unless indicated.

Pre-cultures were incubated at 37°C with 225 rpm shaking overnight in 96-well plates carrying 200 μl of LB broth per well. Pre-cultures were mixed at 1:1 proportion and diluted 1:400 in fresh media. Initial proportions of GFP and non-fluorescent competitors were confirmed in a CytoFLEX Platform (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) flow cytometer, recording 10,000 events per sample. To measure these proportions, we incubated a culture aliquot in NaCl 0.9% containing 0.5% L-arabinose for 1.5 hr to induce the expression of the chromosomal GFP. Mixtures were competed for 22 hr in LB medium at 37°C with shaking (225 rpm). Final proportions were estimated again by flow cytometry as described above.

Six biological replicates were performed for each competition. We performed control experiments mimicking the growth conditions of the competition experiments to ensure that plasmid loss in plasmid-carrying strains is negligible.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Adam C Palmer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes very clearly a set of experiments to assess collateral sensitivity to certain antibiotics that is created by carriage of β-lactam (including carbapenenem) resistance plasmids in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This addresses one of the limitations of existing literature on CS, which typically focuses on the effects of resistance point mutations, which are clinically less significant. By documenting multiple ways that this CS is real and selectable and to a degree generalizable across genetic backgrounds, this is an important contribution in showing that CS is a real phenomenon for clinically important resistance mechanisms.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The primary screen of “antibiotics x plasmids” to identify collateral sensitivity, presented in Figure 1B, lacks an analysis of the statistical significance of results. Supplementary data shows that measurements of MIC are a little too noisy to robustly identify 2-fold changes with only 4 or 5 replicates. Defining &quot;significant&quot; as &quot;mean more than 2x&quot; is not adequate. Using a power calculation derived from the data in the manuscript, a sample size should be determined to have a 90 (or other high) % chance of detecting a 2x difference given the variability observed between assays, and then they should be done. Ideally this would be for all organism-plasmid pairs, but at least for the ones that the preliminary screen found a mean of 2x for.</p><p>2) Recommendation (not required for acceptance, but please temper claims of clinical relevance if not done): The comparative killing data should be repeated in competition. This is technically more challenging but I believe not more so than the comparative growth curves. This would establish as proof of principle that a mixed population could be purified of plasmid-bearers by CS. Without this, the clinical relevance will still remain speculative. Also, two reviewers initially misread these as competition assays. The text and legend should emphasize that these are separate populations</p><p>3) (not required for acceptance but suggestion for future work): The presented work is solid but, as pointed out by the authors, there is no mechanistic explanations for the observations. It would be highly interesting to know if the collateral effects are due to specific genes (OXA-48 would be a good place to start) and/or if the observed effects are due to the plasmid backbone.</p><p>4) The experiment in Figure 3 demonstrates the exploitation of collateral sensitivity to preferentially inhibit plasmid-bearing bacteria. The terminology in this section refers to “eradicate”, “mortality” etc, but in practice, the experiment defines survival as OD&gt;0.2 after ~24 hours. It seems likely that in the “non-surviving” conditions, waiting another day or two would show regrowth of some bacteria in these conditions. We don't think this requires any change to the experiment, only how the results are described: they show preferential inhibition of growth, not eradication. A more patient approach to identifying regrowth would be necessary to definitively state that these bacterial populations have been eradicated. Suggest tempering claims.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Collateral sensitivity associated with antibiotic resistance plasmids&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As suggested, we performed power analyses for the combinations where we detected a difference of at least 2x in the initial analysis, assuming normality of the data [as nonparametric power analysis is not trivial (Shieh et al., 2006)]. The results show that 10-50 replicates would be required to statistically validate this difference (at α=0.05 and a power of 0.80; https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html). We have now performed additional MIC determinations (total of 10 biological replicates) and statistical tests for the plasmid-antibiotic combinations that were identified in the preliminary screening. New data using 10 biological replicates shows that 6 out of the 8 originally described CS instances are indeed significant (MannWhitney U test; P&lt;0.015 in all cases). For the remaining 2 non-significant CS instances, one (pCF12-tetracycline) does not reach the ≥2x threshold after combining data from all replicates, so we decided to remove it from subsequent analyses. The other non-significant event (pKA2Qtetracycline) is above the 2x threshold, but the difference is not statistically significant (MannWhitney U test; P=0.2039). The results of the power analysis showed that 50 replicates per genotype (MG/pKA2Q and MG1655) would be required to statistically validate this difference. Given that the CS produced by pKA2Q is statistically validated with both growth curves and disk assays, we honestly believe that performing that many replicates is unnecessary.</p><p>These changes have been introduced in the text and in the figure legend where we now state that MIC determinations were first performed as a preliminary screening and we report the statistical significance of the ≥2x CS instances. Additionally, we have modified Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to reflect the new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Recommendation (not required for acceptance, but please temper claims of clinical relevance if not done): The comparative killing data should be repeated in competition. This is technically more challenging but I believe not more so than the comparative growth curves. This would establish as proof of principle that a mixed population could be purified of plasmid-bearers by CS. Without this, the clinical relevance will still remain speculative. Also, two reviewers initially misread these as competition assays. The text and legend should emphasize that these are separate populations</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a direct competition experiment would establish a nice proof of principle of the clinical potential of CS to purify plasmid-bearers. In fact, that was the original experimental design for this section, and we even fluorescently tagged the different wild-type strains in order to use flow cytometry to perform high-throughput competitions. However, when we started to run the experiments, we realized that the presence of azithromycin (protein synthesis inhibitor) affects GFP production leading to unreliable results. In addition, when we tried an alternative approach to flow cytometry for the competitions (plating on selective agar), we had the problem of selecting for pOXA-48 plasmid, which gives rise to a strong inoculum effect in the plasmid-bearing clones. As a consequence, plating results became noisy, especially when using the ESBL-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> clinical isolates, which are already resistant to most <italic>β</italic>-lactam antibiotics (the low-level resistance conferred by pOXA-48 to carbapenems exacerbates the inoculum effect issue when selecting in these backgrounds). Finally, we also thought about the possibility of performing the same killing curves we performed, but using mixed populations (plasmid-bearing/plasmid-free) instead of pure cultures. However, since these cultures are propagated over a few days, pOXA-48 conjugation becomes a potential problem for the interpretation of the results. Therefore, we finally decided to use the alternative approach of comparative killing curves with pure cultures. We believe that these experiments, although far from being perfect, provide a nice proof of concept of the potential clinical exploitation of CS effects associated with AR plasmid acquisition. However, we agree with the reviewers that the clinical relevance of our study still remain speculative, and that in the previous version of the manuscript we overstated the clinical implications of our results, so we have toned down those claims through the manuscript and included a sentence to clearly state the limitations of our experimental design in the concluding remarks section. We have also improved the description of the experiment in the figure legend, and the Results and Materials and methods sections to better convey the idea that plasmid-bearers and plasmid-free populations were subjected to antibiotic treatments separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) (not required for acceptance but suggestion for future work): The presented work is solid but, as pointed out by the authors, there is no mechanistic explanations for the observations. It would be highly interesting to know if the collateral effects are due to specific genes (OXA-48 would be a good place to start) and/or if the observed effects are due to the plasmid backbone.</p></disp-quote><p>Among the several lines of research that our work opens, understanding the molecular causes of CS is arguably one of the most interesting. Indeed, we are undertaking a new project in which we take advantage of our extensive collection of pOXA-48-carrying clinical isolates (León-Sampedro et al., 2020) to gain insight into these mechanistic details. In particular, we are testing if different pOXA-48 variants carrying deletions that affect different plasmid traits (conjugation, toxin-antitoxin, blaOXA-48…) reduce or abolish the CS phenotype. Additionally, we are performing transcriptomic analyses of clinical strains to gain insight into the metabolic perturbations that the plasmid produces in the host cell. We are confident that these experiments will suggest why pOXA-48 produces the observed CS effects, but extensive work will still be needed to generalize these results to other plasmids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiment in Figure 3 demonstrates the exploitation of collateral sensitivity to preferentially inhibit plasmid-bearing bacteria.

We have removed any reference to mortality or eradication of plasmid-carrying bacteria thorough the paper, and we now interpret this results in terms of growth inhibition, as suggested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The revision is excellent.
