It has been proposed that Syt1 promotes SNARE-dependent fusion mainly through its C2B domain, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the C2B domain interacts simultaneously with acidic membranes and SNARE complexes via the top Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops, the side polybasic patch, and the bottom face in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Disruption of the simultaneous interactions completely abrogates the triggering activity of the C2B domain in liposome fusion. We hypothesize that the simultaneous interactions endow the C2B domain with an ability to deform local membranes, and this membrane-deformation activity might underlie the functional significance of the Syt1 C2B domain in vivo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14211.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14211.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14211.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Information travels around the nervous system along cells called neurons, which communicate with each other via connections called synapses. When a signal travelling along one neuron reaches a synapse, it triggers the release of molecules known as neurotransmitters. These molecules are then taken up by the next neuron to pass the signal on. Neurotransmitters are stored in compartments called synaptic vesicles and their release from the first neuron depends on the synaptic vesicles fusing with the membrane that surrounds the cell. This “membrane fusion” process is driven by a group of proteins called the SNARE complex.</p><p>Membrane fusion is triggered by a sudden increase in the amount of calcium ions in the cell, which leads to an increase in the activity of a protein called synaptotagmin-1. A region of this protein known as the C2B domain is able to detect calcium ions, and it can also bind to the cell membrane and SNARE complex proteins. However, it is not clear what roles these interactions play in driving the release of neurotransmitters.</p><p>Wang, Li et al. have used a variety of biophysical techniques to study these interactions in more detail using purified proteins and other cell components. The experiments show that all three interactions occur at the same time and are all required for synaptotagmin-1 to trigger membrane fusion. Wang, Li et al. propose that these interactions allow synaptotagmin-1 to bend a section of the cell membrane in response to calcium ions.</p><p>The experiments also show that the C2B domain interacts more strongly with the SNARE complex than previously thought. A future challenge is to observe whether synaptotagmin-1 works in the same way in living cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14211.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14211.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31322034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB910203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CB910800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the C2B domain insert into a membrane, interactions with a phospholipid and the SNARE complex allow synaptotagmin-1 to bend the membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release by synaptic exocytosis is an exquisitely regulated process for interneuronal communication. The core machinery governing the process includes the SNAREs synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, which form tight SNARE complexes to bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane and catalyze membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). Syt1, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for the fast component of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>), confers Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity to SNARE-dependent synaptic vesicle fusion. The triggering function of Syt1 depends on its interplay with membranes, SNAREs, complexins and other key proteins of the release machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Syt1 consists of two C2 domains, known as C2A and C2B. The C2A and C2B domains adopt similar structures and bind three and two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, respectively, through their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops located at the top of the structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutton et al., 1995</xref>). These loops mediate penetration of Syt1 C2 domains to acidic membranes containing phosphatidylserine (PS) in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and this activity is required for the triggering function of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapman and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, Syt1 readily binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) via its C2B domain in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner, which helps increase the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of Syt1 and thereby enhances release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radhakrishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>). Furthermore, Syt1 binds to SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1, and to SNARE complexes mainly through its C2B domain, which is believed to position Syt1 on the pre-fusion SNARE complexes to trigger release in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohrmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although the biochemical properties of Syt1 have been studied in detail, the functional importance of individual properties has remained unclear. It has been found that disrupting Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to C2B impairs release much more strongly than disruption of C2A Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mackler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nishiki and Augustine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>).Moreover, previous work showed that isolated C2B, instead of C2A, can promote SNARE-dependent membrane fusion in response to Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaffaney et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). These findings suggested that C2B plays a more preponderant role than C2A in neurotransmitter release. A number of studies have revisited this issue and suggested that the functional importance of C2B arises partly from its ability to deform membranes. For instance, C2B can induce vesicle clustering and/or membrane curvature in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is unclear why C2B has such membrane-deformation activity while C2A does not, given the fact that both C2 domains of Syt1 exhibit similar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane-insertion properties in vitro.</p><p>Another potential reason for the striking functional asymmetry of the Syt1 C2 domains was provided by recent studies showing that interactions between C2B and SNARE complexes are crucial for the function of Syt1 in neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). However, these studies have yielded conflicting results. For instance, a recently solved Syt1–SNARE complex crystal structure showed a relatively large binding interface between Syt1 and the SNARE complex that involves two basic residues (Arg398 and Arg399, referred to as the R398 R399 region, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) on the bottom of C2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), whereas another dynamic Syt1–SNARE complex structure model obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicated a SNARE binding interface that is located on the polybasic patch (Lys326 and Lys327, referred to as the K326 K327 region, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) at the side of C2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, both of these basic regions have been previously implicated in binding to acidic membrane lipids, such as PS and PI(4,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>). Some other reports argued against the interaction between Syt1 and the SNARE complex, and suggested that the triggering function of Syt1 requires specific binding of C2B to acidic membranes rather than binding to SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, although it seems clear that C2B can interact with either acidic SNARE complexes or acidic membranes due to the abundance of highly positive charges around its surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the binding mode of C2B with SNARE complexes and membranes underlying the actual mechanism of Syt1 in release remains elusive.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14211.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the structure features of Syt1 C2 domains and the core SNARE complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Structural diagrams (<bold>A</bold>) and electrostatic surface potential (<bold>B</bold>) of Syt1 C2A (PDB entry 1BYN) and C2B (PDB entry 1TJX) domain.

Our results showed that, prior to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the C2B domain interacts with PI(4,5)P2 and membrane-anchored SNARE complexes through the K326 K327 region and the R398 R399 region, respectively. We also found that the two interactions persist during insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into the membrane upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Consistent with a Syt1 triggering model proposed recently by Brunger and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), our data suggest that the local membrane deformation driven by the C2B domain constitutes a key step for triggering fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>C2B interacts with SNARE complexes and acidic membranes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>As mentioned above, Syt1 C2B contains two highly basic regions at the side and the bottom of the structure (i.e., the K326 K327 and R398 R399 regions; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>); both regions have been implicated in interactions with the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>).

Using the GST pull-down assay, we first re-examined interactions between the two basic regions on C2B and the acidic patch on the assembled SNARE complex in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>), we found that both C2AB (soluble fragment of Syt1 harboring C2A and C2B) and C2B bound to assembled SNARE complexes, whereas C2A did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, note that the C2A binding might be too weak to be detected on the gel). The SNARE complex containing the SNAP-25 D51A/E52A/E55A mutation (referred to as SN25 3M) showed impaired binding ability to C2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>).

As expected, disruption of the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (D363N/D365N, referred to as C2b) caused no effect on the SNARE complex binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

PI(4,5)P2 selectively localizes to the plasma membrane, binds to Syt1 and plays crucial functions in neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van den Bogaart et al., 2011b</xref>). Using a liposome co-flotation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we found that, in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both C2AB and C2B (wild type, WT) bound efficiently to liposomes containing 1% PI(4,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). This PI(4,5)P2-binding ability of Syt1 relies on the K326 K327 region but not the R398 R399 region, as C2AB<sub>2KE</sub>/C2AB<sub>2KA</sub> or C2B<sub>2KE</sub>/C2B<sub>2KA</sub> completely abolished binding to PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes whereas C2AB<sub>2RQ</sub> or C2B<sub>2RQ</sub> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). To confirm this binding preference, we measured the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) labeled C2B and rhodamine-labeled liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui et al., 2011</xref>) containing 1% PI(4,5)P2 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When NBD was placed close to the K326 K327 region (H315C-NBD), we detected a robust energy transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). Comparably, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent FRET signals were considerably weaker when PI(4,5)P2 was removed from liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). The addition of excess assembled SNARE complexes in the reaction caused no obvious effect on the FRET between C2B and PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). These results, together with a recent finding that Syt1 binds to PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes in physiological ionic conditions that contain ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2015</xref>), suggest that the K326 K327 region binds specifically to PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Given that the side K326 K327 region of C2B binds specifically to PI(4,5)P2 on membranes, we explored whether the bottom R398 R399 region tends to bind the SNARE complex. Previous studies suggested that the R398 R399 region binds acidic membranes (i.e., PS) and participates in liposome clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). In our study using PS-containing liposomes, we indeed found that C2B clustered liposomes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both C2B<sub>2RQ</sub> and C2b failed to cluster liposomes, while C2B<sub>2KE</sub> was able to cluster liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting the idea that the bottom R398 R399 region and the top Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops associate two opposite acidic membranes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that the PS-containing liposomes used in these experiments lacked the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore re-analyzed the liposome-clustering activity of C2B in the presence of soluble SNARE complexes, as a function of the concentrations of C2B. Robust clustering was observed as the C2B concentration increased in the presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). To our surprise, the addition of 10 μM soluble SNARE complexes in the reaction strongly impaired liposome clustering but the clustering was capable of gradually recovery as the concentration of C2B exceeded that of SNARE complexes (when C2B was above 10 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, the likely explanation is that the weaker R398 R399–PS interaction can be replaced by the stronger R398 R399–SNARE complex binding. These results suggest that the R398 R399 region binds preferentially to SNARE complexes rather than acidic membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Persistence of C2B (R398 R399)–SNARE complex interaction in the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup></title><p>We further directly measured the C2B (R398 R399)–SNARE complex interaction using a bimane-tryptophan quenching assay in the absence of membranes.

To alleviate such an effect, we applied higher ion strength (250 mM KCl, instead of 150 mM KCl used in other experiments throughout the work) and weakened the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops–Ca<sup>2+</sup>–PS interaction by lowering the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 1 mM to 0.1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, to what extent the promotion activity of C2AB (or C2B) in vitro reflects the triggering activity of Syt1 in vivo must be interpreted with caution because the liposome-clustering ability of C2AB (or C2B) correlated strongly with its activity in promoting SNARE-dependent liposome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). Accelerated liposome fusion might arise from the enhanced membrane docking and SNARE pairing caused by C2AB (or C2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui et al., 2011</xref>). To detect the actual activity of C2AB (or C2B) in triggering fusion, in our liposome fusion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) we utilized poly-D-lysine as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent factor to mimic liposome docking and increase SNARE pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui et al., 2011</xref>); added complexin-1 to arrest liposomes in a 'ready-for-fusion' state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2014</xref>); and finally applied 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to trigger fusion.

Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui et al., 2011</xref>), addition of 2 µg/ml poly-D-lysine in the mixtures efficiently induced liposome clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby enhancing SNARE-dependent lipid mixing and content mixing in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (in the presence of 0.2 mM EDTA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,I</xref>). This data is consistent with the idea that liposome clustering can promote fusion through facilitating SNARE pairing. Complexin-1 inhibited both lipid mixing and content mixing in the presence of poly-D-lysine and in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,J</xref>), whereas further addition of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 1500 s triggered both lipid mixing and content mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,K</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaffaney et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>), the triggering activity strictly required C2B instead of C2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,K</xref>). We emphasize that C2B was unable to cluster SNARE-bearing liposomes at a concentration of 0.5 μM in this fusion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes were mostly assembled at the ready-for-fusion stage arrested by complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, SNARE pairing was not obviously promoted during the triggering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results pinpoint the triggering activity of C2B in membrane fusion. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that content-mixing signals represented by de-quenching of sulforhodamine fluorescence arise from liposome leakiness, we performed control experiments where both v- and t-liposome were loaded with sulforhodamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Leakiness was not detected in SNARE-dependent content mixing in the presence of poly-D-lysine with and without C2AB–Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>), indicating that the real membrane fusion events were observed in our experiments.</p><p>Using this system, we investigated whether the simultaneous interactions of C2B with PS, PI(4,5)P2, and the SNARE complex are critical for the triggering activity of C2B.

We found that disrupting the C2A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (D230N/D232N, C2aB) caused a moderate impairment in the lipid mixing and content mixing, whereas disrupting the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (D363N/D365N, C2Ab) totally abolished the ability of C2AB to trigger fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,M</xref>).

Besides, poly-D-lysine was excluded because full-length Syt1 can 'dock' two membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>).

The C2 domains exhibit similar overall structures and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced membrane-insertion properties but differ strikingly in their function during release. Despite the fact that the functional significance of the C2B domain in vivo has been successfully reproduced in SNARE-dependent membrane fusion assays in vitro the mechanism by which C2B acts with the SNAREs and membranes to promote fusion is unclear. In the present study, we suggest a membrane-bending property of the C2B domain that arises from its simultaneous interactions with SNARE complexes and membranes. The relevance of our proposed C2B–SNARE complex–membrane interactions is supported by the present study and many previously reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radhakrishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Bogaart et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), concordantly with the increasing realization that Syt1 cooperates with the SNARE complex and membranes in neurotransmitter release.</p><p>The functional importance of C2B arises most likely from its unique structure that contains abundant basic residues on its surface, which endows C2B with the ability to bind acidic SNARE complexes and/or membranes. Contiguously electrostatic potentials created by the bottom R398 R399 residues and the side K326 K327 residues of C2B contribute to the SNARE binding, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>. However, as demonstrated with our co-flotation and FRET experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–G</xref>), the presence of PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes shifts the equilibrium towards an energetically favorable binding where the K326 K327–PI(4,5)P2 interaction dominates. The much higher efficiency of the K326 K327 region, compared to the R398 R399 region, in PI(4,5)P2 binding arises most likely because the K326 K327 region contains a much higher positive-charge density, which enables it to bind tightly to lipid head groups with a highly negative-charge density [i.e., PI(4,5)P2-microdomains at active zones] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, further investigations on the C2B–SNARE complex interaction using a more sensitive bimane-tryptophan quenching assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) indicate that the R398 R399 region of C2B binds to the SNARE complex or the membrane-anchored SNARE complex in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner. Thus, the existence of the K326 K327–PI(4,5)P2 interaction and the R398 R399–SNARE complex interaction prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx likely recruits Syt1 to the fusion sites, which underlies the docking function of Syt1, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2015</xref>) argued against the Syt1–SNARE complex interaction because this interaction measured in the study appeared to be completely abolished in the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. However, Syt1 used in the study was labeled at residue 342, which is close to the polybasic patch, suggesting that this study actually measured the FRET between the K326 K327 region and the SNARE complex, and it is unlikely that it reflects the real Syt1–SNARE complex interaction. Instead, our study found that the R398 R399–SNARE complex interaction persists in the absence and presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is also noteworthy that C2B T285W and SNAP-25 R59C mutations used in our bimane-tryptophan quenching assay seem unlikely to affect the particular interaction between Syt1 and the SNARE complex, because these residues are outside the 'primary' interface (interface area: 720 Å<sup>2</sup>; including residues Arg398 and Arg399) between Syt1 and the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the C<sup>α</sup>–C<sup>α</sup> distance between the two labeling sites is measured at ~12 Å based on the Syt1–SNARE complex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with the relatively large effect on the FRET observed in our experiments. Moreover, we measured a reasonably strong binding <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> [0.86 ± 0.04 μM and 1.53 ± 0.04 μM in the presence and absence of PI(4,5)P2, respectively] between C2B and the SNARE complex in the presence of membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, our binding results, together with the observations that both spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release are not affected by the presence of 3 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), strongly suggest that the interaction between Syt1 and the SNARE complex is not affected by ionic shielding and is physiologically relevant.</p><p>The finding that the R398 R399 region binds preferentially to the SNARE complex in this study seems to be incompatible with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). This discrepancy may arise from the different experimental conditions used between the present work and our previous studies. Re-examination of liposome clustering in a more stringent condition containing abundant SNARE complexes showed that the liposome-clustering ability of C2B is totally abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This data suggests that the R398 R399–PS binding might be displaced by the R398 R399–SNARE complex interaction. However, our results could not completely rule out the possibility that a small population of Syt1 molcules act to shorten the distance between membranes via the direct interaction of the R398 R399 region with acidic phospholipids in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>By detecting penetration of C2B into membranes (with PS) as well as binding of C2B to the SNARE complex and PI(4,5)P2 at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), our results provides acceptable proof for the persistence of the K326 K327–PI(4,5)P2 interaction and the R398 R399–SNARE complex interaction during Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The presence of the simultaneous SNARE-containing membrane binding of the top Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops, of the side K326 K327 region, and of the bottom R398 R399 region, leads to a possible membrane-deformation mechanism of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>): before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, both the K326 K327–PI(4,5)P2 interaction and the R398 R399–SNARE complex interaction fasten C2B in an orientation parallel with the plasma membrane, leaving the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops held back from membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>); Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx strongly induces fast insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into membranes, rearranging C2B to an orientation vertical to the plasma membrane. The persistent binding of C2B to PI(4,5)P2 and the membrane-anchored SNARE complex would thus exert a membrane bending force to buck the local membrane outward in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Furthermore, it is likely that binding of C2B to PI(4,5)P2 and SNARE complexes before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx would lead to a ring-like arrangement of C2B molecules around the fusion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), which would then facilitate bucking local membranes upon collective bending forces in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This possible membrane-deformation mechanism is in good agreement with the Syt1 working model proposed by Brunger and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), and is supported by a recent observation that local membrane protrusions (5 nm in height, similar to the size of one C2B molecule) bucked on the surface of GUV (giant unilamellar vesicles) require the presence of Syt1 and assembled SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bharat et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14211.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A working model of Syt1 in triggering membrane fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Binding of Syt1 C2B to PI(4,5)P2 and primed <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex on the plasma membrane before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

This membrane-deformation mechanism explains very well the recent observation that isolated C2B readily bends membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hui et al., 2009</xref>), and suggests that membrane insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops alone is not sufficient to drive membrane deformation without the assist of the R398 R399 and the K326 K327 regions. Thus, the functional importance of the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites observed in previous in vivo studies and our present liposome fusion experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) can be explained: disruption of the C2B Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites abrogates the simultaneous interaction of C2B with acidic membrane lipids [i.e., PI(4,5)P2 and PS] and the membrane-anchored SNARE complex, so that the ability of C2B to bend membranes is absolutely abolished. Our data reinforce the idea that local membrane deformation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>–Syt1 is key for the triggering function of Syt1 in release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Our data also reinforce the notion that the coordinated efforts of two or more interactions from one protein can induce membrane deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McMahon and Boucrot, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The liposome fusion results support the notion that SNARE complexes are already partially assembled before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which enables complexin-1 binding and thereby strains such a complex in a stage ready for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>). In response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, C2B-induced membrane bucking would reduce the distance between two apposed membranes, which might cooperate with the action of C2B in displacing inhibitory complexin-1, to facilitate the continuous helical SNARE complex assembly that propagates through the linker region into the transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Thus, high curvature stresses induced by C2B and the energy released from the C-terminal SNARE complex assembly might be coupled together in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> to overcome the energy barrier for membrane fusion. It is noteworthy that C2A would have an ancillary role by binding to one membrane and helping to dictate the apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Altogether, our results add increasing evidence for the triggering mechanism by which Syt1 acts in concert with the SNARE complex and membranes to promote membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant protein purification</title><p>The cytoplasmic domain of rat Syt1 (known as C2AB) used in this study comprises residues 140–421, and the C2A and C2B domains comprise residues 140–266 and 270–421, respectively.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Synaptotagmin C2B domain cooperates with the SNARE complex and membranes to promote fusion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its present form is not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There are two topics mixed in this paper: (1) simultaneous/cooperative binding of Syt1-C2B to both SNARE complex and membrane, and (2) enhancement of SNARE complex formation by Munc13 conjunction with Syt1. This work would greatly benefit from splitting these new results into two papers. The reviewers and editors felt that the results on Syt1-C2B-membrane interactions are potentially more interesting than the results on Munc13. Several concerns (as outlined below) were raised by all reviewers which preclude further consideration of the manuscript in its present form.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work presents data that suggest that the C2B domain of Syt-1 simultaneously and cooperatively interacts with both the SNARE complex and the plasma membrane prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The results and discussions in this manuscript may clarify previous results in the literature that suggested competition between membrane binding and SNARE complex binding. This work also suggests that Syt1 C2B stimulates Munc18-Munc13-dependent SNARE complex assembly in the absence of calcium.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>A better discussion of the previous findings by Zhou et al. (2015) should be included in the Introduction and the Discussion: Zhou et al. found that there is a conserved and calcium independent interface between synaptotagmin-1 and the neuronal SNARE complex and that this interface is essential for fast synchronous release in neurons. Moreover, Zhou et al. proposed that the C2B-SNARE complex unit exists prior to calcium binding and then moves as a block, deforming the membrane by simultaneous three interactions with the membrane involving the polybasic region of Syt1, the calcium binding loops of Syt1 C2B, and the membrane anchor and juxtamembrane region of syntaxin and SNAP-25, similar to the model proposed in this manuscript.</p><p>In the model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the orientation of the C2B domain is inconsistent with the crystal structure of the primary interface by Zhou et al. (2015) (the C2B domain is rotated by 180 degrees compared to the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Realizing that the data presented in this manuscript are insufficient to determine the orientation of the C2B domain and the authors probably wrote this paper before the Zhou et al. publication became available, the model should nevertheless be corrected according to the crystal structure in order to avoid confusion.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that the C2B – SNARE interaction is Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent. This actually has been shown by Zhou et al. since crystal structures in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> produced the same primary interface between Syt1 and SNARE comple (please cite this in this context); What is new here is that the interaction persists upon insertion of the Ca binding loops into the membrane.</p><p>The results presented in this paper are in conflict with the Brewer et al. (NSMB 2015) results. The authors are encouraged to discuss possible reasons for this apparent conflict.</p><p>The lipid composition of the co-flotation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) apparently did not include PS, whereas the other experiments (2F, 2H) include 15% PS. Is there a reason that PS was omitted in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>? Ideally, PS should be included in all experiments for consistency.</p><p>A recent paper (Park Y, et al. (2015), Nat Struct Mol Biol. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.3097) implies that Syt1 – SNARE interactions are weak or non-existent at 150 mM KCl, MgCl2 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the Park et al. paper).

This study aims to resolve the SNARE and membrane binding modes of the C2B domain (in absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and how these interactions contribute to the fusion process. The authors utilize a number of techniques GST pulldown, coflotation, fluorescence measurements and in vitro fusion assays to demonstrate that mutation of side and bottom basic residues impair SNARE complex binding and membrane binding in a Ca dependent manner.</p><p>This work is based on a large body of literature and the findings presented here are in part confirmatory and in part new.</p><p>New is the finding that the interactions of the bottom loop with the membrane can be competitively displaced by the presence of SNARE complexes. Another aspect of the work is that the authors show that synaptotagmin C2B domain is able to double the rate of SNARE complex formation. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is that they can simultaneously monitor both penetration of C2B domain into the membrane and binding to the SNARE complex with the bottom loop at the same time, providing decent proof for the presence of a simultaneous binding of top loops to membranes and bottom loop to cis-SNARE complex via the acid patch created by SNAP25 residues. However, does this experiment exclude that a considerable fraction of the bottom loop would also be able to interact with the phospholipid membrane?</p><p>On other issue here is the conversion of positive to negative charges in the mutations: net charge difference particularly in the coflotation assays may be of concern.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study has important new data, is largely well-written and, in certain respects, presents major advances, especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>1) They &quot;propose that the membrane bending induced by the fast transition between the two binding modes underlies the [fusion] triggering function of C2B&quot; (from the Abstract), yet there is no measurement of membrane bending nor is there any data which implicates the transition between the two binding modes, as opposed to the binding modes themselves, in causing fusion. They are welcome to make such a model, of course, but should make clearer distinctions between what they show and what is simply hypothesis.</p><p>2) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> from the classical assay of dequenching between two fluorescent lipids purports to show &quot;lipid mixing&quot;. However, it has been shown in this journal (Zick and Wickner, <italic>eLife</italic> 2014;3:e09251) that this assay measures trans-SNARE pair dependent events which do not correspond to lipid mixing. In the text, they assume that this lipid mixing is the result of fusion, though it was shown in this same paper that such dequenching can occur in the absence of fusion. The authors should replace this figure with one measuring the mixing of proteoliposomal lumenal contents (in the continuous presence of an external quenching agent, to control for leakage or lysis).</p><p>3) They claim that calcium binding &quot;…causes a cooperative interaction of C2B with membranes and the SNARE complex.&quot; The data however show that C2B can bind membranes or SNARE complex independently, with no data showing cooperativity to this binding.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; they claim that C2B but not C2A binds to SNARE complex, but the C2B band is faint and the C2A band could be just below the detection limit. Also, they claim synergy between the 2 basic regions of C2B for their binding to SNARE complex, but there is no quantitative binding data to gird this claim. What do they mean by synergy here?</p><p>5) Does &quot;MUN&quot;, as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, refer to both Munc13 and Munc18? Were these singly omitted, to support the claim that both are needed? I don't see this in the figure.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Synaptotagmin C2B domain interacts simultaneously with SNAREs and membranes to promote fusion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a re-submission of a previous submission to <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors have now focused on Syt1 – SNARE – membrane interactions, making this a more accessible and interesting study for the general reader. The authors revisited three proposed key interactions of the Syt-1 C2B domain – (i) calcium-dependent binding of the calcium binding loops to membranes with PS, (ii) binding of basic residues K326/327 to membranes with PIP2, and (iii) binding of basic residues R398/399 to the SNARE complex. The data indicate that all three interactions occur simultaneously and are all required for the triggering function the Syt-1 C2B domain in liposome/vesicle fusion. The findings reconcile recently published contradictory data on the functional significance of SNARE complex binding by Syt-1 (e.g. Park et al., 2015 vs. Zhou et al., 2015) – the discrepancy of the present data with those of Park et al. (2015) as regards the ion-sensitivity of the Syt-1-SNARE interaction is explained by differences in the areas labeled for fluorescence/FRET-based interaction studies.</p><p>In addition, the authors present new data on the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> between Syt1 and the SNARE complex in the presence of membrane. To our knowledge this is the first time a reasonably strong <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> has been reported for this interaction (below 1 microM), compared to the relatively weak Syt1-SNARE interaction in the absence of membranes. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The pull-down assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is used as a basis to claim that mutation of the acidic patch in the SNARE complex (SNAP-25 D51/E52/E55 to A – 3M) abolishes binding to the Syt-1 C2B domain. However, it looks as if there is much less SNARE complex in this assay. The authors claim that this is due to lower SDS-resistance of the 3M complex, but there is no trace of the SNARE monomers on the gel, and there is a (slight) difference in the assembly between the WT and the 3M complex. How can one be sure that the same amount of assembled SNARE complex was added in the assay?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: In their binding assays designed to show the synergistic effects of the three key Syt-1 C2B binding modes, the authors used a condition where the dominant effect of the calcium-dependent interaction is reduced. How sensitive are the interactions to calcium (see also next point)?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> implies that there is no interaction between C2B and the membrane-reconstituted SNARE complex in the absence of calcium and absence of PIP2. Yet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 F-I</xref> suggests that there is such an interaction in the absence of calcium and presence of PIP2. The authors should attempt a co-flotation experiment using the same conditions as that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-I</xref>, and in the absence of calcium.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: Syt1-T285W and SNAP-25 R59C mutations. The authors should comment in the text that these residues are outside the primary interface between Syt1 and SNARE complex as observed in the crystal structures by Zhou et al. (2015). Thus, these mutations are unlikely going to affect this particular interaction between Syt1 and SNARE complex. This is an important comment since unfortunate placement of labels have affected this interaction in work by others (Brewer et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015). Moreover, the Ca-Ca distance between the two labeling sites is ~ 12 A (based on the structures by Zhou et al.), consistent with the relatively large effect on FRET that the authors observe. Again, this is worth mentioning.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Was this experiment done in the presence of membrane (i.e., similar to the method shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-I</xref>)?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and second paragraph subsection “Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependently simultaneous C2B–SNARE complex–membrane interactions are crucial for triggering fusion”: The in vitro assay by Kyoung et al., 2011; Diao et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2014) actually reconstituted the full-length Syt1-SNARE machinery at physiological Syt1 copy number and also included complexin. Moreover, Zhou et al. (2015) showed that mutation of the primary interface disrupts calcium-triggered vesicle fusion in this assay. These results should be mentioned in the context of presenting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and the authors should point out which aspects of their experiments go beyond the previous results by Zhou et al. (2015) (e.g., the studies of calcium-binding site mutations.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: Based on other work (Wang Z, Liu H, Gu Y, Chapman ER (2011) Reconstituted synaptotagmin I mediates vesicle docking, priming, and fusion.

This work would greatly benefit from splitting these new results into two papers. The reviewers and editors felt that the results on Syt1-C2B-membrane interactions are potentially more interesting than the results on Munc13. Several concerns (as outlined below) were raised by all reviewers which preclude further consideration of the manuscript in its present form.</italic></p><p>In the new manuscript, we took out Munc13 results and only focused on the results on C2B–SNARE complex–membrane interactions as suggested by the editors. In addition, we have tried to address most of the concerns the reviewers raised and we have included data from new experiments that were performed based on some of the reviewers’ comments. Below I summarize the revisions made and provide answers to other reviewer concerns.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>This work presents data that suggest that the C2B domain of Syt-1 simultaneously and cooperatively interacts with both the SNARE complex and the plasma membrane prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The results and discussions in this manuscript may clarify previous results in the literature that suggested competition between membrane binding and SNARE complex binding. This work also suggests that Syt1 C2B stimulates Munc18-Munc13-dependent SNARE complex assembly in the absence of calcium. Comments: A better discussion of the previous findings by Zhou et al. (2015) should be included in the Introduction and the Discussion: Zhou et al. found that there is a conserved and calcium independent interface between synaptotagmin<sup>-1</sup> and the neuronal SNARE complex and that this interface is essential for fast synchronous release in neurons. Moreover, Zhou et al. proposed that the C2B-SNARE complex unit exists prior to calcium binding and then moves as a block, deforming the membrane by simultaneous three interactions with the membrane involving the polybasic region of Syt1, the calcium binding loops of Syt1 C2B, and the membrane anchor and juxtamembrane region of syntaxin and SNAP-25, similar to the model proposed in this manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We included the finding by Zhou et al. (2015) in the Introduction and mentioned the model proposed by Zhou et al. (2015) throughout the paper.</p><p> <italic>In the model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the orientation of the C2B domain is inconsistent with the crystal structure of the primary interface by Zhou et al. (2015) (the C2B domain is rotated by 180 degrees compared to the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Realizing that the data presented in this manuscript are insufficient to determine the orientation of the C2B domain and the authors probably wrote this paper before the Zhou et al. publication became available, the model should nevertheless be corrected according to the crystal structure in order to avoid confusion.</italic> </p><p>We redrew the Syt1 triggering model (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) according with the C2B–SNARE complex primary binding interface provided by the Syt1–SNARE complex structure (Zhou., et al. (2015)). The orientation of the C2B domain is thus accordingly corrected by a 180-degrees rotation with respect to the SNARE complex, as suggested by the model proposed by Zhou., et al. (2015).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that the C2B – SNARE interaction is Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent. This actually has been shown by Zhou et al. since crystal structures in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> produced the same primary interface between Syt1 and SNARE comple (please cite this in this context); What is new here is that the interaction persists upon insertion of the Ca binding loops into the membrane.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for reminding us and we cited this paper in the according place.</p><p> <italic>The results presented in this paper are in conflict with the Brewer</italic> et al. <italic>(NSMB 2015) results. The authors are encouraged to discuss possible reasons for this apparent conflict.</italic> </p><p>As shown in our present study, both the bottom R398 R399 region and the side K326 K327 region of C2B are able to interact with the SNARE complex in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), as reported in the literature. Thus, we suppose that interactions between C2B and the SNARE complex in solution are dynamic unless the appearance of acidic membranes. We discussed this issue in the Discussion paragraph two.</p><p> <italic>The lipid composition of the co-flotation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) apparently did not include PS, whereas the other experiments (2F, 2H) include 15% PS. Is there a reason that PS was omitted in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>? Ideally, PS should be included in all experiments for consistency.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we re-tested the binding of C2AB/C2B and the mutants with liposomes containing both PIP2 and PS with the co-flotation assay and confirmed that the K326 K327 region mediates the PIP2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p> <italic>A recent paper (Park Y, et al. (2015), Nat Struct Mol Biol. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.3097) implies that Syt1 – SNARE interactions are weak or non-existent at 150 mM KCl, MgCl2 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the Park et al. paper).

Ideally, the conditions of the Park et al. paper should be tested in the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5F-I</xref>.</italic> </p><p>First, the salt conditions for the Syt1–SNARE binding experiments were 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and was 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 250 mM KCl, 10% glycerol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Second, a recent report (Park Y, et al. (2015)) argues against the physiologically relevant of the Syt1–SNARE complex interaction by showing that this binding is abolished in conditions containing ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> with FRET experiments. However, C2AB used in the study was labeled at residue 342, which is close to the polybasic region, so that this study measured the interaction between the K326 K327 region and the SNARE complex. These data only suggest the competition of ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> with the SNARE complex for the K326 K327 region binding. In addition, Park Y, et al. suggested in their study that the K326 K327 region prefers to PIP2 binding at a physiologically ionic environment. Our data support the notion that K326 K327 region binds to PIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-G</xref>) and showed that the interaction between the R398 R399 region and the SNARE complex persisted even at conditions containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 3mM ATP and 1mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), reinforcing the functional importance of the Syt1–SNARE complex interaction.</p><p> <italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, controls should be performed using the K326E, K327E (polybasic – membrane binding) and R398Q R399Q (SNARE binding) mutants.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), instead of using the K326E, K327E mutant, we used liposomes that lacked PIP2 as the control because these liposomes lost the ability to bind the K327 K327 region. In addition, we accordingly tested the interaction between the R398 R399 region and the SNARE complex in solution by using the K326E/K327E and R398Q/R399Q mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: what is the lipid composition of the proteoliposomes?</italic> </p><p>The lipid composition of the proteoliposomes are shown on the top of the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p> <italic>The bulk assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> may be subject to effects caused by vesicle docking and/or lipid mixing since both effects would result in the observed decrease in donor fluorescence.

This study aims to resolve the SNARE and membrane binding modes of the C2B domain (in absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and how these interactions contribute to the fusion process. The authors utilize a number of techniques GST pulldown, coflotation, fluorescence measurements and in vitro fusion assays to demonstrate that mutation of side and bottom basic residues impair SNARE complex binding and membrane binding in a Ca dependent manner. This work is based on a large body of literature and the findings presented here are in part confirmatory and in part new. New is the finding that the interactions of the bottom loop with the membrane can be competitively displaced by the presence of SNARE complexes. Another aspect of the work is that the authors show that synaptotagmin C2B domain is able to double the rate of SNARE complex formation. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is that they can simultaneously monitor both penetration of C2B domain into the membrane and binding to the SNARE complex with the bottom loop at the same time, providing decent proof for the presence of a simultaneous binding of top loops to membranes and bottom loop to cis-SNARE complex via the acid patch created by SNAP25 residues. However, does this experiment exclude that a considerable fraction of the bottom loop would also be able to interact with the phospholipid membrane ?</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer #2 for raising this question. It is generally believed that one synaptic vesicle contains 15 copies of Syt1 molecule. Are all of these Syt1 molecules involved in binding with the SNARE complex? It is really hard to answer based on our bulk assay performed in vitro. However, we found that Syt1-dependent membrane clustering in the presence of calcium was much reduced in the presence of the SNARE complex, we also showed that the C2B2KE or C2B2KA mutations but not the C2B2RQ abolished PIP2 binding with co-flotation experiments. Furthermore, we detected the strong FRET between the bottom loop and the SNARE complex with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a membrane environment. These results strongly suggest that a majority fraction of the C2B bottom loop interact with the SNARE complex. To data, we could not exclude the possibility that a fraction of the bottom loop bind membranes to promote release. We discussed this possibility in the Discussion (paragraph four). Nevertheless, further work will be required to answer this question by using single molecule FRET experiments.</p><p> <italic>On other issue here is the conversion of positive to negative charges in the mutations: net charge difference particularly in the coflotation assays may be of</italic> concern.</p><p>We re-tested both the C2B2KE and C2B2KA mutants and the results showed that they both lost the ability to bind PIP2-containing liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Thus, we suppose that conversion of positive charges to negative or neutral charges results in similar effect. Therefore, we used the C2B2KE mutation throughout our study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p> <italic>This study has important new data, is largely well-written and, in certain respects, presents major advances, especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. 1) They &quot;propose that the membrane bending induced by the fast transition between the two binding modes underlies the [fusion] triggering function of C2B&quot; (from the Abstract), yet there is no measurement of membrane bending nor is there any data which implicates the transition between the two binding modes, as opposed to the binding modes themselves, in causing fusion. They are welcome to make such a model, of course, but should make clearer distinctions between what they show and what is simply hypothesis.</italic> </p><p>Sorry for the misleading sentences in the Abstract or elsewhere in our previous manuscript. In the new one, we described our findings and our hypothesis more clearly. Briefly, our findings are i) before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, C2B binds to the SNARE complex via the bottom R398 R399 region, and interacts with acidic membranes (containing PIP2) through the side K326 K327 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); ii) after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, the R398 R399–SNARE complex interaction and the K326 K327–PIP2 interaction persist upon insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); iii) we showed that the three binding interfaces of C2B involving the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops, the R398 R399 and the K326 K327 regions bound respectively to PS, PIP2 and SNARE complex in a simultaneous and synergistic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). These interactions were found to be crucial for the triggering activity of Syt1 in liposome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our hypothesis is that the simultaneous SNARE-containing membrane interactions of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops and of the two basic regions of C2B would exert a force to deform the plasma membrane in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This hypothesis is in good agreement with a recent model proposed by Zhou et al., 2015, Nature. In addition, this hypothesis is supported by a recent observation (Bharat et al., 2014) that local membrane protrusions (5 nm in height, similar like the size of one C2B molecule) bucked on the surface of GUV require the presence of Syt1 and assembled SNARE complex.</p><p><italic>2) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> from the classical assay of dequenching between two fluorescent lipids purports to show &quot;lipid mixing&quot;. However, it has been shown in this journal (Zick and Wickner, eLife 2014;3:e09251) that this assay measures trans-SNARE pair dependent events which do not correspond to lipid mixing. In the text, they assume that this lipid mixing is the result of fusion, though it was shown in this same paper that such dequenching can occur in the absence of fusion. The authors should replace this figure with one measuring the mixing of proteoliposomal lumenal contents (in the continuous presence of an external quenching agent, to control for leakage or lysis).</italic> </p><p>We performed content mixing experiments and confirmed that there was no leakiness in our content mixing experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). We thank the reviewer for suggesting this robust assay (Zick and Wickner, <italic>eLife</italic> 2014) that has been widely used to measure content mixing. We will definitely try to apply this assay to our future studies.</p><p> <italic>3) They claim that calcium binding &quot;…causes a cooperative interaction of C2B with membranes and the SNARE complex.&quot; The data however show that C2B can bind membranes or SNARE complex independently, with no data showing cooperativity to this binding.</italic> </p><p>We showed that C2B can bind membranes or SNARE complexes independently in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and showed C2B can bind synergistically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to membranes and SNARE complexes in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We agree with reviewer #3 that we had no enough data to declare the “cooperative” behavior among C2B, SNARE complexes and membranes, we thus changed “cooperativity” to “synergistically” throughout the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; they claim that C2B but not C2A binds to SNARE complex, but the C2B band is faint and the C2A band could be just below the detection limit. Also, they claim synergy between the 2 basic regions of C2B for their binding to SNARE complex, but there is no quantitative binding data to gird this claim. What do they mean by synergy here?</italic> </p><p>Our GST pull-down experiments showed that, compared to C2A, either C2B or C2AB exhibited stronger binding to the SNARE complex. The binding between C2A and the SNARE complex might be too weak to be detected in our GST pull-down assay (we noted this in the paper). However, we agree that we could not exclude the possibility that C2A also interacts with the SNARE complex and plays a role in release. Besides, we deleted the sentence claiming the binding synergy of the two basic regions of C2B with the SNARE complex.</p><p> <italic>5) Does &quot;MUN&quot;, as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, refer to both Munc13 and Munc18? Were these singly omitted, to support the claim that both are needed? I don't see this in the figure.</italic></p><p>As editors suggested, we removed the Munc13 part and only focused on the Syt1–SNARE complex–membrane interaction in the current manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The pull-down assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is used as a basis to claim that mutation of the acidic patch in the SNARE complex (SNAP-25 D51/E52/E55 to A – 3M) abolishes binding to the Syt-1 C2B domain. However, it looks as if there is much less SNARE complex in this assay. The authors claim that this is due to lower SDS-resistance of the 3M complex, but there is no trace of the SNARE monomers on the gel, and there is a (slight) difference in the assembly between the WT and the 3M complex. How can one be sure that the same amount of assembled SNARE complex was added in the assay?</italic></p><p>We analyzed the overnight-assembled GST-tagged SNARE complex WT and 3M by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The result show that the SNARE complex 3M is less resistant to SDS compared to the SNARE complex WT before boiling, whereas the individual SNAREs of 3M are same to that of WT after boiling. These results confirm the same amount of assembled SNARE complex was added in our experiments.</p><p> <italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: In their binding assays designed to show the synergistic effects of the three key Syt-1 C2B binding modes, the authors used a condition where the dominant effect of the calcium-dependent interaction is reduced.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we monitored the sensitivity of the binding between C2B and PS-containing liposomes in different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Binding of C2B with liposomes decreased as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration declined. When the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was below 0.1 mM, we could not detect the binding between C2B and PS-containing liposomes with SDS-PAGE gel.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> implies that there is no interaction between C2B and the membrane-reconstituted SNARE complex in the absence of calcium and absence of PIP2. Yet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 F-I</xref> suggests that there is such an interaction in the absence of calcium and presence of PIP2. The authors should attempt a co-flotation experiment using the same conditions as that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-I</xref>, and in the absence of calcium.</italic></p><p>To reduce the dominate effect of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction between C2B and PS and for better monitoring the synergistic effects among the three key Syt-1 C2B binding modes, we used the buffer with higher ion strength (250 mM KCl) and 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughout the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. In contrast, the buffer we used for those experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and other figures contains 150 mM KCl instead (we noted this in subsection “Ca2+-dependent interactions of C2B to SNARE complexes and acidic membranes”). The salt concentration differences (250 mM v.s. 150 mM) may explain why the C2B–SNARE complex binding could be detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> but not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, we still performed the co-flotation experiment the reviewers suggested to confirm the interaction between C2B and the membrane-reconstituted SNARE complex using the same conditions as that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 F-I</xref> (in the presence of 150 mM KCl with and without 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>).

The authors should comment in the text that these residues are outside the primary interface between Syt1 and SNARE complex as observed in the crystal structures by Zhou et al. (2015). Thus, these mutations are unlikely going to affect this particular interaction between Syt1 and SNARE complex. This is an important comment since unfortunate placement of labels have affected this interaction in work by others (Brewer et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015). Moreover, the Ca-Ca distance between the two labeling sites is ~ 12 A (based on the structures by Zhou et al.), consistent with the relatively large effect on FRET that the authors observe.

For fluorescent measurements, especially FRET-based assays, the Syt1 fragments as a donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>) were added to 5 μM in order to monitor the acceptor (rodamine) fluorescence as reported (Hui et al., 2011, NSMB); the Syt1 fragments as an acceptor (for all bimane-tryptophan quenching assays in the manuscript) were added to 5 μM for saturating the FRET, as demonstrated in the titration experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. For liposome cluster assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, excess of Syt1 fragments (10 μM) were used for monitoring liposome cluster as reported (Arac et al., 2006, NSMB and Xue et al., 2008, NSMB). More details are described in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some small remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Please move the new results with full-length synaptotagmin<sup>-1</sup> to the main figure and move the results with the soluble C2AB domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) to a supplement. The results with the full-length protein are more relevant.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the results with the full-length Syt1 are more relevant and we thus have moved the related results to the main figure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, we still keep the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in the main figures because we think the data obtained in such a more simplified fusion system (with C2B or C2A) is also important for understanding the triggering function of C2B. Both of the C2AB-based and full-length Syt1-based fusion systems well reproduced the functional importance of the C2B domain observed in vivo. Beside, the working model for Syt1 (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Results, paragraph one: &quot;K326E/K327E, K326E/K327E&quot; should be &quot;K326A/K327A, K326E/K327E&quot;.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for careful reading of the manuscript and we revised it as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
