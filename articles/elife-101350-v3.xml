vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). In order to investigate the role of signaling by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in SAVI, we used genetic inactivation of TNF receptors 1 and 2 in murine SAVI, which is characterized by T cell lymphopenia, inflammatory lung disease, and neurodegeneration. Genetic inactivation of TNFR1 and TNFR2, however, rescued the loss of thymocytes, reduced interstitial lung disease, and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, genetic inactivation of TNFR1 and TNFR2 blunted transcription of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesions proteins, which result from chronic STING activation in SAVI mice. In addition, increased transendothelial migration of neutrophils was ameliorated. Taken together, our results demonstrate a pivotal role of TNFR signaling in the pathogenesis of SAVI in mice and suggest that available TNFR antagonists could ameliorate SAVI in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>STING</kwd><kwd>SAVI</kwd><kwd>TNF</kwd><kwd>systemic autoinflammation</kwd><kwd>vasculopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>369799452-TRR237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schulze</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC2151 - 390873048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Behrendt</surname><given-names>Rayk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>446167311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rösen-Wolff</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TNF signaling contributes significantly to pathology of constitutively active STING in murine STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING) is a key regulator in innate immunity, especially in the defense against viral infections. Uncontrolled activity of STING results in manifestation of autoinflammatory diseases, e.g., STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinkle et al., 2022</xref>), or severe COVID-19 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domizio et al., 2022</xref>). Murine SAVI is a well-established model for pathology and signaling of constitutive uncontrolled STING activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warner et al., 2017</xref>). STING is an innate immune receptor that senses cyclic dinucleotides. These can be derived from bacteria or in mammalian cells be produced by the enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which is activated upon binding to double-stranded DNA. Mammalian cGAS produces the unique 2′3′-cGAMP that binds to STING and results in its translocation, phosphorylation, and oligomerization. STING oligomers recruit TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which subsequently activates type I interferon (IFN I) signaling as well as nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) triggered signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Oliveira Mann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hopfner and Hornung, 2020</xref>). STING signaling is terminated by AP-1-mediated sorting of phosphorylated STING into clathrin-coated transport vesicles that fuse with endolysosomes to degrade STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonugunta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2022a</xref>).</p><p>Uncontrolled activity of STING is associated with various autoinflammatory disorders and severe diseases caused by viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Gain-of-function mutations of human <italic>STING1</italic> cause SAVI, which is characterized by severe interstitial lung disease, T cell lymphopenia, skin inflammation, and perturbed IFN- and NF-κB-driven signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clarke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Picard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). Genetically induced chronic activation of STING results in comparable severe systemic autoinflammatory symptoms in the murine organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennion et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennion et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luksch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacLauchlan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Motwani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Platt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shmuel-Galia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siedel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stinson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szego et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warner et al., 2017</xref>). We previously established a SAVI mouse model, by knocking in the disease causing variant N153S into the endogenous murine <italic>Sting1</italic> gene (STING ki) resulting in T cell lymphopenia, interstitial lung disease, and systemic autoinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luksch et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, STING ki mice show degeneration of dopaminergic neurons induced by neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szego et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Initially, STING activates various signal transduction pathways and has been assumed to function primarily through type I IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, the manifestation of SAVI hallmarks in STING ki mice were unaffected by knockout of cGAS, IFNAR1, IRF3, and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luksch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siedel et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that other pathways in the STING signaling cascade are required for SAVI symptoms. In our previous investigations, we observed an elevated transcription of <italic>Tnf</italic> in spleen and thymus of STING ki mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siedel et al., 2020</xref>). In order to test the hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling is involved in manifestation and progression of murine SAVI disease, we here used genetic inhibition of TNF receptors.</p><p>TNF, a systemic multifunctional cytokine, is involved in inflammation and immune regulation as well as development of lymphoid organs, and TNF can be produced and secreted by nearly every cell. We established new mouse lines with STING ki in addition to genetic depletion of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), or TNFR1/2. Both receptors are involved in TNF signaling pathways with different functions. TNFR1 is constitutively expressed on almost all cell populations, whereas TNFR2 expression is inducible in specific cell types, e.g., immune and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wajant and Siegmund, 2019</xref>). Both receptors are able to bind TNF but only TNFR1 contains an intracellular death domain and is involved in programmed cell death. TNFR2 is associated with survival and proliferation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atretkhany et al., 2020</xref>). After binding of ligands, TNF receptors trigger NF-κB-driven signaling, predominantly through TNFR1 whereas TNFR2 activates NF-κB transcription poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McFarlane et al., 2002</xref>). Current publications suggest distinct effects of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in association with different types of inflammation. TNFR1 signaling stimulates proinflammatory responses within the innate immune system. In contrast, actions of TNFR2 are involved in cellular homeostasis and anti-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, in the murine model of autoinflammatory familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), both TNF receptors have opposite effects. TNFR1 showed a pathogenic role and TNFR2 a protective role in association with murine FMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we observed that pathology in the thymus of SAVI mice was dependent on TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling whereas signaling through TNFR1 but not on TNFR2-mediated pathology in lungs of STING ki mice. Similarly, the manifestation of dopaminergic neuron degeneration in substantia nigra was dependent on TNFR1/2 signaling. Finally, we investigated the role of constitutive STING activation on the endothelial barrier, which was found to be TNF signaling-dependent. Endothelial cells of STING ki mice induced transmigration of neutrophils in a TNFR1-dependent manner. Overall, our study highlights a pivotal role of TNF signaling in SAVI disease and implies TNF blockade as valuable therapeutic option to ameliorate symptoms of SAVI disease in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Heterozygous STING N153S/WT mice (STING ki) were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luksch et al., 2019</xref>).

To address this, we established a cell culture system for quantification of neutrophil adhesion and neutrophil transmigration across a confluent endothelial cell monolayer under flow. Freshly isolated neutrophils from bone marrow of mice were added to cultured primary lung endothelial cell monolayers. All cells were exposed under constant flow pressure, which mimics physiological shear flow conditions. Quantification of attached and transmigrated neutrophils was performed by real-time microscopic supported video documentation. In the first setup, we used cultured endothelial cells from STING WT and STING ki mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Isolated neutrophil cells of STING WT mice attached significantly more frequently to STING ki endothelial cells than to STING WT endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), even without preincubation of the endothelial cell monolayer. We previously demonstrated that chronic activation of STING in STING N153S mice induced elevated transcription and production of TNF in the lung tissue. To mimic this, we preincubated the endothelial cell monolayer with TNF overnight. The attachment of STING WT neutrophils was much stronger after preincubation of endothelial cells with TNF compared to untreated cells. The reinforcement of proinflammatory signaling after preincubation with TNF resulted in elevated counts of attached (STING WT) neutrophils on STING ki endothelial cell monolayer compared to STING WT endothelial cell monolayers.</p><p>Many SAVI patients suffer from recurrent bacterial infections in the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). For analysis of endothelial cell function during bacterial infection, we preincubated the endothelial cell monolayer with LPS overnight. Similar to TNF pretreatment, the attachment of STING WT neutrophils was increased on LPS-exposed STING ki endothelial cells compared to STING WT. LPS also increased transendothelial migration (TEM) of STING WT neutrophils across the STING ki endothelial cell monolayer compared to STING WT endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we used neutrophils from STING ki mice for the investigation of STING WT and STING ki endothelial cell function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). More STING ki neutrophils attached to STING ki than to STING WT endothelial cell monolayer, independent of their preincubation. Similarly, we observed that significantly more neutrophils transmigrated across STING ki endothelial cell monolayer compared to STING WT endothelial cell monolayers. We conclude that attachment and transmigration of neutrophil cells were dependent on expression of STING gain-of-function mutation in endothelial cells. Taken together, STING ki endothelial cells supported the process of attachment and transmigration significantly more than STING WT endothelial cells.</p><p>In the next setup, we investigated the influence of the neutrophil genotype on the process of cell adhesion and transmigration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Only after TNF or LPS preincubation of endothelial cell monolayer (STING WT), we observed an effective cell attachment. However, we could not detect any differences in transmigration of neutrophil cells of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This is in line with the observation of STING WT or STING ki neutrophil cell attachment on STING ki endothelial cell monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We did not detect any differences in cell attachment without pretreatment and in transmigration of STING WT and STING ki neutrophils.

We observed improvement of thymocyte counts in STING ki mice lacking TNFR1 and TNFR1/2. Blockade of TNFR signaling, especially signaling of TNFR1, increased survival of thymocytes (SP CD8 cells) and enabled the enlargement of the peripheral T cell pool. Interestingly, the frequency of naïve T cells and effector T cells was unchanged in all analyzed STING ki mice. This indicates that blockade of TNFR signaling can promote the cellularity of thymocytes, but does not influence the activation of peripheral T cells. These results are in agreement with previously published data showing that systemic inflammation driven by TNFR signaling induced severe thymic atrophy. This phenotype was rescued totally in a TNFR1-deficient background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belhacéne et al., 2012</xref>). We previously reported that STING ki mice show a disturbed development of lymph nodes leading to the complete loss of lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennion et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the absence of TNFR1 signaling did normalize the thymocyte numbers, but did not restore the development of lymph nodes in STING ki mice. In contrast, STING ki mice lacking the IFNGR1 showed a successful lymph node development, but no improvement of thymocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stinson et al., 2022</xref>). These observations suggest that T cell development in the thymus is dependent on TNFR1 signaling, but the development of lymph nodes depends on IFNGR1 signaling.</p><p>Manifestation and progression of severe interstitial lung disease is a dominant hallmark of the murine systemic autoinflammatory SAVI disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warner et al., 2017</xref>). It was not possible to improve the severity of lung disease by a curative bone marrow transplantation in STING ki mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luksch et al., 2019</xref>). We observed a strong increase of type I IFN and type II IFN signaling as well as elevated transcription of proinflammatory mediators, e.g., <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> in lung tissue of STING ki mice. The manifestation of this inflammatory lung disease was independent of type I IFN, but depended on type II IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stinson et al., 2022</xref>). Our results demonstrated impressive that the initiation and progression of severe lung disease in STING ki mice is also dependent on TNFR1 signaling. In contrast, the deletion of TNFR2 in STING ki mice did not improve the severity of inflammatory lung disease. This is in line with a report that TNFR1 deficiency inhibited skin inflammation and TNFR2 deficiency rather promoted the development of skin disease in a mouse psoriasis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The STING-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra was reduced in mice with TNFR1/2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas the activation of astroglia and microglia was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Neurons express both TNFRs, so circulating TNF could affect dopaminergic neurons without involvement of glial cells.

Activation of microglia was affected only moderately by genetic inactivation of interferon receptor 1 (<italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), suggesting that it is not dependent on this pathway.</p><p>For determination of essential mediators in the manifestation of SAVI characteristic lung disease, we performed a transcriptome analysis of freshly isolated murine lung endothelial cells.

Remarkably, transcription of type II IFN-driven <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10,</italic> and NF-κB-driven <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> was downregulated in all analyzed STING ki mice with deletion of TNFR1 and TNFR2 compared to STING ki mice.

The complete evaluation of RNA sequencing data of primary lung endothelial cells disclosed the involvement of chemokines and adhesions proteins in the manifestation of SAVI characteristic inflammatory lung disease. Transcription of <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl3,</italic> and <italic>Ccl4</italic> was downregulated in endothelial cell of STING ki mice lacking TNFR1/2 signaling. The chemokine CCL2 induces cytoskeletal alterations in endothelial cells and is essential for recruitment and migration of neutrophil granulocytes across the endothelial barrier in mouse tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roblek et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, endothelial secretion of CCL2 controls metastasis by promoting tumor cell extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolf et al., 2012</xref>). In mice, CCL3 recruits neutrophil granulocytes to the lung in response to IFNγ-mediated signaling in a virus infection model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonville et al., 2009</xref>). In LPS-induced lung inflammation, CCL2 recruits macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes into lung tissue across the endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mercer et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of CCL2 induces brain endothelial hyperpermeability and attracts leukocytes to murine brain endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stamatovic et al., 2003</xref>). Human gain-of-function mutations of <italic>STING1</italic> induced elevated transcription of <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4,</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> in PBMCs from SAVI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Cevins et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, the increased expression of endothelial <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl3,</italic> and <italic>Ccl4</italic> is necessary for leukocyte transmigration into the lung tissue in the context of virus- or bacteria-induced inflammation, autoinflammation, and tumor-promoting metastasis. For transmigration of cells across the endothelial barrier, the presence of these chemokines is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mercer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Constitutively active STING induces activation of different pathways, e.g., interferon- or NF-κB-driven signaling. Our results demonstrate that proinflammatory mediators are much more produced in primary lung endothelial cells of SAVI mice. We assume that this uncontrolled signaling is essential for endothelial barrier dysfunction and finally for accumulation of leukocytes in the lung tissue. Primary lung endothelial cells of STING ki mice allowed more attachment of neutrophils compared to primary lung endothelial cells of STING WT mice. We pointed out that attachment and transmigration under native condition was independent of neutrophil genotype. These results demonstrated clearly that the intact barrier of lung endothelial cells is a critical factor for the manifestation of severe inflammatory lung disease. In a murine peritonitis model, it was demonstrated that the expression of STING in endothelial cells is essential for leukocyte transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiou et al., 2021</xref>). Endothelial cells isolated from human coronary artery produce high amounts of adhesions proteins, e.g., ICAM1, that support the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2018</xref>). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (stimulated with TNF), several alterations in gene transcription were observed, e.g., elevated transcription of proinflammatory mediators and adhesion proteins as well as decreased transcription of cytoskeletal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhead et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>). This altered signaling led to molecular alterations in endothelial cells and disrupted the endothelial cell barrier. Interestingly, the mouse model for acute lung injury induced by LPS inhalation is characterized by elevated STING expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of STING activation prevented the manifestation of this disease. In the same line it was published that the progression of ANCA-associated vasculitis is dependent on the activation of cGAS/STING/IRF3 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kessler et al., 2022</xref>). Blockade of STING activation improved the severity of this disease significantly. Previous murine studies indicated that the expression of STING V154M in endothelial cells is only essential for manifestation of inflammatory infiltrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2024</xref>). Taken together, the chronic activity of STING in endothelial cells of STING ki mice is important for disruption of endothelial cell barrier and manifestation of severe lung disease.</p><p>Stinson and coauthors described that murine SAVI disease is promoted by IFNγ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stinson et al., 2022</xref>) and we here observed a TNFR1 signaling dependency of this disease. These observations demonstrated that the manifestation and progression of systemic murine SAVI disease is dependent on various signaling pathways.</p><p>Murine SAVI is caused by heterozygous point mutations in <italic>Sting1</italic>, resulting in constitutive activation of STING with uncontrolled inflammatory activity. T cell lymphopenia and interstitial lung disease are characteristics of murine SAVI disease comparable to symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease. Cell fusion caused by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a potent activator of cGAS-STING pathway with induction of type I IFN and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthelot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2022b</xref>). During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the secretion of TNF and IFNγ induces inflammatory cell death by PANoptosis mediated by JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karki et al., 2021</xref>). Infliximab treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease improved the numbers of blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Popescu et al., 2022</xref>). The TNFR signaling is an essential part in the progression of COVID-19 disease as well as murine SAVI disease. Inhibition of TNFR activity is beneficial for both diseases.</p><p>In summary, our work suggests that TNFR1 signaling is a driver of murine SAVI disease. Loss of TNFR1 signaling can restore thymocyte (SP CD8 cells) numbers. Lack of TNFR1 signaling prevented the severe inflammatory lung disease manifestation in STING ki mice. However, it is important to note that with these newly generated mouse lines of TNFR signaling blockade, we are not able to explain all features of this systemic autoinflammatory disease. Additional investigations are required for complete elucidation of involved mechanisms and for development of new therapeutic options for SAVI patients.</p></sec></body><back><sec

We think this is a reasonable effort to understand the role of TNFRs in the pathogenesis of STING-associated vasculopathy. A significant amount of the disease observed is secondary to TNFRI activation and partially on TNFRII. Our greatest concern here relates to the use of Infliximab (an anti-human TNF antibody) rather than etanercept. There are studies which question the specificity of infliximab in the murine system (see for example, Anti‐inflammatory effects of infliximab in mice are independent of tumour necrosis factor α neutralization. Clin Exp Immunol. 2017 Feb; 187(2): 225-233. doi: 10.1111/cei.12872). Etanercept is known to bind to and inactivate both human and murine TNF. Although Infliximab has been used in the literature, its effects have been questioned over time and most recent studies preferentially use etanercept as a tool to block TNF-a in mice. The authors do present some results using etanercept (supplementary material). Unless the authors can show convincingly that murine TNF-a is being blocked in their system by Infliximab, this whole part of the study needs to be removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101350.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>STING is a key signalling hub in the innate immune system, receiving multiple inputs from upstream activators (such as cGAS) and in turn triggering multiple downstream events (such as IFN induction, NF-κB signalling, autophagy, cell death). Mutations in the STING gene cause a rare inflammatory disease called SAVI. Using a previously established STING ki mouse that recapitulates some of the clinical observations in SAVI patients, this manuscript tests the hypothesis that TNF signalling drives pathology. Using anti-TNF antibody and TNF receptor knockout, the authors show that TNF indeed plays important roles in causing disease in this mouse model. For example, the loss of T cells and neurons is prevented when TNF signalling is blocked, and lung pathology is rescued in STING ki mice lacking TNF receptors. Overall, the manuscript is well written and laid out, and the experimental work is of a high technical standard.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. Most figures show pooled data from two independent experiments including a total of 5-8 mice. Given the variability in some of the readouts, this raises the question of whether there is sufficient statistical power to draw conclusions. For example, in Figure 2, the conclusion that &quot;Infliximab did not alter the expression of inflammatory mediators&quot; seems questionable given the results in Figure 2F and G. Did the authors perform a power calculation? What effect size can the authors detect given the variability and number of replicates? Similarly, in Figure 3, the authors conclude that &quot;Disruption of TNFR signaling did not significantly prevent T cell lymphopenia&quot;; however, with some more replicates, the data in Figure 3D would likely reach significance. Similar concerns apply to several panels in Figures 4 and 6 and to Figure S5M. Ideally, the authors should perform additional repeat experiments to increase the number of replicates. If that is not possible, power calculations need to be provided and conclusions should explicitly mention the minimum effect size that the author can detect given the small sample size (for example &quot;Infliximab did not alter the expression of inflammatory mediators more than x-fold&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her time and for the constructive comments. Below please find our detailed responses to your points.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. However, it is not possible to repeat the treatment of mice with Infliximab for generation of more replicates. The blockade of TNF signalling by treatment with drugs did not cure the murine SAVI disease. According to animal welfare restrictions, we cannot perform additional treatment experiments with Infliximab or Etanercept.</p><p>We analysed the effect size d, f and power of all these presented results and collected them in table S4. Additional explanations about effect sizes were added in the corresponding text to Figures 2 and 3. The demonstrated results in Figure 4 and 6 already contain significant data. We did not include the calculation of effects sizes here. All effect size and power calculations are summarized in table S4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should not make unjustified overstatements. For example, STING KI; TNFR1/2 KO mice should not be referred to as a &quot;new mouse model&quot;. The manuscript simply tests the role of TNFR1/2 in the already published STING N153S model. In line 687, avoid using &quot;impressively&quot; and in line 734 avoid using &quot;massively&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

The main weaknesses are (1) small sample sizes limiting statistical power (see above) and (2) the exclusive use of mouse models.</p><p>Overall, my opinion is that the advance is important, both fundamentally and clinically. Studies of this and the related V154M mouse model previously showed an important role of non-IFN pathways in driving disease. This study indicates that TNF signalling may cause pathology. This not only extends our understanding of STING's role in autoinflammation but also opens a direct therapeutic avenue using approved TNF targeting drugs.</p><p>This study will be primarily of interest to specialised audiences working on STING and SAVI, and secondarily to the wider innate immunity field.</p><p>This reviewer has expertise in the field of nucleic acid sensing, including cGAS-STING.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this paper, Luksch et al. (2024) examines the role of TNF signaling in STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). By using pharmacological inhibition and genetic inactivation of TNF receptors in a murine SAVI model (STING ki), the research found that pharmacologically inhibiting TNF signaling improved T cell lymphopenia but had limited effects on lung disease. Genetic inactivation of TNFR signaling, particularly TNFR1, enhanced thymocyte survival and expanded the peripheral T cell pool, reducing inflammation and neurodegeneration. The development and progression of severe lung disease in STING ki mice are also reliant on TNFR1 signaling, while TNFR2 deletion did not alleviate lung inflammation. The authors also explored the severe inflammatory lung disease manifestation, showing that primary lung endothelial cells in STING ki mice allowed more neutrophil attachment compared to those in STING WT mice, indicating chronic STING activity in endothelial cells disrupts the endothelial barrier and promotes severe lung disease. The study highlights TNFR signaling as crucial in SAVI and COVID-19 progression and suggests blocking TNFR1 signaling as a potential therapeutic approach for both diseases.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The paper establishes a strong connection between TNFR1 depletion and the reduction of SAVI disease severity in lung and neuroinflammation, suggesting TNFR1 blockade as a viable therapeutic strategy for SAVI. To strengthen the arguments and improve the therapeutic potential, the authors should address the following major comments:</p><p>1. The authors conclude that TNFR1 signaling drives murine SAVI disease, as evidenced by the reduced severity of lung disease in TNFR1 -/- mice. While the genetic model is convincing, the discrepancy between pharmacological inhibition and genetic models needs clarification. Before attributing the pharmacological failure to late administration, have the authors considered that Infliximab might not sufficiently deplete TNF to achieve therapeutic benefits? In figure 2H, serum TNF levels were not significantly altered in STING ki mice treated with Infliximab. Have the authors considered using other TNF inhibitors or alternative methods to measure TNF depletion efficacy in STING ki murine models, such as qPCR, flow cytometry, or immunohistochemistry in lymph nodes or lung tissues?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her time and for the constructive comments. Below please find our detailed responses to your points.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. In a preliminary experiment, we already treated STING WT and STING ki mice with Etanercept which is not included in the paper. 3-week-old mice were treated with subcutaneously injection of 25 mg/kg Etanercept or saline, twice per week, for 7 weeks. After treatment, all mice were euthanized and single cell suspensions of blood and spleen were used for flow cytometry analysis. Lung tissue was harvested for histological analysis. Quantification of gene expression was performed by snap frozen lung and kidney tissue and quantification of secreted proteins was analysed by snap frozen serum.</p><p>The transcription of ISGs and proinflammatory mediators in lung tissue was not significantly improved by the Etanercept treatment of mice, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> – D. Interestingly, the amount of secreted CXCL9 in the serum was reduced in Etanercept treated mice compared to vehicle treated mice (E). We concluded that our treatment strategy had no impact in the manifestation and progression of murine SAVI disease, in highly inflamed tissues / organs. However, we found a reduction (partially significant) of proinflammatory mediator transcriptions in the kidney of Etanercept treated mice compared to vehicle control mice. Murine SAVI disease is a systemic autoinflammatory disease without histological alteration in kidney tissue of 10 weeks old mice. Remarkably, transcription of ISGs and proinflammatory mediators is highly upregulated in SAVI mice. Treatment with Etanercept improved this aberrant gene expression in murine SAVI influenced tissue / organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1I</xref> – K). These results encouraged us to perform the treatment with infliximab because we expected a more pronounced effect since infliximab can bind the monomeric and trimeric form while etanercept can only bind to the active trimeric from of TNF.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Etanercept treatment of STING WT (in black) and STING ki (in red) mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative expression level of Cxcl10, (<bold>B</bold>) Mx1, (<bold>C</bold>) Tnf and (<bold>D</bold>) Il1b in lung tissue of Etanercept or saline treated STING WT and STING ki mice.

The TNF pathway exhibits redundancy, as multiple signaling molecules or pathways can compensate for the loss of TNF function to maintain cellular processes and immune responses. The authors showed that thymocytes of STING ki mice lacking TNFR1/2 expressed significantly lower levels of IFN-related genes (Cxcl10, Sting1), and mice lacking TNFR1 and TNFR1/2 expressed reduced levels of NF-κB-related genes. Does this imply that IFN and NF-κB pathways are downstream of TNF signaling driving SAVI progression? It would be valuable to hear the authors' comments or postulations on the potential mechanisms of TNF driving SAVI progression in the discussion, and the methods to dissect the mechanisms further using genetic or pharmacological methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. STING is a key player in various proinflammatory mechanism and is directly involved in IFN and NF-κB signalling. We assume that these signalling pathways are adaptable to various proinflammatory situations. Knock out of TNFR1 and TNFR1/2 results in a strong inhibition of all inflammatory reactions in the whole organisms. We think, it is not possible to conclude mechanisms of murine SAVI manifestation and progression from the results of these mouse lines only. These observations provide new hypothesis, but cannot completely explain the mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mentioned that the pharmacological inhibition of TNF by Infliximab is ineffective due to late administration compared to the onset of SAVI. How would this affect the therapeutic treatment of TNF if the treatment is going to be later than the disease onset? Can the authors elaborate on the potential ways to circumvent the timing of treatment? Would TNFR1 antagonists experience the same issue? To understand disease progression and optimal targeting times, the creation of an inducible TNFR1/2 -/- mouse model could be beneficial. This is optional, but the authors are encouraged to comment on improving TNFR1/2 -/- mouse SAVI models to further study the therapeutic potential of TNF signaling blockage in treating SAVI.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the suggestion. In the next project, we want to generate STING ki mice with inducible knock out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>4. The authors separate STING WT and STING ki into different graphs, which can sometimes make it hard to compare STING WT and STING ki baseline levels. It would be beneficial to merge the two genotypes into single graphs for easier comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. In the first version of this manuscript, we collected results from STING WT and STING ki mice in one graph with 8 bars in different colours and textures in the case of TNFR knock out lines. These graphs were overloaded and very confusing. It is was not possible to mark statistical calculations inside these graphs without losing the focus. Hence, we created the demonstrated design of graphs. We think this is the most convincing version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure S5 lacks statistical annotations, although the legends mention them. Are the statistics usually shown when a comparison is mentioned in the text, or are they only displayed when the differences are significant? It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this and ensure that all relevant statistical comparisons are clearly reflected in the graphs, regardless of the significance level. This consistency would improve the clarity and interpretation of the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We removed the significance level from the legend of Figure S5 (actually line 1199).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors did an excellent job discussing the study's implications, but some of this content could be moved to the introduction. The hypothesis that &quot;tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling is involved in the manifestation and progression of murine SAVI disease&quot; can be introduced more naturally once the authors present previous findings on TNF's association with various autoimmune disorders. This would set a clear context for the study's objectives and rationale.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion and inserted the sentence: “In our previous investigations, we observed an elevated transcription of <italic>Tnf</italic> in spleen and thymus of STING ki mice (Siedel et al., 2020).” (actual line 89/90).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General Assessment: The study identifies enhanced TNF signaling as a driver of SAVI and specifies TNFR1 blockage as a promising treatment to reduce disease severity. It thoroughly characterizes pharmacological inhibition and genetic perturbations of TNF signaling in murine SAVI models and creates a novel mouse model for studying TNF-targeted therapies in SAVI treatment.</p><p>However, the study is limited in characterizing the discrepancy between pharmacological inhibition and genetic depletion of TNF and understanding the underlying mechanisms of TNF driving chronic STING activation and tissue inflammation.</p><p>Advances: The study extends knowledge in the field by demonstrating that enhanced TNF signaling drives SAVI, establishing causation rather than mere correlation. The authors provide strong rationale for treating SAVI with TNF inhibitors/blockage, previously used in other autoimmune disorders like IBD or Crohn's disease, but not in SAVI. They also present a valuable genetic model for studying TNFR signaling blockage in SAVI progression, which is important for both the field of SAVI and future therapy development.</p><p>Audience: The research provides translational and clinical insights by suggesting that targeting TNFR1 signaling could inspire novel treatments for SAVI. The study also advances basic research on SAVI disease progression. Immunologists and clinicians studying and treating autoimmune disorders are the intended audience, but the findings have broader implications. The study highlights the potential role of TNF signaling in COVID-19 disease progression and treatment, thus attracting interest beyond the field of autoimmune disorders.</p><p>Field of expertise:</p><p>cGAS-STING regulation in chromosomally unstable cancers, genomic instability, nuclear envelope rupture and repair</p><p>Do not have sufficient expertise in:</p><p>Immunological underpinning of autoimmune disorders, clinical models or manifestations of SAVI</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Uncontrolled activation of STING is linked to autoinflammatory disease &quot;STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI)&quot;. The authors had previously published a mouse model of SAVI, which was generated by knocking in the disease causing variant N153S into the endogenous murine Sting1 gene (STING ki) (Luksch et.al., 2019). In the current study, the author further investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling in manifestation and progression of murine SAVI disease by using the approach of pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of TNF receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2. Overall, the authors were able to demonstrate the following novel findings:</p><p>1) Infliximab treatment of STING ki mice significantly increased the number of blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and thymic cells count. The authors claimed that the pharmacological inhibition of TNF signalling has a partial rescue effect of T cell lymphopenia. However, pharmacologic inhibition of TNF signalling however has no effect on lung disease.</p><p>2) On the other hand, STING ki;Tnfr1-/- (lacking TNFR1) showed the similar modest rescue of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in blood compared to the WT C57BL/6 (BL6) but not with STING ki;Tnfr2-/- (lacking TNFR2). STING ki;Tnfr1-/-, STING ki;Tnfr2-/- and STING ki;Tnfr1/2-/- had modest rescue of thymic cell count and reduced spleen cell count (reduced splenomegaly). Along with the rescued thymic content and reduced splenomegaly, genetic ablation of TNF signalling (STING ki;Tnfr1-/-) also prevented manifestation of severe inflammatory lung disease.</p><p>3) To investigate the role of lung endothelial cells in the development of interstitial lung disease, primary murine lung endothelial cells from STING WT, STING ki and STING WT;Tnfr1/2-/- and STING ki;Tnfr1/2-/- mice were isolated and bulk RNAseq was performed. This showed decreased level of several proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. Tnf, Il1b) and chemokines (e.g. Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl3 and Ccl4) in STING ki mice lacking TNFR1/2 compared to STING ki mice.</p><p>4) Neutrophils were isolated from bone marrow and were added to cultured primary lung endothelial cell monolayers. The experiments demonstrated that the attachment and transmigration of neutrophil cells were dependent on expression of STING gain-of-function mutation in endothelial cells.</p><p>A few points require clarification before publication of this study.</p><p>1. Tnfr1-/-, Tnfr2-/- and Tnfr1/2-/- did not show any statistical significant improvement of thymic cell count in STING ki mice. As such, the statement in the conclusion/summary section of discussion regarding Tnfr1 can restore thymocyte numbers should be toned-down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her time and for the constructive comments. Below please find our detailed responses to your points.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. In Figure 4 E, we demonstrated that knock out of TNFR1 leads to increasing of SP CD8 thymocyte count and partially of SP CD4 thymocyte count (Figure 4 D).

The dependence of STING-induced neurodegeneration but not glial response on TNFR1/2 suggests that the STING-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is not a direct consequence of microglia or astroglia activation. This is consistent with the emerging concept of a neuron-specific inflammatory response (Welikovitch et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The powerful use of in vivo genetic KO models and TNF inhibitor makes this study a valuable contribution to the field – helping further decipher the importance of the NF-ΚB/TNF branch of STING in SAVI (knowledge gap).

We think this is a reasonable effort to understand the role of TNFRs in the pathogenesis of STING-associated vasculopathy. A significant amount of the disease observed is secondary to TNFRI activation and partially on TNFRII. Our greatest concern here relates to the use of Infliximab (an anti-human TNF antibody) rather than etanercept. There are studies which question the specificity of infliximab in the murine system (see for example, Anti‐inflammatory effects of infliximab in mice are independent of tumour necrosis factor α neutralization. Clin Exp Immunol. 2017 Feb; 187(2): 225-233. doi: 10.1111/cei.12872). Etanercept is known to bind to and inactivate both human and murine TNF. Although Infliximab has been used in the literature, its effects have been questioned over time and most recent studies preferentially use etanercept as a tool to block TNF-a in mice. The authors do present some results using etanercept (supplementary material). Unless the authors can show convincingly that murine TNF-a is being blocked in their system by Infliximab, this whole part of the study needs to be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you and the reviewers for your time and for the constructive comments which have helped us to substantially improve the manuscript.
