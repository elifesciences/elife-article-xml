Initial CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1–3 elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal non-specific effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown. Our results and publicly available reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi genetic screening.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>CRISPR interference</kwd><kwd>genetic screen</kwd><kwd>functional genomics</kwd><kwd>knockdown</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM130964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jost</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RM1HG009490-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Springer Nature Global Grant for Gut Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1772808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jost</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001680</institution-id><institution>Charles H.

screening, and cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doench, 2018</xref>). In mammalian cells, CRISPRi requires two components: (i) an effector protein of catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to one or more transcription repressor domains, which recruits endogenous epigenetic modulators to the genome, and (ii) a single guide RNA (sgRNA), which directs the effector protein to target DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>). When the sgRNA is targeted to a gene promoter, CRISPRi leads to repressive epigenome editing and knockdown of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horlbeck et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horlbeck et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Several features distinguish CRISPRi from Cas9 nuclease-mediated DNA cutting, the major alternative CRISPR/Cas-based approach for loss-of-function genetic studies: (i) Unlike Cas9, CRISPRi does not rely on introduction of double-stranded DNA breaks and therefore does not cause genomic rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kosicki et al., 2018</xref>) and DNA damage-associated toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>), which may be especially limiting in primary and stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haapaniemi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ihry et al., 2018</xref>). (ii) CRISPRi tends to confer more homogeneous loss of gene function compared to Cas9, which often generates subpopulations of cells bearing active in-frame indels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smits et al., 2019</xref>). (iii) CRISPRi is reversible and thus affords temporal control over gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandegar et al., 2016</xref>). (iv) CRISPRi enables titration of gene expression, which for example allows for partial depletion of genes essential for cell growth and interrogation of the resulting phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hawkins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jost et al., 2020</xref>). (v) In turn, one can directly measure the extent of on-target knockdown as well as the corresponding responses in individual cells, for example, using single-cell RNA-seq (Perturb-seq), allowing for evaluation of the extent and potential biological significance of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. (vi) CRISPRi enables loss-of-function studies for non-coding RNAs, which are difficult to inactivate or repress through CRISPR cutting and the introduction of indels as they are insensitive to frame-shifting mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Like other CRISPR approaches, CRISPRi has been paired with large-scale sgRNA libraries to conduct systematic genetic screens. Such screens have been deployed to identify essential protein-coding and non-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haswell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horlbeck et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raffeiner et al., 2020</xref>), to map the targets of regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fulco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fulco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasperini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kearns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thakore et al., 2015</xref>), to identify regulators of cellular signaling and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coukos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luteijn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Semesta et al., 2020</xref>), to uncover stress response pathways in stem cell-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tian et al., 2019</xref>), to uncover regulators of disease-associated states in microglia and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dräger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leng et al., 2022</xref>), to decode regulators of cytokine production in primary human T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>), to define mechanisms of action of bioactive small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jost et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">le Sage et al., 2017</xref>), to identify synthetic-lethal genetic interactions in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horlbeck et al., 2018</xref>), and to identify genetic determinants of complex transcriptional responses using RNA-seq readouts (Perturb-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Replogle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tian et al., 2019</xref>), among others.</p><p>Despite these successes, two technical factors have limited wider adoption of CRISPRi. First, CRISPRi screening is constrained by the large size of sgRNA libraries. Previous machine learning efforts yielded guide design rules which substantially increased the activity of sgRNA libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horlbeck et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanson et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, commonly used libraries (e.g., Dolcetto, CRISPRi v2) target each gene with three or more sgRNAs to decrease false-negative results in screens. The development of a more compact, highly active sgRNA library would enable CRISPRi screens in new cell types and for more complex phenotypes, especially when cost, time, and/or cell numbers are limiting. Second, there is no clear consensus guiding the use of the different reported CRISPRi effector proteins, complicating the generation of CRISPRi cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alerasool et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a suite of tools to enable high-quality CRISPRi genetic screening in a broad range of cell models as well as accompanying protocols, publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jostlab.org/resources/">https://www.jostlab.org/resources/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/">https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/</ext-link>. Based on empirical data aggregated from 126 screens, we design and validate an ultra-compact, highly active CRISPRi library in which each gene is targeted by a single library element encoding a dual-sgRNA cassette of the two most active sgRNAs for that gene. Next, we compare published CRISPRi effector proteins based on their on-target efficacy and non-specific effects on transcription and cell proliferation. We find that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides the best balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal non-specific effects. Finally, we generate K562, RPE1, Jurkat, HT29, HuTu-80, and HepG2 cell lines engineered to stably express Zim3-dCas9 and demonstrate robust on-target knockdown across these cell lines. Our results and reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi genetic screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparison of single- and dual-sgRNA CRISPRi libraries for genetic screening</title><p>Two critical factors for potential applications of CRISPRi screening are the on-target knockdown efficacy and the size of the sgRNA library. In recent work, we found that targeting individual genes with dual-sgRNA constructs substantially improved CRISPRi-mediated gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>). Building on this result, we asked whether a dual-sgRNA strategy could be used to generate an ultra-compact, genome-wide CRISPRi library.</p><p>To assess the potential utility of dual-sgRNA libraries in systematic genetic screens, we began by cloning two pilot libraries for comparison: (i) one targeting each human gene with two distinct sgRNAs expressed from a tandem sgRNA cassette (dual-sgRNA) and (ii) one targeting each human gene by only the single best sgRNA (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also optimized a protocol to amplify and sequence dual-sgRNA cassettes from lentivirally integrated genomic DNA (see Materials and methods; both protocols available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jostlab.org/resources/">https://www.jostlab.org/resources/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/">https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/</ext-link>). Next, we compared the performance of our single- and dual-sgRNA libraries in a genome-wide growth screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We transduced K562 cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB(Kox1) with our libraries, used puromycin to select for cells with lentiviral integration, and harvested cells at day 8 (T<sub>0</sub>) and day 20 (T<sub>final</sub>) post-transduction. We amplified sgRNA cassettes from extracted genomic DNA, sequenced to quantify sgRNA abundance in the two populations, and calculated growth phenotypes for each library element by comparing changes in abundance between T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>final</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The growth phenotypes produced by the single- and dual-sgRNA libraries were well correlated with previously published CRISPRi growth screens using five sgRNAs per gene (single sgRNA r<italic>=</italic>0.82; dual sgRNA r<italic>=</italic>0.83; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) and produced near-perfect recall of essential genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (AUC &gt; 0.98 for both single- and dual-sgRNA libraries). Yet, for essential genes previously identified by the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>), the dual-sgRNA library produced significantly stronger growth phenotypes (mean 29% decrease in the growth rate [γ]) than the single-sgRNA library (n=2005 genes; single-sgRNA mean γ = −0.20; dual-sgRNA mean γ = −0.26; Mann-Whitney p-value = 6 ∙ 10<sup>−15</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), suggesting that the dual-sgRNA library confers stronger depletion of target genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and validation of ultra-compact dual-single guide RNA (sgRNA) CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) libraries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of growth screen used to compare single- and dual-sgRNA libraries.

These two copies generally bear two different sgRNA pairs in a pooled dual-sgRNA library, such that template switching can produce a recombined element with sgRNAs targeting different genes. Our sequencing strategy allowed us to directly identify such recombined elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which occurred with a frequency of 29% in K562 cells, 26% in RPE1 cells, and 24% in Jurkat cells, consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horlbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>). We expected that recombination would be stochastic rather than biased to specific sgRNA sequences, because the length of the invariable sequence between sgRNAs (400 bp) far exceeds the length of sgRNA targeting regions (20 bp). To further distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the recombination rates of elements across replicate screens in K562 cells and found that recombination rates of non-targeting control elements were only weakly correlated (r=0.30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We note that apparent recombination rates of targeting elements were strongly correlated across replicates (r=0.77, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This correlation is likely a consequence of more rapid dropout of unrecombined elements, which generally confer stronger growth phenotypes than recombined elements, leading to inflation of apparent recombination rates. Indeed, apparent recombination rates were strongly anticorrelated with growth phenotypes of the unrecombined elements (r = −0.84, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Together, these results further indicate that recombination is stochastic and largely independent of sgRNA sequence. In our downstream analyses, we exclude all recombined elements such that they do not impact phenotypes, although in principle these recombined elements could be used to assess independent effects of the two sgRNAs targeting each gene.

To optimize sgRNA selection for each gene, we aggregated empirical sgRNA activity data from 126 CRISPRi genetic screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and implemented a three-tiered selection system. First, for genes that are essential in K562 cells, we ranked sgRNAs by growth phenotype. Second, for genes that produced a significant phenotype in one of our previous CRISPRi screens, we ranked sgRNAs by relative <italic>z</italic>-scored phenotype averaged across screens in which the target gene was identified as a hit. Finally, for genes without any empirical effect in a prior screen, we ranked sgRNAs according to predicted activities from the hCRISPRi v2.1 algorithm (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horlbeck et al., 2016a</xref>). To allow users to select the library size suitable to their application, we cloned sublibraries of the best single element (guide ranked 1+2; referred to as hCRISPRi_dual_1_2), the second best element (guides ranked 3+4; referred to as hCRISPRi_dual_3_4), or the third best element (guides ranked 5+6; referred to as hCRISPRi_dual_5_6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>Further examination of the phenotypes from our screens revealed that a small number of elements produced discordant effects between screens, which may arise from bottlenecking or amplification bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). For libraries with multiple elements targeting each gene, such discordant effects can often be mitigated by comparing phenotypes across elements, but this option is not available with single-element libraries. In previously reported CRISPR cutting libraries, incorporation of barcodes into the sgRNA cassette enabled marking and tracing populations of cells derived from individual lentiviral integrations, which allowed for detection of bottlenecking events and amplification bias and thereby improved screen sensitivity and robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michlits et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Building on these results, we incorporated a set of 215 8-nucleotide barcodes, which we term integration barcodes (IBCs), in the tandem sgRNA cassette of our final hCRISPRi_dual_1_2, hCRISPRi_dual_3_4, and hCRISPRi_dual_5_6 libraries (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

We used direct capture Perturb-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>), pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell RNA-seq readout, to measure the on-target knockdown mediated by the top three elements in our dual-sgRNA library (guides 1+2, guides 3+4, or guides 5+6) or the three Dolcetto Set A sgRNAs for 128 randomly selected genes that are expressed in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Our dual-sgRNA library significantly outperformed the Dolcetto library, as quantified by the average knockdown (dual-sgRNA median knockdown 82%; Dolcetto median knockdown 65%; Mann-Whitney p-value = 2.4 ∙ 10<sup>−7</sup>) as well as the strongest knockdown per gene (dual-sgRNA median knockdown 90%; Dolcetto median knockdown 87%; Mann-Whitney p-value = 2 ∙ 10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Briefly, in this construct, expression is driven by a spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter, with an upstream ubiquitous chromatin opening element (UCOE) to minimize silencing, internal nuclear localization signals (NLSs), and an internal HA tag, a GFP marker linked at the C-terminus via a P2A ribosomal skipping sequence to allow for stable cell line generation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element in the 3′ UTR to increase mRNA stability. Where necessary, we included linker sequences derived from the XTEN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schellenberger et al., 2009</xref>), which is reported to be functionally innocuous, to minimize proteolytic cleavage between dCas9 and fused repressor domains. We attempted to maximize the activity for each repressor domain based on our previous data and data in the literature, although we note that our evaluation is not exhaustive.

To test for effects on proliferation, we generated K562 cell lines stably expressing each effector by lentiviral transduction followed by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and then quantified the effect of each effector on cell proliferation using an internally normalized competitive growth assay. We mixed cells bearing each effector ~1:1 with cells expressing mCherry and quantified growth defects of effector-expressing cells by measuring the ratio of mCherry-negative to mCherry-positive cells over time by flow cytometry. We used mCherry-expressing cells as a reference population instead of parental, GFP-negative cells because some of the effector-expressing cells convert to GFP-negative over time due to silencing, which is difficult to separate from true dropout of effector-expressing cells due to growth defects. Over 19 days, cells expressing dCas9 only, dCas9-Kox1, or Zim3-dCas9 proliferated at the same rate as cells expressing GFP only or non-transduced control cells, suggesting that expression of these effectors is not toxic over this time span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, cells expressing SID-dCas9-Kox1 had a strong growth defect (~6% per day), and cells expressing dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2 had a mild growth defect (~1% per day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To assess non-specific effects of effectors on transcription, we performed global transcriptome profiling of K562 cells stably transduced with these effectors by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).

Indeed, these samples clustered separately from every other control and effector-expressing sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, 53 genes were differentially expressed in cells with dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2, suggesting that constitutive expression of this effector also leads to minor non-specific effects on transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). No more than three genes were detected to be differentially expressed in cells expressing any of the other effectors, suggesting that these effectors do not non-specifically perturb transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that (over)expression of SID-dCas9-Kox1 is toxic and globally perturbs transcription at least in K562 cells.

We transduced K562 cell lines stably expressing each CRISPRi effector with vectors simultaneously expressing an sgRNA and a fluorescent marker (mCherry) at a low multiplicity of infection (0.2–0.5). We then monitored the ratio of sgRNA-expressing cells (mCherry+) and unperturbed cells (mCherry-) by flow cytometry, with the expectation that cells with an essential gene-targeting sgRNA would deplete at a rate proportional to CRISPRi activity. We targeted three genes, alanyl-tRNA synthetase (<italic>AARS</italic>), the mitochondrial inner membrane import factor DNAJC19, and subunit D of RNA polymerase I and III (<italic>POLR1D</italic>), with three different sgRNAs each. For all sgRNAs tested, sgRNA-expressing cells depleted at the fastest rate with Zim3-dCas9 and at the second-fastest rate with either dCas9-Kox1 or dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next, to directly measure depletion of targeted proteins, we knocked down the non-essential cell surface proteins CD55 (complement decay-accelerating factor), CD81 (TAPA-1/TSPAN28), and CD151 (TSPAN24) and measured staining intensity with fluorescently labeled antibodies by flow cytometry as a proxy for protein levels. We transduced K562 lines stably expressing the different CRISPRi effectors with vectors expressing either targeting or non-targeting sgRNAs at a low multiplicity of infection (0.2–1). Six days after transduction, we stained cells with fluorescently labeled antibodies against the different cell surface proteins and assessed knockdown by comparing the median antibody staining intensity in cells expressing a targeting sgRNA and cells expressing a non-targeting control sgRNA. With strong sgRNAs, Zim3-dCas9, dCas9-Kox1, and dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2 all mediated strong depletion of each cell surface protein (&gt;96.8% median depletion for all effectors and sgRNAs). With weak sgRNAs, dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2 mediated the strongest knockdown closely followed by Zim3-dCas9, whereas dCas9-Kox1 mediated weaker knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, flow cytometry reports on expression at the single-cell level, allowing us to assess cell-to-cell heterogeneity in knockdown, which is missed when quantifying median expression. As a proxy for heterogeneity, we calculated the fraction of cells without evidence of knockdown despite the use of a strong sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). For Zim3-dCas9, knockdown was largely homogeneous, with only ~5% of cells without detectable knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), perhaps due to the presence of some senescent cells in the population in which lack of cell division limits protein dilution. By contrast, for dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2, 15–20% of cells did not achieve knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). This result may be explained by the toxicity of the effector protein leading to selection against effector expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or by larger cell-to-cell variability in expression levels of the dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2 effector or may be indicative of an intrinsic property of MeCP2 activity. The observed heterogeneity in MeCP2 knockdown may help explain why dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2 appears to mediate the strongest median knockdown while Zim3-dCas9 leads to faster dropout of sgRNA-expressing cells in the essential gene growth assay; in the growth assay, heterogeneity would lead to worse performance due to selection against strong knockdown.

Among the available approaches, CRISPRi has several appealing features including independence of double-stranded DNA breaks, homogeneity and reversibility of perturbations, accessibility of partial loss-of-function phenotypes, and compatibility with direct measurements of target gene expression levels in both bulk populations and single cells. CRISPRi screens have indeed propelled biological discovery in several contexts, but broader deployment has been limited by difficulties in generating CRISPRi cell models and limited knockdown efficacy for a subset of genes. Here, we present a suite of tools and accompanying protocols to address these limitations and improve the efficacy and accessibility of CRISPRi.</p><p>Our ultra-compact, dual-sgRNA CRISPRi library confers stronger knockdown and growth phenotypes than previously reported libraries and thus should minimize false-negative rates in screens. Nonetheless, this library also has drawbacks. First, some library elements undergo intermolecular recombination during lentiviral transduction. We can detect and computationally remove such recombination events, such that they do not corrupt the resulting data. As a consequence, recombination primarily decreases effective library coverage, and in return cell numbers need to be increased by ~20–30% to ensure coverage. In the future, recombination may be further mitigated using decoy vectors, different promoters, and alternatively processed guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knapp et al., 2019</xref>). Second and perhaps more importantly, screens will be inherently noisier and sensitive to off-target effects with only a single element per gene, such that in standard cell lines in which cell numbers are not a concern, existing single-sgRNA libraries may remain the approach of choice. Inclusion of the 3–4 and 5–6 element sublibraries in our dual-sgRNA library can mitigate this noise at the expense of some of the compactness. In cases in which cell numbers are limited by the model, time, or cost, however, the compactness of our dual-sgRNA library will be transformative. Examples include screens in primary or stem cell-derived models or in vivo as well as screens with high-content readout such as Perturb-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bock et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Przybyla and Gilbert, 2022</xref>). In sum, our dual-sgRNA libraries improve CRISPRi knockdown and complement existing libraries by broadening the scope of models in which CRISPRi screens are feasible.</p><p>The dual-sgRNA strategy may provide similar benefits for other CRISPR modalities such as CRISPR-mediated overexpression (CRISPR activation [CRISPRa]), as also described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yin et al., 2022</xref>), and in mouse cells. We have cloned a human dual-sgRNA CRISPRa library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>) and designed in silico dual-sgRNA CRISPRi and CRISPRa libraries targeting the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10 supp11">Supplementary files 10 and 11</xref>). Because few human CRISPRa and mouse screens have been reported, we did not use empirical sgRNA selection for these libraries and instead ranked sgRNAs by their predicted activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horlbeck et al., 2016a</xref>). Finally, the improved knockdown afforded by the dual-sgRNA approach will also be beneficial in arrayed experiments, in which recombination is not a concern, and we have generated a protocol for cloning dual-sgRNA libraries in array (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jostlab.org/resources/">https://www.jostlab.org/resources/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/">https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/</ext-link>).</p><p>In the realm of CRISPRi effectors, our work points to a clear consensus: Zim3-dCas9 is the effector of choice, as it appears equal or superior to other effectors in every test we performed and had no apparent downsides. We had previously measured by Perturb-seq that Zim3-dCas9 afforded median mRNA knockdown of 91.6% across 2285 genes in RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Replogle et al., 2022</xref>), and here we further found that Zim3-dCas9 mediates robust knockdown across a range of cell types. Our work highlights the importance of using multiple assays to assess effector activity including single-cell assays to assess cell-to-cell heterogeneity, of directly measuring knockdown instead of relying on proxies such as growth phenotypes that conflate multiple factors, and of evaluating effectors in stably transduced cells rather than in transiently transfected cells to evaluate longer-term consequences for cell viability. To facilitate implementation of CRISPRi in additional cell models, we created a suite of effector expression constructs with different combinations of promoters and markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>) as well as a cell line generation protocol. After generating a new CRISPRi cell line, we recommend evaluating the cell line for activity and lack of non-specific effects on cell growth, using for example the protocols and assays we describe, before proceeding to large-scale experiments.</p><p>Nonetheless, there is more progress to be made in evaluating effectors and generating robust CRISPRi models. First, our comparison of the effectors was not exhaustive. For example, although we expressed all effectors from the same context, we did not control for potential differences in expression levels or nuclear localization across effectors. The Zim3-dCas9 expression constructs appear optimal as they are, but activities of other effectors may be boosted by optimizing these factors. Second, repression of gene expression is generally mediated through recruitment of endogenous cofactors; for KRAB domains such as those from Zim3 and Kox1, this endogenous cofactor is TRIM28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ecco et al., 2017</xref>). TRIM28 expression varies by cell type, and efficacy of Zim3 and Kox1 may be limited in cell types with low TRIM28 expression. In such cell types, the MeCP2 effector may be a suitable alternative, but the selection against effector-expressing cells may increase false-positive and false-negative rates. Third, we did not measure if the effectors differed in propensity for sgRNA-dependent off-target effects. Previous work on dCas9-Kox1 had documented that well-designed sgRNAs have minimal off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>). The main source of off-target effects of CRISPRi are at bidirectional promoters, which likely is an inevitable consequence of the mechanism of CRISPRi. We note that the stronger activity of Zim3-based effectors may amplify such effects. For now, such off-target effects can be readily predicted and measured, for example by Perturb-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Replogle et al., 2022</xref>). Perhaps future efforts will identify strategies to limit knockdown of neighboring genes. Finally, in some cell types effector expression is silenced over time, leading to loss of CRISPRi activity. We described some strategies to counteract such silencing in our cell line generation protocol, but further protection against silencing remains as an area for improvement. In any case, the assays we describe may be used to test additional effectors in a streamlined and standardized fashion, with the goal of making CRISPRi universally available across cell models.</p><p>Altogether, our resources and best practices will guide both current implementations and future developments of CRISPRi.

The following additional considerations were incorporated into the final construct designs:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>For KRAB from Kox1, the KRAB(KOX1) domain from dCas9-BFP-KRAB (Addgene #46911) was fused to the C-terminus of dCas9, because C-terminal fusions of KRAB(KOX1) have historically produced the highest activity, linked by an 80-amino acid linker (XTEN80). XTEN80-KRAB(KOX1) was synthesized as a gBlock (IDT). We chose XTEN80 because we previously found that inclusion of a linker increases activity and the original dCas9-BFP-KRAB(KOX1) construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>) underwent proteolytic cleavage between dCas9 and KRAB(KOX1) in some cell types, giving rise to free dCas9, a dominant negative for CRISPRi. The final construct is dCas9-XTEN80-KRAB(KOX1) or dCas9-Kox1 for short.</p></list-item><list-item><p>KRAB(ZIM3) was fused to the N-terminus of dCas9 with a 6-amino acid GS linker, which had produced the highest activity in a previous report, including when compared to C-terminal fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alerasool et al., 2020</xref>). KRAB(ZIM3) was PCR-amplified from pLX303-ZIM3-KRAB-dCas9 (Addgene #154472). The final construct is KRAB(ZIM3)-dCas9 or Zim3-dCas9 for short. Note that this construct contains an additional NLS between Zim3 and dCas9.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For SID4x, SID4x was fused to the N-terminus of dCas9-XTEN80-KRAB(Kox1), because SID4x had previously only been evaluated for CRISPRi in the context of a dual fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>). A shorter 16-aa linker (XTEN16) was included between SID4x and dCas9, which has been a sufficient linker length at the N-terminus in the past. SID4x was amplified from a construct generously donated by the Aifantis lab (New York University). The final construct is SID4x-XTEN16-dCas9-XTEN80-KRAB(KOX1) or SID-dCas9-Kox1 for short.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For MeCP2, the previously reported dCas9-KRAB(Kox1)-MeCP2 construct (Addgene #110821; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeo et al., 2018</xref>) was PCR-amplified and transferred into the common backbone, giving rise to dCas9-Kox1-MeCP2. Note that this construct contains no linker between dCas9 and KRAB(Kox1), such that the KRAB(Kox1) domain may be largely inactive, and that the dCas9 uses different codons. We separately also generated a construct in which we fused MeCP2 to the C-terminus of the dCas9-XTEN80-KRAB(KOX1) construct. We observed similar growth defects and non-specific effects on the transcriptome using this construct.</p></list-item></list><p>Additional constructs with expression driven by an EF1α promoter were generated by performing analogous assemblies in the pMH0006 backbone (Addgene #135448). Constructs with expression driven by CMV or EFS promoters were generated by replacing the SFFV promoter in existing constructs. Constructs in which effector expression is marked with BFP, mCherry, or hygromycin resistance were generated by assembling with PCR products containing the desired markers. Constructs in which expression of the fluorescent protein is linked by an IRES from encephalomyocarditis virus were generated by incorporating a PCR fragment generated from pHR-TRE3G-TUBB-IRES-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jost et al., 2017</xref>) instead of the P2A site. Constructs in which EGFP is flanked by loxP sites were generated by PCR-amplifying EGFP with primers containing loxP 2272 sequences (<named-content content-type="sequence">ATAACTTCGTATAAaGTATcCTATACGAAGTTAT</named-content>). The amplicon was inserted by Gibson Assembly into pJB069 or pJB109 linearized by digestion with NotI and AsiSI. Finally, constructs in which the fluorescent proteins are constitutively linked to dCas9 were generated by omitting the P2A sequence from primer overhangs. A full list of generated constructs is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>. All constructs are available on Addgene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Evaluation of effects of CRISPRi effectors on growth and transcription</title><p>K562 cell lines stably expressing CRISPRi effectors from an SFFV promoter linked to GFP via P2A were generated by lentiviral transduction and FACS. Each effector expression construct was transduced in triplicate in parallel with all other constructs; 100,000 GFP-positive cells per replicate were isolated by FACS on a Sony SH800S Cell Sorter 5 days after transduction and allowed to recover.</p><p>To generate RNA-seq libraries of cells expressing each effector, 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were harvested for each sample 6 days after FACS by centrifugation at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and flash-frozen in a dry ice and ethanol bath. RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) and quantified using the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies). RNA-seq libraries were prepared by the Whitehead Genome Technology Core facility using the Roche Diagnostics KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit. Paired-end 100 sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq (Illumina).</p><p>To evaluate growth of CRISPRi effector-expressing K562 cells, a reference population of K562 cells stably expressing mCherry was generated by lentiviral transduction of pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-mCherry (a gift from Gregory Ow and Eric Collisson, UCSF) and FACS. This was conducted in parallel with the generation of CRISPRi effector-expressing cells. Seven days after sorting, ~125,000 cells per GFP-sorted population (different CRISPRi effectors) were mixed with ~125,000 mCherry-sorted cells (reference population). The ratio of mCherry-positive to mCherry-negative cells was read out immediately after mixing and periodically for the next 19 days by flow cytometry on an Attune NxT (Thermo Fisher).</p><p>Growth of HepG2, HuTu-80, and HT29 cells expressing Zim3-dCas9 was performed analogously, except that Zim3-dCas9 was marked with mCherry and the reference population was marked with BFP, by transduction with pCRISPRi/a-v2 containing a Gal4-4 sgRNA. Transduced cells were sorted on a FACSMelody cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Seven days after sorting, ~150,000 cells per mCherry-sorted population (Zim3-dCas9) were mixed with ~150,000 BFP-sorted cells (reference population) and seeded over three independent wells. The ratio of BFP-positive to BFP-negative cells was read out periodically for the next 10–14 days by flow cytometry on a FACSymphony A1 (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>Sequencing reads were aligned strand-specifically to the human genome (GRCh38) and then aggregated by gene using only reads uniquely mapped to the reverse strand using the spliced read aligner STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), version 2.7.9, against an index containing features from Ensembl release 98/GENCODE v32 (downloaded from 10x Genomics reference 2020-A). Replicate sample 2 for cells expressing dCas9-Kox1 had substantially fewer reads than expected and was excluded from analysis. For clustering analysis, transcript counts were normalized to transcripts per million for each sample, filtered for the 2000 most highly expressed genes on average, and clustered using the Ward variance minimization algorithm implemented in scipy version 1.6.2. Differential expression analysis was carried out on gene counts using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Love et al., 2014</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, transcript counts were not filtered.

All sgRNA sequences used for individual evaluation are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>.</p><p>Individual sgRNA expression constructs were cloned as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, two complementary oligonucleotides (IDT), containing the sgRNA targeting region as well as overhangs matching those left by restriction digest of the vector with BstXI and BlpI, were annealed and ligated into pCRISPRia-v2 (pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-BFP with two SbfI sites flanking the sgRNA expression cassette, Addgene #84832; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horlbeck et al., 2016a</xref>) or pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-mCherry (a gift from Gregory Ow and Eric Collisson, UCSF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jost et al., 2020</xref>) digested with BstXI (NEB or Thermo Fisher Scientific) and BlpI (NEB) or Bpu1102I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The ligation product was transformed into Stellar chemically competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells (Takara Bio) and plasmid was prepared following standard protocols. The resulting sgRNA expression vectors were individually packaged into lentivirus as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Evaluation of individual sgRNA phenotypes</title><p>Effects of sgRNAs targeting essential genes on cell growth were measured in internally controlled growth assays by transducing cells with mCherry-marked sgRNA expression constructs at multiplicity of infection &lt;0.5 (15–40% infected cells) and measuring the fraction of sgRNA-expressing cells 3–12 days after transduction as mCherry-positive cells by flow cytometry on an Attune NxT (Thermo Fisher). All experiments were performed in duplicates from the infection step.</p><p>Effects of sgRNAs on expression levels of cell surface proteins were measured by flow cytometry. K562 or Jurkat cell lines expressing CRISPRi effectors of interest were infected with lentivirus containing sgRNA expression vectors by centrifugation at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 1 hr in 24-well plates in the presence of 8 µg/mL polybrene. RPE1, HepG2, HuTu-80, and HT29 cell lines expressing Zim3-dCas9 were infected with lentivirus containing sgRNA expression vectors for 24 hr in the presence of 8 µg/mL polybrene. Six to 14 days after transduction, cells were harvested by centrifugation (suspension cells) or trypsin-free detachment (adherent cells; mechanical detachment or EDTA), washed once in flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 5% (v/v) FBS), and stained at room temperature for 15–30 min with APC-conjugated antibodies targeting CD55 (clone JS11, BioLegend 311311, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2075857">AB_2075857</ext-link>), CD81 (clone 5A6, BioLegend 349509, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2564020">AB_2564020</ext-link>), CD151 (clone 50-6, BioLegend 350405, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10661726">AB_10661726</ext-link>), CD29 (clone TS2/16, BioLegend 303007, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_314323">AB_314323</ext-link>), or B2M (clone 2M2, BioLegend 316312, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:AB_10641281">AB_10641281</ext-link>) diluted 1:100 in flow cytometry buffer. After staining, cells were washed twice in 200 µL flow cytometry buffer and resuspended in flow cytometry buffer for measurement on an Attune NxT (Thermo Fisher), LSR-II (BD Biosciences), or FACSymphony A3 (BD Biosciences).</p><p>Optimal dilutions for each antibody were determined by testing 1:20, 1:100, and 1:500 antibody titrations on K562 cells with epitope-targeting or non-targeting sgRNAs and choosing the titration with the maximum signal difference.</p><p>Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowCytometryTools 0.5.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eyurtsev.github.io/FlowCytometryTools/">https://eyurtsev.github.io/FlowCytometryTools/</ext-link>) and python 3.8. Briefly, the data were gated for cells (FSC-A versus SSC-A), FSC singlets (FSC-W versus FSC-H for data recorded on an Attune NxT and FSC-W versus FSC-A for data recorded on an LSR-II), SSC singlets (SSC-W versus SSC-H for data recorded on an Attune NxT and SSC-W versus SSC-A for data recorded on an LSR-II), and sgRNA-expressing cells (BFP- or mCherry-positive, depending on the experiment). Background APC fluorescence intensity from unstained cells or cells stained with an APC-conjugated Mouse IgG1, κ isotype control (BioLegend clone MOPC-21) was subtracted to correct for background fluorescence. Knockdown was quantified using median background-corrected APC fluorescence intensity in cells expressing a targeting sgRNA relative to intensity in cells expressing a non-targeting control sgRNA, with the exception of the Jurkat and RPE1 experiments, for which knockdown was quantified using median background-corrected APC fluorescence intensity in cells expressing a targeting sgRNA relative to intensity in cells not expressing an sgRNA in the same well.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>consults for Maze Therapeutics and Waypoint Bio</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>consults for Maze Therapeutics.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mauro Calabrese (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The consensus is that it is a strong manuscript and a very useful resource for the community. The necessary revisions are mainly clarifications and should involve only minimal new experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is written clearly and places appropriate emphasis on the strengths and weaknesses of the new approach. In Figure 1, the authors aggregate a large body of data from 126 previously performed CRISPRi screens as well as previously vetted computational predictions to create dual sgRNA libraries that can be used for succinct CRISPRi screens in human cells. They validate the functionality of their dual sgRNA library using Perturb-seq. They also note that one particular weakness of the dual sgRNA system is sgRNA recombination between lentiviruses, resulting in chimeric delivery of sgRNAs to cells. Quantitative analyses estimate that in K562 cells, recombination frequency in their new system is ~30%. In Figure 2, the authors use RNA-seq to demonstrate that in K562 cells, certain dCas9-repressors have greater off target effects than others; this was particularly striking for the SID-dCas9-Kox1 construct, which previously had been used for a handful of CRISPRi screens. In Figure 3 the authors compare the ability of different dCas9-repressors to reduce expression of several target genes, and from these experiments, identify Zim3-dCas9 as the most effective in K562 cells. In Figure 4 the authors show that Zim3-dCas9 is effective in additional human cell lines that have been used for CRISPRi screens. By my evaluation, all conclusions are well supported and justified by the data. CRISPR screens are labor and cost intensive endeavors. With this work, Replogle et al. present a validated set of novel reagents that will enable more effective and efficient CRISPR screens. The manuscript also highlights certain limitations and caveats of different forms of CRISPR screens whose clear explanation here will also benefit the community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) I appreciated the author's quantitation of recombination frequency in dual sgRNA libraries, and agree that essentially all users of the dual sgRNA approach will similarly want to discard reads that contain recombined sgRNAs. The main utility of this manuscript is the protocol it outlines and the reagents developed. In that spirit, I would request that authors provide readers with a link to a well-commented python script that enables users to repeat the author's exact protocol for detecting and discarding recombined reads.</p><p>2) Also related to protocol development and deployment: can the authors provide ranked sets of dual sgRNA libraries targeting the mouse transcriptome as well? If necessary, they could work exclusively from the predictions made in Horlbeck 2016a, but if any reasonable CRISPRi screens in mouse could serve as a validated reference, users would greatly benefit from their analysis here. CRISPR users in the mouse community would benefit, particularly for in vivo screens.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</italic></p><p>The authors performed a series of impressive experiments to systematically establish each part of their CRISPRi method. They provided one of the most compact design of CRISPRi dual-guideRNA library, with a genome-wide coverage; they confirmed prior finding on the optimal repressor domain to generate a set of useful vectors for expressing the repressor; they showcased the usage of the system in multiple common cancer cell lines. The authors also took an important step towards providing a detailed and well-annotated protocol (in the supplementary materials) to help users of their methods. The items listed below would be helpful to further improve this work</p><p>First, while the dual guideRNA design is a useful development, the author also noted the significant rate (~30%) recombination between the two sgRNAs. This should be further discussed and evaluated in the manuscript to help readers understand the implication of this high recombination rate. For example, across replicate experiments or across cell types tested, would the recombination be stochastic, or there may be some bias of which guide would be recombined? Are there any cell-type dependencies here in terms of the recombination rate? This would also help future users to decide if they would need to check for this effect during functional screening.</p><p>Second, on the repressor development and evaluation. As the author mentioned in the text, the expression level of the repressor can confound their conclusion on fitness/efficiency comparisons of CRISPR repressor. Thus, it would be helpful to perform protein level validation using the cell lines they generated, such as a WesternBlot comparison to rule out this potential issue.</p><p>This work would also benefit from including cell proliferation/viability measurement using the selected Zim3-dCas9 repressor in multiple cell lines, as it seems this was only done initially in K562 cells. As authors noted, the fitness effects of the CRISPR repressor would be a major concern when performing functional genomics screening, so such validation of fitness-neutrality of the repressor can be very helpful for potential users of their method and approach.</p><p>Third, a major resource from this work, as the authors noted, is a suite of useful Zim3-dCas9 cell lines. The authors have performed a set of experiments to demonstrate the knockdown efficiency with dozens of guideRNAs. While this is a good initial validation, to really ensure the cell lines are performing as expected, a small scale screening in pooled fashion will be more convincing. This would be a setting more relevant for potential readers, given that pooled screening would likely be the most powerful application of these cell lines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It's very helpful to have multiple constructs generated based on the Zim3-dCas9 design the author selected. It would be helpful to make a list of these constructs available in supplementary materials, and also note their design consideration or reasons to choose a particular construct, this could help readers to understand the author's perspective on how to choose the best construct for experiments.</p><p>There are some minor confusing issues, such as in Figure 3D, some of the plots don't seem to match the number/percentage given, such as the strong targeting guideRNA group where plots seem to show less repression compared with the numbers labeled, or does the number represent something different? In general, the figure labels can be improved, in particular for Figure 2A (UCOE etc. should be described in legend), Figure 3C/E, it may be better to consistently use percentage, or fraction. Figure 4C is now placed between panel A and B, it could be moved to the end.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81856.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Maximizing CRISPRi efficacy and accessibility with dual-sgRNA libraries and optimal effectors&quot; for consideration by eLife.

As we do not have data from mouse CRISPRi/a screens to perform empirical sgRNA selection, we used the predictions from the CRISPRi/a-v2 algorithm (Horlbeck et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2016, https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.19760 , Supplementary file 4). We excluded sgRNAs containing BsmBI cut sites to maintain compatibility with our cloning strategy. The resulting mouse dual-sgRNA CRISPRi library is now included as Supplementary file 10 and the mouse dual-sgRNA CRISPRa library as Supplementary file 11. We also included a reference to these libraries in the Discussion section as well as a paragraph in the methods section describing the design of these libraries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</p><p>The authors performed a series of impressive experiments to systematically establish each part of their CRISPRi method.

This would also help future users to decide if they would need to check for this effect during functional screening.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that recombination is an important limitation of dual-sgRNA screens. We included additional analyses and data in the revised manuscript to help readers understand the implications of the observed recombination.</p><p>First, we performed growth screens using dual-sgRNA libraries in two additional cell lines (RPE1 and Jurkat) to address the potential cell type specificity of lentiviral recombination. We cloned a dual-sgRNA library targeting DepMap Common Essential genes (n=2291 dual-sgRNA elements). We transduced cells with this library, harvested cells at day 7 post-transduction, amplified sgRNA cassettes from extracted genomic DNA, and sequenced to quantify sgRNA recombination rates. We found similar recombination rates of dual-sgRNA constructs isolated from these three cell types (observed K562 recombination rate 29%; observed RPE1 recombination rate 26%; observed Jurkat recombination rate 24%).</p><p>Next, we compared the recombination rates of each dual-sgRNA element. Our expectation was that lentiviral recombination would be largely stochastic per element based on the known mechanism of lentiviral recombination previously discussed in Adamson et al. 2018 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/298349v1.full">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/298349v1.full</ext-link>) given that the constant region between sgRNAs (400bp) far exceeds the length of sgRNA targeting regions (20bp). However, we would also expect apparent recombination rates to be artificially inflated for dual-sgRNAs with strong growth phenotypes, as the stronger growth phenotypes of unrecombined dual-sgRNAs compared to recombined dual-sgRNAs will lead to dropout of unrecombined dual-sgRNAs. To account for this bias, we began by comparing the recombination rate for non-targeting control dual-sgRNAs excluding those with growth phenotypes across replicates of our K562 screens. There was only a weak correlation between the recombination rate for non-targeting control dual-sgRNAs (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30; Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1E). We next compared the recombination rates of all dual-sgRNA elements (both targeting and non-targeting) across replicates of our K562 screens. As expected, we observed that the recombination rate of elements was correlated across replicates (<italic>r</italic> = 0.77; Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1F), and the recombination rate was strongly anticorrelated with the growth phenotype of dual-sgRNAs in K562 cells (<italic>r</italic> = -0.84; Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1G). We have integrated these data into the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, on the repressor development and evaluation. As the author mentioned in the text, the expression level of the repressor can confound their conclusion on fitness/efficiency comparisons of CRISPR repressor. Thus, it would be helpful to perform protein level validation using the cell lines they generated, such as a WesternBlot comparison to rule out this potential issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that differences in expression levels of the effectors can confound comparisons and that Western Blotting for such differences would be valuable. That said, any such analyses would not substantively alter the main claim of our paper, which is that Zim3-dCas9 provides excellent on-target knockdown in the absence of non-specific effects on cell growth or gene expression. This finding is of immediate practical use to the community. By no means are we claiming that we eliminated all possible confounding factors nor do we think that it is possible to do so. To avoid overstating our findings, we had acknowledged in the discussion that expression levels may indeed be a confounding factor, we had noted in the methods section that the dCas9-MeCP2 effector uses a different coding sequence for dCas9, which may contribute to differences in expression, and we had noted that other effectors may prove useful in some settings. We have further emphasized that differences in expression levels may contribute to our results in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work would also benefit from including cell proliferation/viability measurement using the selected Zim3-dCas9 repressor in multiple cell lines, as it seems this was only done initially in K562 cells. As authors noted, the fitness effects of the CRISPR repressor would be a major concern when performing functional genomics screening, so such validation of fitness-neutrality of the repressor can be very helpful for potential users of their method and approach.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we assessed the proliferation of HepG2, HuTu-80, and HT29 cells expressing Zim3-dCas9. Expression of Zim3-dCas9 did not have a negative impact on proliferation in any of these cell types, providing further evidence that the Zim3-dCas9 will be broadly useful. We included these data in Figure 4 – Figure Supplement 2 in the revised manuscript. That said, we cannot rule out that expression of Zim3-dCas9 may be detrimental in other cell types. Indeed, we want to emphasize that users should evaluate both on-target knockdown and lack of non-specific effects of effectors in new cell models before proceeding to large-scale experiments. The assays and protocols we describe are ideally suited for this purpose. We have further emphasized this point in the discussion section to guide users.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, a major resource from this work, as the authors noted, is a suite of useful Zim3-dCas9 cell lines.

This would be a setting more relevant for potential readers, given that pooled screening would likely be the most powerful application of these cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>While conducting the work described in this manuscript, we had used the Zim3-dCas9 RPE1 cell line for a large-scale pooled screen with single-cell RNA-seq readout (Perturb-seq, Replogle et al. 2022). Across greater than 2000 target genes, the median knockdown was 91.6%, which provides strong validation that Zim3-dCas9 performs as expected in this cell line. We had noted this point in the discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It's very helpful to have multiple constructs generated based on the Zim3-dCas9 design the author selected.

We had also included considerations for selecting constructs in our cell line generation protocol. To make it easier for readers to find these protocols, we have made them publicly available at a separate location (https://www.jostlab.org/resources/ and https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/resources/) and we have included more explicit references to the protocols in the result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some minor confusing issues, such as in Figure 3D, some of the plots don't seem to match the number/percentage given, such as the strong targeting guideRNA group where plots seem to show less repression compared with the numbers labeled, or does the number represent something different?

For Figure 3D, the numbers do match the plots, because we quantified knockdown at the protein level using the median antibody staining signal. Although using median signal overestimates knockdown when knockdown is bimodal, as is the case for some of our samples, we believe that median values are the appropriate metric for flow cytometric quantification of protein levels. We now more clearly emphasize the quantification metric in the figure legend.</p><p>In addition, we updated the legend for Figure 2A to include a description of the abbreviations, we updated Figure 3 to consistently depict percentages, and we re-arranged Figure 4.</p></body></sub-article></article>
