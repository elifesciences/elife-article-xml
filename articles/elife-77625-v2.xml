Using <italic>DATES</italic> on~1100 ancient genomes from sixteen regions in Europe and west Asia, we reconstruct the chronology of the formation of the ancestral populations and the fine-scale details of the spread of Neolithic farming and Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry across Europe. By studying the genetic formation of Anatolian farmers, we infer that gene flow related to Iranian Neolithic farmers occurred before 9600 BCE, predating the advent of agriculture in Anatolia. Contrary to the archaeological evidence, we estimate that early Steppe pastoralist groups (Yamnaya and Afanasievo) were genetically formed more than a millennium before the start of Steppe pastoralism. Our analyses provide new insights on the origins and spread of farming and Indo-European languages, highlighting the power of genomic dating methods to elucidate the legacy of human migrations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genomic clocks</kwd><kwd>ancient DNA</kwd><kwd>admixture</kwd><kwd>molecular clock</kwd><kwd>European Holocene</kwd><kwd>Neolithic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moorjani</surname><given-names>Priya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at the Scientific Interface</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moorjani</surname><given-names>Priya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Understanding the timing and signatures of admixture offers insights into the historical context in which the mixture occurred and enables the characterization of the evolutionary and functional impact of the gene flow. Many admixed groups are formed due to population movements involving ancient migrations that predate historical records. The recent availability of genomic data for a large number of present-day and ancient genomes provides an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct population events using genetic data, providing evidence complementary to linguistics and archaeology.</p><p>To characterize patterns of admixture, genetic methods use the insight that the genome of an admixed individual is a mosaic of chromosomal segments inherited from distinct ancestral populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty and Weiss, 1988</xref>). Due to recombination, these ancestral segments get shuffled in each generation and become smaller and smaller over time. The length of the segments is inversely proportional to the time elapsed since the mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty and Weiss, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moorjani et al., 2011</xref>). Several genetic approaches – ROLLOFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moorjani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>), ALDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 2013</xref>), Globetrotter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>), and Tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gravel, 2012</xref>) – have been developed that use this insight by characterizing patterns of admixture linkage disequilibrium (LD) or haplotype lengths across the genome to infer the timing of mixture. Haplotype-based methods perform chromosome painting or local ancestry inference at each locus in the genome and characterize the distribution of ancestry tract lengths to estimate the time of mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gravel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>). This requires accurate phasing and inference of local ancestry, which is often difficult when the admixture events are old (as ancestry blocks become smaller over time) or when reference data from ancestral populations is unavailable. Admixture LD-based methods, on the other hand, measure the extent of the allelic correlation across markers to infer the time of admixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moorjani et al., 2011</xref>). They do not require phased data from the target or reference populations and work reliably for dating older admixture events (&gt;100 generations). However, they tend to be less efficient in characterizing admixture events between closely related ancestral groups.</p><p>While highly accurate for dating admixture events using data from present-day samples, current methods do not work reliably for dating admixture events using ancient genomes. Ancient DNA samples often have high rates of DNA degradation, contamination (from human and other sources), and low sequencing depth, leading to a large proportion of missing variants and uneven coverage across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orlando et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, most studies generate pseudo-haploid genotype calls – consisting of a haploid genotype determined by randomly selecting one allele at the variant site – that can lead to some issues in the inference. In such sparse datasets, estimating admixture LD can be noisy and biased (see Simulations below). Moreover, haplotype-based methods require phased data from both admixed and reference populations which remains challenging for ancient DNA specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gravel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An extension of admixture LD-based methods, recently introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>, leverages ancestry covariance patterns that can be measured in a single sample using low coverage data. This approach measures the allelic correlation across neighboring sites, but instead of measuring admixture LD across multiple samples, it integrates data across markers within a single diploid genome. Using a set of ascertained markers that are informative for Neanderthal ancestry (where sub-Saharan Africans are fixed for the ancestral alleles and Neanderthals have a derived allele), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>, inferred the timing of Neanderthal gene flow in Upper Paleolithic Eurasian samples and showed the approach works accurately in ancient DNA samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>). However, this approach is inapplicable for dating admixture events within modern human populations, as there are very few fixed differences across populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auton et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Motivated by the single sample statistic in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>, we developed <italic>DATES (Distribution of Ancestry Tracts of Evolutionary Signals</italic>) that measures the ancestry covariance across the genome in a single admixed individual, weighted by the allele frequency difference between two ancestral populations. This method was first introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>, where it was used to infer the date of gene flow between groups related to Ancient Ancestral South Indians, Iranian farmers, and Steppe pastoralists in ancient South and Central Asian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we evaluate the performance of <italic>DATES</italic> by carrying out extensive simulations for a range of demographic scenarios and comparing the approach to other published genomic dating methods. We then apply <italic>DATES</italic> to infer the chronology of the genetic formation of the ancestral populations of Europeans and the spatiotemporal patterns of admixture during the European Holocene using data from ~1100 ancient DNA specimens spanning ~8000–350 BCE.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of <italic>DATES</italic>: model and simulations</title><p><italic>DATES</italic> estimates the time of admixture by measuring the weighted ancestry covariance across the genome using data from a single diploid genome and two reference populations (representing the ancestral source populations). <italic>DATES</italic> works like haplotype-based methods as it is applicable to a single genome and not like admixture LD-based methods, which by definition require multiple genomes to be co-analyzed; but unlike haplotype-based methods, it is more flexible as it does not require local ancestry inference. There are three main steps in <italic>DATES</italic>: we start by first learning the genome-wide ancestry proportions by performing a simple regression analysis to model the observed genotypes in an admixed individual as a linear mix of allele frequencies from two reference populations. For each marker, we then compute the likelihood of the observed genotype in the admixed individual using the estimated ancestry proportions and allele frequencies in each reference population (this is similar in spirit to local ancestry inference). This information is, in turn, used to compute the joint likelihood of shared ancestry at two neighboring markers, accounting for the probability of recombination between the two markers. Finally, we compute the covariance across pairs of markers located at a particular genetic distance, weighted by the allele frequency differences in the reference populations (Materials and methods).</p><p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>, we bin the markers that occur at a similar genetic distance across the genome, rather than estimating admixture LD for each pair of markers, and compute the covariance across increasing genetic distance between markers. The estimated covariance is expected to decay exponentially with genetic distance, and the rate of decay is informative of the time of the mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty and Weiss, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moorjani et al., 2011</xref>). Assuming the gene flow occurred instantaneously, we can then infer the average date of gene flow by fitting an exponential distribution to the decay pattern (Materials and methods). In cases where data for multiple individuals is available, we compute the likelihood by summing over all individuals. To make <italic>DATES</italic> computationally tractable, we implement the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for calculating ancestry covariance as described in ALDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 2013</xref>). This provides a speedup from <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>Ο</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>Ο</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi> </mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> that reduces the typical runtimes from hours to seconds with minimal loss in accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To assess the reliability of <italic>DATES</italic>, we performed simulations where we constructed 10 admixed diploid genomes by randomly sampling haplotypes from two source populations (Materials and methods). Briefly, we simulated individual genomes with 20% European and 80% African ancestry by using phased haplotypes of northern Europeans (Utah European Americans, CEU) and west Africans (Yoruba from Nigeria, YRI) from the 1000 Genomes Project, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auton et al., 2015</xref>). As reference populations in <italic>DATES</italic>, we used closely related surrogate populations of French and Yoruba respectively, from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>). We first investigated the accuracy of <italic>DATES</italic> by varying the time of admixture between 10 and 300 generations. For comparison, we also applied ALDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 2013</xref>) to these simulations. Both methods reliably recovered the time of admixture up to 200 generations or ~5600 years ago, assuming a generation time of 28 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>), though <italic>DATES</italic> was more precise than ALDER for older admixture events (&gt;100 generations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>). Further, <italic>DATES</italic> shows accurate results even for single target samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and even when few reference individuals are available for dating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, the use of large numbers of reference samples, if available, can improve the inference. In <italic>DATES</italic>, allele frequencies of the reference populations are used for computing the likelihood as well as the weighted pairwise ancestry covariance across the genome (Materials and methods). With large samples, allele frequencies of the reference populations are more reliably computed, which in turn, can improve the precision of inferred dates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simulation results.</title><p>We constructed <italic>n</italic> admixed individuals with 20% European (CEU) and 80% African (YRI) ancestry using ~380,000 genome-wide SNPs for admixture dates ranging between 10 and 200 generations.

By varying of European ancestry proportion between ~1% and 50% (the rest derived from west Africans), we observed <italic>DATES</italic> accurately estimated the timing in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, the inferred admixture proportion was overestimated for lower admixture proportions (&lt;10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, we caution against using <italic>DATES</italic> for estimating ancestry proportions. <italic>DATES</italic> works reliably for dating admixtures between related groups such as Europeans and Mexicans (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>~ 0.03), though it was unable to distinguish mixtures of Southern and Northern Europeans (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>&lt; 0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>We found <italic>DATES</italic> is robust to the use of highly divergent surrogates as reference populations. For example, the use of Khomani San as the reference population instead of the true ancestral population of Yoruba (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> ~ 0.1) provides unbiased dates of admixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In this regard, for ancient DNA where sometimes only sparse data is available, one can also use present-day samples as reference populations to increase the quality and sample size of the ancestral groups. In principle, as long as the allele frequencies in the reference samples are correlated to the ancestral allele frequencies, the inference of admixture dates should remain unbiased (Materials and methods). In practice, however, recent demographic events (e.g., strong founder events or admixture from additional sources, etc.) in the history of the present-day samples could lead to significant deviation from the ancestral allele frequencies. Thus, the reference populations should be carefully chosen.</p><p>Another idea is to use the admixed populations themselves as one of the reference populations as demonstrated by the single reference setup in ALDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 2013</xref>). Admixed individuals have intermediate allele frequencies to the ancestral populations and thus weighted LD or ancestry covariance can be computed with only one reference population (albeit, with reduced power). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 2013</xref>, showed that the use of admixed populations as one of the references does not bias the rate of decay of the weighted LD (i.e., time of admixture), though the amplitude of the decay curve (not used in <italic>DATES</italic>) can be biased under some scenarios. To verify <italic>DATES</italic> provides reliable results under this setup, we applied <italic>DATES</italic> with a single reference population and used the admixed population as the other reference. Like ALDER, our inferred dates of admixture were accurate and comparable to using two reference populations. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>An important feature of <italic>DATES</italic> is that it does not require phased data and is applicable to datasets with small sample sizes, making it in principle useful for ancient DNA applications. To test the reliability of <italic>DATES</italic> for ancient genomes, we simulated data mimicking the relevant features of ancient genomes, namely small sample sizes (<italic>n</italic>=1–20), large proportions of missing genotypes (between 10% and 60%), and pseudo-haploid genotype calls (instead of diploid genotype calls) in reference and/or target samples. <italic>DATES</italic> showed reliable results under various setups, even when only a single admixed individual was available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">9</xref>). In contrast, admixture LD-based methods require more than one sample and do not work reliably with missing data. For example, ALDER estimates were very unstable for simulations with &gt;40% missing data. For older dates (&gt;100 generations), there was a slight bias even with &gt;10% missing genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). This is expected as LD calculations leverage shared patterns across samples, thus variable missingness of genotypes across individuals leads to substantial loss of data leading to unstable and noisy inference. We also generated data for combinations of features including small sample sizes, pseudo-haploid genotypes with large proportions of missing genotypes in both target and reference samples, and use of highly divergent reference samples. We found <italic>DATES</italic> yielded reliable results with large amounts (~40–60%) of missing data, either in the target or references, even with highly divergent reference populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). This was also true when a single target sample was available, though as expected, the inference becomes noisier for older dates and large fractions of missing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). The robust performance of <italic>DATES</italic> in sparse datasets highlights a major advantage for ancient DNA applications.</p><p><italic>DATES</italic> assumes a model of instantaneous gene flow with a single pulse of mixture between two source populations. However, many human populations have a history of multiple pulses of gene flow. To test the performance of <italic>DATES</italic> for multi-way admixture events, we generated admixed individuals with ancestry from three sources (East Asians, Africans, and Europeans) where the gene flow occurred at two distinct time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). By applying <italic>DATES</italic> with pairs of reference populations, we observed that <italic>DATES</italic> recovered both admixture times for target populations that had equal contributions from all three ancestral groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). In the case of unequal admixture proportions from three ancestral groups, <italic>DATES</italic> inferred the timing of the recent admixture event in most cases. In some cases, however, the inferred dates were intermediate to the two pulses when the ancestry proportion of the recent event was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2—figure 3</xref>). This confounding could be eliminated if the reference populations were set up to match the model of gene flow. For example, the inferred times of admixture were accurate if the two references used in <italic>DATES</italic> were: reference 1: the source population for the recent event and reference 2: pooled individuals from both ancestral populations that contributed to the first admixture event, or the intermediate admixed group formed after the first event (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). This highlights how the choice of reference populations can help to tune the method to infer the timing of specific admixture events more reliably.</p><p>Finally, we explored the impact of more complex demographic events, including continuous admixture and founder events using coalescent simulations (Appendix 2). In the case of continuous admixture, <italic>DATES</italic> inferred an intermediate timing between the start and the end of the gene flow period, similar to other methods like ALDER and Globetrotter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>). In the case of populations with founder events, we inferred unbiased dates of admixture in most cases except when the founder event was extreme (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> ~ 10) or the population had maintained a low population size (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> &lt; 100) until the present (i.e., no recovery bottleneck) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig4">Appendix 2—figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table3">Appendix 2—table 3</xref>). In humans, few populations have such extreme founder events, and thus, in most other cases, our inferred admixture dates should be robust to founder events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tournebize et al., 2020</xref>). We note that while <italic>DATES</italic> is not a formal test of admixture, in simulations, we find that in the absence of gene flow, the method does not infer significant dates of admixture even if the target has a complex demographic history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig6">Appendix 2—figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig7">Appendix 2—figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparison to other methods</title><p>We assessed the reliability of <italic>DATES</italic> in real data by comparing our results with published methods: Globetrotter, ALDER, and ROLLOFF. These methods are designed for the analysis of present-day samples that typically have high-quality data with limited missing variants. In addition, Globetrotter uses phased data which is challenging for ancient DNA samples. Thus, instead of rerunning other methods, we took advantage of the published results for contemporary samples presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>, we created a merged dataset including individuals from HGDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behar et al., 2010</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henn et al., 2012</xref>) (Materials and methods). We applied <italic>DATES</italic> and ALDER to 29 target groups using the reference populations reported in Table S12 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>, excluding one group where the population label was unclear. Interestingly, the majority of these groups (25/29) failed ALDER’s formal test of admixture; either because the results of the single reference and two reference analyses yielded inconsistent estimates or because the target had long-range shared LD with one of the reference populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>). Using <italic>DATES</italic>, we inferred significant dates of admixture in 20 groups, and 14 of those were consistent with estimates based on Globetrotter. In the case of the six populations that disagreed across the two methods, most of the populations appear to have a history of multiple pulses of gene flow either involving more than two populations (e.g., Brahui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pagani et al., 2017</xref>) or multiple instances of contact between the same two reference groups (e.g., Mandenka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Price et al., 2009</xref>) or the model of admixture differed (e.g., recent ancient DNA studies suggest present-day Bulgarians have ancestry from western hunter-gatherers [HGs], Near Eastern farmers, and Steppe pastoralists from Eurasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>] but were modeled as a mixture of Polish and Cypriots in Globetrotter). In case of complex admixture scenarios, the inconsistencies across the two methods are hard to interpret as Globetrotter and <italic>DATES</italic> could be capturing different events or the weighting of both events could differ. Finally, the estimated admixture timing based on <italic>DATES</italic>, ROLLOFF, and ALDER (assuming two-way admixture regardless of the formal test results) were found to be highly concordant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Fine-scale patterns of population mixtures in ancient Europe</title><p>Recent ancient DNA studies have shown that present-day Europeans derive ancestry from three distinct sources: (a) HG-related ancestry that is closely related to Mesolithic HGs from Europe; (b) Anatolian farmer-related ancestry related to Neolithic farmers from the Near East and associated to the spread of farming to Europe; and (c) Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry that is related to the Yamnaya pastoralists from Russia and Ukraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allentoft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skoglund et al., 2012</xref>). Many open questions remain about the timing and dynamics of these population interactions, in particular related to the formation of the ancestral groups (which were themselves admixed) and their expansion across Europe. To characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of mixtures in Europe in the past 10,000 years, we used 1096 ancient European samples from 152 groups from the publicly available Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR) spanning a time range of ~8000–350 BCE (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

There was large diversity among HGs with four main groups – western hunter-gatherers (WHGs) that were related to the Villabruna cluster in central Europe, eastern hunter-gatherers (EHGs) from Russia and Ukraine related to the Upper Paleolithic group of Ancestral North Eurasians (ANEs), Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHGs) from Georgia associated to the first farmers from Iran, and the GoyetQ2-cluster associated to the Magdalenian culture in Spain and Portugal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skoglund et al., 2012</xref>). Most Mesolithic HGs fall on two main clines of relatedness: one cline that extends from Scandinavia to central Europe showing variable WHG-EHG ancestry, and the other in southern Europe with WHG-GoyetQ2 ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>). The latter is already present in the 17,000 BCE <italic>El Mirón</italic> individual from Spain, suggesting that the GoyetQ2-related gene flow occurred well before the Holocene. However, the WHG-EHG cline was formed more recently during the Mesolithic period, though the precise timing remains less well understood.</p><p>To characterize the formation of the WHG-EHG cline, we used genomic data from 16 ancient HG groups (<italic>n</italic>=101) with estimated ages of ~7500–3600 BCE.

For each target population, we chose the most parsimonious model, that is, fitting the data with the minimum number of source populations.

To confirm that the target populations do not harbor Anatolian farmer-related ancestry (that could lead to some confounding in estimated admixture dates), we applied <italic>D</italic>-statistics of the form <italic>D</italic>(Mbuti, <italic>target</italic>, WHG, Anatolian farmers) where target = Mesolithic HGs. We observed that none of the target groups had a stronger affinity to Anatolian farmers than WHG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>).

Accounting for the average sampling age of the specimens and the mean human generation time of 28 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorjani et al., 2016</xref>), we inferred the admixture time in years before present or in BCE (Materials and methods).

Among HGs, we inferred that the earliest admixture occurred in Scandinavian HGs from Norway and Sweden with a range of average dates of ~80–113 generations before the samples lived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This translates to admixture dates of ~10,200–8000 BCE, with the most recent dates inferred in Motala HGs from Sweden suggesting substantial substructure in HGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the Baltic region, we inferred the range of admixture dates of ~8700–6000 BCE in Latvia and Lithuania HGs, postdating the mixture in Scandinavia. In southeast Europe, the Iron Gates region of the Danube Basin shows widespread evidence of mixtures between HG groups and, in the case of some outliers, the mixture of HGs and Anatolian farmer-related ancestry as early as the Mesolithic period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>). Further, these groups showed a strong affinity to the WHG-related ancestry in Anatolian populations, suggesting ancient interactions with Near Eastern populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>).

The early Neolithic Anatolian farmers (Aceramic Anatolian farmers) had majority ancestry from AHG with some gene flow from the first farmers from Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>). AHG, in turn, had ancestry from Levant HG (Natufians) and some mysterious HG group related to the ancestors of WHG individuals from central Europe – a gene flow event that likely occurred in the late Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>). Using <italic>qpAdm</italic>, we confirmed that early Anatolian farmers could be modeled as a mixture of AHG and Iran Neolithic farmer-related groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C</xref>). To learn about the timing of the genetic formation of early Anatolian farmers, we applied <italic>DATES</italic> using Iran Neolithic farmer-related individuals and other reference as groups with AHG ancestry. Since there are limited samples of AHG ancestry, we instead used pooled individuals of WHG-related and Levant Neolithic farmer-related individuals to represent the main ancestry components of AHG.

Our setup with pooled reference populations should recover the timing of the most recent event (in this case, the gene flow from CHG or Iran Neolithic-related groups) reliably. We infer the Iran Neolithic farmer-related gene flow occurred ~10,900 BCE (12,200–9600 BCE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), predating the origin of farming in Anatolia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bramanti et al., 2009</xref>). During the subsequent millennia, these early farmers further admixed with Levant Neolithic groups to form Anatolian Neolithic farmers who spread towards the west to Europe and in the east to mix with Iran Neolithic farmers, forming the Chalcolithic groups of Seh Gabi and Hajji Firuz (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C</xref>).

To elucidate the fine-scale patterns and regional dynamics of these mixtures, we applied <italic>DATES</italic> to time transect samples from 94 groups (<italic>n</italic>=657) sampled from 16 regions in Europe, ranging from ~6000 to 1900 BCE and encompassing individuals from the early Neolithic to Chalcolithic periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Using <italic>qpAdm</italic>, we first confirmed that the Neolithic Europeans could be modeled as a mixture of European HG-related ancestry and Anatolian farmer-related ancestry and inferred their ancestry proportions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2D</xref>). For most target populations (~80%), we found the model of gene flow between Anatolian farmer-related and WHG-related ancestry provided a good fit to the data (p-value &gt; 0.05). In some populations, we found variation in the source of the HG-related ancestry and including either EHG- or GoyetQ2-related ancestry groups improved the fit of the model. In five groups, none of the models fit, despite excluding outlier individuals whose ancestry profile differed from the majority of the individuals in the group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2E</xref>). To confirm that the target populations do not harbor Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry, we applied <italic>D</italic>-statistics of the form <italic>D</italic>(Mbuti, <italic>target</italic>, Anatolian farmers, Steppe pastoralists) where target = Neolithic European groups. We observed that four groups had a stronger affinity to Steppe pastoralists compared to Anatolian farmers, and hence we excluded these from further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2F</xref>). After filtering, we applied <italic>DATES</italic> to 86 European Neolithic groups using WHG-related individuals and Anatolian farmers as reference populations.</p><p>Earlier analysis has suggested that farming spread along two main routes in Europe, from southeast to central Europe (‘continental route’) and along the Mediterranean coastline to Iberia (‘coastal route') (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gronenborn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guilaine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, we inferred one of the earliest timings of gene flow was in the Balkans around 6400 BCE. Using the most comprehensive time-transect in Hungary with 19 groups (<italic>n</italic>=63) spanning from middle Neolithic to late Chalcolithic, we inferred the admixture dates ranged from ~6100 to 4500 BCE. Under a model of a single shared gene flow event in the common ancestors of all individuals, we would expect to obtain similar dates of admixture (before present) after accounting for the age of the ancient specimens. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>, we observed that the estimated dates in middle Neolithic individuals were substantially older than those inferred in late Neolithic or Chalcolithic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bollongino et al., 2013</xref>). This would be expected if the underlying model of gene flow involved multiple pulses of gene flow, such that the timing in the middle Neolithic samples reflects the initial two-way mixture and the timing in the Chalcolithic samples captures both recent and older events. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>, and other recent studies have documented increasing HG ancestry from ~3% to 15% from the Neolithic to Chalcolithic period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that there was additional HG gene flow after the initial mixture. This highlights that the interactions between local HGs and incoming Anatolian farmers were complex with multiple gene flow events or continuous admixture between these two groups, which explains the increasing HG ancestry and more recent dates in Chalcolithic individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2D</xref>).</p><p>Mirroring the pattern in Hungary, we documented the resurgence of HG ancestry in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and southern Europe. In central Europe, we inferred that the Anatolian farmer-related gene flow ranged between ~5600 and 5000 BCE across Germany and Czech Republic, with some exceptions. For instance, in the Blätterhöhle site from Germany, the inferred dates were more recent (~4000 BCE), consistent with the occupation of both HGs and farmers in this region until the late Neolithic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>). In eastern Europe, using samples related to the Funnel Beaker culture (TRB; from German <italic>Trichterbecher</italic>) from Poland, we dated the Anatolian farmer-related gene flow occurred on average ~4700 BCE (5300–4200 BCE). Following the TRB decline, the Baden culture and the Globular Amphora culture appeared in many areas of Poland and Ukraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandes et al., 2018</xref>). These cultures had close contact with the Corded Ware complex (CWC) and Steppe pastoralists’ societies, though we found a parsimonious model without Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry provides a good fit to the GAC individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2D</xref>). Applying <italic>DATES</italic>, we inferred the Anatolian farmer and HG-related mixture in GAC ranged between ~4700 and 3900 BCE, predating the spread of Steppe pastoralists to eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allentoft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Along the Mediterranean route, we characterized Anatolian farmer-related gene flow in Italy, Iberia, France, and the British Isles. Using samples from five groups in Italy, we inferred the earliest dates of gene flow of ~6100 BCE, and within the millennium, the Anatolian farmer-related ancestry spread from Sardinia to Sicily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In Iberia, the Anatolian farmer-related mixture ranged from ~5700 to 4300 BCE and showed evidence for an increase in HG ancestry from ~9% to 20% after the initial gene flow. In France, previous studies have shown that Anatolian farmer-related ancestry came from both routes, along the continental route in the north and along the costal route in the south (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>). This is reflected in the source of the HG ancestry, which is predominantly EHG and WHG-related in the north and includes WHG and Goyet-Q2 ancestry in the south (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, we also observed that the admixture dates in France were structured along these routes, with the median estimate of ~5100 BCE in the east and much older ~5500 BCE in the south (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). In Scandinavia, we inferred markedly more recent dates of admixture of ~4300 BCE using samples from Sweden associated with the TRB culture and Ansarve Megalithic tombs, consistent with a late introduction of farming to Scandinavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mittnik et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we inferred recent dates of admixture in Neolithic samples from the British Isles (England, Scotland, and Ireland) with the median timing of ~5000 BCE across the three regions. Interestingly, unlike in western and southern Europe, we obtained overlapping dates across eight groups including early to late Neolithic samples from British Isles. This is consistent with previous studies that suggest there was no resurgence in HG ancestry during the Neolithic in Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brace et al., 2019</xref>). Thus our dates can be interpreted as the time of the main mixture of HGs and Anatolian farmers in this region, implying that the farmer-related ancestry reached Britain a millennium after its arrival in continental Europe. By 4300 BCE, we find that Anatolian farmer-related ancestry is present in nearly all regions in Europe.</p><sec id="s2-4-1"><title>Late Neolithic to Bronze Age</title><p>The beginning of the Bronze Age (BA) was a period of major cultural and demographic change in Eurasia, accompanied by the spread of Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry from Pontic-Caspian steppes across Europe and South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>). The archaeological record documents that the early Steppe pastoralists cultures of Yamnaya and Afanasievo, with characteristic burial styles and pottery, appeared ~3300–2600 BCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morgunova and Khokhlova, 2016</xref>). These groups were formed as a mixture of EHG-related individuals and CHG-related groups associated with the first farmers from Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Using <italic>qpAdm</italic>, we first tested how well this model fits the data from eight early Steppe pastoralist groups, including seven groups associated with Yamnaya culture and one group related to the Afanasievo culture (Materials and methods). For all but two Yamnaya groups (from Hungary Baden and Russia Kalmykia), we found this model provides a good fit to the data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2G</xref>). We note that the samples from Kalmykia in our dataset were shotgun sequenced, and in the <italic>qpAdm</italic> analysis, we are mixing shotgun and capture data that could potentially lead to technical issues. To understand the timing of the formation of the early Steppe pastoralist-related groups, we applied <italic>DATES</italic> using pooled EHG-related and pooled Iranian Neolithic farmer-related individuals. Focusing on the groups with the largest sample sizes, Yamnaya Samara (<italic>n</italic>=10) and Afanasievo (<italic>n</italic>=19), we inferred the admixture occurred between 40 and 45 generations before the individuals lived, translating to an admixture timing of ~4100 BCE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). We obtained qualitatively similar dates across four Yamnaya and one Afanasievo groups, consistent with the findings that these groups descend from a recent common ancestor (we note for the Ozera samples from Ukraine, the dates were not significant). This is also further supported by the insight that the genetic differentiation across early Steppe pastoralist groups is very low (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> ~ 0.000–0.006) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2H</xref>). Thus, we combined all early Steppe pastoralist individuals in one group to obtain a more precise estimate for the genetic formation of proto-Yamnaya of ~4400–4000 BCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These dates are noteworthy as they predate the archaeological evidence by more than a millennium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthony, 2007</xref>) and have important implications for understanding the origin of proto-Pontic Caspian cultures and their spread to Europe and South Asia.</p><p>Over the following millennium, the Yamnaya-derived ancestry spread across Europe through CWC and Bell Beaker complex (BBC) cultures. Present-day Europeans derive between ~10% and 60% Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry, which was not seen in Neolithic samples. To obtain a precise chronology of the spread of Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry across Europe, we analyzed 109 late Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and BA samples dated between 3000 and 750 CE from 18 regions, including samples associated with the CWC and BBC cultures. We first confirmed that most target samples had Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry, in addition to European HG-related and Anatolian farmer-related ancestry using <italic>qpAdm</italic>. We excluded 20 groups that could not be parsimoniously modeled as a three-way mixture even after removing individual outliers. After filtering, we retained 79 groups for dating Steppe pastoralist-related gene flow across Europe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2I and J</xref>). As BA Europeans have ancestry from three distinct groups, we applied <italic>DATES</italic> using the following two reference populations, one group including early Steppe pastoralists (Yamnaya and Afanasievo) and the other group that is a the proxy for the ancestral Neolithic Europe population using pooled samples of WHG-related and Anatolian farmer-related individuals.</p><p>To learn about the spread of CWC culture across Europe, we used seven late Neolithic and Bronze age groups, including five associated with CWC artifacts. Using <italic>DATES</italic>, we inferred that the oldest date of Steppe pastoralists gene flow in Europe was ~3200 BCE in Scandinavia in samples associated with Battle Axe Culture in Sweden and Single Grave Culture in Denmark that were both contemporary to CWC. The samples from Scandinavia showed large heterogeneity in ancestry, including some individuals with majority Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry (and negligible amounts of Anatolian farmer-related ancestry), consistent with patterns expected from recent gene flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malmström et al., 2019</xref>). Strikingly, we inferred the timing of admixture in central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic) and eastern Europe (Estonia and Poland) to be remarkably similar. These dates fall within a narrow range of ~3000–2900 BCE across diverse regions, suggesting that the mixed population associated with the Corded Ware culture formed over a short time and spread across Europe rapidly with very little further mixture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><p>Following the Corded Ware culture, from around 2800 to 2300 BCE, Bell Beaker pottery became widespread across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fokkens and Nicolis, 2012</xref>). Using 19 Chalcolithic and BA samples, including 10 associated with Beaker-complex artifacts, we inferred the dynamics of the spread of the Beaker complex across Europe. We inferred the oldest date of Steppe pastoralist-related admixture was ~3200 BCE (3600–2800 BCE) in early Bronze Age (EBA) Mallorca samples from Iberia. We note the EBA Mallorca sample is not directly associated with Beaker culture, but <italic>qpAdm</italic> modeling suggests that this individual is clade with the small subset of Iberian Beaker-complex-associated individuals who carried Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandes et al., 2020</xref>). Most individuals from Iberia, however, had negligible Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry suggesting the Beaker culture was not accompanied by major gene flow in Iberia despite the earliest dates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2I</xref>). In central and western Europe, where Steppe pastoralist gene flow was more pervasive, we inferred the median date of the mixture was ~2700 BCE with the oldest dates in the Netherlands, followed by Germany and France (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). There was, however, large heterogeneity in the dates across Europe and even within the same region. For example, comparing two BA groups from the Netherlands suggests a wide range of dates ~3000 BCE and 2500 BCE, and four groups from Germany indicate a range of ~2900–2700 BCE. From central Europe, the Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry spread quickly to the British Isles, where people with Steppe pastoralist ancestry replaced 90% of the genetic ancestry of individuals from Britain. Our estimates for the time of gene flow in Bell Beakers samples from England suggest that the gene flow occurred ~2700 BCE (2770–2550 BCE). Our estimated dates of admixture are older than the dates of arrival of this ancestry in Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olalde et al., 2018</xref>) and, interestingly, overlap the dates in central Europe. Given that a significant fraction of the Beaker individuals were recent migrants from central Europe, we interpret our dates reflect the admixture into ancestors of the British Beaker people, occurring in mainland Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olalde et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The middle to late Bronze Age (MLBA) led to the final integration of Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry in Europe. In southern Europe, EBA samples had limited Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry, though present-day individuals harbor between ~5% and 30% of this ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>). Using pooled samples of MLBA from Spain, we inferred major mixture occurred ~2500 BCE in Iberia. We inferred a similar timing in Italy using individuals associated with the Bell Beaker culture and EBA samples from Sicily (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). In Sardinia, a majority of the BA samples do not have Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry. In a few individuals, we found evidence for Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry, though in most cases, this ancestry proportion overlapped 0 and the inferred dates of admixture were very noisy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2I</xref>). Using Iron Age samples from Sardinia, we inferred the gene flow occurred ~2600 BCE, though there is a large uncertainty associated with this estimate (3700–1490 BCE). In other parts of continental Europe and the British Isles, the Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry got diluted over time, as evidenced by more recent dates in LBA (late Bronze Age) than EBA or MBA (middle Bronze Age) samples in Germany, England, and Scotland, and an increase in Neolithic farmer ancestry during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olalde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the CWC expanded to the east to form the archaeological complexes of Sintashta, Srubnaya, Andronovo, and the BA cultures of Kazakhstan. Samples associated with these cultures harbor mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist-related groups (CWC, in some cases) and Neolithic individuals from central Europe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2K</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>). Applying <italic>DATES</italic> to eight MLBA Steppe pastoralist groups, we inferred the precise timing for the formation of these groups beginning in the third millennium BCE. These groups were formed chronologically, with the date of genetic formation of ~3200 BCE for Sintashta culture, followed by ~2900 BCE for Srubnaya and Andronovo cultures. In the central Steppe region (present-day Kazakhstan), we obtained median dates of ~2800 BCE for the expansion of Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry in four Kazakh cultures of Maitan Alakul, Aktogai, and Kairan. By ~2700 BCE, most of these cultures had almost 60–70% Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). These groups, in turn, expanded eastwards, transforming the genetic composition of populations in South Asia.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed <italic>DATES</italic> that measures ancestry covariance patterns in a single diploid individual genome to estimate the time of admixture.

We illustrate the application of <italic>DATES</italic> by reconstructing population movements and admixtures during the European Holocene. We confirm and extend signals that were previously identified such as the resurgence of HG ancestry during the Neolithic and provide new details about the genetic formation of the ancestral populations of Europeans and the spread of CWC and BBC cultures across Europe. Together, our analysis provides a detailed timeline and insights into the dynamics of the Neolithization of Europe and the spread of Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry across Europe.</p><p>First, we document that the Mesolithic HGs formed as a mixture of WHG and EHG ancestry ~10,200–7400 BCE. These dates are consistent with the archaeological evidence for the appearance of lithic technology associated with eastern HGs in Scandinavia and the Baltic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Günther et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kashuba et al., 2019</xref>). Next, we studied the timing of the genetic formation of Anatolian farmers. The earliest evidence of agriculture comes from the Fertile Crescent, the southern Levant, and the Zagros Mountains of Iran and dated to around 10,000 BCE. In central Anatolia, farming has been documented c. 8300 BCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellwood, 2005</xref>). It has been long debated if Neolithic farming groups from Iran and the Levant introduced agriculture to Anatolia or HGs in the region locally adopted agricultural practices. The early Anatolian farmers can be modeled as a mixture of local HGs related to Caucasus HGs or the first farmers from Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>). By applying <italic>DATES</italic> (assuming a single instantaneous admixture), we inferred that the Iran Neolithic gene flow occurred around 10,900 BCE (~12,200–9600 BCE). An alternate possibility is that there was a long period of gradual gene flow between the two groups and our dates reflect intermediate dates between the start and end of the gene flow. An upper bound for such a mixture comes from the lack of Iran Neolithic ancestry in AHGs at 13,000 BCE, and a lower bound comes from the C14 dates of early Anatolian farmers, one of which is directly dated at 8269–8210 BCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>). In either case (instantaneous admixture or gradual gene flow), the genetic mixture that formed Anatolian farmers predates the advent of agriculture in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellwood, 2005</xref>). This supports the model that AHGs locally transitioned to agricultural subsistence, and most probably, there was cultural diffusion from other regions in Near East (Iran and Levant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies with more dense temporal sampling will shed light on the demographic processes that led to the transition from foraging to farming in the Near East, and in turn, elucidate the relative roles of demic and cultural diffusion in the dispersal of technologies like agriculture across populations.</p><p>Using data from 16 regions in Europe, we reconstruct a detailed chronology and dynamics of the expansion of Anatolian farmers during the Neolithic period. We infer that starting in ~6400 BCE, gene flow from Anatolian farmers became widespread across Europe, and by ~4300 BCE, it was present in almost all parts of continental Europe and the British Isles. These dates are significantly more recent than the estimates of farming based on archaeological evidence in some parts of Europe, suggesting that the local HGs and farmers coexisted for more than a millennium before the mixture occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>). In many regions, after the initial mixture, there was a resurgence of HG ancestry, highlighting the complexities of these ancient interactions. We note that our results are consistent with two previous genetic studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>, that applied genetic dating methods to a subset of samples we used in our analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipson et al., 2017</xref>, used a modified version of ALDER to infer the timing of admixture in three regions (<italic>n</italic>=151). We obtained statistically consistent results for all overlapping samples (within two standard errors) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table6">Appendix 1—table 6</xref>). An advantage of our approach over the modified ALDER approach is that we do not rely on helper samples (higher coverage individuals combined with the target group) for dating; unless these have a similar ancestry profile, they could bias the inferred dates. Our results are concordant with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivollat et al., 2020</xref>, that used a previous version of <italic>DATES</italic> to infer the timing of Neolithic gene flow in 32 groups (vs. 86 groups in our study). We find the performance of both versions of <italic>DATES</italic> is similar, though some implementation details have improved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).</p><p>The second major migration occurred when populations associated with the Yamnaya culture in the Pontic-Caspian steppes expanded across Europe. Our analysis reveals the precise timing of the genetic formation of the early Steppe pastoralist groups – Yamnaya and Afanasievo – occurred ~4400–4000 BCE. This estimate predates the archaeological evidence by more than a millennium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthony, 2007</xref>) and suggests the presence of an ancient ‘ghost’ population of proto-Yamnaya around this time. Understanding the source and location of this ghost population will provide deep insights into the history of Pontic-Caspian cultures and the origin of Indo-European languages that have been associated to have spread with Steppe pastoralists ancestry to Europe and South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kassian et al., 2021</xref>). Starting in ~3200 BCE, the Yamnaya-derived cultures of CWC and BBC spread westwards, bringing Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry to Europe. Our analysis reveals striking differences in the spread of these two cultures: the CWC formation is similar across diverse regions separated by thousands of kilometers, suggesting a rapid spread after the initial formation of this group, while the spread of BBC culture was more complex and heterogeneous across regions. We find the earliest evidence of Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry in Iberia around 3200 BCE, though this ancestry only becomes widespread after 2500 BCE. In central Europe, the gene flow occurred simultaneously with archaeological evidence and was coexisting with the CWC in some parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Willigen and van, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olalde et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, in the British Isles, the Bell Beaker culture spreads rapidly from central Europe and replaces almost 90% of the ancestry of individuals in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olalde et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recent analysis has shown remarkable parallels in the history of Europe and South Asia; with both groups deriving ancestry from local indigenous HGs, Near Eastern farmers, and Steppe pastoralist-related groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, however, the timing of the two major migrations events differs across the two subcontinents. Both mixtures occurred in Europe almost a millennium before they occurred in South Asia. In Europe, the Neolithic migrations primarily involved Anatolian farmers, while the source of Neolithic ancestry is closer to Iran Neolithic farmers in South Asia. The Steppe pastoralist-related gene flow occurred in the context of the spread of CWC and BBC cultures in Europe around 3200–2500 BCE; in South Asia, this ancestry arrived with Steppe MLB A cultures that were formed much later in 1800–1500 BCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narasimhan et al., 2019</xref>). The Steppe MLBA groups have ancestry from Steppe pastoralist derived groups and European Neolithic farmers following the eastward expansion of CWC groups between ~3200 and 2700 BCE. Understanding the origin and migration paths of the ancestral groups thus helps to illuminate the differences in the timeline of the spread of Steppe pastoralists across the two subcontinents of Eurasia.</p><p>Genomic dating methods like <italic>DATES</italic> provide an independent and complementary approach for reconstructing population history. By focusing on the genetic clock based on recombination rate, we provide an independent estimate of the timing of evolutionary events up to several thousands of years. Our analysis also has advantages over the temporal sampling of ancient DNA, in that we can obtain direct estimates of when a population was formed, rather than inferring putative bounds for the timing based on the absence/presence of a particular ancestry signature (which may be sensitive to sampling choice or density). Genetic approaches provide complementary evidence to archaeology and linguistics as they date the time of admixture and not migration. Both dates are similar in many contemporary populations like African Americans and Latinos, though this may not be generally true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al., 2014</xref>). This is underscored by our dates for the Anatolian farmer-related mixture, which postdates evidence of material culture related to agriculture by almost two millennia in some regions. This suggests that European HGs and farmers resided side by side for several thousand years before mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bollongino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skoglund et al., 2014</xref>).

To correctly account for this effect, we fit an exponential with the rate of (<italic>t</italic>+1) in <italic>DATES</italic> v4010. In practice, this has a minor effect on the dates reported earlier, as in most cases the uncertainty is much larger than one generation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Goodness of fit test: In v4010, we implemented the NRMSD to assess the fit of the exponential curve. NRMSD computes the deviation between the empirical estimate and fitted data in order to provide a statistical way to characterize the noisiness of the fitted curve. Lower values of NRMSD suggest a better fit, however, there is no clear interpretation of the absolute value of NRMSD. Based on the empirical distribution of NRMSD values in our study samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), we infer a conservative threshold of 0.7 to define a ‘good’ fit. We caution that users should adjust this threshold based on their application and always visually inspect their exponential fits to ensure reliable results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Support for arbitrary number of chromosomes: Unlike v753 that was optimized for parameters in humans, the new version supports an arbitrary number of chromosomes (inputted by the user) so <italic>DATES</italic> can be used in any species.</p></list-item></list><p>A comparison of the two version of <italic>DATES</italic> using simulated data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) and empirical data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>) yields qualitatively similar results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Simulations</title><p>We constructed admixed genomes following the approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moorjani et al., 2011</xref>. This method requires phased haplotypes from two source populations and uses two key parameters to simulate data from admixed individuals, (a) the mixture proportion (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) that represents the probability that a particular sampled haplotype comes from one of the reference panels, namely <italic>source</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>source</italic><sub>2</sub>, and (b) the time of mixture (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) which is the number of generations since mixture. To simulate an admixed individual, we begin at the start of the chromosome and sample a haplotype from either <italic>source</italic><sub>1</sub> with a probability (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and <italic>source</italic><sub>2</sub> with a probability (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). At each subsequent marker, we check if there was a recombination event between the two neighboring markers. A recombination event occurs with a probability of (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), where <italic>g</italic> is the genetic distance in Morgans. We use the time of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>  generations to account for the fact that in the first generation following admixture, the offspring inherits one chromosome of each ancestry. In the next generation, the crossovers lead to a mixing of ancestry. Thus, when a recombination event occurs, we resample the ancestry between <italic>source</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>source</italic><sub>2</sub>, otherwise, we copy the haplotype from the same source population. (Note, a recombination event can lead to a switch to a haplotype of the same ancestry.) Once the ancestry is chosen, we randomly pick a haplotype from the ancestral pool (without replacement) and copy its sequence to the genome of the admixed individual. This process is continued until we reach the end of the chromosome. Using this approach, we generate the genomes of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> admixed individuals. The simulated haploid chromosomes are merged at random to construct diploid admixed individuals. This algorithm requires more than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> ancestral haplotypes for generating data for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> diploid admixed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moorjani et al., 2011</xref>). For more than two reference populations, the same algorithm is repeated iteratively.</p><p>We used 111 CEU and 112 YRI phased 1000 genomes phase 3 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auton et al., 2015</xref>) for generating 10 admixed genomes for ~380,000 SNPs (unless otherwise stated). For the inference, we used French and Yoruba from HGDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>). We generated data for various demographic scenarios, where we varied the time the admixture (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), proportion of mixture (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), sample size in the reference and target populations, divergence between the ancestral and reference populations used and studied their impact on the estimated dates. We also characterized the impact of features of ancient DNA such as missing data, pseudo-haploid genotypes, and limited sample size. In order to simulate pseudo-haploid genotypes, we randomly sampled an allele at each heterozygous site and assigned it as the homozygous genotype at that site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harney et al., 2021</xref>). To generate missing data, we set the genotype call at a site as ‘missing’ or ‘unknown’ (in eigenstrat format as <italic>9</italic>) where the proportion of missing genotypes ranged between 5% and 60% in our simulations. We also evaluated the impact of the choice of reference populations used in <italic>DATES</italic> in case of simple and multiple pulses of admixture.</p><p>To study the impact of complex scenarios of admixture involving founder events and continuous gene flow, we used a coalescent simulator, MaCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). We simulated 100 Mb of three populations with an effective population size of 12,500, mutation rate of 1.2 × 10<sup>–8</sup> and recombination rate 1 × 10<sup>–8</sup> per base pair per generation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halldorsson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jónsson et al., 2017</xref>). We assumed the admixture occurred continuously over a period of time or was followed by the bottleneck. In case of the latter, the duration of the bottleneck was 1–10 generations with reduction in effective population size from 12,500 to 10–1000 and the population recovered to its original size after the bottleneck or maintained a small size until present (no recovery founder event). For each simulation, we generated data for two haploid chromosomes and combined these to generate one diploid chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Software availability</title><p>The executable and source code for <italic>DATES</italic> will be available on GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MoorjaniLab/DATES_v4010">https://github.com/MoorjaniLab/DATES_v4010</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:0cd95e97a6e3186515f8812dca928ba30829d132;origin=https://github.com/MoorjaniLab/DATES_v4010;visit=swh:1:snp:bb2c8ef48a7ffe4366f654ee057c257c7780e88c;anchor=swh:1:rev:e034dc0d6fe8d41a828796f07791d50011b6bb04">swh:1:rev:e034dc0d6fe8d41a828796f07791d50011b6bb04</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chintalapati et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Data and admixture dates inferred using <italic>DATES (Distribution of Ancestry Tracts of Evolutionary Signals)</italic> for European groups during the Holocene (Excel sheet).</title><p>(A) Information on ancient samples used in our study.

The current method (version 4010) released in this study differs in some key aspects of the implementation (Materials and methods). To compare the two versions of <italic>DATES</italic>, we performed simulations and generated 10 admixed individuals with 20% European and 80% African ancestry where the time of admixture varied between 10 and 300 generations (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). We also varied the sample sizes of the admixed population between 1 and 20 in increments of 5. Our estimated admixture using v753 and v4010 are highly concordant suggesting although the implementation has changed, the results are similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1A–B</xref>). Further, we compared the dates of times of admixture that were reported using the earlier version.

Using the same setup in both methods, we inferred that <italic>DATES</italic> reliably recovers the time of admixture even when samples had large missing proportions of around 60% (, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). In contrast, ALDER becomes every noisy with moderate proportions of missing data (&gt;40%). For older dates (&gt;100 generations), ALDER estimates appear to be biased even with &gt;10% missing genotypes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). As the missing sites vary among individuals, admixture LD-based methods such as ALDER that combine information across individuals become noisy as there are few sites without non-missing genotypes remaining for inference. However, <italic>DATES</italic> performs the analysis for single individuals (using all non-missing genotypes for that individual) and then averages the inferred estimates across individuals. This provides substantial robustness to variable missingness across individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3-2"><title>Comparison of <italic>DATES</italic> with published admixture

The references used for inference are also pseudo-haploid genotyped. We further varied three key features of the data, missing genotype rate in reference populations (between 0-40%), missing genotype rate in target populations (between 20-60%) and divergence between true source populations and reference population used in <italic>DATES</italic>. We evaluated the performance of DATES for this setup for (supplement 8) target population size of <italic>n</italic> = 10 and (supplement 9) target population size of <italic>n</italic> = 1.</p><p>We have added the following to the main text:</p><p>“We also generated data for combinations of features including small sample sizes, pseudohaploid genotypes with large proportions of missing genotypes in both target and reference samples and use of highly divergent reference samples.

Moreover, the power of the inference depends on the demographic history, availability of data from reference populations related to the true source populations and age of the target samples (in particular, the proximity of the target sampling age to the time of admixture). Based on simulations, we find <italic>DATES</italic> gives reliable results using a single sample, with diploid or pseudo-haploid genotypes for least 50,000 genome-wide SNPs and with at least 5 samples from each reference population (with <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> ≤ 0.1). In empirical data, we find there is substantial robustness for dating recent admixture events, compared to older mixture events even with limited data.

For example, the use of Khomani San as the reference population instead of the true ancestral population of Yoruba (FST ~ 0.1) provides unbiased dates of admixture (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). In this regard, for ancient DNA where sometimes only sparse data is available, one can also use present-day samples as reference populations to increase the quality and sample size of the ancestral groups. In principle, as long as the allele frequencies in the reference samples are correlated to the ancestral allele frequencies, the inference of admixture dates should remain unbiased (Methods). In practice, however, recent demographic events (e.g., strong founder events or admixture from additional sources, etc.) in the history of the present-day samples could lead to significant deviation from the ancestral allele frequencies. Thus, the reference populations should be carefully chosen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Can you please clarify why using the admixed samples themselves as one of the reference populations works reliably (beginning of page 5)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following to the main text:</p><p>“Another idea is to use the admixed populations themselves as one of the reference populations as demonstrated by the single reference setup in ALDER (Loh et al., 2013; Pickrell et al. 2012). Admixed individuals have intermediate allele frequencies to the ancestral populations and thus weighted LD or ancestry covariance can be computed with only one reference population (albeit, with reduced power). Loh et al., 2013 showed that the use of admixed populations as one of the references does not bias the rate of decay of the weighted LD (i.e., time of admixture), though the amplitude of the decay curve (not used in DATES) can be biased under some scenarios. To verify DATES provides reliable results under this setup, we performed simulations and applied DATES with a single reference population and used the admixed population as the other reference. Like ALDER, our inferred dates of admixture were unbiased (Figure 1—figure supplement 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would also be very useful for potential users of DATES for the authors to specify what they think are the lower bounds for the use of their method with respect to sample size and data quality.</p></disp-quote><p>Lower bounds for statistical methods typically derive from theoretical limits of the method. Simulations can guide about the failure modes and serve as recommendations for parameter values that are likely to work, though these should not be considered as hard limits. Moreover, all our simulations are based on demographic and evolutionary parameters in humans, though the method is applicable (and being applied) to data from other species that differ in diversity, recombination map, data quality and demographic history compared to humans. Thus, rather than suggesting lower bounds, we have provided users with detailed investigation of the performance of DATES for varying sample size and data quality of reference and target individuals. Specifically, we provide recommendations for the following parameters in the main text under the “Overview of DATES: Model and simulations” section. Also where useful, we have added additional clarifications and caveats.</p><p>a) Dates of admixture – lines 137-139</p><p>b) Sample size of the target population – lines 140-141</p><p>c) Sample size of the reference populations – line 142</p><p>d) The genetic divergence of the source populations from the true ancestral population – lines 163-166</p><p>e) The quality of the data, including the proportion of missing genotypes in reference and target groups- lines 186-189.</p></body></sub-article></article>
