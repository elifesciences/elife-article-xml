In humans, for example, development progresses from childhood through to puberty and then to adulthood, when sexual maturity is attained. Similarly, in holometabolous insects, immature juveniles transit to the adult form through an intermediate pupal stage when larval tissues are eliminated and the imaginal progenitor cells form the adult structures. The identity of the larval, pupal, and adult stages depends on the sequential expression of the transcription factors <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>Br-C,</italic> and <italic>E93</italic>. However, how these transcription factors determine temporal identity in developing tissues is poorly understood. Here, we report on the role of the larval specifier <italic>chinmo</italic> in larval and adult progenitor cells during fly development. Interestingly, <italic>chinmo</italic> promotes growth in larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. In addition, we found that the absence of <italic>chinmo</italic> during metamorphosis is critical for proper adult differentiation. Importantly, we also provide evidence that, in contrast to the well-known role of <italic>chinmo</italic> as a pro-oncogene, Br-C and E93 act as tumour suppressors. Finally, we reveal that the function of <italic>chinmo</italic> as a juvenile specifier is conserved in hemimetabolous insects as its homolog has a similar role in <italic>Blatella germanica</italic>. Taken together, our results suggest that the sequential expression of the transcription factors Chinmo, Br-C and E93 during larva, pupa an adult respectively, coordinate the formation of the different organs that constitute the adult organism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Egg, larva, pupa, adult: the life of many insects is structured around these four well-defined stages of development. After hatching, the larva grows until it reaches a certain size; when the right conditions are met, it then becomes a pupa and metamorphoses into an adult. Most larval cells die during metamorphosis; only a group known as imaginal cells survives, dividing and maturing to create pupal and adult tissues.</p><p>Each of these developmental steps are linked to a particular genetic program deployed in response to a single stage-specifying gene. For instance, the activation of the <italic>Br-C</italic> gene triggers the transition from larva to pupa, while <italic>E93</italic> initiates the transformation of the pupa into an adult. However, which stage-specifying gene controls larval identity remains unclear. Recent studies suggest that in fruit flies, a gene known as <italic>chinmo</italic> could be playing this role.</p><p>In response, Chafino et al. explored how <italic>chinmo</italic> shapes the development of fruit fly larvae. The experiments showed that <italic>chinmo</italic> is activated in the juvenile stage, and that it is required for the larvae to grow properly and for larval and imaginal tissues to form. Conversely, it must be switched off for the insect to become a pupa and then an adult. Further work suggested that the role of <italic>chinmo</italic> as a larval specifier could have emerged early in insect evolution.</p><p>Moreover, Chafino et al. revealed that <italic>chinmo</italic> could repress <italic>Br-C</italic>, an important characteristic since stage-specifying genes usually switch on sequentially by regulating each other. A closer look suggested that, in imaginal cells, <italic>chinmo</italic> promotes development by inhibiting <italic>Br-C</italic>; in larval cells, however, <italic>chinmo</italic> not only has a <italic>Brc-</italic>repressing role but it is also necessary for larval cells to grow. Additional experiments exploring the role of the stage-specifying genes in tumor formation showed that <italic>chinmo</italic> promotes cells proliferation while <italic>Br-C</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> had tumor-suppressing properties.</p><p>Overall, the work by Chafino et al. sheds new light on the genetic control of insect development, while also potentially providing a new perspective on how genes related to <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>Br-C</italic> contribute to the emergence of human cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stage specifier</kwd><kwd>development transition</kwd><kwd>BTB-zinc finger transcrition factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGC2018-098427-B-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martín</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Franch-Marro</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2021-125661NB-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martín</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Franch-Marro</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGC2018-094254-B-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casanova</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-SGR 1030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martín</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Franch-Marro</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2021-123392NB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casanova</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stage identity and developmental progression in insects is controlled by sequential expression of temporal-specific transcription factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal development passes through various stages characterised by distinct morphological and molecular changes. In humans, for instance, development continues from birth through to childhood and puberty to give rise to the adult form. As in many animals, in holometabolous insects such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the developmental stages are sharply defined: embryogenesis gives rise to the larva, a juvenile stage, which, upon different rounds of growth and moulting, brings about a new stage structure, the pupa, when most of the larval cells die and the adult progenitor cells (imaginal cells) develop to generate the adult organism. The regulation of stage-specific differences is mediated by the action of two major developmental hormones, the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone and the terpenoid juvenile hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hiruma and Kaneko, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Truman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Truman and Riddiford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Truman and Riddiford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>). Both hormones exert this precise developmental control by regulating the expression of three critical genes that encode for the stage-identity factors that compose the metamorphic gene network: the C2H2 zinc finger type factor <italic>Krüppel-homolog 1</italic> (<italic>Kr-h1</italic>), the helix-turn-helix <italic>Ecdysone inducible protein 93</italic>F (<italic>E93</italic>), and <italic>Broad-complex</italic> (<italic>Br-C</italic>; also known as broad), a member of the bric-a-brac-tramtrack-broad family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martín et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The deployment of the pupal-specific genetic program is controlled by the expression of <italic>Br-C</italic> at the larval-pupal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Truman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou and Riddiford, 2002</xref>). Upon the formation of the pupa, hormone signalling triggers the expression of the helix-turn-helix factor <italic>E93</italic>, whose product represses <italic>Br-C</italic> expression and directs the formation of the final differentiated adult structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chafino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martín et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ureña et al., 2014</xref>). While it is firmly established that <italic>Br-C</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> are the stage-specifying genes for the pupal and adult states, the nature of the larval specifying gene has been elusive. To date, larval identity has been attributed to Kr-h1, which is present during the larval period and represses <italic>Br-C</italic> and <italic>E93</italic> expression during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ureña et al., 2016</xref>). However, although Kr-h1 is undoubtedly critical for maintaining the larval state, evidence has shown that this factor cannot be considered the larval specifier per se. For example, depletion of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not prevent normal larval development nor a timely transition to the pupa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pecasse et al., 2000</xref>). In this regard, the product of <italic>chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis</italic> (<italic>chinmo</italic>) gene, another member of the BTB family of transcription factors, has been recently proposed to be responsible for larval identity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Truman and Riddiford, 2022</xref>).</p><p>First isolated based on its requirement for the temporal identity of mushroom body neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>), the identification of Chinmo as a more general larval specifier has provided invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of juvenile identity. Yet, little is known about how this factor exerts its function along with Br-C and E93. Moreover, given that holometabolous insects are comprised of both larval tissues and pools of adult progenitor cells (known as imaginal cells), a central issue in the understanding of how larval identity is controlled is how larval and imaginal cells respond differentially to the same set of temporal transcription factors. Furthermore, in the sequential activation of <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>Br-C,</italic> and <italic>E93</italic>, the extent of the activity directly attributable to each transcription factor or to their mutual repression is still unclear.</p><p>Here, we confirm the role of <italic>chinmo</italic> as larval specifier in larval and imaginal cells and establish its regulatory interactions with the other temporal specifiers. We also examine how the temporal sequence of Chinmo and Br-C differently affects with the genetic program that establishes larval vs. imaginal identity. Thus, we found that Chinmo controls larval development of larval and imaginal tissues in a Br-C-independent and -dependent manner, respectively. According to these data, and in the context of the metamorphic gene network, we also show that <italic>chinmo</italic> absence is critical for the transition from larva to pupa and then to adult, as it acts as a repressor of both <italic>Br-C</italic> and <italic>E93</italic>. In addition, we report that the <italic>chinmo</italic> homologue has a similar role in the cockroach <italic>Blattella germanica,</italic> thereby indicating that its function as a juvenile specifier precedes the hemimetabolous/holometabolous split. Finally, we show that in contrast to the well-characterised role of <italic>chinmo</italic> as a pro-oncogene, the <italic>Br-C</italic> pupal and <italic>E93</italic> adult specifiers act mainly as tumour suppressor genes. These characteristics are maintained beyond insects and may account for the different role of some human BTB-zinc finger transcription factors in tumourigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>chinmo</italic> is expressed throughout larval stages and is required in larval and imaginal tissues</title><p>Examination of <italic>chinmo</italic> expression revealed that it is expressed during embryogenesis and early larval development and that it is strongly downregulated from L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Regarding the former, <italic>chinmo</italic> was selectively depleted in the salivary glands using the <italic>forkhead</italic> (<italic>fkh</italic>) driver (<italic>fkh-Gal4</italic>), which is active in this tissue from embryogenesis onwards. The salivary glands are a secretory organ that develops from embryonic epithelial placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edgar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zielke et al., 2013</xref>).

As it is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, although depletion of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the salivary glands did not affect the formation of this organ, it caused a dramatic decrease in normal larval development, as revealed by the strong reduction in size and DNA content of the gland cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Consistently, the expression levels of both early and late specific salivary gland protein encoding genes, such as <italic>new glue 1–3</italic> (ng) and <italic>Salivary gland secretion</italic> (<italic>Sgs</italic>), were virtually undetectable in <italic>chinmo</italic>-depleted salivary glands compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To address this notion, we precociously expressed Br-CZ1, the main Br-C isoform expressed during imaginal larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Narbonne-Reveau and Maurange, 2019</xref>), in salivary glands and wing discs. As previously described, ectopic expression of Br-CZ1 blocked Chinmo activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Narbonne-Reveau and Maurange, 2019</xref>). As a consequence, precocious upregulation of Br-C blocked development in both tissues, phenocopying the loss of function of <italic>chinmo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result suggests that a fundamental function of Chinmo is to suppress the expression of the pupal specifier <italic>Br-C</italic> during the juvenile stages. To confirm this hypothesis, we simultaneously depleted <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>Br-C</italic> in salivary glands and wing discs. Remarkably, whereas salivary glands showed the same growth impairment observed upon <italic>chinmo</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), depletion of <italic>Br-C</italic> largely rescued the abnormalities in the wing discs caused by depletion of <italic>chinmo</italic>: the double knock-out wing discs developed in a regular manner to reach normal size by the end of L3 and showed proper expression of patterning genes such as <italic>wg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The difference between larval and imaginal tissues was also observed in the analysis of the tracheal system and the eye imaginal disc. Whereas depletion of <italic>Br-C</italic> in the eye disc rescued the phenotype induced by the absence of <italic>chinmo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the larval trachea failed to restore the growth defects observed in <italic>chinmo</italic>-depleted tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that a major regulatory function of <italic>chinmo</italic> during early larval development in imaginal cells is channelled through the repression of <italic>Br-C</italic>, while in larval tissues <italic>chinmo</italic> appears to exert specific growth-related functions that are independent to <italic>Br-C</italic> repression. Thus, in the imaginal cells <italic>chinmo</italic> appears to ensure the expression of juvenile genes by repressing <italic>Br-C</italic>, a well-known inhibitor of larval gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou and Riddiford, 2002</xref>). In this regard, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>Br-C</italic> might repress the early expression of critical components of signaling pathways such as Wg and EGFR, involved in wing fate specification in early larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zecca and Struhl, 2002</xref>). In contrast, in larval tissues <italic>chinmo</italic> seems to exert an active role promoting growth and maturation. The fact that the Br-C-dependent <italic>Sgs</italic> genes fail to be activated in absence of <italic>chinmo</italic>, when <italic>Br-C</italic> is prematurely expressed, supports this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This different response could be explained by the nature of the larval and imaginal tissues. While larval tissues are mainly devoted to growth during the larval period and then fated to die during the metamorphic transition, the developmental identity of the imaginal cells is modified along the larva-pupa-adult temporal axis to give rise to the adult structures. This difference could also account for the distinct roles of the other members of the metamorphic gene network in larval and imaginal tissues. Thus, while <italic>Br-C</italic> is necessary for the degeneration of the larval salivary glands during the onset of the pupal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>), it is critical for the correct eversion of the imaginal wing disc and for the temporary G2 arrest that synchronises the cell cycle in the wing epithelium during early pupa wing elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, <italic>E93</italic> is necessary to activate autophagy for elimination of the larval mushroom body neuroblasts in late pupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>), whereas it controls the terminal adult differentiation of the imaginal wing during the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ureña et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uyehara et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Different requirement of <italic>chinmo</italic> for the larval growth of salivary glands and wing discs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DAPI-stained salivary glands from control (<italic>fkh-Gal4</italic>) and <italic>UAS-Br-C<sup>RNAi</sup>; UAS-chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> L3W larvae.

To this end, we used the German cockroach <italic>B. germanica</italic> as a model for hemimetabolous development. <italic>Blattella</italic> goes through six juvenile nymphal instars (N1–N6) before developing into an adult. Metamorphosis takes place during N6 and is restricted to the transformation of the wing primordia into functional wings, the attainment of functional genitalia, and changes in cuticle pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ureña et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A detailed Tblastn search in the <italic>Blattella</italic> genome database revealed the presence of a <italic>chinmo</italic> orthologue (<italic>Bg-chinmo</italic>). To study <italic>Bg-chinmo</italic>, we first examined its expression during the life cycle of <italic>Blattella</italic>. We found that it is highly expressed in embryos and decreases dramatically thereafter during nymphal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In order to analyze the function of the relative low levels of <italic>Bg-chinmo</italic> during postembryonic stages, we analysed the function of <italic>Bg-Chinmo</italic> by systemic injection of dsRNAs into newly emerged N4 instar. Specimens injected with dsMock were used as negative controls (Control animals). Importantly, whereas Control larvae underwent two nymphal molts before initiating metamorphosis at the end of the N6 stage, 43% of <italic>Bg-chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals underwent only one nymphal molt before molting to an early adult after the N5 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–E</xref>). Precocious <italic>Bg-chinmo</italic>-depleted adults were smaller than control counterparts as they skipped a nymphal stage. However, they presented all the external characteristics of an adult, namely functional hind- and fore-wings, adult legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), adult cerci, mature genitalia, and adult-specific cuticle pigmentation. Altogether, these results suggest that the role of Chinmo as juvenile specifier seems to be conserved in hemimetabolous insects, thereby indicating that its developmental function precedes the hemimetabolous-holometabolous split.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Depletion of <italic>chinmo</italic> in <italic>B. germanica</italic> promotes premature adulthood.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) <italic>Bg-chinmo</italic> mRNA levels measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from embryo to the last nymphal stage (<bold>N6</bold>) in whole body (<bold>A</bold>), and prothoracic gland (PG), and wings and elytra (<bold>B</bold>).

Together with a number of previous reports (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martín et al., 2021</xref>), our results show that the temporal expression of Chinmo, Br-C, and E93 determines the tissue acquisition of gradual differentiation features from the juvenile to the adult to generate the distinct organs. Whereas Chinmo maintains cells in an undifferentiated state, Br-C and E93 induce progressively the differentiation program. This effect has already been shown in the central nervous system where early-born neurons are characterised by the expression of Chinmo, whereas smaller late-born neurons are marked by expression of <italic>Br-C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>chinmo</italic>-to-<italic>Br-C</italic> transition in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been associated with the loss of the regenerative potential of imaginal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Narbonne-Reveau and Maurange, 2019</xref>). The fact that Br-C and E93 act as a tumour suppressor in an overproliferative background supports this idea.</p><p>Finally, we found that the role of <italic>chinmo</italic> as larval specifier is conserved in hemimetabolous insects. Since hemimetabolous insects do not undergo the intermediate pupal stage, the transition from juvenile to adult, therefore, relies mainly on the shift from Chinmo to E93 during the last nymphal stage, with Kr-h1 also involved in preventing metamorphosis through the repression of <italic>E93</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ureña et al., 2016</xref>). However, although in hemimetabolans insects depletion of <italic>Br-C</italic> does not impair metamorphosis, Br-C does regulate the progressive growth of the metamorphic tissues, such as the wing pads and the dorsal thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erezyilmaz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez-Nicolas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konopova et al., 2011</xref>). This observation suggests that a premetamorphic role of Br-C was already present in hemimetabolous insects, acquiring an additional metamorphic role as pupal specifier during the evolution of holometabolous insects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>All fly stocks were reared at 25°C on standard flour/agar <italic>Drosophila</italic> media.

larval growth and development as part of the metamorphic gene network in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Chinmo does so in part by regulating Broad expression in imaginal tissues (e.g. eye and wing discs) and in a Broad-independent manner in other larval tissues such as the salivary glands and larval trachea. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the role of Chinmo in promoting larval development is conserved between holometabolous insects and hemimetabolous insects, which lack a pupal stage. The data were collected and analyzed using solid and validated methodology and will be of interest to a broad audience including those interested in development and evolution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84648.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Fernandes</surname><given-names>Vilaiwan M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Truman</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/006w34k90</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/10.1101/2022.11.17.516883">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.17.516883v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Antagonistic role of the BTB-zinc finger transcription factors Chinmo and Broad in the juvenile/pupal transition and in growth control&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: James W Truman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions and clarifications of reviewer feedback</p><p>1. Please test the relationship between Chinmo and Broad in imaginal/larval tissues (in addition to the wing disc and salivary glands, which are provided in the manuscript). The reviewers felt this would strengthen the authors' claim that Chinmo promotes larval development in a Br-C-dependent manner in imaginal tissues and a Br-C-independent manner in other larval tissues.</p><p>2. Related to point 2 raised by Reviewer #2, following the consultation session, the reviewers agreed that the role of ecdysone and EcR in the transition from Chinmo to Broad is of obvious interest, but that the manuscript stands well without this additional information. While it would be interesting to know if larval cells show a similar transition time and dependence on EcR (perhaps by using an EcR-DN under conditional GAL-80 control) this information does not impact the main message of the manuscript and is therefore not essential.</p><p>3. Regarding sex-specific regulation of Chinmo (point 3 raised by reviewer#2), following the consultation session, the reviewers have asked that the figure legend and methods relating to Figure 1 be revised to clarify which sex was used throughout the study.</p><p>4. There are some discrepancies with the model that Chinmo promotes larval development and represses the larval-to-pupal transition in larval tissues independently of Broad (see specific reviewer comments) since salivary glands lacking chinmo would be expected to express higher rather than lower levels of sgs genes. This discrepancy may relate to the reduced size of the tissue. It is therefore possible that Chinmo may feed into two parallel pathways, one to regulate growth independently of Broad and the other involving Broad to regulate premetamorphic changes.</p><p>- Please examine early larval salivary gland proteins such as ng-1 to -3 that are expressed in salivary glands before the critical weight. Also, it would be interesting if the appearance of the SGS proteins after chinmo knock-down (Figure 5E) is abolished by simultaneous knock-down of broad.</p><p>5. Please amend the text to include further consideration of the role of Broad in hemimetabolous insects in light of other publications (see comments from reviewer #3 for more details).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please accept these manuscript comments, which include experimental suggestions as well as minor spelling errors:</p><p>1. In the legend for Figure 1E, the larval stage isolated at the time of qPCR should be reported.</p><p>2. In Figure 1F, the staining of Br-C and Chinmo in L3W wing discs should be repeated with proper controls included: control wing discs, UAS-chinmoRNAi with an additional &quot;control&quot; UAS-line such as UAS-laczRNAi. The latter should be included since the stated conclusion of this experiment is that wing disc growth requires the absence of Br-C until the L3W stage. The restoration of normal growth in the experiment shown could be a result of attenuated Chinmo depletion due to the presence of a 3rd UAS construct (there is already a UAS-GFP in the background).</p><p>3. For similar reasons stated above, the following experiments/figures should be shown with proper controls:</p><p>– Figure 5A (single knockdowns of Br-C or chinmo, each with UAS control);</p><p>– Figure 5F (control wing disc staining, as well as UAS-chinmoRNAi with a UAS control).</p><p>4. Control stainings should be included for:</p><p>– Br-C and Ct staining in control wing discs are not shown in any figures and should be included in experimental controls for each figure where this staining appears (e.g., Fig6);</p><p>– Same comment for E93 in Fig7.</p><p>5. Stage of animals used to assess SG gene expression in Figure 2E should be reported.</p><p>6. In Figure 4, unique subfigure letters for each genotype would aid analysis/reading.</p><p>7. Unique figure letters for each graph in 9A would aid reader analysis. Also, the &quot;PG&quot; and &quot;wing and elytra&quot; graphs should each include a y-axis label.</p><p>8. In the text description of the esgGal4 driver (lines 150-151), I suggest revising it to the following: &quot;…we knocked down this factor in the pouch region of wing imaginal discs…&quot;</p><p>9. In line 181, there is a minor typo. Would revise it to &quot;As a consequence, precocious upregulation of Br-C blocked development in both tissues, phenocopying the loss of chinmo.</p><p>10. In lines 205-213, literature evidence is presented to bolster the notion that MGN factors can exert different functions depending on the tissue, as they demonstrate Chinmo acting in both Br-C-dependent and independent manners to promote larval development. I'm not sure that I logically follow this argument and I don't think it strengthens the previous statement. If it is possible to clarify the argument then I support that, but otherwise, I would suggest removing this portion of the text.</p><p>11. In line 282, remove the word &quot;also&quot;</p><p>12. In lines 315-317, the authors describe phenotypes that are preserved in the absence of Bg-chinmo (Figure 9). I recommend including representative images that show that the mentioned adult structures are preserved in Bg-chinmoRNAi.</p><p>13.

Please test the relationship between Chinmo and Broad in imaginal/larval tissues (in addition to the wing disc and salivary glands, which are provided in the manuscript). The reviewers felt this would strengthen the authors' claim that Chinmo promotes larval development in a Br-C-dependent manner in imaginal tissues and a Br-C-independent manner in other larval tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analysed the role of <italic>chinmo</italic> in two additional tissues as suggested by the referees and the editorial board. The larval tracheal system as an additional larval tissue and the eye disc as another imaginal tissue. Confirming the results obtained in the salivary glands and wing discs, we found that <italic>chinm</italic>o promotes development in the eye imaginal disc by repressing precocious expression of Br-C, whereas in the larval trachea, in addition to the Br-C repression, induces tracheal growth. We generated two Figures supplement with the new results and added the data in the main text. (Please see the complete explanation below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to point 2 raised by Reviewer #2, following the consultation session, the reviewers agreed that the role of ecdysone and EcR in the transition from Chinmo to Broad is of obvious interest, but that the manuscript stands well without this additional information. While it would be interesting to know if larval cells show a similar transition time and dependence on EcR (perhaps by using an EcR-DN under conditional GAL-80 control) this information does not impact the main message of the manuscript and is therefore not essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editor that the analysis of ecdysone signalling, although of interest, would not substantially modify the message of the manuscript and, therefore, we did not address it (Please see the complete explanation below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding sex-specific regulation of Chinmo (point 3 raised by reviewer#2), following the consultation session, the reviewers have asked that the figure legend and methods relating to Figure 1 be revised to clarify which sex was used throughout the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the measurements of <italic>chinmo</italic> expression always in females when sex identification was possible, namely in L3. In L1 and L2 larvae, sex identification was not possible in our conditions. Nevertheless, we think that there are evidences that suggest that <italic>chinmo</italic> does not have a significant role in sex difference growth rate during larval development, when precisely male and female growth differences have been reported (Please see the complete explanation below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There are some discrepancies with the model that Chinmo promotes larval development and represses the larval-to-pupal transition in larval tissues independently of Broad (see specific reviewer comments) since salivary glands lacking chinmo would be expected to express higher rather than lower levels of sgs genes. This discrepancy may relate to the reduced size of the tissue. It is therefore possible that Chinmo may feed into two parallel pathways, one to regulate growth independently of Broad and the other involving Broad to regulate premetamorphic changes.</p><p>- Please examine early larval salivary gland proteins such as ng-1 to -3 that are expressed in salivary glands before the critical weight. Also, it would be interesting if the appearance of the SGS proteins after chinmo knock-down (Figure 5E) is abolished by simultaneous knock-down of broad.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the expression levels of early larval salivary gland protein <italic>ng-1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic> and <italic>-3</italic> genes in <italic>chinmo</italic> and in <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>Br-C</italic> depleted animals. As happens to be the case also for <italic>Sgs</italic> genes, the expression levels of those genes were virtually undetectable in both conditions, suggesting that <italic>chinmo</italic> is required for SG growth and maturation. (Please see the complete explanation below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please amend the text to include further consideration of the role of Broad in hemimetabolous insects in light of other publications (see comments from reviewer #3 for more details).</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the role of Br-C in hemimetabolous insects in the main text as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please accept these manuscript comments, which include experimental suggestions as well as minor spelling errors:</p><p>1. In the legend for Figure 1E, the larval stage isolated at the time of qPCR should be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>This information was already reported in the figure legends of Figure 1: “qPCR was performed from SG dissected at L1 larva”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 1F, the staining of Br-C and Chinmo in L3W wing discs should be repeated with proper controls included: control wing discs, UAS-chinmoRNAi with an additional &quot;control&quot; UAS-line such as UAS-laczRNAi. The latter should be included since the stated conclusion of this experiment is that wing disc growth requires the absence of Br-C until the L3W stage. The restoration of normal growth in the experiment shown could be a result of attenuated Chinmo depletion due to the presence of a 3rd UAS construct (there is already a UAS-GFP in the background).</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the referee refers to Figure 5F and not Figure1F as there is no such panel 1F in the Figure 1. In any case, we understand the concern of the referee regarding the strength of the Gal4 with multiple UAS transgenes. For this reason, we provide a staining of Br-C and Chinmo in the double knockdown in Figure 5F to prove that the downregulation of each gene is indeed effective. The same control of RNAi effectiveness was performed for the SG. We added the staining of Br-C and Chinmo in depleted SGs in a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1. In summary, we believe that measuring the decay of protein levels in each experimental condition is a strong enough evidence of the RNAi efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For similar reasons stated above, the following experiments/figures should be shown with proper controls:</p><p>– Figure 5A (single knockdowns of Br-C or chinmo, each with UAS control);</p><p>– Figure 5F (control wing disc staining, as well as UAS-chinmoRNAi with a UAS control).</p></disp-quote><p>As in the previous point, we think that staining for Br-C and Chinmo in the SG is a good enough control to show the efficiency of the RNAi. Importantly, the double knockdown of <italic>Br-C</italic> and <italic>chinmo</italic> is not able to rescue the <italic>chinmo</italic> RNAi alone. This observation supports the idea that the double UAS is not reducing the effectiveness of the RNAi, as, otherwise, we should observe a different phenotype. Nevertheless, as we did for the imaginal disc, we measured the expression of Br-C and Chinmo in a double knockdown SGs. Under these conditions we were not able to detect neither Chinmo nor Br-C demonstrating that both RNAis work properly. We added this data in a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>For the experiment presented in panel F of Figure 5, we generated a new Figure 5—figure supplement 2 with the staining of Chinmo, Br-C and Wg in <italic>Control</italic> wing discs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Control stainings should be included for:</p><p>– Br-C and Ct staining in control wing discs are not shown in any figures and should be included in experimental controls for each figure where this staining appears (e.g., Fig6);</p><p>– Same comment for E93 in Fig7.</p></disp-quote><p>Control Ct staining is shown in Figure 3. In Figures 6 and 7 all the experiments were performed with internal controls. We used the cubitus interruptus driver (<italic>ci-Gal4</italic>), which is only expressed in the anterior compartment of the larval disc or pupal wing. Therefore, wild type expression of the different markers is provided in these two figures in the posterior compartment. For this reason, we think that it is redundant and confusing to add the expression of the different markers analysed in a wild type disc in those special conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Stage of animals used to assess SG gene expression in Figure 2E should be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>SGs were dissected from L3W larva. We have added this information in the new Figure 2 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

In the text description of the esgGal4 driver (lines 150-151), I suggest revising it to the following: &quot;…we knocked down this factor in the pouch region of wing imaginal discs…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the sentence as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In line 181, there is a minor typo. Would revise it to &quot;As a consequence, precocious upregulation of Br-C blocked development in both tissues, phenocopying the loss of chinmo.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the sentence as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. In lines 205-213, literature evidence is presented to bolster the notion that MGN factors can exert different functions depending on the tissue, as they demonstrate Chinmo acting in both Br-C-dependent and independent manners to promote larval development. I'm not sure that I logically follow this argument and I don't think it strengthens the previous statement. If it is possible to clarify the argument then I support that, but otherwise, I would suggest removing this portion of the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified this point in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.
