are not obligate pathogens; rather, they are environmental microbes taking advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation, is an evolutionary puzzle. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. An example of such a trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of ‘accidental virulence’, replicate populations of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes— biofilm formation and flor formation— increased; another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to the nutrient limitation. Thus, experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. Wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains. Hence, selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence. Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Yeast are microscopic fungi that are found on many plants, in the soil and in other environments around the world.

For example, a toxin that helps the opportunistic microbe compete against neighboring microbes may also weaken an animal. Or the ability of many individual microbe cells to clump together into structures known as biofilms on solid surfaces, or floating mats called flors on liquids, helps them to survive in harsh environments, whether in the soil or in the body of an animal.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, Ekdahl, Salcedo et al. examined whether artificially selecting yeast with a specific trait – the ability to stick to plastic beads – in the absence of any host animals would inadvertently also select for yeast that were good at causing disease. This trait was selected because it has not been previously linked to opportunistic yeast infections.</p><p>The team grew the yeast for 400 generations in tubes that each contained a plastic bead. At every generation, only yeast that stuck to the plastic bead were transferred to a fresh tube to grow the next generation. The experiments found that, not only did the ability of the yeast to stick to the plastic increase over time, but the yeast also evolved the ability to form biofilms and flors. Furthermore, the sticky yeast killed an insect host known as wax moth larvae more quickly than non-sticky yeast.</p><p>Together, these findings demonstrate that when microbes evolve in an environment that is devoid of any host animals, selection can inadvertently favor dual-use traits that also help the yeast to infect animals. Opportunistic yeast infections are of increasing concern in human patients, particularly those with weakened immune systems. Understanding which yeast traits are dual-use will help guide future efforts in combatting yeast and other opportunistic microbes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>adherence</kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>FLO11</kwd><kwd>wax moth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15-GM122032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Helen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1839555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Helen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yeast that were evolved to adhere to plastic surfaces for a few hundred generations became hyper-adherent and more virulent.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of infectious disease often focuses on pathogenic microbes that either specialize in exploiting animal hosts or act as commensals that switch to pathogenesis when the delicate balance between host and microbe is perturbed. These microbes are presumed to have co-evolved complex adaptations that allow survival and reproduction in and on hosts. However, there exists a broad range of microbial organisms that live in the open environment (i.e. soil, vegetation, aquatic habitats) that are capable of causing disease when the opportunity presents itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). Such microbes also have adaptations that allow host exploitation, but the origin of these adaptations is unclear, as growth and survival in a host is not a required part of the lifecycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casadevall and Pirofski, 2007</xref>). For example, the soil-associated bacteria <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Selezska et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahenthiralingam et al., 2008</xref>) can infect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.</p><p>The existence of virulence traits in environmentally-derived opportunistic pathogens may be due to selection favoring the traits for other uses in the non-host environment, which challenges the idea that co-evolution is a requirement of microbial pathogenesis and virulence. This hypothesis, first proposed and explored in the bacterial literature, is known as ‘coincidental selection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Levin and Svanborg Edén, 1990</xref>). Much of the research testing the coincidental selection hypothesis has focused on the biotic environment as a selective pressure, specifically the role of predatory bacteriophages and protists (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erken et al., 2013</xref>]). The relationship between virulence, bacteria, and their predators is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brüssow, 2007</xref>). For example, a positive relationship between amoeba predation and virulence was shown in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adiba et al., 2010</xref>), while selection by amoeba predation led to a decrease virulence in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leong et al., 2022</xref>). In the same bacterial species, an evolution experiment with both protist and phage predators showed that phage could mitigate the decrease in virulence associated with protist predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friman and Buckling, 2014</xref>). Despite the complexity, it is clear that selection from the biotic environment can strongly influence bacterial virulence.</p><p>A hypothesis similar to coincidental selection, known as ‘accidental virulence’, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casadevall and Pirofski, 2007</xref>) and explored in parallel in the eukaryotic microbial literature, also with a focus on the biotic environment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Siscar-Lewin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casadevall et al., 2019</xref>). For example, in the fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, traits that protect from predatory amoeba also play a role in human infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Steenbergen et al., 2001</xref>), and selection by amoeba can increase the prevalence of such traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steenbergen et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, co-culturing <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> fungi with amoeba can lead to increased virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albuquerque et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In both the bacterial and eukaryotic literature, there has been less focus on the role of selection imposed by the abiotic environment, although temperature is increasingly a consideration, as thermotolerance and halotolerance may make colonization in and on humans more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casadevall, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Solache and Casadevall, 2010</xref>). For example, the emerging opportunistic yeast <italic>Candida auris</italic>, which is found in warm and salty coastal wetlands, can cause severe systemic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2021</xref>). There is also experimental evidence that increased temperature can select for virulence in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The dual-use virulence traits that can be under ‘coincidental selection’ and lead to ‘accidental virulence’ are numerous and range from toxin production, such as the production of gliotoxin in the soil-dwelling filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hillmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gupta et al., 2021</xref>), to protective structures, such as capsule formation in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadevall et al., 2003</xref>). Another type of trait, which is the focus of the research presented here, is adherence. Adherence is important for many microbial behaviors required for survival (e.g., biofilm formation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">West et al., 2007</xref>), but can also play a role in pathogenicity and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Douglas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>). The ability to adhere to and invade tissues, as well as form communities resistant to anti-microbials, can be key to successful pathogenicity. In the soil-associated yeast, <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgardner and Laundre, 2001</xref>), which can cause lung infections, the deletion of a single adhesin gene abolishes pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klein, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The function of microbial traits in both the open environment and the host is crucial evidence for the coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis. However, experimental evolution allows the idea to be tested directly; thus far, most evolution experiments have focused on co-culturing opportunistic microbes with predators (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friman and Buckling, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steenbergen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albuquerque et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mikonranta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hosseinidoust et al., 2013</xref>]). In the research presented here, rather than altering the biotic or abiotic environment and determining the effect on virulence, we apply direct selection to a specific trait hypothesized to be dual-use in the biomedical model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Aside from serving as a model for genetics and cell biology, and being found in a myriad of ecological niches around the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Peter et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is also an opportunistic pathogen capable of infecting immunocompromised individuals, with reports of infections increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aucott et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Muñoz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Llopis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enache-Angoulvant and Hennequin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hennequin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pérez-Torrado and Querol, 2015</xref>). As such, it has been a model for fungal pathogenesis-related traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clemons et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fraser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McCusker et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Phadke et al., 2018</xref>). Some environmentally derived strains are capable of adhering to surfaces and expressing associated aggregative phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Verstrepen and Klis, 2006</xref>). These range from biofilms on solid and semi-solid agar, to pseudohyphal growth and agar invasion, to floating mats on liquid surfaces (flors). Of these multicellular phenotypes, only invasive and pseudohyphal growth have been linked to pathogenicity in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McCusker et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Phadke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Palecek et al., 2002</xref>), although biofilm formation has been linked to pathogenicity in other fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fanning and Mitchell, 2012</xref>). Not all strains are capable of expressing these phenotypes. And while some strains express multiple multicellular traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casalone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zara et al., 2009</xref>), there does not appear to be a correlation among the numerous adherence phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hope and Dunham, 2014</xref>). Despite overlap in conserved signaling and regulatory networks governing the traits, the ability of a strain to express multicellularity in one form does not necessarily suggest the ability to express it in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen and Sprague, 2012</xref>). This is not entirely surprising, since different environmental conditions likely favor different multicellular phenotypes.</p><p>Here, yeast populations were artificially selected for adherence ability in one context, in order to determine whether it led to an increase in virulence in another. Specifically, yeast were evolved to adhere to a plastic bead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Poltak and Cooper, 2011</xref>), then tested against wax moth larvae to estimate virulence. In replicate populations of two genetic backgrounds, the yeast increased in their ability to express multicellularity in numerous forms. Not all multicellular phenotypes responded in the same way, with pseudohyphal growth appearing to evolve independently from plastic adherence, biofilm formation, and flor formation. This phenotypic evolution demonstrates the complexity of the interacting genetic networks underlying yeast multicellularity. Along with these correlated effects of selection, the yeast also became more virulent. Our results experimentally demonstrate that selection on dual-use traits outside of a host environment can inadvertently favor pre-adaptations for virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The evolution experiment was conducted in two genetic backgrounds. While most <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains can be pathogenic against wax moth larvae if administered with a high enough inoculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Phadke et al., 2018</xref>), we chose two strains isolated from clinical settings, and therefore, had a known tendency toward human pathogenicity as well. These strains were highly heterozygous, with tens of thousands of SNPs in each genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Magwene et al., 2011</xref>); thus, the strains contained standing genetic variation on which selection could act. The first strain, YJM311, was isolated from the bile tube of a patient in San Francisco in 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McCusker et al., 1994b</xref>); its recombinant offspring vary in at least one form of filamentous growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lenhart et al., 2019</xref>). The second strain, YJM128, was isolated from the lung of a patient in Missouri in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tawfik et al., 1989</xref>). Both strains were engineered to constitutively express mCherry, then sporulated, digested, and germinated. Each pool of recombinant offspring was used to inoculate replicate populations.</p><p>From each ancestral strain, 10 replicate populations were evolved via serial transfer for 350–400 mitotic generations, half punctuated with sexual cycles every 40 generations, and two without beads as controls. YJM311 was evolved for 8 sexual cycles, while YJM128 was evolved for 9. Populations were grown in limiting medium in glass tubes in the presence of a plastic bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). After growth, beads were washed, suspended in water, and sonicated to detach cells. The cell suspension was transferred to the next tube for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In YJM128, the sexual control failed to propagate after the first cycle. Therefore, a full complement of controls (three asexual and three sexual) were subsequently initiated and evolved in the same manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evolution of bead adherence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image of a 7 mm experimental bead; close-up image with attached cells expressing mCherry, scale bar represents 50 µm.

Larval survival and pupation were monitored for the next 7 days. Different batches of larvae can be variable in their response to microbial insult; therefore, to ensure reproducibility of results, the experiment was repeated multiple times with numerous batches of larvae, with each batch being challenged by all strains from a genetic background. For the clones derived from YM311, of the 2400 larvae injected with yeast, 1809 did not survive through day 7. Larvae injected with a hyper-multicellular strain were 1.28 times more likely to die than those injected with a non-multicellular strain (mixed effects Cox model: coefficient = 0.249, coeff. s.e. = 0.068, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

When considering the survival curves of individual strains, non-multicellular strains were less virulent regardless of whether they were from ancestral, control or experimental populations.</p><p>Thus, the evolutionary changes brought about by selection for adherence to a plastic bead, led to the incidental evolution of increased virulence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that selection on one yeast trait can generate a correlated response in other traits— a common feature of organismal evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Price and Langen, 1992</xref>)— but here, the correlated traits may have included those associated with virulence. In this experiment, favoring the ability to adhere to plastic, a surface that is common in industrial, medical, and domestic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geyer et al., 2017</xref>), led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence.</p><p>The coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis proposes that selection for survival in harsh conditions may lead to traits that predispose microbes to virulence. However, harsh environmental conditions can also favor traits that favor the collective, or multicellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tong et al., 2022</xref>), so it is perhaps not surprising that other forms of multicellularity increased throughout this experiment. Furthermore, in its long evolutionary history, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has evolved the genetic capability to express multiple different multicellular phenotypes, most of which are induced in nutrient limiting conditions; the experiment presented here was performed in such conditions (glucose limited medium). Other experiments with yeast growing in nutrient limiting conditions have resulted in the unintended evolution of single aggregative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hope et al., 2017</xref>). In this light, the correlated phenotypic response in this experiment is not entirely unexpected. However, the evolution of <italic>multiple</italic> multicellular phenotypes in <italic>two</italic> independent genetic backgrounds was not anticipated. Furthermore, nutrient limiting conditions may have affected PSH in our experiment, but it was not the main driver of the other multicellular phenotypes; rather, it was adherence selection that led to the evolution of hyper-multicellularity.</p><p>Previous research on a panel of environmental isolates found no correlation between the phenotypes assayed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hope and Dunham, 2014</xref>), and in a tractable lab strain capable of aggregative behaviors, each phenotype was associated with its own set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ryan et al., 2012</xref>). However, there is overlap in the requirement of <italic>FLO11</italic> and its regulators. Despite the phenotypes being induced by different nutrient signals, there are numerous conserved signaling pathways contributing to filamentous, multicellular growth of all forms (e.g. cAMP-PKA, TOR, filamentous MAPK, Rim101) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen and Sprague, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Granek et al., 2011</xref>). It is well known that genetic background and genetic architecture can have strong effects on the expression and correlation of traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gasch et al., 2016</xref>). In the case of the filamentous phenotypes assayed here, a genetic background that contains variants in the main signaling pathways may lead to a correlation of the phenotypes, while variants expressed later in the development of the phenotype, that are specific to a single trait, may not lead to such a correlation. The effect of the different types of genetic variants suggests that some strains and genetic backgrounds are more likely to evolve virulence from selection in the open environment.</p><p>The strains used in this experiment each contain ~50,000 heterozygous sites and differ from each other by ~25,000 SNPs. It is possible that they contained genetic variation in canonical signaling pathways, allowing for the evolution of hyper-multicellular strains. Interestingly, in both backgrounds, pseudohyphal growth appeared to evolve independently of the other phenotypes. Future research will investigate the sorting of the genetic variation, as well as the new mutations, that led to the observed phenotypic evolution in these populations.</p><p>Understanding the processes that lead to the emergence of opportunistic fungal pathogens is of increasing importance. In 2022, the World Health Organization issued its first-ever report prioritizing 19 fungal pathogens for research and public health awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>); of these, 11 are known to live in the environment (i.e. soil, wood, etc.), including three in the highest priority group (<italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, <italic>Candida auris</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>). In our experiment, it is unclear which trait was associated with increased virulence: plastic adherence, a different multicellular trait, or general hyper-multicellularity. Regardless of the specific trait causing increased virulence, the experiment demonstrated that selection for a dual-use trait in an environment that is entirely devoid of host organisms can still inadvertently lead to virulence and pathogenicity. The experiment also demonstrated the role that sex can have in increasing rates of adaptation in fungi.</p><p>Whether or not increased virulence caused by adherence selection is a general result in fungal microbes remains to be seen. In bacteria, the results are mixed. In <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic>, plastic bead selection led to an increase in biofilm phenotypes and mutations previously associated with chronic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Poltak and Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Traverse et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, bead selection in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> led to a decrease in biofilm-related phenotypes. It also led to an increase in antibiotic resistance, thus mimicking changes seen in chronic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azimi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As humans continue to generate novel ecological niches at an unprecedented rate by encroaching on more habitats, using plastics unreservedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Iroegbu et al., 2021</xref>), and especially, as the global climate changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">IPCC Core Writing Team, 2023</xref>), the potential for unintended selection grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casadevall, 2020</xref>). Clinically relevant strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can use microplastics in the environment as a reservoir and can even become more virulent after recovery from the ‘plastisphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ormsby et al., 2023</xref>), and it has been shown that plastics in the environment may harbor other pathogenic taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Warmer water temperatures and climate disruptions have been linked to the incidence of illness caused by the marine bacterium <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Martinez-Urtaza et al., 2010</xref>), and an increase in global temperature has been hypothesized to be related to the simultaneous emergence of <italic>C. auris</italic> infections on multiple continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Megha et al., 2020</xref>). More generally, the narrowing of the gap between mammalian body temperatures and the ambient environment may create opportunities for fungi to exploit new host niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Solache and Casadevall, 2010</xref>). Thus, as new selective pressures act on populations with existing abundant genetic variation, there is the opportunity to coincidentally select a new generation of accidental pathogens.</p></sec><sec

Replicate population within treatments (control, asexual, sexual) was considered a random effect. Because all populations were begun from a single ancestral pool, the intercept was set as the mean value of the ancestor and not allowed to vary among treatments. Therefore, the only fixed effect was the interaction between cycle and treatment, which tested the differences among the slopes of the three treatments. The analysis was performed on the number of cells counted on a hemocytometer, which ranged from zero to a few hundred cells in the later cycles. Thus, the coefficients represent the effect on the number of cells per cycle on these counts. Clonal data were analyzed similarly, with the untransformed average score of a phenotype as the independent variable.

Therefore, the low-multicellularity clones were chosen from the ancestral segregants, as well as early and ending control populations. The high-multicellularity clones were chosen from the ending experimental populations. Because CCM was correlated with plastic adherence and flor formation, it was used as an initial screen to find clones of interest (either smooth or very complex colonies); data on the other phenotypes were then investigated. Once a subset of clones was chosen, they were re-assayed to verify the phenotypes and used in virulence assays. In the second background, YJM128, clones were chosen in an attempt to isolate the effect of hyper-multicellularity, thus, other than ancestral segregants, all clones were chosen from the experimental populations using the same process. Since the high-multicellularity clones should have exhibited some level of all of the phenotypes (when possible) and PSH was evolving independently, the chosen clones do not stand out as the most extreme on the PCA plot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Virulence assay</title><p>10 ml EM cultures of evolved and ancestral strains <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref> were grown for 48 hr, washed and resuspended in sterile water to a concentration of 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml based on hemocytometer counts. 4 μl of culture or control water was injected into the final posterior proleg of <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae (Vanderhorst Wholesale Inc, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.waxworms.net">https://www.waxworms.net</ext-link>) weighing on average 180 (±20) mg using a Hamilton PB600-1 Repeating Dispenser with a 27-gauge needle.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel Smith (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have provided detailed comments and made recommendations for improving the paper. Furthermore Reviewers 1 and 2 had discussions among themselves and with me regarding what would constitute a successful revision and here is a distillation of that discussion, which is in addition to the Reviewer comments below.</p><p>– As noted by Reviewer it is very important to address the relationship to previous work on 'coincidental selection for virulence' and place your findings in that context.</p><p>– You must address the concerns about how the virulence assays were conducted. For example, It was not clear to Reviewer 1 why the paper lacked a simple 'ancestor' versus 'evolved with beads' versus 'evolved without beads' comparison. The concern here is that pooling across generations and stratifying by a correlated phenotype could introduce biases that confound the question of phenotype under observation.</p><p>– There was concern about the pooling of the data. Although the unpooled data was in the supplemental data this should be on the main figures. Pooling is a problem because the isolates come from different cycles and conditions, and the readers should be able to see which are the ancestral/control and late-cycle experimental isolates. Showing that enhanced virulence phenotype is present in 10-12 of the hyper multicellular isolates makes their data stronger than showing them pooled as one.</p><p>– The paper needs to do a better job in describing the selection of the 20 low hyper multicellular strains and the 20 high hyper multicellular strains and include the Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 in the main text. This could help the reader see which strains were used and also show that the low hyper multicellular strains are generally control or ancestral isolates. They might also be able to write which strain is which in the virulence graph keys.</p><p>Please know that I will be sending this paper back to the reviewers if a revised version is submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>. Hence, I encourage you to address all the issues raised by the review. Personally, I think this is a very interesting paper and I hope that it can be revised such that it would be acceptable to the journal. The comments/criticisms are extensive but if addressed will result in a much stronger paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found this paper very interesting, and I think the experiments were thorough and well-designed, and I am very impressed with the volume of the G. mellonella infections. It is amazing how much the yeast changed after the 8/9 cycles of selection for adhesion to plastic. I think the paper does a good job describing the multicellular (and hyper-multicellular) phenotypes that arose from the adhesion to plastic. I also found it interesting that the PSH evolved independently of plastic adhesion and was likely due to nutrient deprivation in the media. Below are some suggested edits and changes you could make to the presentation of the data that could help effectively show the massive amount of work done.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1. How many of the bead-adhering cells get removed during the sonication and washing process? Are there strongly adherent cells remaining? If so, would you then be selecting for medium-plastic rather than strong adherence?</p><p>2. Have you looked at the cell surface hydrophobicity of some of these strains? A MATH assay (Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbon) is relatively straightforward to try, although it might be fickle and highly variable if the baseline hydrophobicity is low. I would expect the plastic-selected ones to have higher hydrophobicity which is sometimes associated with enhanced virulence.</p><p>3. Line 114: you mention the possibility of fluorescence evolution over time. Although it seems unlikely (and you give good reasons why), if you wanted to verify could you measure the mean fluorescence intensity of an individual cell? (i.e. take an image under the microscope and measure the mean gray value of the individual cells using an image processing software like ImageJ/FIJI. A mean gray value of 0 is black/no fluorescence signal and 255 would be white/brightest fluorescent signal. It would be expected that the fluorescence of each cycle would be equal.)</p><p>4. Do you think the phenotypes are reversible? Genetics is discussed a lot, but there is a possibility that this is epigenetics-based.</p><p>Data Presentation:</p><p>1. In my opinion, there is a lot of great data visualization that is put in the supplementary figures that could be included in the main figures/table. Namely, I think including a version of Table S1 and S2, Figure S6/7, Figure S8/9 (as part of Figure 4), and Figure S10 (instead of the current Figure 3B) in the main manuscript would be helpful.</p><p>2. Figure 1 may benefit from including Figure S1 as the first panel. I think it might help the reader better understand the evolution schema. Figure S1 could also be labelled directly on the illustration to improve understanding. Figure 1 should also have a scale bar in the fluorescence microscope mage in Panel A.</p><p>3. The presentation of the linear mixed-effect model data on lines 95-101, 112-114, 137-139, 151-152, 172-177 is unclear and took a while to understand. It is not clear what the units are for these data, which would be important to know and better understand the results. Including the units and removing the formula and including that information in the methods it would help the clarity. Could you compare these counts in any other way such as averaging the values of the sexual and asexual groups instead at each cycle and do an ANOVA comparing to the control?</p><p>4. Connecting the dots of the average values over the cycles in Figure 2 would help illustrate the trends better.</p><p>5. Can you correlate the fungal virulence with the quantified phenotypes of the individual strains (Similar to Figure S6 and S7) using either % mortality, pathogenic potential (PP or PPT), or median survival time as measures? I think that maybe correlating virulence to a specific multicellular phenotype show if one, in particular, is responsible for the increased virulence (as mentioned in Line 328-332).</p><p>6. Similarly, have you looked at if the longer FLO11 genotype correlated with the virulence?</p><p>7. If space permits, for Figure 3, write &quot;high multicellularity&quot; and &quot;low multicellularity&quot; in the key instead of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; for better clarity.</p><p>8. In Figure 4, it might be easier to understand the X axis if instead of (a-d) it would be 1-4, and/or there was a key in the figure itself rather than just in the figure legend.

Furthermore Reviewers 1 and 2 had discussions among themselves and with me regarding what would constitute a successful revision and here is a distillation of that discussion, which is in addition to the Reviewer comments below.</p><p>– As noted by Reviewer it is very important to address the relationship to previous work on 'coincidental selection for virulence' and place your findings in that context.</p></disp-quote><p>We wholeheartedly agree with this criticism. Our previous literature search and review focused exclusively on the fungal literature, and was missing this important context. We had no intention of ignoring previous work and apologize for the omission. To the best of our ability, given the space constraints, we have updated the Introduction to include this hypothesis and the subsequent work testing it. We also expanded this section to include more review of the fungal literature, as it is comparable to that which we highlight from the bacterial literature. This review of the literature has even generated new ideas for our own research, and we are grateful for the urging of the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– You must address the concerns about how the virulence assays were conducted. For example, It was not clear to Reviewer 1 why the paper lacked a simple 'ancestor' versus 'evolved with beads' versus 'evolved without beads' comparison. The concern here is that pooling across generations and stratifying by a correlated phenotype could introduce biases that confound the question of phenotype under observation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a reasonable criticism and to be honest, one we struggled with when we were choosing the strains to assay for virulence. As noted in the paper, the evolution of hyper-multicellular strains was unexpected and surprising, and we were therefore focused on the effect of this trait (or suite of traits) on virulence. Hyper-multicellularity was only observed in populations evolved with a bead, and not in the ancestral clones or those evolved without a bead.</p><p>For the first genetic background that we assayed (YJM311), for the low-multicellular treatment, we exclusively chose ancestors and clones from populations evolved without beads (cycle 2 and cycle 8). The results from this design (or strain choice) would allow us to say that the virulence increased in populations evolved with beads (and was not due to evolution in the medium alone). When it came time to choose strains/clones from the second background (YJM128), for the low-multicellular treatment, we again chose a few ancestors, but were also interested in finding low-multicellular clones from populations evolved with a bead. This would allow us to say that clones evolved in the same conditions, but with different resulting multicellular phenotypes, had different patterns of virulence. As can be seen by the clones we chose, most of those strains came from earlier in the experiment (cycles 1 and 3). For the same reason, we also chose hyper-multicellular strains from a timepoint earlier than the last one (cycle 6). We were really trying to get at whether it was the hyper-multicellularity or evolution with a bead, but were limited to what phenotypes evolved at different timepoints in the experiment.</p><p>Given the number of larvae required to assay the virulence of each clone, we could not reasonably assay more strains than we did. For better or worse, we made the choices described above. In our first genetic background, we could in principle make the “simple” comparison of ancestor vs. evolved with bead, and ancestor vs. evolved without bead, but the number of strains in the different categories would be unequal. Instead, we choose to focus on the phenotype, which was what we were interested in.</p><p>To be completely transparent and for ease of understanding, we have labeled all the low multicellular survival curves in the figure (Figure 5), which should help the readers navigate the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There was concern about the pooling of the data. Although the unpooled data was in the supplemental data this should be on the main figures. Pooling is a problem because the isolates come from different cycles and conditions, and the readers should be able to see which are the ancestral/control and late-cycle experimental isolates. Showing that enhanced virulence phenotype is present in 10-12 of the hyper multicellular isolates makes their data stronger than showing them pooled as one.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have updated the figures to include the unpooled data. We have clearly labeled the individual curves and included images of the clonal phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The paper needs to do a better job in describing the selection of the 20 low hyper multicellular strains and the 20 high hyper multicellular strains and include the Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 in the main text. This could help the reader see which strains were used and also show that the low hyper multicellular strains are generally control or ancestral isolates. They might also be able to write which strain is which in the virulence graph keys.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done our best to comply with this request (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please know that I will be sending this paper back to the reviewers if a revised version is submitted to eLife. Hence, I encourage you to address all the issues raised by the review. Personally, I think this is a very interesting paper and I hope that it can be revised such that it would be acceptable to the journal. The comments/criticisms are extensive but if addressed will result in a much stronger paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the encouragement and hope the revised version is acceptable.</p><p>Below we respond to the suggestions from each reviewer, focusing on the ones that were not included in the summary above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, I found this paper very interesting, and I think the experiments were thorough and well-designed, and I am very impressed with the volume of the G. mellonella infections. It is amazing how much the yeast changed after the 8/9 cycles of selection for adhesion to plastic. I think the paper does a good job describing the multicellular (and hyper-multicellular) phenotypes that arose from the adhesion to plastic. I also found it interesting that the PSH evolved independently of plastic adhesion and was likely due to nutrient deprivation in the media. Below are some suggested edits and changes you could make to the presentation of the data that could help effectively show the massive amount of work done.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1. How many of the bead-adhering cells get removed during the sonication and washing process? Are there strongly adherent cells remaining? If so, would you then be selecting for medium-plastic rather than strong adherence?</p></disp-quote><p>We haven’t investigated this systematically. We have occasionally looked at the beads under the microscope to verify that the cells have been removed. It is certainly possible that after long-term selection, there could be cells that adhere so strongly that sonication does not remove them and they would not be included in the inoculum for the next generation. At this point, we have no evidence for that occurring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Have you looked at the cell surface hydrophobicity of some of these strains? A MATH assay (Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbon) is relatively straightforward to try, although it might be fickle and highly variable if the baseline hydrophobicity is low. I would expect the plastic-selected ones to have higher hydrophobicity which is sometimes associated with enhanced virulence.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion and one we may use for future research, as we are very interesting in the evolved multicellular changes. But in our opinion, this is out of the scope of the current manuscript, as it doesn’t directly address the idea of virulence evolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 114: you mention the possibility of fluorescence evolution over time. Although it seems unlikely (and you give good reasons why), if you wanted to verify could you measure the mean fluorescence intensity of an individual cell? (i.e. take an image under the microscope and measure the mean gray value of the individual cells using an image processing software like ImageJ/FIJI. A mean gray value of 0 is black/no fluorescence signal and 255 would be white/brightest fluorescent signal. It would be expected that the fluorescence of each cycle would be equal.)</p></disp-quote><p>This is also an interesting suggestion, but since the plastic adherence assays show the expected patterns (increase over the cycles); thus, in our opinion, this extra assay is unlikely to contribute significantly to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Do you think the phenotypes are reversible? Genetics is discussed a lot, but there is a possibility that this is epigenetics-based.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is possible that there is an epigenetic component, we believe the majority of the phenotype is genetic. Given the abundance of evidence that there is a genetic basis for each of the traits assayed here (mapping studies, etc.) and the extensive amount of genetic variation in each clinical isolate (~40-50K heterozygous sites), it is reasonable to surmise that the sorting of this genetic variation is leading to the gradual evolution of increase in multicellularity throughout the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data Presentation:</p><p>1. In my opinion, there is a lot of great data visualization that is put in the supplementary figures that could be included in the main figures/table. Namely, I think including a version of Table S1 and S2, Figure S6/7, Figure S8/9 (as part of Figure 4), and Figure S10 (instead of the current Figure 3B) in the main manuscript would be helpful.</p><p>2. Figure 1 may benefit from including Figure S1 as the first panel. I think it might help the reader better understand the evolution schema. Figure S1 could also be labelled directly on the illustration to improve understanding. Figure 1 should also have a scale bar in the fluorescence microscope mage in Panel A.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the compliment and have taken the suggestion to update Figure 4 (now Figure 5) by including the data from Figure S10 and Table S1. For the other sets of supplementary figures, we intend to take advantage of the <italic>eLife</italic> format and link these supplementary figures to the main figures in the text. Specifically, when Figure 3 is viewed (the PCA), there will be links to Figures S6/7 to show the individual correlations. Similarly, when Figure 4 (FLO11 evolution) is viewed, there will hyperlinks to Figures S8/9. In this way, the supplementary figures will be viewed in the context in which they are discussed in the manuscript. This is also true for Figure 1 with a hyperlink to S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The presentation of the linear mixed-effect model data on lines 95-101, 112-114, 137-139, 151-152, 172-177 is unclear and took a while to understand. It is not clear what the units are for these data, which would be important to know and better understand the results. Including the units and removing the formula and including that information in the methods it would help the clarity. Could you compare these counts in any other way such as averaging the values of the sexual and asexual groups instead at each cycle and do an ANOVA comparing to the control?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the issue of interpreting the coefficients. We have updated the methods to clarify, and added language to the results when the linear model is first introduced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Connecting the dots of the average values over the cycles in Figure 2 would help illustrate the trends better.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken this suggestion and made this edit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can you correlate the fungal virulence with the quantified phenotypes of the individual strains (Similar to Figure S6 and S7) using either % mortality, pathogenic potential (PP or PPT), or median survival time as measures? I think that maybe correlating virulence to a specific multicellular phenotype show if one, in particular, is responsible for the increased virulence (as mentioned in Line 328-332).</p><p>6. Similarly, have you looked at if the longer FLO11 genotype correlated with the virulence?</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewer’s suggestion, we have analyzed the virulence data using a Cox survival analysis and extracted the hazard ratio for each strain. Not surprisingly, each of the multicellular phenotypes was correlated with this measure of virulence. The reason is that the two categories of strains were chosen to have either all or none of the multicellular phenotypes, and as noted in the manuscript, one category had a higher virulence than the other (i.e., high and low multicellularity). Thus, we cannot point to one particular phenotype as being responsible. <italic>FLO11</italic> was not correlated with virulence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. If space permits, for Figure 3, write &quot;high multicellularity&quot; and &quot;low multicellularity&quot; in the key instead of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; for better clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>The updated figure does not have the space, but the figure legend clarifies the groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 4, it might be easier to understand the X axis if instead of (a-d) it would be 1-4, and/or there was a key in the figure itself rather than just in the figure legend. I am also not sure if &quot;Cs&quot; is a typo or if I cannot find what the lowercase &quot;s&quot; stands for. I also think the data in Figure S8/9 is really interesting and would be nice to include in the main Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out; the legend has been updated to clarify the nomenclature. As noted above, Figures S8-9 will be hyperlinked to the figure in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General suggestions:</p><p>1.

We should have included this detail in the manuscript, and have since added text to the methods (lines 420-423). “Control populations were also grown in 10 ml of EM in a glass tube, but without the presence of a bead. Instead, 10 ul of culture were used to inoculate the next tube, which was approximately the same number of cells being transferred from bead adherence in the experimental populations at the start of the experiment.”</p><p>However, to be clear, we cannot guarantee that the number of cells being transferred was comparable throughout the entirety of the experiment. As experimental populations became more adherent, more cells would have been transferred, and as control populations adapted to the medium, more would have been transferred. This is often the case in microbial evolution experiments when passage is by volume. At the start of the experiment, bottlenecks from passaging are consistent among treatments, but may diverge among replicates as evolution proceeds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Sample pooling for virulence assays.</p><p>The authors provide an honest summary of their rationale for their experimental design, but little in the way of changes to the MS.

Even with a more specific, unambiguous set of criteria for strain selection, my previous concerns remain. By selecting the virulence assay on phenotypes (seemingly blind to passage time or treatment), we weaken the ability to directly assess the impact of different experimental treatments on evolutionary outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and respect the reviewer’s concern about the clones we selected for the virulence assay. As noted in the previous response, we cannot now change the clones we selected, so we are left with only one option, which is to be as transparent as possible. To that end, we previously updated Figure 5 to include details about the clones that were chosen. We have now also added text to the Methods to provide details about our selection logic and criteria (lines 481-495). Unfortunately, there is nothing more we can do to address this concern. We leave the ultimate fate of the manuscript in the hands of the reviewers and editors.</p><p>For the sake of total transparency, below we provide details about our process from our lab notes. As best we could, we sought to find clones that had none of the phenotypes in the low strains and all of the multicellular phenotypes in the high strains, and also came from various specified timepoints. This ended up being more of an art than a science, which we describe below, in part because PSH evolved independently from the other phenotypes. As a reminder, we first assayed YJM311, so we chose high strains from the end of the experiment and low strains from the control populations and ancestors. When we next assayed YJM128, we were interested in isolating hyper-multicellularity as a trait, so chose low and high strains from experimental populations throughout (as well as ancestors).</p><p>The process was as follows:</p><p>1) In order to avoid sampling the same clonal background twice, we aimed to choose only one clone from a replicate population at a given timepoint.</p><p>2) Since we were ultimately interested in hyper-multicellularity, we focused our initial selection criteria more on the phenotypes that appeared to be a correlated response than on plastic adherence itself (evolved populations from later timepoints would not have survived the experiment if they were not adhering). We knew from the PCA results that CCM (complex colony morphology) strongly correlated with flor formation and plastic adherence, and PSH was evolving independently from the other phenotypes. We therefore used CCM for the first step in the screen, as colony morphology was a clear, visible phenotype with high replicability among replicate plates. Thus, for low strains, we sought smooth colonies and for high strains, we sought highly complex colony morphology (and when possible, seemingly different architectures).</p><p>3) Low Strains:</p><p>For the low strains, we aimed to find clones that had none of the multicellular phenotypes, or at the very least muted versions of them. For example, there were 20 ancestral clones from each genetic background; most of these had some form of PSH, CCM and plastic adherence. In YJM311, the ancestral clones had no flor formation, while in YJM128, they did. So for the ancestral clones, we chose the ones with the lowest scores on the combination of the three phenotypes that existed in our panel, otherwise, we would have had no ancestral clones.</p><p>For the other low strains, we began by screening the CCM plates for the smoothest colonies in the timepoints/treatments we were interested in. For YJM311, which was the first genetic background we conducted virulence assays for, we looked only for clones from control populations (early and late in the experiment). After finding the smoothest colonies from different replicates, we looked at the scores on PSH and flor formation. It was often not possible to have everything in the later timepoints: sometimes for the lowest CCM, there was slight PSH or flor formation (e.g., C7s-8-8). We therefore also looked for the lowest PSH scores, and then investigated the CCM and flor scores (e.g., C7a-8-6).</p><p>For YJM128, we attempted to get low strains from experimental populations. The procedure was similar: visibly scan the CCM plates for smoothness to begin the process, then investigate the other phenotypes. It turned out that low strains were not available later in the experiment.</p><p>4) High Strains</p><p>For the high strains, we aimed to get clones that had multiple, ideally all, of the multicellular phenotypes. We began by scanning the CCM plates for complex colony morphology (and when possible, different morphological architectures). We then investigated flor scores, plastic adherence and PSH of these clones. We were trying to balance finding clones with abilities in all phenotypes, not just the most extreme version of a single one.</p><p>For YJM 311, we were only interested in the last time point and were able to find clones from different replicate lines. In this genetic background, PSH decreased over the experiment, so we had to find clones with high CCM, PSH ability that was as least as strong as the average ancestral ability, and some flor formation.</p><p>In YJM 128, we were interested in obtaining clones from throughout the experiment; we followed a similar procedure. We began by screening CCM, then the other phenotypes. The one exception was (A8a-9-8), which had very high PSH and flor formation, but medium CCM.</p><p>After choosing the clones of interest, all strains were re-assayed to verify the scores they received in the high throughput assays.</p><p>To be clear, we stated that we used PCA results as a guide because these results gave us the insight of which traits were correlated, but it does not mean (nor did we mean to suggest) that we used the six clones with top scores on the first two PCs. We have updated the language in the manuscript. It is important to note that when looking at the PCA plot, PSH is antagonistic with the other multicellular phenotypes. Thus, the reasons we couldn’t just simply choose the most extreme points on the plot are: (1) these points do not necessarily exhibit all of the phenotypes of interest (because of the uncoupling of PSH and the others), (2) they may not have been from the correct treatment/timepoint, and (3) we were only selecting one clone from each replicate/timepoint and clones from a replicate/timepoint tended to cluster (see the supplemental figures for Figure 3).</p><p>We hope this explanation lends transparency to our process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. FLO gene length typing is a blunt instrument.</p><p>The authors agree, they have sequence data but are holding it back for another paper. The current data provides very little insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic differences reported.</p></disp-quote><p>This manuscript is focused on the evolution of phenotypes and not molecular mechanisms. It is true that we have sequenced the replicate populations at multiple time points; however, there are ~50K SNPs being sorted in the sexual populations, and single clones fixing in the asexual populations (that differ by many SNPs, many of which likely have nothing to do with selection for plastic adherence). We are working through these messy data and have not uncovered an obvious candidate gene(s) responsible for the observed phenotypes. In fact, our QTL-mapping approach is yielding more fruitful genetic results for following up on potential alleles. We can assure the reviewer that if we had an exciting insight into the molecular mechanism, we would include it in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, the MS is improved, and it provides useful data that will benefit the field.
