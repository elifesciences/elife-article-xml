may help understand the characteristic immunopathology of tuberculosis. We performed targeted metabolomic analyses in a large cohort of patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM), the most severe manifestation of tuberculosis, focusing on tryptophan metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 1069 Indonesian and Vietnamese adults with TBM (26.6% HIV-positive), 54 non-infectious controls, 50 with bacterial meningitis, and 60 with cryptococcal meningitis. Tryptophan and downstream metabolites were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma using targeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Individual metabolite levels were associated with survival, clinical parameters, CSF bacterial load and 92 CSF inflammatory proteins.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>CSF tryptophan was associated with 60-day mortality from TBM (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–1.24, for each doubling in CSF tryptophan) both in HIV-negative and -positive patients. CSF tryptophan concentrations did not correlate with CSF bacterial load nor CSF inflammation but were negatively correlated with CSF interferon-gamma concentrations. Unlike tryptophan, CSF concentrations of an intercorrelating cluster of downstream kynurenine metabolites did not predict mortality. These CSF kynurenine metabolites did however correlate with CSF inflammation and markers of blood–CSF leakage, and plasma kynurenine predicted death (HR 1.54, 95% CI = 1.22–1.93). These findings were mostly specific for TBM, although high CSF tryptophan was also associated with mortality from cryptococcal meningitis.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TBM patients with a high baseline CSF tryptophan or high systemic (plasma) kynurenine are at increased risk of death.

Patients suffer from varying degrees of intracerebral inflammation, commonly manifest as leptomeningitis, vasculitis, and space-occupying brain lesions (tuberculomas). Hydrocephalus, stroke, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and loss of consciousness are common complications and lead to death in around 30% of patients, even when treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs and adjuvant corticosteroid therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dodd et al., 2021</xref>). Development of more effective host-directed therapy is hampered by a lack of knowledge on the biological pathways involved in the immunopathology of TBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Metabolism is critical for the function of immune cells, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites could help unravel underlying biological mechanisms in TBM. Previously, using a large-scale metabolomics analysis, we found that lower CSF tryptophan concentrations were associated with survival of TBM patients in Indonesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">van Laarhoven et al., 2018</xref>). This study did not include HIV-infected patients and the association was not validated in other populations. Moreover, there is a need to investigate the downstream metabolites in the kynurenine pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), through which 95% of tryptophan is initially catabolized via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and which includes metabolites with putative neuroprotective (e.g. kynurenic acid) or neurodamaging (e.g. quinolinic acid) properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lovelace et al., 2017</xref>).

TBM patients were defined as having ‘definite TBM’ if they had either microbial confirmation by Ziehl–Neelsen staining, positive CSF culture, or GeneXpert. Based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">van Laarhoven et al., 2017</xref>), probable TBM was defined as clinically suspected TBM fulfilling at least two out of the following three criteria: CSF leukocytes ≥5 cells/μl, CSF/blood glucose ratio &lt;0.5, and CSF protein &gt;0.45 g/l. Patients were treated with antibiotics according to national guidelines for 180 days minimally, and received adjunctive dexamethasone starting at 0·3 mg/kg for grade I and 0·4 mg/kg for grade II or III TBM and tapered thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Thwaites et al., 2004</xref>). Patients were followed-up clinically or by phone up until day 180 from admission. Primary outcome was 60-day survival, when most deaths attributable to TBM occur. As a secondary endpoint, earlier and later mortality were explored separately. We ensured equal power for both time windows by separating them by the median time to death for those patients who died during the total follow-up of 180 days. The median time to death was 14 days and was used as the cut-off to differentiate early (days 0–14) from late (days 14–180) mortality. Patients without an infection (non-infectious controls) were included from the same sites. In Indonesia, patients in this group had undergone a lumbar puncture for suspected central nervous system infection or subarachnoid bleeding, but infection was excluded by negative microscopy, GeneXpert and bacterial culture, and CSF leucocytes &lt;5 cells/μl and CSF/blood glucose ratio ≥0.5. In Vietnam, patients were included as controls if they had undergone a lumbar puncture, but an alternative, non-infectious, diagnosis was confirmed. In both sites, none of the non-infectious controls received anti-tuberculosis treatment.

CSF and plasma metabolites were measured using targeted a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS) method with a system comprised of a 1290 Infinity II U-HPLC coupled to an Agilent 6495 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA). Metabolites were extracted from plasma or CSF (10 µl) using 90 µl of acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid (74.9:24.9:0.2, vol/vol/vol) containing stable isotope-labeled internal standards (valine-d8, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; and phenylalanine-d8, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). The samples were centrifuged (10 min, 9000 × <italic>g</italic>, 4°C), and the supernatants were injected directly onto a 150 × 2 mm, 3 µm Atlantis HILIC column (Waters, Milford, MA). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250 µl/min with 5% mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water) for 0.5 min followed by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 10 min. Pairs of pooled samples generated using aliquots of all samples in the study were included every 20 samples correct for MS sensitivity drift and for quality control analyses. Sample stability over the 7-year study inclusion and 4-year storage time was checked by plotting metabolite levels of definite TBM patients against storage time. Tryptophan metabolites were measured using the following multiple reaction monitoring transitions: 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (154.1 to &gt;136.0), 3-indoleacetic acid (176.1 to &gt;130.1), 3-methoxyanthranilate (168.1 to &gt;150.0), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (192.1 to &gt;146.0), 5-methoxytryptophol (192.1 to &gt;130.0), kynurenic acid (190.1 to &gt;144.1), kynurenine (209.1 to &gt;94.0), tryptophan (205.1 to &gt;187.9), <italic>N</italic>-acetylserotonin (219.1 to &gt;160.0), niacinamide (123.1 to &gt;80.1), quinolinic acid (168.0 to &gt;149.9), and xanthurenic acid (206.1 to &gt;132.0). Absolute concentrations were determined using external calibration curves created via serial dilution of stable isotope-labeled compounds in CSF and plasma. These compounds were sourced from Cambridge Isotope Labs: 3-indoleacetic acid-d7 (DLM-8040), anthranilic acid-<sup>13</sup>C6 (CLM-701), 5-HIAA-<sup>13</sup>C6 (CLM-9936), kynurenic acid-d5 (DLM-7374), <sc>L</sc>-kynurenine-d6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shop.isotope.com/productdetails.aspx?itemno=DLM-7842-PK">DLM-7842</ext-link>), <sc>L</sc>-tryptophan-<sup>13</sup>C11 (CLM-4290), and niacinamide-<sup>13</sup>C6 (CLM-9925).

In the current study, we confirm these observations in a much larger cohort of HIV-negative and -positive patients from both Vietnam and Indonesia. Aiming to understand how tryptophan metabolism is altered in TBM and how it might exert its effect on patient outcome, we correlated its concentrations with bacterial load and CSF inflammatory markers and measured downstream metabolites in both CSF and plasma. Our findings show that CSF concentrations of downstream kynurenine metabolites did not predict mortality, and that higher tryptophan levels were not associated with a higher bacterial load. Also, while kynurenine metabolites strongly correlated with CSF inflammatory markers and CSF protein, a marker of blood–CSF leakage, there was no association with CSF tryptophan. Tryptophan did however show a negative correlation with IFN-γ, important for immunity against mycobacteria. Collectively, these findings suggest that a process involving tryptophan metabolism affects outcome from TBM. Given the lack of plasma tryptophan with outcome, this process may take place in the brain rather than systemically. It is potentially driven by IFN-γ but not associated with nonspecific inflammation, and independent from downstream tryptophan metabolism or bacterial replication. In contrast, kynurenine may affect outcome systemically by leakage across the blood–brain barrier.</p><p>CSF tryptophan increases with age in individuals without central nervous system infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hestad et al., 2017</xref>). Age is known to negatively impact outcome of TBM and in this study, higher age was associated with higher CSF tryptophan concentrations. All mortality analyses were therefore corrected for age, as well as sex and HIV status, and analysis was stratified for country because of the overall higher mortality in Indonesian compared to Vietnamese TBM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Thuong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">van Laarhoven et al., 2017</xref>). We further tested whether higher CSF tryptophan reflected a higher mycobacterial burden and refuted this hypothesis. For cryptococcal meningitis, no previous data on cerebral tryptophan metabolism were known. These patients follow a pattern similar to TBM, with low tryptophan and high kynurenine, and in a small number of cryptococcal meningitis patients, a high baseline CSF tryptophan predicted mortality, similar as for TBM.</p><p>Systemic tryptophan and kynurenine are transported into the brain over the large amino acid transporter <italic>LAT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boado et al., 1999</xref>). In a healthy brain, systemic and CSF kynurenine positively correlate, as do CSF concentrations of tryptophan and kynurenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hestad et al., 2017</xref>). In patients with cerebral inflammation, the correlation between CSF kynurenine and tryptophan can be lost, probably through increased catabolism through IDO upregulation, which also has been demonstrated in the brain parenchyma of deceased TBM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>). Although we found low CSF tryptophan and high CSF kynurenine in TBM compared to healthy controls, the two did not intercorrelate and moreover, the increase in CSF kynurenine was much larger than the decrease in CSF tryptophan and it is therefore unlikely that upregulation of IDO1 solely explains this which precludes catabolism as the sole explanation. This suggests that increased blood to central nervous system kynurenine transport as an additional mechanism to IDO1 upregulation. Endothelial cells and pericytes of the blood–brain barrier can upregulate tryptophan catabolism into kynurenine metabolites upon IFN-γ stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Owe-Young et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings corroborate this hypothesis because we find a negative correlation between CSF IFN-γ and CSF tryptophan in our patients.</p><p>We examined whether higher CSF tryptophan concentrations reflected higher concentrations of downstream kynurenine metabolites that may have neurotoxic (quinolinic acid) or lower levels of the metabolites that may have neuroprotective (kynurenic acid) properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lovelace et al., 2017</xref>) and refuted these hypotheses. Interestingly however, CSF kynurenine metabolites correlated with CSF cell counts and pro-inflammatory proteins, including TNF-α. Kynurenine is sensed by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is important for the upregulation of TNF among other pro-inflammatory cytokines in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Moura-Alves et al., 2014</xref>), in line with our CSF findings. The increased CSF kynurenine levels we found in TBM have been reported before in bacterial meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coutinho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sühs et al., 2019</xref>) and in cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Medana et al., 2003</xref>) and in plasma from pulmonary TB patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Weiner et al., 2018</xref>). Of interest, nicotinamide can inhibit <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth, and can compete with isoniazid for antimycobacterial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Murray, 2003</xref>). We did however not find a detrimental effect of a higher nicotinamide, possibly because of its complex biology, that is it can also be produced by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> when human dietary niacin intake is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adu-Gyamfi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Strengths of our study include the large numbers of clinically well-phenotyped patients from multiple independent study sites in Indonesia and Vietnam, including a significant proportion of HIV-positive patients. We moreover used a sensitive triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometry method specifically designed to accurately target the tryptophan metabolites. Absolute quantification of a subset of metabolites further facilitated interpretation. Due to differences in polarity of the downstream tryptophan metabolites, we could not measure the complete tryptophan pathway. The availability of CSF at baseline only, limits our ability to understand how changes in tryptophan metabolism influence mortality. And we infer our observations from lumbar CSF, which reflects biological processes from both the blood and the brain. The use of ventricular CSF could help establishing what processes in the brain parenchyma take place. Moreover, although the lower CSF tryptophan values in TBM patients compared to non-infectious controls, implies active tryptophan metabolism in TBM, definite claims can only be made in an interventional study. Therefore animal studies, preferably combined with live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mota et al., 2022</xref>), are warranted to see whether pharmacological induction of IDO1 (for instance with recombinant IFN-γ), or inhibitory tryptophan analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) should be priorities as adjuvant therapeutic candidates for future personalized trials.</p><p>In summary, we confirm the importance of CSF tryptophan to outcome from HIV-negative and -positive adults with TBM, independent from downstream kynurenine metabolism, bacterial load, and inflammation. We additionally show the potential importance of systemic kynurenine as a predictor of mortality. Better understanding of the metabolic pathways associated with TBM may lead to more targeted therapies, as adjuvant immunotherapy may modulate the aberrant metabolic pathways and thus improve outcome.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials availability</title><p>The clinical metadata and LC–MS data before pre-processing are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has received consulting fees from Scientific Board TTxD and is a scientific founder of TTxD, Lemba and BioTRIP.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Diederik van de Beek (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Modelling. The impact of baseline CSF and plasma metabolite levels on 60-day survival was tested in a Cox-regression model, adjusted for sex, age, and HIV. One of the research questions could be whether tryptophan concentrations and outcome in TBM is a defining factor for outcome or just simply a bystander effect of damage. To study this in a cohort with &gt;1000 TBM patient and 231 deaths, the authors might want to perform multiple regression analyses for 30-day survival, including baseline and clinical features presented in the baseline table. They could include tryptophan concentrations in categories depending on the distribution of values (i.e., quartiles) and perform multiple imputation for missing values. While the association of CSF tryptophan levels with mortality (high tryptophan levels associated with higher 60-day mortality) are an interesting finding, it is confusing to note that uninfected control subjects had much higher CSF tryptophan levels (Figure 3). Similar, trend to TB meningitis (i.e. higher mortality in those with higher tryptophan levels) were noted in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Finally, patients with bacterial meningitis also had much higher tryptophan levels but information on mortality is lacking. Therefore, it is likely that CSF tryptophan levels may not be the driver of mortality and more likely is an inflammatory biomarker in chronic forms of meningitis. This needs more detailed analysis and discussion.</p><p>2. Study power. Based on the previous findings and the number of patients in the cohorts, the authors could say something about the statistical power, i.e., what are changes that they are able to detect.</p><p>3. Early vs. late mortality. The association between tryptophan concentrations and outcome in TBM seems to be not only true for the early period (e.g., the first 14 days), but also for the late period. As suggested in the results (HIV+ vs HIV- patients; suppl table 1). Could the authors explain in more detail how these analyses were performed? It is difficult to understand how base-line metabolites have a strong effect on late outcome (i.e., at day 180). This might even point towards the hypothesis that found metabolites are not the causing factor of death but more just a bystander effect.</p><p>4.

Modelling. The impact of baseline CSF and plasma metabolite levels on 60-day survival was tested in a Cox-regression model, adjusted for sex, age, and HIV.

This needs more detailed analysis and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for commenting on the comparison with control patients, and on causality with mortality within the group of TBM patients.</p><p>First, on the comparison with controls patients. We think that the fact that TBM and cryptococcal patients had lower CSF tryptophan than non-infectious controls, points to active tryptophan metabolism (i.e. catabolism) in TBM cryptococcal meningitis, which apparently does not occur in bacterial meningitis patients, who had similar CSF tryptophan levels compared to non-infectious controls.</p><p>Then, regarding the multivariable analysis. All the current analyses are multivariable, including age, sex and HIV as covariates, and stratified for study site as the overall mortality is higher in Indonesia than Vietnam. We deliberated the inclusion of disease severity as another covariate in our analysis plan. We think that Glasgow Coma Scale is the most appropriate proxy for disease severity because it predicts outcome in both our cohorts and because of its more granular ordinal scale (3-15) compared to TBM grade (1-3). Tryptophan did not correlate to GCS in the previous paper (van Laarhoven et al., <italic>Lancet Infectious Diseases</italic> 2018). For the analysis plan for the current study, we considered the following options for disease severity (i.e. GCS):</p><p>GCS as an intermediate between tryptophan and outcome.</p><p>GCS being an independent predictor for outcome.</p><p>GCS driving mortality, with tryptophan as an intermediate.</p><p>We argued that:</p><p>In case 1, adding it to a multivariable model would be problematic because of multicollinearity.</p><p>In case 2. adding GCS would not change the result.</p><p>Case 3 we thought unlikely, because of the lack of correlation in our previous analysis.</p><p>That said, in the current study, GCS had a very week negative correlation with tryptophan (r = -.08), i.e. patients with severe disease (lower GCS, worse outcome) had a slightly higher tryptophan (associated to worse outcome). We can therefore understand the reviewers concern, although the correlation is only weak. And because the correlation is only weak, multicollinearity is not much of a problem. We performed two additional multivariable models:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>including the pre-defined variables, and adding GCS.</p></list-item><list-item><p>including the pre-defined variables, and adding GCS and the other baseline variables.</p></list-item></list><p>We have added to the Results section (lines 211-217) “Because of weak negative correlation between tryptophan and GCS (r = -0.08) and to exclude the possibility that tryptophan is a marker of patients with more severe disease, we performed a post-hoc analysis with two additional models. These models included the basic pre-defined variables (age, sex, HIV as covariates, study site as stratum). Adding GCS did not substantially change the effect size (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.23), and adding GCS and CSF cell counts, CSF protein and glucose ratio did neither (1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.22) confirming that tryptophan was associated to mortality independent of the aforementioned parameters.”</p><p>We have also added a sentence at the end of the discussion (lines 355-357) referring to the above and acknowledging that with the current data we cannot infer a definite causation.</p><p>“The lower CSF tryptophan values in TBM patients compared to non-infectious controls, implies active tryptophan metabolism in TBM. Combined with an improved survival in TBM patients with the lowest CSF tryptophan, this could imply that in TBM an active tryptophan metabolism is beneficial. Interventional studies will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Study power. Based on the previous findings and the number of patients in the cohorts, the authors could say something about the statistical power, i.e., what are changes that they are able to detect.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a power calculation before the study (as part of the grant application): “We based the sample size calculation on the variance for tryptophan metabolites with neuromodulating effect (kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and quinolinic acid) in the original discovery cohort (n = 32). Applying strict Bonferroni-correction for the total number of tryptophan metabolites measured, 96-213 events (non-survivors) are needed in each group for adequate power. For HIV-uninfected patients (estimated 33% mortality), this equals to maximum 800 patients and for HIV-infected patients (estimated 50% mortality) to 600 patients for the least discriminating metabolite.“ (ULTIMATE grant proposal).”</p><p>In the final analysis plan, because of the similar metabolite levels between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected metabolites, we decided to incorporate HIV-status as covariate, rather than a stratum, to ensure enough power for this confirmatory study.</p><p>We have added the change in data analysis (lines 173-175) to improve power by incorporating HIV-status in our analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Early vs. late mortality. The association between tryptophan concentrations and outcome in TBM seems to be not only true for the early period (e.g., the first 14 days), but also for the late period. As suggested in the results (HIV = vs HIV- patients; suppl table 1). Could the authors explain in more detail how these analyses were performed? It is difficult to understand how base-line metabolites have a strong effect on late outcome (i.e., at day 180). This might even point towards the hypothesis that found metabolites are not the causing factor of death but more just a bystander effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the finding that baseline CSF tryptophan levels predict later mortality is intriguing. However, we know that events occurring early in treatment (e.g. new infarcts or tuberculomas) have a significant effect on long term outcomes, and that intra-cerebral inflammation lasts for many months (as detected by persistent CSF abnormalities). TBM is slow to resolve, despite optimal therapy, which makes these observations less surprising.</p><p>First, with regard to the methods. For patients who died during the specified follow-up period (180 days), the median time to death was 14 days. This was used as the cut-off to differentiate early (day 0 – day 14) from late (day 14 – day 180) mortality. In the analysis for early mortality, 1069 patients entered the analysis of which 155 died. In the analysis for late mortality, the remaining patients entered the analysis, of whom 149 died. As the power of Cox regression is dependent on the number of events (deaths), this is equal for both time periods. The results in this analysis, with similar HRs of 1.14 and 1.17 for both time periods, indicate an ongoing increased hazard for mortality for patients with a high baseline CSF tryptophan. This is illustrated by the Kaplan Meier plots (best seen in Supplementary Figure 3) showing that the lines keep separating beyond the first 14 days. We can hypothesize that an intrinsic difference in tryptophan metabolism, that is shown at baseline, is important also for later mortality, but cannot point to the exact mechanism.</p><p>We have added more detail in the methods, lines 112-113.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Negative correlation between tryptophan and IFN. The authors state that they find a strong negative correlation between tryptophan and IFN.

In the multivariable model (including sex, age and HIV status) in this patient subset, the HR for tryptophan was 1.13 (0.99-1.29).
