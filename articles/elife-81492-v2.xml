environment due to variation in locomotor requirements. However, proximal and distal limb segments may evolve differently from one another, reflecting an anatomical gradient of functional specialization that has been suggested to be impacted by the timing of development. Here, we explore whether the temporal sequence of bone condensation predicts variation in the capacity of evolution to generate morphological diversity in proximal and distal forelimb segments across more than 600 species of mammals. Distal elements not only exhibit greater shape diversity, but also show stronger within-element integration and, on average, faster evolutionary responses than intermediate and upper limb segments. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that late developing distal bones display greater morphological variation than more proximal limb elements. However, the higher integration observed within the autopod deviates from such developmental predictions, suggesting that functional specialization plays an important role in driving within-element covariation. Proximal and distal limb segments also show different macroevolutionary patterns, albeit not showing a perfect proximo-distal gradient. The high disparity of the mammalian autopod, reported here, is consistent with the higher potential of development to generate variation in more distal limb structures, as well as functional specialization of the distal elements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mammalia</kwd><kwd>marsupialia</kwd><kwd>monotremata</kwd><kwd>placentalia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Integration</kwd><kwd>Macroevolution</kwd><kwd>Phenotypic variation</kwd><kwd>Autopod</kwd><kwd>Osteology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>204841/2018-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothier</surname><given-names>Priscila S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-STG-677774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benson</surname><given-names>Roger BJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The diversification of hand bones in mammals was much more dynamic than those of the proximal and intermediate forearm, involving higher morphological diversity, stronger integration, and greater evolutionary lability at distal structures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary origin of limbs sets the stage for the remarkable ecological diversity of Tetrapoda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shubin et al., 1997</xref>). From delicate wings to powerful excavating claws, from slender hooved legs to wide flattened flippers, limb formation is intrinsically integrated with and constrained by the determination of the tetrapod body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raff, 1996</xref>). The tetrapod limb is typically composed of three basic components: the proximal stylopod (upper arm and thigh), the intermediate zeugopod (lower arm and calf), and the distal autopod (hand and foot). The proximal to distal organization of segments is correlated with their respective evolutionary appearance, the stylopod being the first structure to evolve, later followed by the zeugopod, and finally the autopod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shubin et al., 1997</xref>). Although the three-segment pattern is conserved among quadruped tetrapods, the morphology of these structures along the proximo-distal axis may evolve differently among groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sears et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Limbs are often studied for their exceptional morphological and ecological diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grizante et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kohlsdorf et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ledbetter and Bonett, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rothier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rothier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stepanova and Womack, 2020</xref>). In mammals, for example, the forelimb is present in all species and is typically more variable than the hind limb, possibly due to its greater number of functional roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmidt and Fischer, 2009</xref>). The meristic composition of tetrapod forelimb segments varies along the proximo-distal limb axis, where the autopod exhibits most of the diversity in terms of the number and position of skeletal elements (i.e. fusion and loss of carpal and tarsal bones and alteration of the phalangeal formula; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamrick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saxena et al., 2017</xref>). Except for lineages that have undergone complete limb loss such as snakes and caecilians, the meristic composition of proximal segments is much more conserved than that of the autopod, displaying some but less frequent cases of element reduction and partial fusion of the zeugopod bones (observed in anurans, bats, manatees, horses, etc., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keeffe and Blackburn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sears et al., 2007</xref>). Although this meristic information is useful to quantify major evolutionary changes in element composition, most of the morphological variation observed in the limbs results from changes in the shape and relative size of individual elements (i.e. variation of form) without changing the numbers of elements, and is often associated with functional adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Janis and Martín-Serra, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lungmus and Angielczyk, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sears et al., 2018</xref>).

Developmental mechanisms predict this pattern due to the timing and spatial structure of morphogenesis, which has been suggested to influence the macroevolutionary outcome of adult morphologies, including that of the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardua et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabre et al., 2020</xref>), the vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2022</xref>), and the limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holder, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stepanova and Womack, 2020</xref>). Each limb initiates as a bud that extends from the body wall and where skeletal elements are generally specified in a proximal to distal sequence that matches their evolutionary appearance during tetrapod origins: development begins with the stylopod, followed by the zeugopod, and terminating in the autopod at the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schneider and Shubin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shubin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stopper and Wagner, 2005</xref>). Limb development has been notably studied in mammals, revealing that different species have more similar forelimb morphology during early development, and become more disparate during later stages of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ross et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, gene expression of different mammal species is more conserved during early phases of limb development, compared to later phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maier et al., 2017</xref>), and these patterns might reflect the intrinsic temporal properties of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sears et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simplified scheme of the developmental sequence of limb condensation (<bold>A</bold>), indicating the bones analysed and the linear measurements obtained.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Humerus in anterior (right) and lateral (left) view: (1) length, (2) proximal width, (3) mid-shaft width, (4) distal width, and (5) height.

Indeed, early developmental processes mediating the initial specification of structures are generally more constrained than those governing later events, such as organ specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalinka and Tomancak, 2012</xref>). Therefore, because limb development proceeds proximo-to-distally, developmental perturbations at later phases may tend to accumulate higher morphological variation in distal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallgrímsson et al., 2002</xref>). One way to investigate the levels of developmental and functional constraints on adult morphologies is by quantifying the phenotypic integration among traits, inferred from the covariation between structures. For example, because the fore and hind limbs are serially homologous, they share genetic and developmental processes that give rise to strong phenotypic integration between and within the limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruvinsky and Gibson-Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young and Hallgrímsson, 2005</xref>). In mammals, the correlation between homologous limb segments of the fore- and hind limbs (i.e. humerus with femur, radius with tibia, metacarpal with metatarsal) suggests that proximal segments are highly integrated to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallgrímsson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmidt and Fischer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young and Hallgrímsson, 2005</xref>). In contrast, the more distal elements of the hand and foot show more variable patterns of integration, which may reflect functional specialization and the accumulation of variation during later phases of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallgrímsson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rolian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young and Hallgrímsson, 2005</xref>). A consequence for limb diversification is that the patterns and pace of morphological evolution might not be the same between proximal and distal segments.</p><p>Here, we investigate the evolutionary patterns underlying the morphological diversification of mammalian forelimb segments along a proximal-to-distal axis, using a comprehensive data set of 638 species, capturing over 85% of Mammalia family-level diversity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We ask to what extent is the temporal structure of proximo-distal bone condensation consistent with the macroevolution of limb segment morphologies. Mammals are an ideal group to address this question given their exceptional morphological and ecological diversity, combined with a substantial literature on the functional variation and the evolutionary development of their limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grossnickle and Newham, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Howenstine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lungmus and Angielczyk, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sears et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weisbecker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weisbecker et al., 2008</xref>). We examined the diversification of limb skeletal elements by quantifying morphological diversity and integration using linear measurements of four forelimb bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). We also estimated the macroevolutionary patterns of these elements using multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods. First, we quantified the morphological diversity of each segment, testing the hypothesis that distal bones are morphologically more diverse than the proximal structures as is predicted by development. Next, we investigated whether the strength of within-element integration differs between proximal and distal limb elements. We predicted that proximal elements would be more integrated than distal ones, due to their earlier condensation during development. Finally, we inferred the macroevolutionary patterns for bones belonging to all limb segments, predicting positive associations between the temporal sequence of bone condensation and the capacity for evolution to generate morphological diversity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the evolutionary patterns observed in the form of proximal versus distal limb elements are investigated using a broad phylogenetic and ecological sample of mammals, essential to address these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphological diversity</title><p>Among the three different evolutionary models examined (Brownian motion, Early-Burst and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck), the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen, 1997</xref>) process is the one that better predicts the pattern of evolution for all bones measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). We inferred morphological diversity for each bone using the determinant and the trace of the original dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref>) and of simulated trait matrices. Determinants and traces of matrices offer different but complementary generalized metrics to describe the variation of multidimensional data. The matrix trace provides information about the accumulated trait variance, whereas the determinant provides information about the volume occupied by the multivariate data. Both show similar patterns, in which morphological variation increases along the proximo-distal axis, consistent with the timing of limb condensation during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

The stationary variance, referred here as evolutionary lability, represents the expected variation when the OU process is at equilibrium (i.e. around the optimum): the higher the stationary variances, the greater – or more labile – is the phenotypic change around the trait optimum (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gearty et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weaver and Grossnickle, 2020</xref>). The stationary variances are significantly higher for distal elements compared to proximal ones.

There are no significant differences in the stationary variances at which the humerus and the radius evolve, these values being significantly lower than those of the two autopodial elements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, whereas these results are in line with the predictions of the developmental hypothesis in showing greater evolutionary lability in the distal elements, they do not support the idea of a proximo-distal gradient of increasing stationary variances.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The remarkable diversity of limb morphologies seen in mammals reflects the rich ecological and functional diversity that has evolved in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>). However, such outstanding morphological variation does not evolve uniformly among segments. Based on linear measurements of limb bones we show a general pattern of morphological diversity in Mammalia in which distal elements such as phalanges and metacarpals are in general more disparate and show greater evolutionary lability, as indicated by our measures of stationary variance, than more proximal elements such as the humerus and radius. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the among-species diversity of limb element morphologies is predicted by the timing of element condensation during development. Conversely, developmental constraints imposed by early versus late morphogenesis do not seem to determine differences in within-bone integration; we found that the latest-condensing elements of the hand are more integrated than the earlier-condensing humerus and radius. We hypothesize that the degree of functional specialization across segments might play a role on the levels of within-element integration, with the autopod potentially being more specialized and therefore exhibiting greater integration. We further show that distal elements evolve, on average, with greater stationary variances (i.e. faster) than the proximal limb elements.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limb segments: a proximal to distal gradient of increasing diversity</title><p>Previous studies have described the exceptional meristic variation in the autopod in contrast with the proximal and intermediate limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holder, 1983</xref>). Here, we confirm that such diversity is also detected in the form of hand bones. A pattern of increased morphological diversity along the proximal-distal limb axis is consistent with the prediction that lower proximal diversity might have been driven by developmental canalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallgrímsson et al., 2002</xref>). A similar pattern has been previously documented for anurans, in a study that compared shape variation of the humerus and the radioulna of the forelimb, as well as the femur, the tibiofibula, and the tarsus of the hind limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stepanova and Womack, 2020</xref>). Although this study did not include the digital elements of the hand (metacarpals and phalanges), it showed that late developing distal structures are not only more diverse but also evolve faster than the most proximal elements belonging to the stylopod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stepanova and Womack, 2020</xref>). Microhabitat use also explains more shape variation in the distal elements compared to the most proximal limb bones, suggesting that functional specialization evolves differently along the proximo-distal limb axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stepanova and Womack, 2020</xref>). Combined with our results, these findings provide evidence that the proximal-distal gradient of variation in limb structures may consist of an early conserved pattern shared across tetrapods, supporting the hypothesis that the timing of development affects the intrinsic capacity of an organism to generate variation and facilitate subsequent functional diversification.</p><p>Functional variation is often a good predictor of the pattern of morphological variation of limb bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grossnickle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weaver and Grossnickle, 2020</xref>). The autopod is the structure that interacts directly with the surrounding environment, performing important activities such as providing support to the body during locomotion and, in some cases, digging, handling food, grooming, and mediating social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biewener and Patek, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mc Grew et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naghizadeh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sustaita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weisbecker and Warton, 2006</xref>). Our results corroborate the idea that the hand bones are subjected to more dynamic selective pressures that ultimately favour greater diversity and evolutionary lability compared to proximal segments. However, few studies have quantified the functional relationships driving autopod variation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almécija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rolian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weisbecker and Schmid, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weisbecker and Warton, 2006</xref>). As the number of digits, and the number of phalanges in each digit, varies within most groups of tetrapods, including mammals, autopodial morphology is difficult to quantify in a comparable, homologous way among species. Although our data support this association, we do not explicitly test for the relationship between the variation observed in each bone and its degree of functional specialization. Further investigations are needed to quantify the impact of these parameters on limb diversification and need to set up a priori testable hypotheses.</p><p>To our knowledge, our study comprises the most comprehensive taxonomic dataset on the forearm morphology of mammals. The use of linear measurements succeeded at establishing comparable topological distances and provided a robust overview for the global morphological diversity between limb segments across the mammalian tree of life. However, this method imposes some limitations on capturing detailed local shape variation. For example, the proximal joint at the humerus can encompass complex surfaces which determine the mobility of the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Martorell, 2019</xref>; Veeger and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Veeger and van der Helm, 2007</xref>), but variation therein is not captured by our measurements. Likewise, the shape and size of the deltopectoral crest of the humerus may display considerable interspecific variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hopkins and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Samuels and Van Valkenburgh, 2008</xref>), and is also not quantified here. Similar structures are not present at the joints or at the longitudinal surfaces of the phalanges. Thus, it is not clear whether adding such morphological features would have resulted in an increase of morphological diversity in proximal bones compared to the distal ones. Either way, previous studies that have incorporated complex geometric surfaces of the long bones detected that the robustness (i.e., the correlation of length and thickness) is one of the principal factors contributing to the pattern of morphological variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Michaud et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with our results.</p><p>Having the zeugopod solely represented by the radius might as well have obscured some of the diversity present in the intermediate limb segment. The ulna is highly variable, with the olecranon particularly being a strong predictor of locomotor habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lungmus and Angielczyk, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milne and Granatosky, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Samuels and Van Valkenburgh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Valkenburgh, 1987</xref>). However, due to the high variation of the ulna, the topological distances used to describe the skeletal morphology (length, width, and height) cannot be applied to this bone in all species as the ulna is distally reduced or fused to the radius in many taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sears et al., 2007</xref>), thus preventing us from quantifying the diversity between this and other limb bones. We encourage future studies to include the ulna and to use geometric morphometrics of the joints to complement our findings with detailed information on shape variation across limb segments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional predictors of bone integration</title><p>The high integration detected in the mammalian hand suggests that developmental constraints of early versus late bone condensation do not predict within-element covariation. These findings do not imply that development is unimportant for the individual integration of elements. Yet, in the matter of relative bone integration, the timing of condensation is unable predict which elements are the most and the least integrated. The proximal and distal humeral joints perform different functions and allow very different movements: the proximal head connects the limb to the pectoral girdle at the shoulder through a complex ball-and-socket articulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Martorell, 2019</xref>; Veeger and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Veeger and van der Helm, 2007</xref>), and it distally articulates with the ulna and the radius at the elbow driving forelimb mobility and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre et al., 2014</xref>). The radial joints are also involved in different functions, having a proximal head connected to the elbow and an enlarged distal extremity articulated at the wrist with carpals and sometimes the ulna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLeod and Rose, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>). Because they are involved in different functions, the articular surfaces of long bones are differently impacted by functional specialization related to locomotor habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lungmus and Angielczyk, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacLeod and Rose, 1993</xref>). In terms of within-element integration, the different functional demands at the proximal and distal bone extremities might encompass a reduction of covariation between these traits, as detected here for the humerus and the radius. The metacarpal and the phalangeal articulations, on the other hand, work more similarly: phalanges articulate with the metacarpals at a bi-axial-joint (movement at two axes: flexion/extension, abduction/adduction) and articulate with each other at hinge joints which allow only one axis of movement (flexion and extension; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Napier and Tuttle, 1993</xref>). The strong integration of hand bones detected for mammals indicates that these elements experience a highly correlated evolution, which in this case might also emerge from functional similarity and interdependence at the articulations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Integration and evolutionary lability</title><p>The relationship between integration and morphological variation is not always consistent among traits and taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felice et al., 2018</xref>). Whereas some studies have shown clear positive associations between high integration and phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabre et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabre et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Randau and Goswami, 2017</xref>), negative associations have been also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felice and Goswami, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goswami and Polly, 2010</xref>). We find no evidence for a strong correspondence of integration with morphological diversity in proximal forelimb segments: the radius exhibits greater diversity of form than the humerus but presents the weakest values of integration among the bones measured. For the distal elements, however, our results show that the highly integrated autopod, especially the phalanx, also corresponds to the most diverse structure of the limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These differences might reflect how selection interacts with the intrinsic and extrinsic constraints on variation. Though integration may constrain the evolution of the phenotype to a limited portion of morphospace, it may also promote variation by driving the evolution of these traits in response to selection for functional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goswami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hansen and Houle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lande, 1979</xref>). Such dynamics appear to be observed in the distal elements: high integration in the phalanx and metacarpus, possibly favoured the evolution of functionally specialized autopod structures, contributes to the high variation observed in mammalian hand bones. Future studies will benefit from including extinct taxa to understand how morphological diversity and integration of limb bones evolved in deep time. Such analyses would further provide insights into whether these patterns are consistent between major taxonomic and ecological groups and through time and would provide information on when they first appeared during mammalian evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolutionary lability of the autopodal elements: functional associations</title><p>The autopodial bones evolve, on average, with greater stationary variances around their optima than the stylopod and the zeugopod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although the developmental hypothesis predicted that the fastest evolving structures would belong to the late-condensed distal limb, evolutionary lability do not increase in a perfect proximal-to-distal pattern, and the third metacarpal is the structure with the highest stationary variances, followed by the phalanx. These findings suggest that functional selection (resulting from the direct impact of autopodial structures on locomotor performance) combined with the higher potential of development to generate variation in the morphology of more distal limb elements, facilitated the evolution of high autopodial disparity in response to varying environmental demands across mammals. Although this subject remains largely unexplored, some studies provide cues about the possible association of function with the evolutionary lability of the autopod morphology in tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ledbetter and Bonett, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rolian, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Notable transformations in the metacarpal and phalangeal morphology are observed in cursorial taxa that present specializations allowing for endurance running, typically involving the elongation of the distal limb in relation to proximal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>). These transformations may explain part of the results observed in our study. For example, morphological adaptations to cursoriality mostly encompass the modification of autopod posture to digitigrady (animals that stand on the distal ends of metapodials and middle phalanges, such as cats and dogs) and unguligrady (animals that stand on their hooved distal-most phalanx, such as horses and cows; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clifford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang, 1993</xref>). Digitigrady is observed in many carnivorans providing limb elongation and thus increasing stride length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang, 1993</xref>). Extant horses exhibit one of the most dramatic modifications of the third metapodial and phalanges among all unguligrade taxa: the limb is uniquely supported by the third toe, which is considerably enlarged and elongated, whilst the lateral fingers are markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McHorse et al., 2019</xref>). One recent study suggested that the evolutionary transitions in foot and hand postures are associated with strong selection for rapid changes in increasing body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kubo et al., 2019</xref>). Although a digital posture presumably implies morphofunctional specialization of the distal limb, it is not clear if the acceleration of body mass evolution during autopod posture transitions has also affected the rates of morphological change of the hand and foot. Autopodial specialisations are also evident among smaller-sized mammals. For example, body size is positively associated with the tempo of evolution of postcranial morphology (hand and foot bones included) in both ground and tree dwelling animals, where medium-sized animals tend to exhibit higher stationary variances than small-sized species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weaver and Grossnickle, 2020</xref>). Overall, these examples suggest that functional specializations related to the locomotion and size likely played a role in driving the morphological evolution of the limb, potentially driving the accelerated evolution of hand bone morphology. Further investigations are needed to better understand the associations of body size and functional variation with the evolutionary dynamics of limb diversification.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study uses a macroevolutionary framework to compare, for the first time, the general patterns of form diversification of proximal and distal limb elements in mammals. Our results reveal that the evolution of the mammalian forelimb involves different patterns of morphological diversification when comparing limb segments along a proximal–distal gradient. We detected that the diversification of autopodial elements was much more dynamic than that of the zeugopod and stylopod, involving higher morphological diversity, stronger integration, and greater evolutionary lability at distal structures. Specifically, we corroborate the premise that the late-condensing distal elements such as metacarpals and phalanges (in the autopod) exhibit higher morphological diversity than early-condensing, more proximal, elements. This pattern might emerge from different levels of constraints during the developmental succession. Yet, no proximo-distal gradient in stationary variance was observed. Furthermore, such temporal constraints of development do not explain the patterns of limb evolution alone, as functional specializations also play an important role on the diversification of the forelimb. Particularly, the strong integration of the autopodial elements most likely reflects the functional similarity and interdependence between joints in response to functional demands. We highlight the importance of considering variation induced by development to understand the macroevolutionary outcome of adult morphologies, and we hope that these results will contribute to better understand the association of limb segment variation and ecological diversity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Taxonomic sampling and data acquisition</title><p>We sampled 638 species of mammals (670 specimens), representing 598 genera of 138 living families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We complemented this dataset with measurements provided by caliper of 261 medium to large body-sized species from the mammal collection of the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris, France; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We measured 20 linear distances from anterior limb bones, including the humerus, the radius, the third metacarpal and the first phalanx of digit III. We acquired five measurements for each element: length, widths (proximal, mid-shaft and distal) and height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, see detailed description in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). We opted not to include the ulna because this bone is fused to the radius in many taxa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sears et al., 2007</xref>), preventing the acquisition of such measurements. The metacarpal and first phalanx of digit III were sampled because this is the only digit present in the hands of all mammalian lineages, even in groups that exhibit digit loss or fusion with other autopodial elements, such as in golden moles and ungulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clifford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McHorse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prothero, 2009</xref>). Each individual was measured twice with the subsequent calculation of the mean and standard error in order to verify measurement error. The error estimate was most often below 1.5% regardless of an animal’s size and the measurement method, demonstrating consistency and repeatability of the methods employed. Body mass values were rarely available for the individuals measured, so we assembled the average species body mass of adults from the PanTHERIA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2009</xref>) and complemented by literature sources when necessary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When species level was not identified, we used the mean body mass available for the genus. Species taxonomy followed the Mammal Diversity Database published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgin et al., 2018</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Comparative analyses</title><p>Analyses were implemented in R 4.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">R Core Team, 2021</xref>). We used the phangorn R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schliep, 2011</xref>) to estimate a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from a posterior sample of 10,000 trees published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Upham et al., 2019</xref>. Because the incorporation of some species was available only at the genus level, we pruned the MCC tree to genus level, according to the taxa sampled by our study, and calculated the genus mean per trait whenever we had more than one specimen measured per genus.</p><p>Allometry generally explains most of morphological variation, as body parts usually grow together, masking variation mediated by local development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marroig, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raff, 1996</xref>). Because we are particularly interested in understanding morphological constraints imposed by the local development of the limb, we decided to remove the allometric component of our dataset in order to reduce variation associated with other sources of development. We could not retrieve the individual body masses for most of the species included, so we calculated geometric means as a proxy for body size by including values of the individuals themselves and the average species body mass. First, we transformed body mass into linear scale by taking the cube root prior to log10-transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harmon et al., 2010</xref>). We calculated the geometric means of all measurements acquired, including the linear scaled body mass, and then we fitted the log10-transformed trait means in a phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS) using the geometric means as a predictor. We grouped the traits by bone and fitted the linear models for each skeletal unit with mvgls() function from mvMORPH R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clavel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clavel et al., 2015</xref>). We calculated the fit of three models of evolution using LASSO penalization: Brownian Motion (BM), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU), and Early Burst (EB). We compared the likelihood of the model fits with Generalized Information Criterion (GIC) to establish which model provided the best fit.</p><p>The OU model of evolution had the best fit for all the linear regressions accounting for the geometric means using the MCC tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). To evaluate whether using the species average value (and not the individual body mass) would bias the results, we performed supplemental PGLS removing the average body mass from the geometric means. The results between bones remained the same (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c and d</xref>), so we maintained the body mass in the geometric means for the downstream analyses. We used a parametric bootstrap approach to assess the uncertainty around point estimates for morphological diversity and integration. We first simulated 100 datasets for each bone on MCC tree using the OU process fit (that is, the best fit model on our original data) with parameters estimates from the empirical regression (function mvSIM() from mvMORPH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clavel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clavel et al., 2019</xref>). The model (the body size PGLS under an OU process) was then fit to these 100 simulated traits, and the distribution of parameters estimates obtained was used to assess the variability around the point estimate (for the determinant, the trace, and the measure of integration) obtained on empirical data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Morphological diversity and phenotypic integration</title><p>Morphological diversity for each bone was interpreted as the values of the determinant and the trace of simulated matrices. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the trait covariance matrix, that is, the sum of individual traits variance (sum(diag()), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">R Core Team, 2021</xref>). The determinant is a scalar measure that summarize the information contained in a square matrix (det(), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">R Core Team, 2021</xref>). For a covariance matrix, it corresponds to a generalized measure of variance, because contrary to the trace, the determinant account for the correlations/covariances between the traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rencher, 2002</xref>). We scaled the determinants by transforming their absolute value to the power of one divided by five, which is the number of dimensions of each matrix (i.e. the number of measurements). Differences in the determinant and trace between skeletal elements were evaluated by ANOVA followed by Tukey Tests (function TukeyHSD() from stats R package) of the 95% confidence interval (CI).</p><p>We calculated the magnitude of integration for each bone separately, based on eigenvalue dispersion in their respective matrices. We transformed the simulated covariance matrices into correlation matrices and provided integration values as the standard deviation of eigenvalues relative to their theoretical maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pavlicev et al., 2009</xref>). We calculated the integration as the dispersion of the standard deviation of eigenvalues of our trait matrices, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pavlicev et al., 2009</xref>. For instance, highly integrated traits have most of the independent variance concentrated in the first few eigenvalues, while uncorrelated traits have the variance similarly distributed between eigenvalues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pavlicev et al., 2009</xref>). Eigenvalue dispersion was inferred from CalcEigenVar() function of evolqg R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machado et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melo et al., 2015</xref>), which calculates the relative eigenvalue variance of the matrix as a ratio between the observed variance and the theoretical maximum for a matrix of the same size and trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machado et al., 2019</xref>). Differences between distributions were computed by an ANOVA and detailed by Tukey Tests of the 95% CI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Macroevolutionary patterns</title><p>Finally, we were interested in estimating the tempo of evolution of each bone. To assess variability due to the tree topology and branching times uncertainties, we replicated the body mass linear regressions with 100 randomly sampled trees from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Upham et al., 2019</xref>. We fitted these linear regressions under an OU process and estimated the average rates of evolution (σ<sup>2</sup>) per bone. Under a Brownian motion process, the tempo of evolution can be directly inferred from the σ<sup>2</sup>, which represents the total variance of traits changes linearly, as a function of the traits covariances matrix and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harmon, 2019</xref>). In an OU process, however, traits evolve towards an optimum θ with an attraction α. The main difference between BM and OU, is that the trait variance changes with time in BM, while it is not related to time in OU when stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hunt, 2012</xref>). Assuming that time was long enough in an OU process (so that the process is stationary, e.g., reached the optimum), its covariance matrix, equivalent to a BM matrix of traits variance and covariance, depends only on the parameters σ<sup>2</sup> and α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hunt, 2012</xref>). A comparable rate metric for traits evolving under OU process is then the stationary variance (σ<sup>2</sup>/2α), representing the variance of traits distribution per evolutionary steps (or the variance of traits when lineages were given enough time to reach their optima and the process is in equilibrium; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hunt, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we calculated the mean stationary variance of bones from the matrices fitted under OU process (function stationary() from mvMORPH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clavel et al., 2015</xref>). We compared their distributions using ANOVA followed by a 95% confidence interval Tukey Test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Source code</title><p>Data and codes will be made available on Dryad Digital Repository upon to manuscript publication.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Analyzed specimens, indicating taxonomy, institutional identification, method of morphometric acquisition, MorphoSource ID and associated projects (when applicable) and body mass (grams, from PanTHERIA or indicated literature).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81492-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Trait description and model fit.</title><p>(a) Linear measurements obtained for each specimen extracted either by landmark positioning in 3D digital models or by direct caliper measurements (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David M. Grossnickle (Reviewer #2); Francois Gould (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers make sensible requests for major revisions to the article, mostly concerning the need to include essential information that is missing from the methods and discussion, and to give more serious consideration to other (functional, allometric) explanations for the patterns that are presented. Since most of the suggested revisions are text-based rather than data/methods-based, it should be straightforward to address them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Although the authors tempered their claims around decisive support for developmental constraints as the sole driver of limb morphological diversity, the abstract conclusion still overstates the results. The line &quot;suggesting that strong functional selection, combined with the higher potential of development to generate variation in more distal limb structures, facilitate the evolution of high autopodial disparity in mammals&quot; overstates the conclusions that can be drawn from these data. We can't be sure that stronger functional selection does not solely generate the variation in distal limb structures. Nor can we be sure the pattern is not simply a result of the differing developmental potential for variation. The combination of stronger functional selection with the higher potential of development to generate variation is a really interesting hypothesis but it is not necessarily suggested by the data. These are simply possible explanations for the patterns described in the paper.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The introduction primarily cites and discusses mammalian limb studies, despite the relevance of the suggested findings beyond mammals and forelimbs. Furthermore, relevant work exists in other tetrapod clades and structures related to evolutionary rates of later-developing traits and proximo-distal variation.</p><p>Results:</p><p>When explaining stationary variances you state &quot;which represents the expected variation when the process is in equilibrium and summarizes the relative influence of stochastic factors in evolution&quot;. It would be really helpful to explicitly say how this measure summarizes the relative influence of stochastic factors by stating something like &quot;a lower stationary variance value means X whereas a higher stationary variance means Y&quot;.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>Line 235: rephrase &quot;or both in combination therefore&quot;.</p><p>Line 327: space needed before citation &quot;species(Weaver and Grossnickle, 2020)&quot;</p><p>Finally, although the evolutionary patterns here are interesting there is a missed opportunity with this extensive sampling to test for effects of ecology, locomotion, and/or digit number variation on the patterns observed. This would have provided more clear evidence (or lack of) for some of the suggestions in the discussion.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Although all bones can be relatively scaled, do you think differences among bones in their original size and shape, and thus, differences among bones in the ultimate spacing of the landmarks, could affect the variation in shape seen among structures? Specifically, a smaller, wider bone when scaled equally to a long thin bone might create really different potentials for measured shape change when you think about how those landmarks will vary across different bone shapes in each case. If this influences the analysis/results, it could be a confounding factor since the bones get smaller from proximal to distal.</p><p>I found it a bit confusing how the size was accounted for in these analyses. The size was the mean mass for the genera from a database? Not from the specimens themselves? Would somehow using the size of the bones themselves provide a better proxy for the body size of the actual animal measured?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 1: In the title and main text you use the phrase &quot;evolutionary versatility.&quot; I like it, but it's also a little vague, so it'd help if you provide your definition of &quot;evolutionary versatility&quot; somewhere in the text. You have the phrase in parentheses after &quot;stationary variance&quot; in Figure 3E, which implies that it's mostly referring to the stationary variance results, but this isn't clear in the text unless I missed an explanation. Also, you could consider replacing &quot;evolutionary versatility&quot; with the term &quot;evolvability,&quot; if you think they're synonymous (e.g., see Love et al. 2021 Paleobiology, and a couple of your references that have &quot;evolvability&quot; in their titles). On a broader note, you often mention &quot;constraints,&quot; but you might consider putting greater emphasis on the 'evolutionary versatility (or evolvability) of the distal elements' rather than the 'constraints on proximal elements.' Constraints are often inferred from the lack of something (negative evidence), but it's hard to tell whether it's truly constraints that have led to the lack of some morphologies.

The line &quot;suggesting that strong functional selection, combined with the higher potential of development to generate variation in more distal limb structures, facilitate the evolution of high autopodial disparity in mammals&quot; overstates the conclusions that can be drawn from these data. We can't be sure that stronger functional selection does not solely generate the variation in distal limb structures. Nor can we be sure the pattern is not simply a result of the differing developmental potential for variation. The combination of stronger functional selection with the higher potential of development to generate variation is a really interesting hypothesis but it is not necessarily suggested by the data. These are simply possible explanations for the patterns described in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the recommendation, so we changed the sentence to emphasize that our results are consistent with the developmental hypothesis without excluding other potential drivers of variation: “High disparity of the mammalian autopod, reported here, is consistent with the higher potential of development to generate variation in more distal limb structures, as well as other possible drivers such as functional adaptation.” (lines 39-41).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>The introduction primarily cites and discusses mammalian limb studies, despite the relevance of the suggested findings beyond mammals and forelimbs.

We interpreted the tempo of evolution of traits considering the mean stationary variance (σ<sup>2</sup>/2α) of each bone, which is a measure of rate under the OU process (Hunt, 2012).

In the present study we tested the idea that timing of development may be an important driver of variation in the mammalian limb, irrespective of variation in locomotor style or habitat use.

Specifically, a smaller, wider bone when scaled equally to a long thin bone might create really different potentials for measured shape change when you think about how those landmarks will vary across different bone shapes in each case. If this influences the analysis/results, it could be a confounding factor since the bones get smaller from proximal to distal.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the concern. However, in comparing the variation between bones, we did not scale all structures to the same size. Each linear measurement obtained was corrected by body size (calculated as the geometric means of body mass plus all the measurements), implying that bone proportions were maintained along the proximo-distal axis. In fact, the traits that vary the most are the metacarpal and the phalanx lengths (variances per measurement illustrated in the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), and not the smallest distance values such as heights and widths, showing that variation in relative bone proportion is driving the diversity of the autopod.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81492-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Animals having small body sizes – and consequently the smallest bones – were measured digitally, so we were able to zoom to visualize distal bones, avoiding measurement errors due to scale. So landmark spacing is ‘controlled for' by the resolution of the images for smaller specimens. Because we measured each specimen twice, we were able to calculate the standard error of each distance acquired, and we detected that measurement error is similar for all distances. In fact, the landmarks chosen to describe the morphology of the metacarpal and the phalanx are easily identified across species (as described in Appendix 2-table 1 and Figure 2), and they also exhibit high repeatability when taking the standard errors into consideration. In larger animals, measured by caliper, the structures were easy to manipulate and did not show high error measurements after comparing the duplicates. For example, the percentage of the standard error obtained from the duplicates for one of the smallest animals studied, the shrew <italic>Sorex cinereus</italic> (average weight 4.2g) was just of 0.05% for the humerus length (5.67 ± 0.003 mm) and 0.75% for the phalanx length (1.34 ± 0.010 mm). Similar error proportions were also obtained for larger animals: the humpback whale (<italic>Megaptera novaeangliae</italic>, 33 tons average weight) had 1.74% error for the humerus (323.18 ± 5.64 mm) and 0.13% for the phalanx length (186.765 ± 0.245 mm), and the Asian elephant (<italic>Elephas maximus</italic>, 3.3 tons) presented 0.43% error of humerus length (700.78 ± 3.03 mm) and 1.13% of phalanx length (59.26 ± 0.68 mm).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found it a bit confusing how the size was accounted for in these analyses.

Size was calculated as the geometric means of : (1) the linear-scaled body mass taken from PanTheria (from a database, as pointed by the reviewer, and not from the specimen itself since this information is unfortunately not available for most of the individuals in museum collections), or other sources of literature, and (2) the linear measurements of the specimens themselves. Most specimens were identified at the species-level, so the body mass value used corresponded to the species’ taxonomy. Whenever the classification was available only for the genus but not for the species, we calculated the genus average body mass and used this value to calculate the geometric means. Tips were identified on the phylogeny at the genus level as most of the genera were represented by a single species. Those represented by more than one species had their trait means calculated and used in the downstream analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 1: In the title and main text you use the phrase &quot;evolutionary versatility.&quot; I like it, but it's also a little vague, so it'd help if you provide your definition of &quot;evolutionary versatility&quot; somewhere in the text. You have the phrase in parentheses after &quot;stationary variance&quot; in Figure 3E, which implies that it's mostly referring to the stationary variance results, but this isn't clear in the text unless I missed an explanation. Also, you could consider replacing &quot;evolutionary versatility&quot; with the term &quot;evolvability,&quot; if you think they're synonymous (e.g., see Love et al. 2021 Paleobiology, and a couple of your references that have &quot;evolvability&quot; in their titles). On a broader note, you often mention &quot;constraints,&quot; but you might consider putting greater emphasis on the 'evolutionary versatility (or evolvability) of the distal elements' rather than the 'constraints on proximal elements.' Constraints are often inferred from the lack of something (negative evidence), but it's hard to tell whether it's truly constraints that have led to the lack of some morphologies. See Salazar-Ciudad (2021 Biol.

We rephrased the title to “Mammalian forelimb evolution is driven by a gradient of increasing proximal-to-distal morphological diversity”, removing the mention of “evolutionary versatility”. In the main text, we modified it to “lability”. As pointed out by Love et al. (2021), the term “evolvability” carries different connotations depending on the field of study. The term is traditionally used in the quantitative genetics to refer to the ability of a population to evolve towards the direction of selection (see Wagner and Altenberg 1996 <italic>Evol.</italic>; Hansen and Houle 2008 <italic>J.

Because our study is at a macroevolutionary scale, and not at the population level, we preferred not to use the term “evolvability” to avoid misinterpretation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 35: You may want to explicitly state that &quot;more integrated&quot; refers to more within-element integration.

We did estimate the empirical values, and then we simulated the 100 datasets incorporating the parameter estimates from the best fit model on the original data (i.e., an OU process). We did not include the empirical results in the last manuscript version because we showed the distributions of the simulated data instead, but we recognize the importance to include these values for comparison. Therefore, in the distribution represented at Figure 3 (i.e., the 100 simulated results for each bone), we additionally included reference lines indicating these empirical values. These values are indicated for the trace, determinant, and integration, and they are now also available in the SI (Appendix 2 – table 3). For the stationary variances, however, the reference line indicates the median of the regressions, and not the empirical value from the MCC tree, using 100 random trees from Upham et al. (2019).

The rationale for using multiple specimens to represent a single species precisely considered the species diversity per family, in addition to the availability of individuals in the collections and at online repositories. For example, the only living species representing the family Ornithorhynchidae is the platypus <italic>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</italic>, and we have measured two individuals of this species to improve the morphological characterization for this taxon. We considered that in groups we were able to sample many species, the taxon diversity was satisfactorily described, and we did not include additional individuals because of the time required to provide the measurements (specifically considering that all morphological data was gathered by a single researcher). The same reasoning was applied to other groups with few species, as Procaviidae (3 genera), Orycteropodidae (1 species), Dugongidae (one living species), etc. However, for some other families also represented by few species (for example Elephantidae, Tarsipedidae, etc.), we were not able to find additional specimens with the required skeletal elements to be included in our dataset. We also randomly added a second specimen to some few species belonging to diverse groups (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, Muridae and <italic>Glossophaga soricina</italic>, Phyllostomidae) because of their abundance in online repositories thus allowing to assess the within-species variation more broadly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
