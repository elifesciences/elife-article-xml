Here, we report a novel protein-DNA binding screening pipeline, termed Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE), that can systematically predict protein binding partners and DNA motif spacing preferences. Using SPICE, we successfully identified known composite elements, such as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs) and STAT5 tetramers, and also uncovered several novel binding partners, including JUN-IKZF1 composite elements. One such novel interaction was identified at CNS9, an upstream conserved noncoding region in the human <italic>IL10</italic> gene, which harbors a non-canonical IKZF1 binding site. We confirmed the cooperative binding of JUN and IKZF1 and showed that the activity of an <italic>IL10</italic>-luciferase reporter construct in primary B and T cells depended on both this site and the AP1 binding site within this composite element. Overall, our findings reveal an unappreciated global association of IKZF1 and AP1 and establish SPICE as a valuable new pipeline for predicting novel transcription binding complexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Protein-DNA</kwd><kwd>IKZF1</kwd><kwd>SPICE</kwd><kwd>JUN</kwd><kwd>AP1</kwd><kwd>IL-21</kwd><kwd>IL-10</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z99 HL999999</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational pipeline SPICE systematically screens and predicts novel protein-protein binding complexes including the previously unrecognized global association and functional cooperation between IKZF1 and AP1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome-wide studies exploring cooperative interactions of transcription factors (TFs), histone modifications, and higher-order chromatin conformation are critical for systematically evaluating gene expression mechanisms. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been employed to map genome-wide DNA binding proteins of interest, advancing our understanding of genomics and epigenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roberson et al., 2007</xref>), with important discoveries related to disease-associated transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deardorff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izumi et al., 2015</xref>), tissue-specificity of epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>), and chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutani et al., 2015</xref>). To extract biologically relevant information from ChIP-seq data, many computational tools, such as Model-based Analysis for ChIP-seq (MACS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), MUltiScale enrIchment Calling for ChIP-seq (MUSIC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harmanci et al., 2014</xref>), and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Algorithm (ZINBA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rashid et al., 2011</xref>), have been developed to understand transcription factor cooperation and interactions. Genomic regions that are significantly enriched represent candidates for protein/DNA-binding sites that can be used to predict binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Machanick and Bailey, 2011</xref>), and ChIP-seq analysis can be integrated with other types of genomic assays, including RNA-seq gene expression profiling and long-distance chromatin interaction analyses to elucidate mechanisms of genomic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2017</xref>) and gene ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McLean et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, given a set of identified ChIP-seq peaks, motif enrichment analysis tools such as MEME, STREME, TF-COMB, MCOT, and TACO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Machanick and Bailey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levitsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jankowski et al., 2014</xref>) can de novo discover the motif(s) corresponding to the TF’s DNA binding domain. When binding to genomic DNA, some TFs may cooperatively bind and physically interact with specific partner TFs, and there often is preferred spacing between their binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karczewski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Little, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jolma et al., 2015</xref>). These cooperative interactions at composite elements are critical for the transcriptional regulation of genes and are used by cells to integrate diverse signals and potently drive transcription even at low concentrations of transcription factors. However, few computational tools to date can predict composite elements and their optimal spacing using transcription factor ChIP-seq data. SpaMo (space motif analysis) in MEME suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>) can infer interactions between a pair of specific TFs at near sites on the DNA sequence, however, it cannot systematically predict TF-TF composite elements genome-wide. We present a novel computational pipeline denoted ‘SPICE,’ which can predict genome-wide novel composite elements for pairs of transcription factors and their optimal motif spacing. SPICE is both versatile and efficient, capable of utilizing any ChIP-seq dataset to generate predictions that can be experimentally validated to confirm cooperative binding and its effects on gene expression. Our findings show that SPICE accurately predicts known binding partners and composite motifs, and in this study we demonstrate genome-wide JUN-IKZF1 interactions. SPICE is broadly applicable and serves as a powerful tool for uncovering a range of new transcription factor interactions and elucidating mechanisms underlying gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SPICE pipeline predicts known and novel protein complexes</title><p>The SPICE schematic pipeline is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and detailed in the Methods. First, we aligned the sequenced reads from ChIP-seq datasets to the reference genome and identified significant transcription factor binding sites (peaks) using MACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Second, we performed de novo motif analysis, designating the most enriched motif among the identified peaks as the primary motif. We retained only the peaks containing this primary motif and excluded sequences without matches. Third, we loaded secondary motifs using motif databases such as HOCOMOCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kulakovskiy et al., 2018</xref>), centered the primary motifs, and scanned for secondary motifs within 500 bp of the primary motif, focusing on the enrichment of known transcription factor DNA-binding motifs. Finally, we sorted the significant secondary motifs and their spacing, grouping redundant ones together. To visualize their interactions, we created heatmaps showing the interaction matrices of the primary and secondary motifs (see illustrative schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, where each red square indicates a predicted composite element containing the motifs at the corresponding primary and secondary motifs on the x- and y-axis, respectively). Based on the distance from the primary to the secondary motif, we displayed the spacing distributions as bar graphs highlighting the most significant spacing preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To validate the predictive accuracy of SPICE, we used our previously published IRF4 ChIP-seq data in mouse pre-activated T cells to see if we could de novo re-discover AP-1/IRF4 composite elements (AICE, 5′-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3′)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2012b</xref>). Indeed, SPICE successfully predicted these elements, including optimal spacing between AP1 and IRF4 as 0 or 4 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2012b</xref>), thus validating the pipeline. Furthermore, SPICE successfully predicted STAT5 tetramerization with an optimal spacing of 11–12 bps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4 also have been reported to form tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vinkemeier et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang and Darnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vinkemeier et al., 1998</xref>), and indeed SPICE de novo predicted that these STATs also can form tetramers, whereas STAT2 was not predicted to form tetramers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), consistent with the lack of reports of such formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE) predicts known and novel composite elements and spacing preferences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic step-by-step flowchart of the SPICE pipeline to predict transcription factor composite elements and their spacing preferences (see Methods for details).

We evaluated the performance of SPICE using ENCODE ChIP-seq libraries from Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) generated by ENCODE/Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (SYUH), which comprise a total of 343 libraries in 20 different cell lines, with K562 human erythroleukemia, GM12878 EBV-transformed B cell, and HeLa S3 human cervical carcinoma cell lines being heavily used to generate these libraries. For each selected TF ChIP-seq library that contains a primary motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, x-axis), we extracted 500 bp of DNA sequence centered on the primary motif and searched for 401 known human transcription factor binding motifs using the <bold><italic>H</italic></bold><italic><bold>o</bold>mo sapiens</italic> <bold>Co</bold>mprehensive <bold>Mo</bold>del <bold>Co</bold>llection database (HOCOMOCO, v11)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, y-axis), and generated a 343×401 spatial interaction matrix, in which each cell was assigned an E-value indicating the significance of primary-secondary motif pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The E-values were then log-transformed (-log10(E-value)) and shown as an interaction heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As is evident, most of the motif pairs were not significant, suggesting that transcription factor composite elements are relatively rare events; in addition, some interactions that exist in some cell types may not be observed if they are not present in the cell lines that were used to generate the ENCODE datasets. After applying a filtering criterion that only included motif pairs with an E-value &lt;1e<sup>–10</sup>, the resulting interaction matrix had dimensions of 118x205 and exhibited reduced spatial complexity. Very interestingly, we could immediately identify multiple potential TF-TF composite elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which include putative associations of JUN with STAT3 and IKZF1, of CEBPβ with E2F, KLF, and BACH family members, and a range of others including ZNF241/NF-κB, GATA1/NDF1, and CTCF/ETS. Importantly, an association of JUN with STAT3 has been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>) and a functional CTCF-ETS1 interaction was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pham et al., 2019</xref>), further validating the predictive power of SPICE. Regarding the CTCF-ETS association, SPICE successfully defined an optimal spacing of 8 bp for CTCF/ETS complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>), something that was not defined in the earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pham et al., 2019</xref>) and thereby further underscoring the robustness of our pipeline. Interestingly, some TFs show significant interactions with a wide range of partner factors. These TFs are studied as ‘Stripe’ transcription factors, or ‘universal stripe factors (USFs).’ Examples include members of the KLF, EGR, and ZBTB families, which recognize overlapping GC-rich sequences across all analyzed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Most IKZF1 binding sites co-localize with JUN</title><p>We decided to focus on the putative JUN-IKZF1 given that both JUN and IKZF1 play critical roles in immune cells but have not been reported to physically associate or functionally cooperate. IKZF1, also known as IKAROS, plays a vital role in the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mullighan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramírez et al., 2010</xref>) and is a regulator of immune cell development in early B cells and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nutt and Kee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kleinmann et al., 2008</xref>). JUN family factors are part of AP-1 complexes, forming homodimers or hetero-dimers with FOS family basic leucine zipper proteins and playing prominent roles in T cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riera-Sans and Behrens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carr et al., 2017</xref>). By ChIP-seq, IKZF1, and JUN extensively co-localized in the human cell line GM12878 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> left panel: binding intensity heatmap; right panel: co-localization Venn diagram), for example at multiple sites in the <italic>TNFRSF8</italic> and <italic>IL10</italic> loci. The <italic>IL10</italic> locus included a highly conserved CNS9 region (highlighted in a red box and labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), located approximately 9.1 kb upstream of the <italic>IL10</italic> promoter. Pairwise sequence alignment confirms the CNS9 region is highly conserved between humans and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). BATF, a FOS family member, is also bound at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), consistent with BATF’s ability to partner with JUN in AICEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2012b</xref>). To further characterize IKZF1-JUN complexes and validate their existence in vitro and in vivo, we performed ChIP-seq experiments with antibodies to IKZF1 and JUN in primary mouse B cells that were either untreated or treated with LPS or LPS + IL-21 for 3 hr. We used B cells given the importance of IKZF1 for B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sellars et al., 2011</xref>). When cells were stimulated with LPS + IL-21, we identified a total of 9197 and 14433 binding sites for IKZF1 and JUN, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The de novo motif analysis (HOMER) on the IKZF1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) indicated the most enriched motifs include ETS-like motif (ranks first) and EBF1-like motif (ranks second), which are comparable to the previously identified IKZF1 motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoshida and Georgopoulos, 2014</xref>), as well as an IRF-like motif (ranks third), etc., all of which ostensibly could be utilized by IKZF1 to bind to DNA. Strikingly, 8125 out of 9197 (88.3%) of IKZF1 peaks co-localized with JUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and the Reactome Pathway Analysis from the 8125 co-localized peaks suggested that the IKZF1-JUN complex might play broad biological roles as there were multiple enriched pathways, including ‘Cytokine Signaling in Immune System,’ ‘Signaling by Interleukins,’ TLR4-related cascades, and more. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). IKZF1 binding was induced when cells were treated with LPS or LPS + IL-21, while JUN binding was prominent only with LPS + IL-21 treatment. IKZF1 sites globally co-localized with JUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), including at known regulatory elements, for example at the <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Il10</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2012b</xref>), which are critical for plasma cell differentiation in IL-10-producing B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).

Importantly, besides IKZF1 and JUN binding, other pioneer factors might also play vital roles and contribute to biological function by opening chromatin, thus facilitating IKZF1 and JUN binding to DNA, an interesting area for future investigation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>JUN co-localizes with IKZF1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks identified for IKZF1 and JUN in experiments from primary mouse B cells that were treated with LPS + IL-21.

The WT competitor dramatically reduced the binding activity and the variant IKZF1 mutant competitor moderately reduced the intensity of the shift, whereas AP-1 mutant or IKZF1/AP-1 double mutant oligonucleotides had little if any effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). To determine whether IKZF1 and AP-1 proteins cooperatively bound to the CNS9 region, we used recombinant IKZF1 and cJUN/cFOS AP1 protein to perform EMSAs with wild-type and mutant IR700 probes corresponding to the <italic>IL10</italic> CNS9 site (data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). There is a second band with faster mobility beneath the prominent band in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (EMSA experiment with recombinant IKZF1 and JUN), which perhaps was bound by IKZF1 since its intensity weakened when the IKZF1 site was mutated and was absent when only JUN was added. With the wild-type probe, no binding activity was observed with IKZF1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref><bold>, lane 2</bold>), but binding occurred with AP-1 (<bold>lane 3</bold>), and stronger binding occurred when both IKZF1 and AP1 proteins were added (<bold>lane 4</bold>), suggesting cooperative binding of these factors. Binding was not detected to the AP-1 mutant probe (<bold>lane 8</bold>) and was lower with the variant IKZF1 mutant probe (<bold>lane 6</bold>), suggesting that the AP-1 site is absolutely required for the cooperative binding and that the putative variant IKZF1 site had low affinity in its own right but cooperated with the AP1 site to allow cooperative binding of the factors. Correspondingly, the activity of the WT <italic>IL10</italic> luciferase reporter was potently induced by LPS in primary B cells compared to vector but not when IKZF1, AP-1, or both motifs were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting both IKZF1 and AP-1 are important for transcriptional activation of this gene. However, since AP-1 comprises a group of homodimers or heterodimers of JUN/JUNB/BATF/FOS family members, the roles of the individual members remains uncertain, with the different members having potentially similar or even opposing actions. Besides B cells, IKZF1 has been shown to be a regulator of <italic>Il10</italic> gene expression in mouse T cells, in which <italic>Il10</italic> expression was significantly lower compared with wild-type T cells in response to TCR stimulation or during Th2 differentiation in <italic>Ikzf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Umetsu and Winandy, 2009</xref>).

Our pipeline is unique, and our findings are distinctive. SPICE systematically screens and predicts novel protein-protein binding complexes, including the newly discovered IKZF1-JUN composite element, yielding distinctive and valuable biological insights and validations. In this report, we utilized the SPICE pipeline to analyze the ENCODE database, successfully predicting both a range of known interactions and numerous novel interactions. Although newer and updated databases like ReMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hammal et al., 2022</xref>), which includes over 8000 ChIP-seq datasets, are available, our fundamental conclusion regarding the IKZF1-JUN composite element would not be altered even if a larger database were used. Here, we focused on JUN-IKZF composite elements, an association not previously demonstrated. ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that IKZF1 (Ikaros) co-localizes with JUN in a genome-wide manner, and that the major two motifs identified were canonical IKZF1 motifs, but that non-canonical variant motifs were also identified, including at the <italic>IL10</italic> gene locus. It is worth noting that because IKZF1 is closely related to IKZF2 (Helios) and IKZF3 (Aiolos), it is conceivable that one or both of these factors might also co-localize with JUN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Georgopoulos, 2017</xref>). Notably, an independent study that cited our ChIP-seq data reported in this study confirmed that IKZF1 and IKZF3 can directly bind to AP-1 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goh et al., 2024</xref>). In that study, the deletion of both <italic>Ikzf1</italic> and <italic>Ikzf3</italic> in NK cells led to a significant reduction in Jun/Fos expression and a complete loss of peripheral NK cells. This independent validation supports our findings and further suggests that IKZF1 and JUN can functionally cooperate. In our study, we could coprecipitate JUN with anti-IKZF1, and moreover, we found functional cooperation between IKZF1 and AP1 motifs. Specifically, we found that IKZF1 and JUN not only cooperatively bound to the CNS9 region in the <italic>IL10</italic> locus but that both IKZF1 and AP1 motifs were critical for transcriptional activity of a reporter construct in both B and T cells. While our primary focus was on the <italic>IL10</italic> locus, we also demonstrated genome-wide co-localization of these factors. Reactome pathway analysis associates the genes they co-localize with across various pathways, including, but not limited to, cytokine signaling pathways. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); Therefore, the physiological significance of transcription factor cooperation may be broad, potentially influencing various cellular functions and disease contexts. The discovery of JUN-IKZF1 complexes highlights the effectiveness of our computational approach and specifically of the SPICE pipeline in predicting novel transcription factors binding complexes and their optimal spacing. This provides a valuable new way to discover composite elements that contribute to a highly specific pattern of gene transcriptional regulation and to better understand gene regulatory networks involved in the immune responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>SPICE pipeline</title><p>All mapped files of TFBS were downloaded from ENCODE project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhTfbs/">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhTfbs/</ext-link>), from a collection of libraries generated by Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (SYUH).

The mapped outputs were converted to browser-extensible data files, which were then converted to binary tiled data files (TDFs) using IGVTools 2.4.13 for viewing on the IGV browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/</ext-link>). TDFs represent the average alignment or feature density for a specified 20 bps window size across the genome. Peak calling was performed by MACS 1.4.2 (8) relative to an IgG library as input control and the p-value threshold was set as 1e<sup>–10</sup>. Only non-redundant reads were analyzed for peak calling. ChIP-seq binding intensity heatmaps were analyzed and visualized using deepTools. ChIP-seq co-localization analysis was performed using the R package ‘ChIPseeker,’ and Reactome pathway analysis was performed using the R package ‘ClusterProfiler’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>is an employee of Amgen Inc</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE) can predict possible tetramers for STAT family member proteins.</title><p>SPICE is capable of identifying canonical STAT binding motifs, also known as interferon gamma-activated sequence (GAS) motifs, and then predicts STAT tetramer formation and the optimal spacing for tetramer formation for STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, and STAT5B, whereas STAT2 was predicted to not form tetramers.

The pipeline also predicts the optimal distance between the paired binding sites. The pipeline correctly predicted known/reported transcription factor cooperations, and also predicted new cooperations, not yet reported in literature. The authors choose to follow up on the predicted interaction between Ikaros and Jun. Using ChIP-seq in mouse B cells, they show extensive overlap in binding regions between Ikaros and Jun in LPS+IL21 stimulated cells. In a human B-lineage cell line (MINO) they show that anti-Ikaros Ab can co-immunoprecipitate Jun protein, and that the MINO cell extracts contain protein(s) that can bind to the CNS9 probe (conserved region upstream of IL10 gene), and that binding is lost upon mutation of two basepairs in the AP1 binding motif, and reduced upon mutation of two basepairs in the non-canonical Ikaros binding motif. Part of this protein complex is super-shifted with an anti-Jun antibody, and more DNA is shifted with addition of an anti-Ikaros antibody.</p><p>The authors perform EMSA showing that recombinant Jun can bind to the tested DNA-region (IL10 CNS9) and that addition of recombinant Ikaros (or anti-Ikaros antibody in Fig 3E) can enhance binding (increase amount of DNA shifted). The authors lastly show that the IL10 CNS9 DNA region can enhance transcription in B- and T-cells with a luciferase reporter assay, and that 2 bp mutation of the Ikaros or Jun DNA motifs greatly reduce or abolish this activity.</p><p>This is interesting work, with two main contributions: The SPICE pipeline (if made available to the scientific community), and the report of interaction between Ikaros and Jun. However, the distinction between DNA motifs, and the proteins actually binding and having a biological function, should be made clear consistently throughout the manuscript. The same DNA motifs can be bound by multiple factors, for instance within transcription factor families with highly homology in the DNA-binding regions of the proteins.</p><p>Some specific points:</p><p>SPICE: It is unclear if this is uploaded somewhere to be available to the scientific community.</p><p>It was unclear if Ikaros-Jun interaction was initially found from primary Jun ChIP-seq (and secondary Ikaros motif from HOCOMOCO) or from primary Ikaros CHIP-seq (and secondary Jun motif from HOCOMOCO). And - what were the two DNA motifs (primary and secondary, and their distance) from the SPICE analysis?</p><p>Authors have mostly careful considerations and statements. One additional comment is that binding does not equal function (Fig 2D), and that opening of chromatin (by any other factor(s)) can give DNA-binding factors (like Ikaros and Jun) the opportunity to bind, without functional consequence for the biological process studied.</p><p>Figure 2E: Ikaros is reported to be expressed at baseline in murine B cells, yet the Ikaros ChIP-seq in unstimulated cells had what looks to be no significant or low peaks. LPS stimulation induced strong Ikaros ChIP-seq signal. A western blot showing the Ikaros protein levels in the 3 conditions could help understand if the binding pattern is due to protein expression level induction. Similar for Jun (western in the 3 conditions), which seemed to mainly bind in the LPS+IL21 condition. Furthermore, as also suggested below, tracks showing Ikaros and Jun binding from all conditions (unstimulated, LPS only and LPS+IL21 stimulated cells), at select genomic loci, would be helpful in illustrating this difference in signal between the different cell conditions. This is relevant in regards to the point of cooperativity of binding.</p><p>ChIP-seq in mouse B cells showed that Ikaros bound strongly in LPS stimulated cells, in the (relative) absence of Jun binding (Fig. 2C). However, in EMSA (Fig 3C), there is no binding when the AP1 site is mutated, and the authors describe this as Ikaros binding site. What does the Ikaros binding look like at this genomic location in LPS (only) stimulated cells? The authors could show the same figure as in Fig 2F but show Ikaros and Jun ChIP-seq tracks at IL10 CNS9 locus from all conditions to compare binding in unstimulated, LPS and LPS+IL21 cells.</p><p>Also: How does this reconcile with the luciferase assay in Fig 4E, where LPS (only) stimulation is used, which in Fig 2E only/mainly induced Ikaros, and not Jun ChIP-seq signal (while EMSA indicate Ikaros cannot bind the site alone, but can enhance Jun-dependent binding).</p><p>Comment on statements in results section: The luciferase assays in B and T cells do not demonstrate the role of the proteins Ikaros or Jun directly (page 10, lines 208 and surrounding text). The assay measures an effect of the DNA sequences (implying binding of some transcription factor(s)), but does not identify which protein factors bind there.</p><p>Lastly, the authors only discuss Ikaros (using the term IKZF1 which is the gene symbol for the Ikaros protein). There are other Ikaros family members that have high homology and that are reported to bind similar DNA sequences (for instance Aiolos and Helios), which are expressed in B-cells and T-cells. A discussion of this is of relevance, as these are different proteins, although belonging to the same family (the Ikaros-family) of transcription factors. For instance, western for Aiolos and Helios will likely detect Aiolos in the B cells used, and Helios in the T cells used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88833.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The study is performed with old tool Spamo (12 year ago), source data from Encode (2010-2012), even peak caller tool version MACS is old ~ 2013.

They were able to recapitulate previously known composite elements, such as the AP-1/IRF4 composite elements (AICE) and predict many composite elements that are expected to be very useful to the community of researchers interested in dissecting the regulatory logic of mammalian enhancers and promoters. The authors then focus on a novel, SPICE predicted interaction between JUN and IKZF1, and show that under LPS and IL-21 treatment, JUN and IKZF1 in B cells have significant overlap in their genomic localization. Next, to know whether the two TFs physically interact, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. While JUN immunoprecipitated with an anti-IKZF1 antibody, curiously IKZF1 did not immunoprecipitate with an anti-JUN antibody. Finally, EMSA and luciferase experiments were performed to show that the two TFs bind cooperatively at an IL20 upstream probe.</p><p>Major strengths:</p><p>1.

Under LPS and IL-21 treatment, JUN and IKZF1 in B cells have significant overlap in their genomic localization.

The super-shift experiment to show that the proteins bound to their EMSA probe were indeed IKZF1 and JUN are not very convincing and would benefit from efforts to quantify the shift (Figure 3E). Nuclear extracts from cells with single or double CRISPR knock outs of the two TFs would have been ideal.</p><p>3. There is a second band beneath the more prominent band in the EMSA experiment with recombinant IKZF1 and JUN (Figure 4C). This second band is most probably bound by IKZF1 because it becomes weaker when the IKZF1 site is mutated and is completely absent when only JUN is added. This is completely ignored by the authors. Therefore, experiments with EMSA fail to convincingly show that IKZF1 and Jun bind cooperatively. They could just as well bind independently to the two sites.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88833.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pulugulla</surname><given-names>Sree</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Sonali</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Jangsuk</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Spolski</surname><given-names>Rosanne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jian-Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Leonard</surname><given-names>Warren J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors report a new bioinformatics pipeline (&quot;SPICE&quot;) to predict pairwise cooperative binding-sites based on input ChIP-seq data for transcription factor (TF)-of-interest, analyzed against DNA-binding sites (DNA motifs) in a database (HOCOMOCO).

The same DNA motifs can be bound by multiple factors, for instance within transcription factor families with highly homology in the DNA-binding regions of the proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has correctly assessed the content of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some specific points:</p><p>SPICE: It is unclear if this is uploaded somewhere to be available to the scientific community.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment.

One additional comment is that binding does not equal function (Fig 2D), and that opening of chromatin (by any other factor(s)) can give DNA-binding factors (like Ikaros and Jun) the opportunity to bind, without functional consequence for the biological process studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer believes our considerations and statement are careful. We agree that opening of chromatin can give the opportunity of factors to bind, and we now make this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2E: Ikaros is reported to be expressed at baseline in murine B cells, yet the Ikaros ChIP-seq in unstimulated cells had what looks to be no significant or low peaks. LPS stimulation induced strong Ikaros ChIP-seq signal. A western blot showing the Ikaros protein levels in the 3 conditions could help understand if the binding pattern is due to protein expression level induction. Similar for Jun (western in the 3 conditions), which seemed to mainly bind in the LPS+IL21 condition. Furthermore, as also suggested below, tracks showing Ikaros and Jun binding from all conditions (unstimulated, LPS only and LPS+IL21 stimulated cells), at select genomic loci, would be helpful in illustrating this difference in signal between the different cell conditions. This is relevant in regards to the point of cooperativity of binding.</p></disp-quote><p>The main point of the paper was showing functional cooperation and proximity of binding. However, the use of purified JUN and Ikaros protein suggest cooperative binding. Exhaustive evaluation of the JUN-Ikaros association is left for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ChIP-seq in mouse B cells showed that Ikaros bound strongly in LPS stimulated cells, in the (relative) absence of Jun binding (Fig. 2C). However, in EMSA (Fig 3C), there is no binding when the AP1 site is mutated, and the authors describe this as Ikaros binding site. What does the Ikaros binding look like at this genomic location in LPS (only) stimulated cells? The authors could show the same figure as in Fig 2F but show Ikaros and Jun ChIP-seq tracks at IL10 CNS9 locus from all conditions to compare binding in unstimulated, LPS and LPS+IL21 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now show Ikaros and Jun ChIP-seq tracks from unstimulated, LPS-treated, and LPS + IL21-treated cells. Both Ikaros and cJUN were bound to the Il10 upstream CNS9 region with LPS treatment of cells (see Author response image 1, highlighted in red box), but binding was weaker than that observed with LPS + IL21.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88833-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also: How does this reconcile with the luciferase assay in Fig 4E, where LPS (only) stimulation is used, which in Fig 2E only/mainly induced Ikaros, and not Jun ChIP-seq signal (while EMSA indicate Ikaros cannot bind the site alone, but can enhance Jun-dependent binding).</p></disp-quote><p>As shown above, in the LPS (only) condition, both IKZF1 (Ikaros) and cJUN bind to Il10 CNS9 locus. Thus, this is not in conflict with our luciferase assay data in Fig. 4E, which showed Ikaros is dependent on AP-1 binding. Moreover, the AP-1 site in Fig. 4D and 4E can be bound by other AP-1 factors as well, such as JUND, JUNB, BATF, etc. These points can be made in the manuscript. These factors potentially can compete with cJUN binding and their roles remain to be explored.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment on statements in results section: The luciferase assays in B and T cells do not demonstrate the role of the proteins Ikaros or Jun directly (page 10, lines 208 and surrounding text). The assay measures an effect of the DNA sequences (implying binding of some transcription factor(s)), but does not identify which protein factors bind there.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. It is reasonable and even likely that different family members may be partially redundant. This point is now made on our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the authors only discuss Ikaros (using the term IKZF1 which is the gene symbol for the Ikaros protein). There are other Ikaros family members that have high homology and that are reported to bind similar DNA sequences (for instance Aiolos and Helios), which are expressed in B-cells and T-cells. A discussion of this is of relevance, as these are different proteins, although belonging to the same family (the Ikaros-family) of transcription factors. For instance, western for Aiolos and Helios will likely detect Aiolos in the B cells used, and Helios in the T cells used.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. As requested, we now discuss the possibility that Aiolos or Helios may also contribute.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The study is performed with old tool Spamo (12 year ago), source data from Encode (2010-2012), even peak caller tool version MACS is old ~ 2013.

They were able to recapitulate previously known composite elements, such as the AP-1/IRF4 composite elements (AICE) and predict many composite elements that are expected to be very useful to the community of researchers interested in dissecting the regulatory logic of mammalian enhancers and promoters. The authors then focus on a novel, SPICE predicted interaction between JUN and IKZF1, and show that under LPS and IL-21 treatment, JUN and IKZF1 in B cells have significant overlap in their genomic localization. Next, to know whether the two TFs physically interact, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. While JUN immunoprecipitated with an anti-IKZF1 antibody, curiously IKZF1 did not immunoprecipitate with an anti-JUN antibody. Finally, EMSA and luciferase experiments were performed to show that the two TFs bind cooperatively at an IL20 upstream probe.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has described the basic results of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major strengths:</p><p>1.

We never intended to claim that we established a definite physical interaction. The coIP worked in one direction, but not reliably in the other, even though we have tried a total of four different antibodies. We now mention in the revised manuscript that we have tried the additional anti-JUN antibodies, cJun (60A8, CST) and JunD (D17G2, CST).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The super-shift experiment to show that the proteins bound to their EMSA probe were indeed IKZF1 and JUN are not very convincing and would benefit from efforts to quantify the shift (Figure 3E). Nuclear extracts from cells with single or double CRISPR knock outs of the two TFs would have been ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that using single or double knockouts would be helpful, but other Ikaros family or Jun family members could be involved, so such studies might not be definitive. That is why we used purified proteins to show apparent cooperative binding (Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There is a second band beneath the more prominent band in the EMSA experiment with recombinant IKZF1 and JUN (Figure 4C). This second band is most probably bound by IKZF1 because it becomes weaker when the IKZF1 site is mutated and is completely absent when only JUN is added. This is completely ignored by the authors. Therefore, experiments with EMSA fail to convincingly show that IKZF1 and Jun bind cooperatively. They could just as well bind independently to the two sites.</p></disp-quote><p>The second band has a faster mobility and might relate to IKZF1, although this is difficult to know. We comment on this band on revised manuscript. As noted above, the purified protein experiments do suggest cooperativity. However, our overall intent was to identify factors binding in proximity, which SPICE has successfully done, even if the binding was “independent”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
