Generally these bacteria co-exist with us peacefully, but sometimes certain bacteria may enter the body and cause infections, such as gum disease or a bone infection called osteomyelitis. Many of these infections are thought to occur when the bacteria become able to form complex communities called biofilms. Bacteria living in a biofilm cooperate and make lifestyle choices as a community, so in this way, they behave like a single organism containing many cells.</p><p>A sticky glue-like material called the matrix holds the bacteria in a biofilm together.

One bacterium that typically lives peacefully on our bodies, called <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> can sometimes cause serious biofilm-associated infections. <italic>S. aureus</italic> forms biofilms more readily when oxygen is in short supply, but it was not known how these biofilms form.

At the same time, the bacteria produce more of an enzyme that breaks down cell walls. Together, these processes cause some of the bacteria cells to break open. The contents of these broken cells, including their DNA, help form the matrix that will hold together and protect the other bacterial cells in the biofilm. The experiments also identified a protein called SrrAB that switches on the process that ruptures the cells when oxygen is low.</p><p>The findings of Mashruwala <italic>et al</italic>. show how bacteria grown in the laboratory form biofilms when they are starved of oxygen. The next steps following on from this work are to find out whether the same thing happens when bacteria infect animals and whether drugs that block the rupturing of bacterial cells could be used to treat infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23845.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23845.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Staphylococcus</kwd><kwd>aureus</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>oxygen</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>multistate project NE1048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyd</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rutgers University Busch Biomedical Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyd</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The absence of oxygen prompts <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> cells to rupture resulting in increased formation of biofilms, which are the etiological agents of recurrent infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a commensal bacterium that is estimated to colonize between 20–50% of the healthy human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Naimi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Enright et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ohara-Nemoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zafar et al., 2007</xref>).

Under select conditions, <italic>S. aureus</italic> is capable of causing both invasive as well as non-invasive infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Williamson et al., 2013</xref>). The dominant fraction of invasive infections caused by this bacterium occur in the context of bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, <italic>S. aureus</italic> can infect and cause diseases of the lungs (penumonia), skin (cellulitis), skeletal tissues (ostoemyelitis), and heart tissue (endocarditis), as well as septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). In the United States, pneumonia and septic shock are rapidly progressing infections and are often fatal with mortality rates in the United States (US) of 30–55% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>). While bacteremia and endocarditis infections have a lower degree of mortality, they are associated with a higher degree of recurrence, suggestive of therapeutic recalcitrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>). A recent epidemiological analysis of ~8,700 cases of invasive <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in the US found that nearly 92% cases required hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Historically, <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in the US were largely nosocomial in origin; however, their onset or occurrence increasingly transpires in community settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tenover et al., 2006</xref>). In the United States, pulsed-field type USA300 methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) has emerged as the dominant etiologic agent of community-associated invasive infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>). Treatment of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections is often problematic due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains have been isolated that are resistant to nearly all clinically available antibiotics, including the last-line antibiotics linezolid and daptomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sánchez García et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Biofilms are architecturally complex, multicellular communities of microorganisms of either mono- or poly-microbial compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costerton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costerton et al., 1995</xref>). It has been theorized, based upon studies using direct techniques, such as microscopy, that ~99% of bacteria establish biofilms in their natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costerton et al., 1995</xref>). A number of persistent and chronic infections in humans, such as periodontis and cystic fibrosis, are associated with the ability of the microorganisms to establish biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sedghizadeh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costerton et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, biofilms of infectious agents are well characterized to form upon biomedical devices such as prosthetics, heart valves, catheters, and contact lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costerton et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bispo and Haas, 2015</xref>). A number of staphylococcal infections, such as osteomyelitis, are also intimately connected to the ability of the bacterium to form biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joo and Otto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Otto, 2008</xref>). Reflective of their clinical significance, biofilms are considered to be the etiologic agents of recurrent staphylococcal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joo and Otto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Otto, 2008</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms are typically composed of one or more extracellular polymeric molecules (DNA, proteins, or polysaccharides) that provide structural integrity and may also facilitate intercellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rice et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boles and Horswill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cramton et al., 1999</xref>). The polymers interact to facilitate the formation an extracellular matrix. This matrix provides protection from environmental stress, innate immunity, as well as therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies, 2003</xref>). The polymer(s) utilized to facilitate biofilm formation can vary between staphylococcal isolates with some favoring DNA and/or proteins and others polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rice et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boles and Horswill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cramton et al., 1999</xref>). The complexity of biofilm formation results in this process being highly regulated and deterministic. Biofilm formation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is responsive to diverse signals including nutrient limitation and quorum sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joo and Otto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Otto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boles and Horswill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Majerczyk et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Oxygen concentrations vary greatly between healthy human tissues (between 19.7 to ~1.5%; normoxia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carreau et al., 2011</xref>). Oxygen concentrations also vary between healthy and infected or necrotic tissues, as well as in wounds, where concentrations are estimated to be below 1% (hypoxic) or anoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carreau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vogelberg and König, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 1987</xref>). A recent study found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in skeletal tissues (osteomyelitis) cause an ~3 fold decrease in oxygen concentrations resulting in increasing hypoxia as infection proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wilde et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Multiple studies have focused upon the human systems that are active under hypoxia or anoxia and aid in combating bacterial infections. However, relatively little is known about how <italic>S. aureus</italic> mount a response to hypoxia or anoxia. A study by Cramton <italic>et al.</italic> found that decreased oxygen concentrations result in increased biofilm formation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cramton et al., 2001</xref>). An alternate study found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> growing in biofilms are starved for oxygen and that the rate of oxygen depletion is proportional to the rate of biofilm maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). Cramton <italic>et al.</italic> also found that decreased oxygen concentrations lead to increased production of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is a polymer used by some <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates to facilitate intercellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cramton et al., 2001</xref>). However, the role or requirement of PIA in low oxygen biofilms is unclear since biofilm formation in a PIA deficient strain was not examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cramton et al., 2001</xref>). It is also unclear how the lack of oxygen, a cell permeable molecule, translates into increased biofilm formation.</p><p>Two-component regulatory systems (TCRS) are modular signal transduction pathways that facilitate the integration of multiple stimuli into cellular signaling circuits, allowing for a rapid and robust response to environmental alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Stock et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stephenson and Hoch, 2002</xref>). In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which encodes for classical TCRS, the systems are predicted to be composed of a histidine kinase (HK) and a DNA-binding response regulator (RR). The HK interacts with the environmental stimulus and can be either membrane associated or cytosolic. Upon stimulation, the HK alters the levels of the phosphoryl group upon the RR. In the case of most (but not all) DNA-binding RRs, altered phosphoryl levels modify the affinity of the RR for DNA resulting in altered gene transcription and a tailored physiological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Stock et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stephenson and Hoch, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The goal of this study was to examine the mechanisms by which oxygen affects <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation. Data presented show that oxygen impacts biofilm formation in its capacity as a terminal electron acceptor in cellular respiration. Consequently, growth conditions that diminish respiration elicit increased biofilm formation. Impaired respiration leads to increased cell lysis via increased expression of the AltA murein hydrolase and a concomitant decrease in the expression of wall-teichoic acids. The regulatory tuning of these two processes in a divergent manner affects cell lysis. Increased biofilm formation and cell lysis is a programmed mechanism that is governed by the SrrAB TCRS. Genetic evidence suggests that SrrAB-dependent biofilm formation occurs in response to the accumulation of reduced menaquinone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>S. aureus</italic> forms robust biofilms in the absence of oxygen</title><p>The influence of anaerobiosis upon biofilm formation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> was examined.

WT was cultured aerobically or fermentatively in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, the cells were heat-killed, and used as substrates in murein hydrolase assays. WT cells cultured aerobically with tunicamycin were lysed at a rate similar to that of fermentatively cultured cells by CW-extracts from a Δ<italic>atlA</italic> strain carrying either p<italic>atlA<sub>AM</sub></italic> or p<italic>atlA</italic>. This confirmed that changes in WTA expression alter the amenability of fermenting cells to cleavage by AtlA and AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Two models have been proposed to explain the influence of WTA upon AtlA activity. Schlag <italic>et al.</italic> found that the presence of WTA interferes with the binding of AtlA to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schlag et al., 2010</xref>). Biswas <italic>et al.</italic> found that WTA contributes to proton binding on the cell surface. AtlA activity decreases substantially below pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al., 2012</xref>), and therefore, it was proposed that binding of protons by WTA leads to a decrease in the local pH of the cell surface thereby inhibiting AtlA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al., 2012</xref>). We examined the contribution of these two mechanisms in the lysis of fermenting <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p>First, the effect of proton binding by WTA upon AtlA activity was examined by decreasing the pH of the murein hydrolase and autolysis assays. We reasoned that an increased concentration of protons would exacerbate the effect of proton binding by WTA. Under this scenario, cells containing an increased abundance of WTA would be expected to be resistant towards AtlA-dependent cleavage at decreased pH. Consistent with this premise, AtlA-dependent lysis of heat-killed WT was dramatically decreased in murein hydrolase assays conducted at a pH of 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Importantly, lysis of fermenting WT cells was still observed while it was nearly absent for those cultured aerobically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, lysis rates for tunicamycin treated WT were unaltered upon decreasing the pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), confirming that the influence of pH upon AtlA activity was observed entirely as a result of alterations in WTA expression. The results from autolysis assays conducted at pH 5 lent further support to the findings of the murein hydrolase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Strikingly, autolysis was abrogated in aerobically cultured WT, while fermentatively cultured cells or those cultured in the presence of tunicamycin underwent proficient AtlA-dependent autolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Second, we examined whether fermenting WT bind an increased amount of AtlA and whether this is dependent upon WTA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fournier and Hooper, 2000</xref>). Various heat-killed cells were incubated at pH 5 with CW-extract from a Δ<italic>atlA</italic> strain carrying p<italic>atlA</italic>. The cells were subsequently removed, and the bacteriolytic activity remaining in the supernatants was quantified using heat-killed <italic>M. luteus</italic> cells as substrate. Aerobically or fermentatively cultured heat-killed WT cells did not bind bacteriolytic enzymes while tunicamycin treated cells bound a majority of the bacteriolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We concluded that the complete loss of WTA expression does indeed increase binding of AtlA to the cell surface confirming and extending the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schlag et al.

However, altered AtlA binding to WTA was unlikely to underlie the increased lysis of fermenting cells.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>, we concluded that fermenting <italic>S. aureus</italic> had increased expression of AtlA and concomitantly decreased expression of wall-teichoic acids.

Previous work found that hypoxic growth results in increased biofilm formation of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, the molecular and regulatory mechanism(s) translating the lack of oxygen into biofilm formation were unknown. We report that oxygen impacts biofilm formation in its capacity as a terminal electron acceptor (TEA) for cellular respiration. Consistent with this premise, supplementing the growth medium with the alternate TEA nitrate decreased biofilm formation during anaerobic growth. Moreover, genetic or chemical inhibition of respiratory processes resulted in increased biofilm formation even in the presence of a TEA. TEA availability in the natural microenvironments of <italic>S. aureus</italic> varies, leading to the supposition that biofilm formation would be responsive to the concentration of TEA. Consistent with this logic, biofilm formation was titratable with respect to the concentration of a TEA or a molecule that inhibits respiration.</p><p>Fermenting biofilms were dependent upon the presence of high-molecular weight DNA. High-molecular weight DNA in <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm matrixes (eDNA) has been shown to originate from genomic DNA, and thus, its presence suggested that fermenting cells undergo increased autolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rice et al., 2007</xref>). Lending support to this concept, fermentative biofilm formation was attenuated upon chemical inhibition of autolysis or genetic inactivation of the AtlA murein hydrolase. Fermenting cells underwent increased autolysis in a AtlA-dependent manner and the matrix from the <italic>atlA::Tn</italic> strain had nearly undetectable levels of eDNA. <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms incorporate cytosolic proteins into their matrixes and AtlA has been implicated in the release of cytosolic proteins via a process that is not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foulston et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pasztor et al., 2010</xref>). We found that fermenting cells had increased activity for a cytosolic protein in the extracellular mileu and an <italic>atlA::Tn</italic> strain was deficient in the release of this protein. Fermenting biofilms were also readily disrupted upon supplementing media with proteinase K suggesting that, in addition to eDNA, proteins are integral components of the fermentative biofilm matrix.</p><p>The increased role of AtlA in fermenting biofilms was due to a combination of two divergent cellular responses. First, fermenting cells increased the transcription of <italic>atlA</italic> and autolysis and murein hydrolase assays confirmed that this was translated into increased AtlA activity. Second, fermenting WT cells that had been heat-killed displayed an increased amenability to AtlA-dependent cleavage when used as substrates in murein hydrolase assays. These findings suggested that the cell surface was being altered to facilitate cell lysis. Wall-teichoic acids (WTA) are cell surface glycopolymers that are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and negatively impact AtlA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schlag et al., 2010</xref>). The transcription of WTA biosynthesis genes was decreased during fermentative growth. Autolysis and murein hydrolase assays, as well as the WTA synthesis inhibitor tunicamycin, confirmed that WTA expression was decreased during fermentative growth. Since two cellular processes are divergently modulated at the transcriptional level in response to an environmental stimulus (TEA availability) to affect autolysis, we propose that this process be termed as <underline>p</underline>rogrammed <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>l</underline>ysis (PCL), which is illustrated in our working model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23845.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A working model for the influence of respiration upon autolysis and biofilm formation in <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</title><p>A decreased capacity to respire results in an enrichment of reduced menaquinone effecting altered activity of the SrrAB two-component regulatory system.

Thus, it has been clear that cell wall composition, the localized pH of the cell wall, and cellular autolysis are interconnected. However, the mechanisms underlying these interconnections have remained elusive. A recent study by Biswas <italic>et al</italic>. shed light on these processes in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al., 2012</xref>). Biswas <italic>et al</italic>. found that WTA traps protons at the cell surface and they proposed that this results in decreased pH of the microenvironment, and thereby, inhibits AtlA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al., 2012</xref>). We found that the influence of pH upon AtlA activity, in both murein hydrolase, as well as autolysis assays, was almost entirely as a result of alterations in WTA expression. These findings both confirm and extend the model put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al. (2012)</xref>. An alternate study by Schlag <italic>et al.</italic> proposed that WTA negatively affects AtlA activity by interfering with its binding to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schlag et al., 2010</xref>). We found that at a pH of 5, tunicamycin treated cells bound a majority of the bacteriolytic activity corresponding to AtlA. In contrast, binding was absent in cells not treated with tunicamycin, regardless of whether they were cultured aerobically or fermentatively. Thus, our findings also confirmed and extended the findings of Schlag <italic>et al</italic>. However, the complete absence of WTA synthesis is unlikely to be a phenomenon that would be physiologically encountered. Therefore, in fermenting <italic>S. aureus</italic>, where the final pH of the culture medium is ~5, we propose that the model of Biswas <italic>et al</italic>. would dominate with respect to autolysis and biofilm formation.</p><p>Acidic pH has long been recognized to elicit biofilm formation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Regassa et al., 1992</xref>); however, the mechanisms underlying this phenotype have been unclear.

The association of the proteins with the cells increases with decreasing pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foulston et al., 2014</xref>). Foulston <italic>et al.</italic> conducted their study in a medium that leads to a decrease in pH over growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Foulston et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it was unclear whether low pH was necessary for the release of the cytoplasmic proteins. Data presented herein suggest that low pH optimizes AtlA function and thereby effects the release of the cytoplasmic proteins, extending the findings of Foulston <italic>et al.</italic> Further, the physiological condition(s) under which this mechanism would be relevant was not entirely clear. In the present study we demonstrate that this mechanism is pertinent in the context of an environmental signal (oxygen) that is crucial in infection progression. Finally, we note that the pH of the skin and nares, which are sites colonized by <italic>S. aureus,</italic> is lower than the homeostatic 7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weinrick et al., 2004</xref>). However, to our knowledge, it is unknown if low pH contributes to <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Respiration is a process mediated predominantly by membrane associated cellular factors. A strain lacking the SrrAB TCRS, consisting of a transmembrane histidine kinase (SrrB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pragman et al., 2004</xref>), was attenuated in biofilm formation. A strain lacking SrrAB had decreased transcription of <italic>atlA</italic>, increased transcription of WTA biosynthesis genes, and displayed multiple phenotypes consistent with the transcriptional data. Further, the biofilm deficient phenotype of the Δ<italic>srrAB</italic> strain was partially suppressed by the introduction of <italic>atlA</italic> in multicopy. These data suggest that SrrAB influences PCL and biofilm formation by divergently influencing AtlA and WTA expression.</p><p>SrrAB output was previously shown to be altered under conditions of hypoxia and nitric oxide stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kinkel et al., 2013</xref>). However, the cellular molecule(s) that influence SrrAB activity are unidentified. We found that SrrAB-dependent biofilms increased as a function of decreased respiratory activity. SrrAB-dependent biofilms were formed upon accumulation of reduced, but not oxidized menaquinone, and SrrAB output was abrogated in the absence of menaquinone. These findings suggest that (1) menaquinone is necessary for stimulus transmission to SrrAB, and (2) the oxidation state of the cellular menaquinone pool influences SrrAB output. We also considered the possibility of two alternate signals that could affect SrrAB output: culture pH and decreased proton motive force. Fermentative growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> upon TSB results in the release of acidic by-products, which decrease the pH of the extracellular mileu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Somerville et al., 2003</xref>). Diminished respiration also decreases the proton-motive force. However, heme and menaquinone auxotrophs are both deficient in respiration and the concentration of fermentative by-products and the pH in the spent media is similar in these strains ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hammer et al., 2013</xref>) and data not shown). These strains also display a similar decrease in membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hammer et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, only a heme auxotroph forms SrrAB-dependent biofilms. Thus, we deem it unlikely that pH or alterations in proton motive force alter SrrAB activity with respect to biofilm formation.</p><p>It is worth noting the similarities that exist between the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ArcAB TCRS and SrrAB. Although these TCRS do not display significant homology, the stimuli influencing their activity are similar. ArcB is proposed to donate electrons from conserved cysteine residues to oxidized quinones resulting in silencing of kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Malpica et al., 2004</xref>). Similar to ArcB, SrrB contains three conserved cysteine residues, which may facilitate redox interactions with the menaquinone pool. While this leads to the supposition that the molecular mechanism of SrrB signaling may be similar to ArcB, further biochemical analyses are required to make this conclusion. The <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> TCRS ResDE displays similarities to SrrAB and it also responds to changes in the respiratory status. However, unlike SrrB, ResE does not contain cysteine residues and studies have deemed it unlikely that the menaquinone pool influences ResDE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geng et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Similar to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> increases biofilm formation under hypoxic growth and this phenotype is reversed upon supplementation with the alternate TEA nitrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2013</xref>). Biofilm formation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> coincided with increased transcription of genes required for matrix production, which was mediated via the membrane-associated kinases KinA and KinB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ResD binds to the promoter regions or within the coding regions of <italic>lytF</italic> and <italic>cwlO</italic>, which encode for two major bacillus autolysins, suggesting it modulates the transcription of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ohnishi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ishikawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yamaguchi et al., 2004</xref>). Further, the binding of ResD to these DNA regions was limited to fermentative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henares et al., 2014</xref>). However, to our knowledge, it is currently unknown whether ResDE has a role in respiration dependent biofilm formation. The gram-negative bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> also increases biofilm formation under hypoxic growth and this phenotype is also reversed upon supplementation with the alternate TEA nitrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dietrich et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2013</xref>). However, the regulatory mechanisms driving respiration dependent biofilm formation in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are unknown. Thus, it seems likely that increased biofilm formation in response to TEA limitation is conserved among diverse bacteria. However, the genetic and regulatory bases underlying biofilm formation may differ.</p><p>Clinical isolates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> that are incapable of respiration, termed as small colony variants (SCV), display increased resistance towards antibiotics and cause persistent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Proctor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Melter and Radojevič, 2010</xref>). The SCV phenotype often, but not always, arises as a result of mutations in genes necessary for heme biosynthesis resulting in non-functional terminal oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hammer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Proctor et al., 2006</xref>). Our finding that a heme auxotroph forms SrrAB-dependent biofilms lends considerable insight into the mechanisms that may predominate within clinical SCV strains.</p><p>While we suggest the usage of the term PCL in the context of the mechanisms outlined herein, we note that this should not be confused with the process of programmed cell death (PCD) in bacteria or in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rice and Bayles, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>). Mechanistically, these are distinctly unique processes. Moreover, the morphological and biochemical markers determined in our study do not satisfy the criteria set forth by the committee on cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>). However, in the holistic view there are intriguing parallels between <italic>S. aureus</italic> PCL and eukaryotic PCD. PCD occurs as a homeostatic measure in multicellular organisms, whereby a genetically programmed mechanism of cellular catabolism eliminates select quantities and types of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>). PCD is crucial for a variety of processes ranging from proper cell turnover and embryonic development to the functioning of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kroemer et al., 2009</xref>). While PCD occurs at the cellular level, and typically in a localized environment, it provides benefits at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>). Similar to PCD, the findings presented herein suggest that PCL may provide bacteria with a population-level advantage by facilitating biofilm establishment, thereby imparting protection from the immune system and therapeutic agents.</p><p>Respiration in eukaryotic cells relies upon using oxygen as a substrate. Similar to PCL, hypoxia or anoxia trigger PCD in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shimizu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weinmann et al., 2004</xref>). PCD occurs as one of two distinct biochemical modalities: apoptosis or necrosis. Hypoxia triggered PCD manifests as a mixture of apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shimizu et al., 1996</xref>). Anoxia triggered PCD is largely an apoptotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weinmann et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, anoxia-triggered PCD is dependent upon mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weinmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kuwana et al., 2002</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that Bax and Bak function as holin-like proteins and facilitate the formation of oligomeric membrane pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kuwana et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> also encodes for two holin-like proteins termed CidA and LrgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ranjit et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>cid</italic> operon genes, <italic>cidA</italic> and <italic>cidB</italic> have been implicated in programmed cell death in aerobically cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaudhari et al., 2016</xref>). CidA was previously proposed to have role in cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rice et al., 2007</xref>). This role was predicated upon the phenotype of a <italic>cidA</italic> mutant; however, recent studies suggest that this was likely an outcome of a secondary mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rice et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaudhari et al., 2016</xref>). CidB, is predicted to be a membrane-associated protein, however its precise function and biochemical activity(s) are yet to be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Windham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaudhari et al., 2016</xref>). In our hands, <italic>cidA::Tn</italic>, <italic>cidB::Tn</italic>, and <italic>lrgA::Tn</italic> strains were not attenuated in fermentative biofilm formation suggesting a functional separation of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> PCD and PCL pathways, with respect to biofilm formation.</p><p>In summary, we report that oxygen impacts <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation in its capacity as a terminal electron acceptor. Decreased respiration results in programmed cell lysis via increased expression of AtlA and decreased expression of wall-teichoic acids. These processes are governed by the SrrAB TCRS and evidence suggests this occurs in response to the accumulation of reduced menaquinone. The AtlA-dependent release of cytosolic components facilitates biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Restriction enzymes, quick DNA ligase kit, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and Phusion DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs.

The <italic>menF::Tn</italic> (<italic>ermB</italic>) strain was transduced with the pTnTet plasmid and Tet resistance was selected at 30°C. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 mL of TSB medium and cultured with shaking overnight at 30°C in the presence of Cm. To initiate recombination, cells from the overnight culture were spread onto a TSB agar plate containing Tet and incubated at 42°C (replication non-permissive). Single recombinants were inoculated into 5 mL of TSB and incubated at 30°C in the absence of antibiotic to promote recombination and plasmid loss. These overnights were re-diluted 1:1,000 fold into TSB medium containing 30 ng mL<sup>−1</sup> of Atet and cultured overnight at 30°C. The overnight culture was diluted of 1:50,000 before plating 20–100 μL onto TSA containing Atet to select against plasmid containing cells. Colonies were screened by replica plating for Cm sensitivity and Tet resistance. The resultant strain, once reconstructed, was verified to be deficient in menaquinone biosynthesis by chemical complementation using menaquinone-4 (MK4). Where mentioned, strains interrupted in <italic>hemB</italic> were verified using chemical complementation by supplementing growth medium with hemin.</p><p>The Δ<italic>ndhC::tetM</italic> strain was constructed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mashruwala et al., 2015</xref>). The pJB38_Δ<italic>srrAB::tet</italic> plasmid was created by using PCR to amplify the <italic>tetM</italic> allele from strain JMB1432 using primers G+tetMluI and G+tetNheI. The PCR product was digested with MluI and NheI and ligated into similarly digested pJB38_Δ<italic>srrAB</italic> (pJB38_Δ<italic>srrAB::tetM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Joska et al., 2014</xref>). The Δ<italic>srrAB::tetM</italic> strain was created as outlined above.</p><p>The pLL39_<italic>srrAB</italic> plasmid, containing <italic>srrAB</italic> under the transcriptional control of their native promoter, was constructed using yeast recombinational cloning as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Joska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mashruwala and Boyd, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mashruwala et al., 2016b</xref>). Amplicons were generated using the following primer pairs: pLL39_yeastF and yeast_srrProR, yeast_srrProF and srrAB_pLL39R. The <italic>srrAB</italic> alleles and the upstream promoter region were amplified from the LAC chromosome and the pLL39 vector was linearized using SalI. The resultant pLL39_<italic>srrAB</italic> plasmid was integrated as an episome into the chromosome of the Δ<italic>srrAB</italic> strain (JMB1467).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Static model of biofilm formation</title><p>Biofilm formation was examined as described earlier, with minor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mashruwala et al., 2016a</xref>). Overnight cultures were diluted into fresh TSB to a final optical density of 0.05 (A<sub>590</sub>). 200 µL aliquots of diluted cultures were added to the wells of a 96-well microtitre plate (Corning 3268) and the plate was subsequently incubated statically at 37°C for 22 hr. Prior to harvesting the biofilm, the optical density (A<sub>590</sub>) of the cultures was determined. The plate was subsequently washed twice with water, biofilms were heat fixed at 60°C, and the plates were allowed to cool to room temperature. The biofilms were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, washed thrice with water, destained with 33% acetic acid and the absorbance of the resulting solution was recorded at 570 nm, standardized to an acetic acid blank, and subsequently to the optical density of the culture upon harvest. Finally, the data were normalized with respect to the WT or as described in the figure legends to obtain relative biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR assays</title><p>Biofilms were cultured in the presence or absence of oxygen for eight hours. At point of harvest the spent medium was discarded and the remaining culture was immediately resuspended in RNAProtect reagent (Qiagen) and treated according to manufacturer instructions. The treated culture was subjected to centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in RNase free 50 mM Tris, pH 8. Cell-free extracts were generated using bead beating. RNA was extracted using Trizol, as per manufacturer instructions. Downstream treatments of the purified RNA and construction of cDNA libraries was as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mashruwala et al., 2015</xref>). Primers for PCR were designed manually or using the Primer Express 3.0 software from Applied Biosystems. Quantitative real time PCR reactions (Table S1) were conducted as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mashruwala et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of high-molecular weight extracellular DNA (eDNA)</title><p>eDNA was analyzed as described earlier with some changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>). Overnight cultures were diluted into TSB to a final optical density of 0.05 (A<sub>600</sub>) in a final volume of 6 mL per well of a six-well plate. The cultures were incubated statically at 37°C for 22 hr. At point of harvest, the spent media supernatant was aspirated out of each well. One mL of 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was immediately added to the wells and a cell scraper was used to transfer the contents to an eppendorf tube. The biomass was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. The pellets were thoroughly resuspended in 1X PBS and vortexed for 5 min using a Vortex Genie 2 (Scientific Industries) at the highest speed possible using a vertical micro-tube adapter. Aliquots were removed for determination of the viable cell count (colony forming units) and samples were pelleted by centrifugation. Control experiments verified that the viable cell counts were not affected by the vortexing procedure (data not shown). Equal volumes of the supernatants were assessed for the presence of high molecular weight DNA (&gt;10 kilobases) using agarose gel electrophoresis. To assess the extracellular DNA in a semi-quantitative manner, the gels were photographed and the bands were subjected to density analysis using Image J software. For each sample, the spot densities were normalized to the viable cell count (colony forming units) and subsequently as mentioned in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cytoplasmic protein release assays</title><p>Strains were cultured as described under eDNA analyses. The samples were vortexed briefly, biomass was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube, and cell pellets and spent media supernatants were partitioned by centrifugation. The spent media supernatant was retained for further analyses. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 4 μg lysostaphin, 8 μg DNAse, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37°C until confluent lysis was observed. Cell lysates were clarified using centrifugation to obtain cell-free extracts. Catalase (Kat) activity was assayed, in both the cell-free extracts as well as spent medium supernatants as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mashruwala et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beers and Sizer, 1952</xref>). The ratio of extracellular to intracellular Kat activity was utilized to determine protein release. In control experiments, Kat activity was undetectable in a <italic>katA::Tn</italic> strain (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Whole cell autolysis assays</title><p>Overnight cultures were diluted into TSB to a final optical density of 0.05 (A<sub>600</sub>) and cultured for four hours. Whole cell autolysis assays were conducted as described elsewhere with minor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bose et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the cultures were harvested by centrifugation, cell pellets were washed twice, and resuspended in autolysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). For analyses conducted at pH 5, HEPES was replaced with 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer and all other components remained unaltered. The cell suspensions were then incubated at 37°C with shaking and optical densities were recorded periodically.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Murein hydrolase assays</title><p>Biofilms were cultured for four hours and cells were harvested as mentioned under eDNA analyses. Thereafter, cell-wall associated protein extracts (CW-extracts) were prepared and murein hydrolase activity determined as described elsewhere with minor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mani et al., 1993</xref>). Briefly, cell pellets were washed and CW-extracts were prepared by resuspension in 3 M lithium chloride and incubation for 25 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mani et al., 1993</xref>). Protein concentrations of the extracts were determined and between 0.1–0.5 µg of an individual extract was combined with heat-killed cell substrates (0.35 optical density (A<sub>600</sub>)) in assay buffer (50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). For analyses conducted at pH 5, HEPES was replaced with 0.2 M sodium acetate and all other components remained unaltered.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wendy Garrett (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael S Gilmore (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-done investigation into the relationship between anoxia and biofilm formation by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This work is most notable for the effort undertaken to independently validate observations by attacking the problem from several perspectives. In general, insights are initially gained into biofilm formation using genetic tools. These are systematically followed by examining in depth the connection between the genetics associated with increased or decreased biofilm formation in response to reduced oxygen availability, and predicted behaviors tested in other ways. Although there are few surprises and much of the process is what would be expected based on the prior work of others, biofilm formation is complex and the field has been muddied by superficial studies that have drawn sweeping conclusions based on dogma and limited testing. A main virtue of this work is that it is complete, systematic and rigorous, and most likely applies to biofilm formation under most conditions and by most strains relevant to infection.</p><p>In contrast to the strong technical section of this manuscript, the Introduction is comparatively superficial and uncritically reiterates much of the dogma in the field. It would be enhanced and strengthened by examining the factual basis for many statements. For example, although a cause of infective endocarditis, this is hardly the most common manifestation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, or the most likely to lead to serious consequence. It therefore is not a good choice as representative for framing the importance of the work. Emerging resistance to last line antibiotics would be better to include linezolid and daptomycin – frank resistance to vancomycin remains rare, although the utility of vancomycin is often compromised by the &quot;intermediate&quot; susceptibility of VISA strains. The statement &quot;A majority of staphylococcal infections are intimately connected to the ability of the bacterium to form complex multicellular communities called biofilms…&quot; cites work that made similar statements, but did not critically examine the question, and hence makes a thinly supported case, etc. This is not to say that a strong case cannot be made, but as written, it is not convincing.</p><p>The technical meat and potatoes of the paper are strong. <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation is unambiguously greater in reduced oxygen, and by probing this with the alternate terminal electron acceptor nitrate, and showing the critical role of heme in relaying electrons along the partial electron transport pathway of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the authors make a strong case for the its importance. One area that is less explored/discussed are the alternate fates of electrons in forme fruste respiration in impaired mutants, and precisely how that may limit biofilm formation. This is indirectly pursued by showing an effect on expression on transcription of LTA biosynthetic genes, and more directly using tunicamycin to inhibit LTA biosynthesis, but tunicamycin also inhibits targets other than TarO. The authors complement this by examining the effect of deficiencies in LTA production with alteration of AtlA binding and activity, which is nicely done. This raises the questions, what is known about the pH where biofilms are problematic, and to what degree is this consistent with the mechanism proposed by the investigators? Given the role of respiration energetics in events leading to biofilm formation, it was then not surprising to find the SrrAB TCS, or menaquinones involved. Nevertheless, these lines of experimentation generated results consistent with the model and add further support and rigor to the manuscript.</p><p>In summary, this is a technically well done study that adds considerable clarity to an otherwise congested field that in this reviewer's opinion has been confounded by the dogma and lore of biofilms developed largely in other systems. For example, production of specific extracellular polymers, such as PIA, fit expectations for biofilm formation based on what had been discovered in other systems, but as the authors and others have shown, are not likely the most important element of biofilm formation by most clinical isolates of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Some reviewers expressed skepticism about connecting the mechanism identified here to other types of processes, as may be superficially inferred by dubbing this process &quot;programmed etc..…&quot;, as it may have the unintended consequence of building in expectations developed in the eukaryotic programmed cell death/tissue differentiation paradigm, which may or may not apply to biofilm formation by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Irrespective of how the authors proceed on that, as they are not the first to venture in that direction, they should add a few sentences to help the reader reconcile their model with other &quot;programmed cell death&quot;-type models that have been published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some reconciliation of &quot;Programmed&quot; models as noted above is needed in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Provide details on fermentation conditions to inform the reader as to whether or how available oxygen was measured or inferred (e.g., were the experiments performed in anaerobic environmental chambers?)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23845.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In contrast to the strong technical section of this manuscript, the Introduction is comparatively superficial and uncritically reiterates much of the dogma in the field.
