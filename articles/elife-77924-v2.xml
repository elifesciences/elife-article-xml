function. A major challenge towards understanding the structural and functional architecture of neural circuits is to separate these inputs and determine their intrinsic and heterosynaptic relationships. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction is a powerful model system to study these questions, where two glutamatergic motor neurons, the strong phasic-like Is and weak tonic-like Ib, co-innervate individual muscle targets to coordinate locomotor behavior. However, complete neurotransmission from each input has never been electrophysiologically separated. We have employed a botulinum neurotoxin, BoNT-C, that eliminates both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission without perturbing synaptic growth or structure, enabling the first approach that accurately isolates input-specific neurotransmission. Selective expression of BoNT-C in Is or Ib motor neurons disambiguates the functional properties of each input. Importantly, the blended values of Is+Ib neurotransmission can be fully recapitulated by isolated physiology from each input. Finally, selective silencing by BoNT-C does not induce heterosynaptic structural or functional plasticity at the convergent input. Thus, BoNT-C establishes the first approach to accurately separate neurotransmission between tonic vs. phasic neurons and defines heterosynaptic plasticity rules in a powerful model glutamatergic circuit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>phasic</kwd><kwd>tonic pathways</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>botulinum toxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS091546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickman</surname><given-names>Dion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS111414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickman</surname><given-names>Dion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new tool enables electrophysiological isolation of input-specific neurotransmission in a powerful model glutamatergic circuit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuits are established in development, modified by experience, and must be maintained at stable physiological levels throughout the lifetime of an organism. Most cells embedded in neural circuits are innervated by multiple neurons, which differ in the number and strength of synaptic connections, the classes of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released, and their patterns of activity. There is also evidence that changes in synapse number or function at one input can induce adaptive or Hebbian modulations in transmission at convergent inputs, termed heterosynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chater and Goda, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dittman and Regehr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a powerful model system for revealing fundamental principles of transmission and heterosynaptic plasticity, where synaptic development, growth, function, and plasticity have been studied for over 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunner and O’Kane, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harris and Littleton, 2015</xref>). Most muscles at this glutamatergic synapse are co-innervated by two distinct motor neurons (MNs) that coordinate muscle contraction to drive locomotor behavior, termed MN-Is and MN-Ib. These MNs differ in both structural and functional properties, with the strong MN-Is firing with phasic-like patterns and depressing with repeated stimulation, while the weak MN-Ib fires with tonic-like patterns and facilitates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aponte-Santiago and Littleton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoang and Chiba, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lnenicka and Keshishian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Newman et al., 2017</xref>). The vast majority of fly NMJ studies of synaptic structure have focused on MN-Ib terminals, given their larger relative size and amenability to light and super-resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu and Lichtman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maglione and Sigrist, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sigrist and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Similarly, most studies using electrophysiology in this system have recorded an ambiguous blend of miniature events originating from both MN-Is and MN-Ib, as well as a composite evoked response from simultaneous stimulation of both inputs. It bears emphasizing that this compound-evoked response does not reflect the physiology of any actual existent synapse. This failure to fully disambiguate transmission from the strong MN-Is and weak MN-Ib has limited our understanding and ability to interpret synaptic transmission and plasticity at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ.</p><p>Although most electrophysiological studies using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ have failed to cleanly separate transmission from entire MN-Is and MN-Ib inputs, important insights have been gleaned into their respective properties. Early anatomical studies characterized their relative size and structures, which established that MN-Is boutons are smaller and contain fewer release sites, while those of MN-Ib are larger and opposed by a more elaborate subsynaptic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atwood et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jia et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lnenicka and Keshishian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schuster et al., 1996</xref>). Differences were also observed in the relative abundance of postsynaptic glutamate receptor subtypes at MN-Is vs. MN-Ib NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>). Macro patch recordings at identified boutons suggested spontaneous events were larger at MN-Is terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pawlu et al., 2004</xref>), consistent with electron microscopy (EM) studies that showed synaptic vesicles were larger at MN-Is terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karunanithi et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, threshold stimulus manipulations established that single action potential-evoked transmitter release from MN-Is drives most of the depolarization in the postsynaptic muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Together, this important body of work detailed fundamental properties of the two MN subtypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Recent innovations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and the identification of GAL4 drivers that selectively express in MN-Is vs. MN-Ib have enabled new attempts to isolate transmission between the two inputs. First, postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors were developed that revealed important differences in quantal release events, active zone-specific release characteristics, and plasticity between MN-Is vs. MN-Ib NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbergenova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gratz et al., 2019</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Newman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Newman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peled and Isacoff, 2011</xref>). Following the recent identification of selective GAL4 drivers that target MN-Is and MN-Ib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pérez-Moreno and O’Kane, 2019</xref>), input-specific manipulations suggested heterosynaptic structural plasticity could be induced between convergent Is vs. Ib inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, to what extent heterosynaptic functional plasticity was expressed was unclear due to an inability to fully isolate transmission from either input. Finally, selective optogenetic stimulation of MN-Is or MN-Ib has been used to estimate evoked neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Genç and Davis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>), but is unable to resolve input-specific miniature transmission and may suffer from confounds due to chronic channel rhodopsin expression in MNs. An accurate electrophysiological understanding of transmission from entire MN-Is vs. MN-Ib NMJs has therefore remained unresolved due to the significant limitations of these approaches. Similarly, clear rules and mechanistic insights into the signaling systems mediating heterosynaptic plasticity at the fly NMJ have not been established.</p><p>We have therefore sought to develop an optimal approach to accurately separate neurotransmission between tonic and phasic motor inputs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Towards this goal, we screened a series of botulinum toxins for abilities to prevent neurotransmitter release from MNs. This approach identified botulinum neurotoxin-C (BoNT-C) to eliminate all spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release without imposing apparent intrinsic toxicity or plasticity at the convergent input. BoNT-C now enables the accurate separation of motor inputs and establishes heterosynaptic plasticity rules at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Suboptimal approaches to disambiguate tonic and phasic inputs at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ</title><p>An ideal approach to functionally isolate MN-Is and MN-Ib would silence all neurotransmission from one input without inducing structural or functional plasticity from the convergent input (‘heterosynaptic plasticity’). If such an approach were successful, then the frequency of miniature transmission should be reduced when either input is silenced compared to recordings from wild-type NMJs (where miniature transmission is blended), and quantal size should be increased at MN-Is NMJs relative to MN-Ib. In addition, synaptic strength, as assessed by single action potential stimulation, should be increased when evoked from MN-Is relative to MN-Ib NMJs. Importantly, when the composite values of miniature and evoked transmission from MN-Is and MN-Ib NMJs are averaged or summed, they should fully recapitulate all aspects of neurotransmission as assessed from standard wild-type NMJ recordings, where miniature events are a mix from both inputs and evoked transmission is an ambiguous average of simultaneous release from both MN-Is and MN-Ib.</p><p>The fly larval musculature is composed of 12 repeated segments, with ~30 muscles per abdominal hemisegment (60 per segment), innervated by 36 distinct MNs: ~30 MN-Ib and 3 MN-Is per hemisegment (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoang and Chiba, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lnenicka and Keshishian, 2000</xref>). MN-Ib inputs typically innervate single muscles, while MN-Is co-innervates groups of several muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To distinguish transmission between MN-Is and MN-Ib inputs at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, we first confirmed expression profiles of four MN GAL4 drivers that express at the muscle 6/7 NMJ, the primary NMJ that has been used for electrophysiology in the field and that we will focus on in this study: (1) <italic>OK6-GAL4</italic>, which drives GAL4 expression in all MNs, including the ones that innervate muscle 6/7; (2) <italic>OK319-GAL4</italic>, which expresses in small subsets of both Is and Ib MNs, including the ones that innervate muscle 6/7; (3) ‘Is-GAL4’ (<italic>R27E09-GAL4</italic>), which expresses in the MN-Is that innervates muscle 6/7; and (4) ‘Ib-GAL4’ (<italic>dHB9-GAL4</italic>), which expresses in the single MN-Ib that innervates muscle 6/7. Expression of these drivers proved specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), where expression begins by at least early first-instar stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), motivating a genetic dissection of the MN-Ib and MN-Is inputs at the muscle 6/7 NMJ.</p><p>One promising approach to electrophysiologically separate MN-Is and MN-Ib would be to employ a conditional null allele of the <italic>vesicular glutamate transporter</italic> (<italic>vGlut</italic>) that was recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Banerjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sherer et al., 2020</xref>). In principle, this would be an ideal approach because all glutamate release would be silenced without otherwise perturbing innervation or synaptogenesis. Indeed, conditional loss of <italic>vGlut</italic> eliminates all neurotransmission in adult NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Banerjee et al., 2021</xref>). However, at larval NMJs we found <italic>vGlut</italic> expression to be only moderately reduced at presynaptic terminals and did not eliminate transmission, despite trying all four of the GAL4 drivers described above to conditionally remove <italic>vGlut</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is likely due to perdurance of maternally contributed <italic>vGlut</italic> and early <italic>vGlut</italic> synthesis, as well as the finding that a single vGlut transporter is sufficient to fill a synaptic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, conditional loss of <italic>vGlut</italic> in larval MNs was not an effective approach for our goal of eliminating miniature and evoked transmission.</p><p>Using the Is-GAL4 and Ib-GAL4 drivers described above, we tried three alternative approaches to distinguish transmission between these two inputs. Each of these was previously used in attempts to functionally separate MN-Is/MN-Ib transmission, and each proved inadequate for our purposes. First, we used selective optogenetic stimulation of MN-Ib or MN-Is as recently employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Genç and Davis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>). From the outset, we knew the limitations of this approach in failing to distinguish input-specific miniature transmission and an inability to perform repeated trains of stimulation to assess short-term plasticity and resolve vesicle pools. We expressed <italic>channel rhodopsin</italic> (ChR) in all MNs (OK6&gt;ChR) or selectively in either MN-Is or MN-Ib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), as performed in previous studies. As expected, miniature frequency and amplitude were indistinguishable in Is&gt;ChR and Ib&gt;ChR compared to OK6&gt;ChR or wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), while evoked release was stronger at Is compared to Ib, as expected. However, we also noted significant differences between optogenetic vs. electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), where baseline-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) values were reduced by ~33% in OK6&gt;ChR compared to wild-type controls, suggesting that chronic expression of ChR alone induces significant changes in intrinsic excitability and synaptic function. Next, we expressed <italic>tetanus toxin</italic> [TNT; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>)] in an attempt to selectively silence evoked transmission in either MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Although TNT expression blocks evoked release, miniature transmission persists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>), so we also knew from the outset that TNT, like optogenetic stimulation, would fail to separate miniature transmission. Indeed, selective expression of TNT does not significantly change miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential (mEPSP) frequency or amplitude from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Further, while evoked EPSPs were larger at MN-Is NMJs compared to MN-Ib, as observed with optogenetic stimulation, input-specific TNT expression was reported to induce heterosynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>), making it unclear if the input-specific differences in synaptic strength reflect genuine wild-type behavior. Finally, we tried genetic ablation of either MN-Is or MN-Ib by expression of the pro-apoptotic genes <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>) and <italic>head involution defective</italic> (<italic>hid</italic>). Is&gt;rpr.hid cleanly eliminated MN-Is inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), but was also reported to induce heterosynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, Ib&gt;rpr.hid did not always completely ablate MN-Ib inputs, yet always fully eliminated all MN-Is inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). While electrophysiological recordings from Is&gt;rpr.hid appeared to silence transmission from MN-Is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), virtually all transmission was ablated at Ib&gt;rpr.hid NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Thus, conditional mutagenesis, optogenetics, TNT expression, and genetic ablation each proved inadequate to accurately distinguish input-specific transmission.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Suboptimal approaches for selectively isolating tonic and phasic neurotransmission at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of recording configuration and representative miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential (mEPSP) and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) traces illustrating that overexpression of <italic>ChR2<sup>T159C</sup></italic> in MN-Ib or -Is enables optically evoked EPSP events from either MN-Ib or -Is NMJs.

Neuronal toxicity has been reported for some classes of neurotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peng et al., 2013</xref>), and we continued to use TNT expression as a comparison. Expression of TNT in both MN-Is and -Ib by OK319&gt;GAL4 led to an ~20% reduction in bouton and active zone number at terminals of MN-Ib (indicated by immunostaining of the active zone scaffold Bruchpilot [BRP]), while an inverse change in synaptic growth was observed in MN-Is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goel and Dickman, 2018</xref>).

The postsynaptic glutamate receptors at the NMJ assemble as heterotetramers containing three essential subunits (GluRIII, GluRIID, and GluRIIE) and either a GluRIIA or GluRIIB subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qin et al., 2005</xref>). GluRIIA-containing receptors drive most of the synaptic currents due to the rapid desensitization of GluRIIB-containing subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diantonio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Differences in GluR composition have been reported at postsynaptic compartments of MN-Is and MN-Ib, where GluRIIA-type receptors localize more centrally within GluR fields and are more abundant at MN-Ib postsynaptic compartments relative to MN-Is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbergenova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>). It has been speculated that tonic vs. phasic patterns of activity at MN-Is and MN-Ib may orchestrate these differences in GluR composition at postsynaptic receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aponte-Santiago and Littleton, 2020</xref>). We used synaptic silencing by BoNT-C as an opportunity to test this possibility. At wild-type postsynaptic compartments, we observed the lower GluRIIA intensity characteristic at MN-Is NMJs relative to MN-Ib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We also found the characteristic enrichment of GluRIIA at centers of receptive fields, with GluRIIB distributed in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, these same input-specific patterns of GluR composition and spatial localization were observed following BoNT-C expression, where no glutamate is emitted from presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). We also did not find any major differences in GluR localization or maturation at earlier developmental stages following BoNT-C expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), although we cannot rule out the possibility of more subtle alterations in the timing of postsynaptic maturation. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate two important points. First, neurotransmitter release is not required for synaptic assembly and alignment at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, nor for their maintenance during growth and elaboration, including the specialization of postsynaptic GluR fields. Second, patterns of tonic vs. phasic transmission do not sculpt the final composition of postsynaptic receptive fields.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Tonic vs. phasic activity patterns do not specialize postsynaptic GluR fields.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of boutons from MN-Ib and -Is neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) immunostained with anti-GluRIIA, -GluRIIB, and -GluRIID in wild-type.

Although input-specific silencing by BoNT-C does not induce heterosynaptic structural plasticity, it is possible that heterosynaptic functional adaptations might be imparted. Alternatively, input-specific silencing by BoNT-C may not induce functional changes in neurotransmission at the convergent input. We sought to distinguish between these possibilities. In standard electrophysiological recordings from wild-type NMJs, miniature transmission is an undefined blend of spontaneous events originating from both MN-Is and MN-Ib inputs, and evoked amplitudes reflect a nebulous composite of transmission from both motor inputs that does not reflect the behavior of any synapse that actually exists. We reasoned that if wild-type physiology could be fully reconstituted after electrophysiological isolation of both miniature and evoked transmission from MN-Is and MN-Ib, this would confirm that no heterosynaptic functional plasticity is induced by input-specific BoNT-C expression. However, if wild-type physiology was not fully reconstituted, this would indicate that heterosynaptic functional plasticity was provoked by input-specific BoNT-C silencing.</p><p>We first compared miniature transmission at wild-type (Ib+Is), Ib only (Is&gt;BoNT-C), and Is only (Ib&gt;BoNT-C) NMJs.

Finally, we were able to obtain an accurate quantal content value of synaptic vesicle release at MN-Ib and MN-Is, extracted from the disambiguated miniature and evoked transmission. Given the large quantal size of transmission from MN-Is, due to enhanced vesicle size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karunanithi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Newman et al., 2017</xref>), less quantal content was observed than would be expected from the averaged quantal size, while the converse is true for transmission from MN-Ib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

However, despite the identification of GAL4 drivers specific for tonic vs. phasic MNs, two major limitations rendered TNT a suboptimal approach to isolate input-specific transmission at the fly NMJ. First, the persistence of miniature transmission obscures the accurate determination of accurate quantal content values from either MN, particularly given the large difference in quantal size between the two inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, TNT expression alters synaptic growth at MN terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goel and Dickman, 2018</xref>), and heterosynaptic plasticity was reported with input-specific TNT expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, while we did not observe heterosynaptic structural or functional plasticity following input-specific TNT expression at the muscle 6/7 NMJ, accurate evoked EPSP amplitudes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that input-specific TNT expression can alter synaptic growth and block evoked transmission without inducing any apparent changes at the convergent input.</p><p>The isolation of BoNT-C was fortunate given the variable activity and toxicity previously reported with BoNTs. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, BoNT transgene expression led to variable substrate cleavage where, for example, BoNT-A only partially cleaved SNAP-25 and Syntaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Backhaus et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we also observed variable activity between independent transgenic inserts of BoNT-E, where expression of some transgenes appeared to make animals less healthy than others (see ‘Materials and methods’). In addition, expression of TNT or BoNT can lead to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berliocchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Although we cannot rule out that BoNT-C may induce toxicity when expressed in other cell types or for longer durations in MNs, we find no evidence for toxicity or altered health when BoNT-C is expressed in MNs throughout larval development. This is likely due to BoNT-C exhibiting specific cleavage activity for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Syntaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Backhaus et al., 2016</xref>) in synaptic SNARE complexes as well as a fortuitous genomic insertion that ensures moderate expression of the transgene. BoNT-C, when expressed in MNs, appears to selectively target Syx in complexes controlling regulated synaptic vesicle fusion at synapses, distinct from complexes involved in constitutive post-Golgi membrane trafficking. BoNT-C expression in muscle also leads to lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Backhaus et al., 2016</xref>), so it is likely that BoNT-C can target Syx in complexes with post-Golgi SNARE machinery in non-neuronal cell types. There are 10 <italic>Drosophila syntaxin</italic> genes and three Syx1A isoforms, so BoNT-C may preferentially target subsets of specific Syx complexes depending on the tissue it is expressed.</p><p>Several important properties of synaptic structure and function in tonic vs. phasic MNs have been confirmed and extended by selective BoNT-C silencing. First, phasic NMJs are responsible for about twice the postsynaptic depolarization compared to tonic, at least with regard to single stimuli under the conditions used in our study. However, despite this obvious difference in synaptic strength, quantal content values released between MN-Is vs. -Ib are more similar than would be apparent based on the substantial difference in quantal size. Second, tonic vs. phasic firing patterns do not determine the specialized abundance and localization of postsynaptic glutamate-receptive fields. Third, synaptic morphogenesis and structure does not require vesicular neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses as BoNT-C NMJs appear indistinguishable from wild-type. Although several studies have shown neurotransmitter release is not necessary for the initial establishment of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sando et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sigler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>), whether miniature transmission was necessary for clustering of glutamate receptors at the fly NMJ has provoked some controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Otsu and Murphy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saitoe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verstreken and Bellen, 2002</xref>). It will be of significant interest in future studies to now determine the full electrophysiological properties of tonic vs. phasic neurons, including vesicle pools, short-term plasticity, and release probability across various extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions. Furthermore, to what extent synaptic components exhibit specialized functions at tonic vs. phasic MNs, as was recently shown for <italic>tomosyn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>), will also be an exciting area to leverage BoNT-C silencing going forward. Input-specific silencing by BoNT-C now provides a foundation to elucidate fundamental electrophysiological differences between tonic and phasic neuronal subtypes and, importantly, to re-evaluate specialized functions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> synaptic genes in which initial characterizations relied on blended transmission from both inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Insights into synapse development and heterosynaptic plasticity revealed by BoNT-C</title><p>Physical loss of tonic or phasic motor inputs appears to be the key inductive process capable of inducing adaptive heterosynaptic plasticity. Input-specific silencing of neurotransmission by BoNT-C, or even blockade of evoked release only by TNT, failed to elicit any structural or functional changes in the convergent input at the NMJs we assayed (muscle 6/7, 12/13, and 4). Genetic ablation of MN-Ib largely eliminated tonic inputs, as expected, and completely prevented phasic innervation at the convergent muscle 6/7 NMJ. This dramatic change contrasts with the more subtle differences in MN-Is innervation following MN-Ib ablation at the muscle 1 NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, we found no evidence that phasic innervation ever occurred when tonic MNs were ablated, with no remnants of phasic postsynaptic structures remaining at the muscle target, while other muscle targets innervated by the same phasic input appeared largely unchanged. It appears MN-Is NMJs were never formed since no ‘synaptic footprints’ were observed, which are postsynaptic structures that remain after initial synaptogenesis and growth followed by MN retraction observed in neuromuscular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eaton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perry et al., 2017</xref>). The failure of phasic innervation following tonic ablation suggests that during development the tonic MN provides necessary ‘instructive’ cues for proper phasic innervation, akin to pioneer axons important for axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araújo and Tear, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raper and Mason, 2010</xref>). Tonic MN-Ib serving as guidance cues for phasic innervation may make sense given that each muscle target receives tonic innervation from a single MN, while phasic MNs innervate groups of multiple muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoang and Chiba, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, ablation of phasic MN-Is inputs was the only condition in which we found evidence for adaptive structural and functional heterosynaptic plasticity at tonic MN-Ib inputs. It was in this condition where clear evidence for adaptive heterosynaptic structural plasticity was also reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, BoNT-C silencing establishes that loss of neurotransmission from the phasic input per se is not sufficient to induce any adaptive heterosynaptic plasticity. Rather, physical loss of the phasic input must provide an instructive cue, perhaps through signaling from peripheral glia and/or the common muscle target, that elicits adaptive plasticity at the remaining tonic input.</p><p>It would be appealing if loss of transmission from one input could induce a homeostatic adjustment at the convergent input that maintains stable postsynaptic excitation. Clearly this is not the case at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. BoNT-C expression in the tonic input depresses transmission by ~1/3, while loss of phasic transmission reduces NMJ strength by ~2/3, with no evidence of heterosynaptic plasticity observed. In our study and in other cases where heterosynaptic plasticity has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aponte-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), the seemingly adaptive changes in synaptic growth or function are quite subtle, nowhere near the levels that would be necessary to restore basal levels of transmission. For example, total bouton number remained highly reduced following phasic MN-Is ablation (wild-type: 52 ± 1.5; Is&gt;rpr.hid: 32 ± 0.8 bouton numbers), with a corresponding reduction in synaptic strength (wild-type: 32.6 ± 2.2 mV; Is&gt;rpr.hid: 14.2 ± 0.7 mV EPSP values). However, while loss of transmission or innervation to a particular target muscle does not induce homeostatic plasticity, a converse manipulation, in which innervation is biased between adjacent muscle targets, does elicit two distinct forms of target-specific homeostatic plasticity that stabilizes synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis and Goodman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goel et al., 2020</xref>). Hyper-innervation of both tonic and phasic inputs on muscle 6 homeostatically reduces release probability from both inputs without any obvious postsynaptic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis and Goodman, 1998</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goel et al., 2019b</xref>). In contrast, hypo-innervation of both tonic and phasic inputs on the adjacent muscle 7 leads to no functional changes in the neurons, while a homeostatic enhancement in postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance compensates for reduced transmitter release to restore synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goel et al., 2020</xref>). Illuminating the complex synaptic dialogue between pre- and postsynaptic compartments within and between common targets will clarify how adaptive and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are engaged in at NMJs and in motor circuits in general.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pielage et al., 2005</xref>)</title><p>Experimental flies were raised at 25°C on standard molasses food.

Recordings were performed on an Olympus BX61 WI microscope using a ×40/0.80 NA water-dipping objective and acquired using an Axoclamp 900A amplifier, Digidata 1440A acquisition system, and pClamp 10.5 software (Molecular Devices). mEPSPs were recorded in the absence of any stimulation. EPSPs were recorded by delivering 20 electrical stimulations at 0.5 Hz with 0.5 ms duration to MNs using an ISO-Flex stimulus isolator (A.M.P.I.) with stimulus intensities set to avoid multiple EPSPs. All recordings were made on abdominal muscle 6 in segments A2 or A3 of third-instar larvae of both sexes.

Imaging was performed in modified HL-3 saline with 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> added using a Zeiss Examiner A1 widefield microscope equipped with a ×63/1.0 NA water immersion objective. NMJs on muscle 6 were imaged at a frequency of 100 fps (512 × 256 pixels) with a 470 nm LED light source (Thorlabs) using a PCO sCMOS4.2 camera. Spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were imaged at NMJs during 120 s imaging sessions from at least two different larvae. Evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were induced by delivering 10 electrical stimulations at 0.5 Hz. Horizontal drifting was corrected using ImageJ plugins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li, 2008</xref>) and imaging data with severe muscle movements were rejected as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). Three regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected using the outer edge of terminal Ib boutons observed by baseline GCaMP signals with ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Ib and Is boutons were defined by baseline GCaMP8f fluorescence levels, which are two- to threefold higher at Ib NMJs compared to their Is counterparts at a particular muscle. Fluorescence intensities were measured as the mean intensity of all pixels in each individual ROI. ΔF for a spontaneous event was calculated by subtracting the baseline GCaMP fluorescence level F from the peak intensity of the GCaMP signal during each spontaneous event at a particular bouton as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Baseline GCaMP fluorescence was defined as the average fluorescence of 2 s in each ROI without spontaneous events. ΔF/F was calculated by normalizing ΔF to baseline signal F. For each ROI under consideration, the spontaneous event ΔF/F value was averaged for all events in the 60 s time range to obtain the mean quantal size for each bouton. First-instar larvae were prepared in ice-cold HL-3 saline with 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> added without dissection. Spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were acquired through cuticles of first-instar larvae with the same protocol described above.

For fluorescence intensity quantifications of BRP, vGlut, GluRIIA, GluRIIB, and GluRIID, z-stacks were obtained on the same day using identical gain and laser power settings with z-axis spacing between 0.15 and 0.20 µm for all genotypes within an individual experiment. Maximum intensity projections were utilized for quantitative image analysis using the general analysis toolkit of NIS Elements software. The fluorescence intensity levels of BRP, vGlut, GluRIIA, GluRIIB, and GluRIID immunostaining were quantified by applying intensity thresholds and filters to binary layers in the 405 nm, 488 nm, or 561 nm channels. The mean intensity for each channel was quantified by obtaining the average total fluorescence signal for each individual punctum and dividing this value by the puncta area. The mean area of each GluR puncta was measured and defined as GluR puncta size. A mask was created around the HRP channel, used to define the neuronal membrane, and only puncta within this mask were analyzed to eliminate background signals. Boutons were defined as vGlut puncta, and DLG co-staining was used to define boutons at MN-Is vs. -Ib NMJs. NMJ area was measured as the sum area of all boutons labeled by HRP. All measurements based on confocal images were taken from synapses acquired from at least six different animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>EM analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goel et al., 2019a</xref>). Wandering third-instar larvae were dissected in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HL-3 and then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M cacodylate buffer at 4°C. Larvae were then washed three times for 20 min in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. The larval pelts were then placed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing the larva twice with cacodylate and twice with water, larvae were then dehydrated in ethanol. Samples were cleared in propylene oxide and infiltrated with 50% Eponate 12 in propylene oxide overnight. The following day, samples were embedded in fresh Eponate 12. EM sections were obtained on a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope (FEI). NMJs were serial sectioned at a 60–70 nm thickness. The sections were mounted on Formvar-coated single-slot grids and viewed at a 23,000 magnification and were recorded with a Megaview II CCD camera. Images were analyzed using the general analysis toolkit in the NIS Elements software and ImageJ software. Active zone area was measured by defining a circle area with a diameter of the length of the active zone dense at the center of T-bar structure. Synaptic vesicle density was analyzed by vesicle numbers normalized to active zone area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 7.0) or Microsoft Excel software (version 16.22).

This is critical for interpretation of the dataset.</p><p>2. The authors should do a more careful developmental study of synapse maturation, particularly PSD development, to assay if the block in synaptic transmission (assuming it occurs early on) leads to delay in PSD maturation, or simply has no effect.

Assaying PSD length and GluRIIA/B distribution in 1st and 2nd instars, where they would have more temporal control to examine activity-dependent PSD development, would be useful. Perhaps at earlier time points the authors would see a delay in PSD/GluR field maturation, but that this difference is less apparent at older synapses where delays might be masked.

Because they see a sum 33 mV EPSP and a IB of 9.5 mV and a Is of 23 mV doesn't really mean anything other than the Is has a stronger output, as has been previously shown by numerous labs. Without voltage clamp, it becomes harder and harder to depolarize the muscle as you get further from the resting potential. It is not a linear response, as it takes more output and SV fusion events to depolarize the muscle by 33 mV that would be accounted for by a simple addition of 10 and 23 mV like they suggest.

Determine precisely when BoNT-C blocks synaptic transmission. Is embryonic transmission completely blocked or does the blockage occur later in development? This is critical for interpretation of the dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important point and one that deserves further characterization. BoNT-C is a potent enzyme that cleaves synaptic SNARE complexes (Dong et al., 2019), so we expect that as soon as BoNT-C is synthesized it should work to rapidly and persistently block transmission. Therefore, it is important to establish when in development the three GAL4 drivers we use in this study (OK319, Is, and Ib) are expressed and confirm that transmission is blocked when this expression happens. Two complementary approaches discussed below indicate that BoNT-C silences transmission at early developmental stages (by at least 24H AEL).</p><p>First, we have driven a UAS-CD4::tdGFP reporter with each driver and determined when GFP is observed at NMJ terminals. In both OK319&gt;GFP and Is&gt;GFP, we observed strong neural expression by stage 17 embryos (data not shown), along with clear GFP staining at NMJ terminals by early first-instar larvae (24-28 hours after egg lay; AEL), which persisted through second instar stages (48H AEL). Similarly, with Ib&gt;GFP, we observed weak but apparent neural GFP staining in stage 17 embryos and NMJ terminals at early first- and second-instar larvae. This data is shown in a new Supplementary Figure S2 and discussed.</p><p>Second, to assess whether synaptic transmission was silenced at early developmental stages, we have performed ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in postsynaptic compartments using the SynapGCaMP8f reporter we generated in this study. Although robust spontaneous activity was observed at wild-type NMJs at early first instar stages (24-28H AEL), no GCaMP8f signals were observed at Is or Ib NMJs of OK319&gt;BoNT-C, Is NMJs of Is&gt;BoNT-C, or Ib NMJs of Ib&gt;BoNT-C. This data is shown in a new Supplementary Figure S2 and discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As previously reported, DLG structure at the NMJ is not well organized until 2<sup>nd</sup> instar stages (Lahey et al., 1994; Mathew et al., 2002), so we focused our characterization on glutamate receptor maturation at the PSD. We find that GluRIIA and GluRIID levels and localization are similar to wild type controls following BoNT-C silencing at both first- and second-instar NMJs, including the mean fluorescence intensity, bouton number, GluR puncta size and number, and PSD area. These results are now presented in a new Supplementary Figure S6. While we find no obvious evidence to suggest that PSD maturation is delayed in BoNT-C silenced NMJs compared to wild type, we agree with the reviewers that we cannot rule out more subtle changes in the timing of synaptic development. Thus, we have also revised our language in relevant parts of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please discuss why the block in synaptic transmission does not trigger the PHP response the authors have previously described with enhanced BRP accumulation at presynaptic AZs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute point raised the reviewers and certainly one worthy of discussion. Genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of postsynaptic glutamate receptors at the fly NMJ leads to the induction of retrograde signaling and enhanced presynaptic neurotransmitter release, referred to as Presynaptic Homeostatic Potentiation (PHP). As the reviewers point out, part of this homeostatic signaling system involves remodeling of the presynaptic active zone with an apparent increase in the size and intensity of active zone components, including BRP. Although the induction mechanism for how this process works is enigmatic, what is clear is that genetic loss or pharmacological perturbation of GluRIIA-containing receptors is absolutely required (Davis and Müller, 2015; Frank et al., 2020; Goel and Dickman, 2021). There is no evidence that loss or inhibition of presynaptic activity alone is capable of inducing PHP (or active zone remodeling), and in fact there is evidence that PHP can be induced in the absence of synaptic activity (Frank et al., 2006; Goel et al., 2017; Kikuma et al., 2019). Therefore, the active zone remodeling observed in PHP is not expected to be triggered in BoNT-C silenced synapses, since GluRIIA-containing receptors are present and unperturbed (Figure 4). We have added a discussion of these important points and thank the reviewers for raising this interesting issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Can the authors provide a discussion of why their BoNT-C does not block all post-Golgi traffic given Syx1 is required for both SV fusion and post-Golgi vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also an astute and important point, and we agree the target of BoNT-C in neurons should be discussed more thoroughly. Although the reviewers are correct that Syx1 is involved in both regulated (synaptic vesicle fusion) and constitutive (post-Golgi) membrane trafficking in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Schulze et al., 1995), there are 10 <italic>Drosophila syntaxin</italic> genes (and 3 Syx1A isoforms), which may be partially redundant in constitutive membrane trafficking (e.g. syx16; see (Xu et al., 2002)). Further, there is evidence that BoNT activity is variable depending on the tissue it is expressed (Dong et al., 2019), and cleavage assays in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells determined that each toxin cleaves its SNARE substrate with variable efficiency (Backhaus et al., 2016). Finally, clostridial SNARE toxins are known to preferentially target specific SNARE components when in particular complexes. For example, a new BoNT variant termed “BoNT-X” was recently shown to effectively proteolyze VAMP4/VAMP5/Ykt6. VAMP4 is found on Golgiderived vesicles that traffic to late endosomes, where it forms a trans-SNARE complex with the QSNARE complex Stx6/Stx7/Vti1b (Zhang et al., 2017). It seems that this processivity is unique for the BoNT-X/VAMP4 pairing and based on subtle differences in the protease recognition site of the substrate, rendering VAMP4 refractory to other BoNT serotypes. Hence, a similar BoNT-C/substrate mismatch may prevent cleavage of non-synaptic Syx components, at least in neurons. We have added a discussion of these important points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The idea that 'composite values of Is and Ib neurotransmission can be fully recapitulated by isolated physiology from each input' (Figure 7) is not a new experiment and the idea of &quot;reconstitution of wild-type NMJ physiology&quot; by simply summing up evoked responses using sharp electrode recordings is questionable. Because they see a sum 33 mV EPSP and a IB of 9.5 mV and a Is of 23 mV doesn't really mean anything other than the Is has a stronger output, as has been previously shown by numerous labs. Without voltage clamp, it becomes harder and harder to depolarize the muscle as you get further from the resting potential. It is not a linear response, as it takes more output and SV fusion events to depolarize the muscle by 33 mV that would be accounted for by a simple addition of 10 and 23 mV like they suggest. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, we do not think it is accurate to assert that the component values of Is and Ib fully recapitulating wild type physiology (blended Is+Ib) shown in Figure 7 is “not a new experiment”. The reviewer is correct that qualitative, relative differences between Is vs Ib physiology have been reported previously (Hoang and Chiba, 2001; Karunanithi et al., 2002; Lnenicka and Keshishian, 2000; Lu et al., 2016; Pawlu et al., 2004), or evoked but not miniature transmission was separated (Genç and Davis, 2019; Sauvola et al., 2021). However, the term “neurotransmission” refers to quantitative, electrophysiological analysis of both miniature and evoked synaptic activity. To our knowledge, complete neurotransmission (fully isolated electrophysiological miniature and evoked activity) has never been achieved previously from entire MN-Is vs MN-Ib NMJs, nor shown to recapitulate the behavior of wild type (blended Is+Ib transmission). Hence, while previous studies have, for example, indeed shown that evoked transmission from MN-Is is stronger than from MN-Ib (Genç and Davis, 2019; Lu et al., 2016), miniature electrophysiological activity in these studies was not isolated, making it impossible to accurately determine quantal content and other fundamental parameters of synaptic function. Therefore, the data presented in Figure 7 is not only a new experiment which, for the first time, reveals complete, quantitatively accurate electrophysiological isolation of all neurotransmission from MN-Is or MN-Ib, but is perhaps the most important data to clearly establish baseline transmission from Is or Ib. Furthermore, this crucial data is <italic>absolutely necessary</italic> for any conclusions to be drawn about whether heterosynaptic functional plasticity is induced after manipulating Is or Ib. Indeed, the failure to accurately establish baseline synaptic function (miniature and evoked events) from Is vs Ib was a major confound in previous studies on heterosynaptic plasticity that precluded an accurate conclusion about whether heterosynaptic functional plasticity was actually observed.</p><p>The reviewer does bring up an important point related to nonlinear summation, which may obscure the actual depolarization induced when recorded in sharp electrode current clamp configuration. Generally, there are little voltage-gated currents induced when <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval muscles are depolarized less than ~40 mV (Miyamoto, 1978; Stevens, 1976), minimizing the potential impacts of non-linear summation, which is why the field continues to perform current clamp electrophysiology at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ at lowered extracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (0.4 mM ca<sup>2+</sup> in this study). However, we agree that two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) configuration would be a more accurate way to demonstrate the crucial point that composite values of Is and Ib neurotransmission can accurately match wild type (blended Is+Ib) transmission as shown in Figure 7.</p><p>Therefore, we have now included complete TEVC electrophysiology (miniature and evoked activity) in the same conditions as previously shown for current clamp data. This data demonstrates the same quantitative reconstitution of wild-type neurotransmission from composite Is and Ib isolated by BoNT-C silencing. This data is now presented in a new Supplementary Figure S7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors should clarify what has really already been done – both with respect to BoNT-C as well as in terms of selective Is and Ib manipulations. The authors do not appropriately cite the previous BoNT-C Backhaus et al., 2016 paper. This is misleading because Backhaus not only tested cleavage targets of BoNTs, but actually showed UAS-BoNT-C to disrupt transmission but also to kill the animals when expressed in muscle, suggesting non-SV fusion targets are also being affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these points, some of which was raised and responded to in point 4 above. First, we note that we have an open and collegial relationship with Prof Langenham (author on the Backhaus et al., paper) and have discussed several of these issues at length with him over the course of this study. Given our discussions, we would like to summarize several important points. First, all the transgenic BoNT transgenic fly lines described in Backhaus 2016 were lost by the time we contacted Prof Langenham in 2019 to discuss our preliminary findings on the BoNT transgenes we engineered and characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We had, ideally, wanted to compare the lines described in the 2016 study with our own, but were unable due to their loss. Second, Backhaus et al., found that each BoNT cleaves its substrate in S2 cells with variable efficiency, which is likely to be even more variable given the complex cellular environment in neurons and across diverse other tissues with a variety of SNARE complexes involved in regulated or constitutive trafficking. Third, only lethality and behavior (peristaltic movements and visiondependent motion) were used by Backhaus et al., to assess BoNT activity in vivo; <italic>synaptic physiology was not</italic>, <italic>in fact</italic>, <italic>ever directly assessed</italic>. Given these issues, it is difficult to compare the Backhaus et al., findings with the behavior of our BoNT-C in motor neurons in this study. That being said, we do agree that it is worthwhile to relay the following points and update the relevant areas in the manuscript.</p><p>First, like Backhaus et al., we observed variable phenotypes with the various BoNT transgenic flies we engineered, not only between individual BoNT transgenes but even comparing different inserts of the same transgene. For example, different BoNT-A and BoNT-E transgenic inserts were lethal when crossed to elav-Gal4 (pan-neuronal driver), while other inserts were viable. Furthermore, there was a rather large disconnect between the severity of lethality following expression of the transgene (in either neurons or muscle) and the impact on neurotransmission. For example, BoNT-B appeared to be highly toxic, requiring injection of &gt;800 embryos to get a single viable insert. Although this BoNT-B insert was indeed highly toxic, leading to lethality when expressed in neurons, expression in motor neurons hardly impacted NMJ transmission (see Table S1). In contrast, we obtained a single BoNT-C transgene after injecting ~100 embryos, which was also lethal when expressed in all neurons. However, BoNT-C expression in motor neurons completely blocked all neurotransmission.</p><p>In terms of toxicity when expressed in non-neural tissue, we also observe that our BoNT-C transgene and other BoNT variants are lethal when expressed in muscle (Table S1). As discussed in our response to point 4 above, there are many potential SNARE targets for BoNT-C cleavage in muscle that may not be shared in motor neurons. Thus, the actual behavior of any specific BoNT transgene likely is impacted not only by the BoNT toxin itself but also influenced by other factors such as the strength of expression, transgenic insertion site, tissue in which it is expressed, specific SNARE complexes in each tissue, etc.</p><p>We have now more fully discussed these points in the revised methods and discussion.</p><p>References</p><p>Aponte-Santiago, N.A., Ormerod, K.G., Akbergenova, Y., and Littleton, J.T.
