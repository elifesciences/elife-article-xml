Here, disease-specific characteristics of this synchronization and the dopamine-dependence of its scaling in Parkinson’s disease are investigated. In 16 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery, movements of different velocities revealed that subthalamic gamma power peaked in the sensorimotor part of the subthalamic nucleus, correlated positively with maximal velocity and negatively with symptom severity. These effects relied on movement-related bursts of transient synchrony in the gamma band. The gamma burst rate highly correlated with averaged power, increased gradually with larger movements and correlated with symptom severity. In the dopamine-depleted state, gamma power and burst rate significantly decreased, particularly when peak velocity was slower than ON medication. Burst amplitude and duration were unaffected by the medication state. We propose that insufficient recruitment of fast gamma bursts during movement may underlie bradykinesia as one of the cardinal symptoms in Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31895.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parkinson’s disease is a disorder of the nervous system that affects more than 1% of people over the age of 60. Symptoms include uncontrollable shaking or tremor, and difficulty with large or fast movements. These symptoms occur when neurons that produce the chemical dopamine die. The loss of dopamine disrupts the activity of structures deep within the brain called the basal ganglia, which normally control movement.</p><p>Some patients with Parkinson’s disease benefit from a treatment known as deep brain stimulation. Electrodes are lowered into the brain to stimulate part of the basal ganglia called the subthalamic nucleus. But we can also use these electrodes to record the activity of neurons. Doing so reveals that during movement, neurons in the subthalamic nucleus coordinate their firing at a frequency of 40 to 90 hertz. This is known as gamma synchronization.</p><p>Lofredi et al. now reveal that patients with Parkinson’s disease, who do not take any medication, show reduced gamma synchronization. The greater the loss of synchronization, the more slowly patients move. Gamma synchronization does not occur continuously during a movement, but instead occurs in brief bursts. Patients with Parkinson’s disease show a reduction in the number of bursts, but not in their duration or intensity.</p><p>Measuring bursts of gamma synchronization may help reveal what is happening inside the brain of a patient with Parkinson’s disease in real time. This could lead to improvements in deep brain stimulation therapy. At present, electrodes stimulate the basal ganglia continuously, but this can lead to side-effects. In the future, it may be possible to apply stimulation only when there is too little synchrony. This could reduce side effects and make the treatment more effective.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>Bradykinesia</kwd><kwd>deep brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>subthalamic nucleus</kwd><kwd>gamma oscillations</kwd><kwd>gamma bursts</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG KFO247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühn</surname><given-names>Andrea A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease may be associated to a dopamine-dependent recruitment failure of subthalamic activity in short bursts of gamma synchrony.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oscillatory brain rhythms are thought to contribute to the processing and long-range transmission of information as encoded in single-neuron activity through coherence of neuronal assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fries, 2015</xref>). Pathological oscillatory patterns could be related to disease-specific symptoms in Parkinson’s disease using invasive recordings in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery for severe movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deuschl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dams et al., 2016</xref>). Most strikingly, an elevated synchronization in the subthalamic beta band activity is found in Parkinson’s disease that correlates with symptom severity in the dopamine-depleted state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neumann et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kühn and Volkmann, 2017</xref>) and is attenuated by dopaminergic replacement therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2009</xref>) as well as deep brain stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eusebio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Hemptinne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oswal et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to pathological activity at rest, less is known about the functional role of physiological movement-related changes of oscillatory patterns in the cortico-basal ganglia motor loop. In the human motor system, ongoing movement is accompanied by increases in cortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheyne, 2013</xref>) and subcortical gamma (30–90 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Androulidakis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kempf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brücke et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2013</xref>) and strengthening of coupling in that frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Litvak et al., 2012</xref>). Cortical and subcortical movement-related gamma band synchronization seems a general and physiological phenomenon irrespective of the underlying disease. The power increase in high frequencies most likely relies on mechanistically different phenomena with a primarily oscillatory component in the frequency range 30–90 Hz and overlapping asynchronous spiking activity in frequencies &gt;100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fries et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>). Previous studies have shown that narrowband increases in gamma oscillations with a center frequency between 30–90 Hz and ~20 Hz width were of functional significance in encoding of movement parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this, human and animal studies have implicated that the basal ganglia play a major role in scaling of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desmurget et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grafton and Tunik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brücke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). The loss of their physiological activity may lead to hypo- or hyperkinetic movement disorders. Whether the encoding of movement scaling through subcortical oscillatory activity in the gamma band is dopamine-dependent, thus impaired in PD patients after withdrawal of dopaminergic medication, and correlates with movement slowing in the OFF dopaminergic state of the same patient, has to our knowledge never been investigated. Moreover, recent studies have highlighted that both task-specific and resting state oscillatory synchronization do not reflect a continuous activity but rather occur in bursts. While this has been primarily shown for beta activity in the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>), intracerebral recordings of cortical areas highlighted an encoding capacity through variations of gamma burst density in memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kucewicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>). In Parkinson’s disease, there is emerging evidence for a disadvantageous distribution toward long beta bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>). In the gamma frequency range, neither the phenomenon of transient synchrony in motor processing nor how it may be influenced by dopamine signaling has so far been investigated. Here, we aimed at elucidating the patho-physiological role of velocity-related subthalamic gamma oscillations and their modulation by dopamine in patients with Parkinson’s disease. We hypothesized that movement-induced gamma oscillations that have been shown to drive the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Litvak et al., 2012</xref>) are gradually scaled by kinematic velocity as seen in the upstream globus pallidus internus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brücke et al., 2012</xref>), the main projection-target of the subthalamic nucleus and major output nucleus of the basal ganglia. A coding deficiency in modulating subcortical gamma signaling through reduced burst rate in the hypodopaminergic state may contribute to the underlying pathomechanism of bradykinesia, one of the cardinal symptoms in Parkinson’s disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral results</title><p>The mean reaction time (±SEM) of the 16 patients was 651 ± 176 ms across all trials, which was similar (p=0.3, permutation test) to the reaction time in the subgroup of seven patients that additionally performed the task after withdrawal of the dopaminergic therapy (reaction time-OFF: 622 ± 43 ms; small: 613 ± 43 ms, medium: 617 ± 39 ms, large: 637 ± 47 ms).

In all conditions, movement onset was preceded and accompanied by an ERS in the theta frequency range (2 to 8 Hz) and an ERD in the beta band (13 to 30 Hz). The theta ERS started ~1.2 s before movement onset and persisted up to ~2.7 s after movement onset. The beta ERD started later (~0.4 s before movement onset) and ended about ~1.7 s after movement onset. In addition, a pronounced synchronization in the gamma frequency range, spreading from 35 to 100 Hz, started shortly before movement onset at about ~0.3 s and persisted up to ~1.4 s for the smallest and ~3 s for the largest movement. This gamma synchronization during movement seems to segue into a post-movement beta ERS.

This revealed a significantly stronger synchronization in the gamma band when aligned on maximal velocity (14.5%) compared to maximal amplitude (6.9%, p&lt;0.001) and movement onset (12.3%, p=0.02), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In all patients, there was a positive correlation between contralateral gamma band power (40–90 Hz, ±0.5 s around maximal velocity) and the maximally reached velocity on a single-trial level that was significant in 8/16 patients. We further investigated the correlation for the entire spectrum of oscillatory activity and maximal velocity on a single-trial level separately for the hemispheres ipsi- and contralateral to the moved hand. When averaging the resulting correlation plots across all patients, a weak but significant positive correlation between relative power changes in the subthalamic nucleus contralateral to the moved hand and maximal velocity within a trial extended from 24 to 95 Hz and −400 to +600 ms around maximal velocity (p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The significant cluster was prominent in the gamma band and reflects a finely tuned scaling of velocity-related power changes on a single-trial level. Importantly, the subthalamic nucleus ipsilateral to the movement side lacked correlation between velocity and relative power changes. The significant correlation between relative power changes and behavior on a single-trial level was specific for velocity. Other tested parameters such as reaction time, amplitude and accuracy did not significantly correlate across all patients on a single-trial level. To control for a potential fatigue effect leading to decreased peak velocity over trials or a subsequent compensatory mechanism in the gamma band, we investigated a potential systematic change of movement velocity or gamma band activity over the course of the experiment. There was no significant correlation between either variables over trials (Spearman’s Rho = −0.09, p=0.3) making a systematic fatigue effect unlikely. Correlation between motor impairment as assessed by the UPDRS-ON score and averaged relative power changes around maximal velocity showed a negative correlation between both mean theta (Spearman’s ρ = −0.73, p=0.006) and mean gamma power (Spearman’s ρ = −0.55, p=0.038) and the individual UPDRS-ON score as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

While movement was accompanied by a broadband increase in high frequency activity (40–150 Hz), the parametric modulation with maximal movement velocity on a single-trial level was spectrally restricted to a narrow gamma band (40–90 Hz) in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, we hypothesize that two co-occurring phenomena take place in the subthalamic nucleus during movement: a narrowband gamma oscillation that scales with motor output and an asynchronous broadband activity that may reflect local spiking activity without a direct behavioral correlate. The synchronization of narrowband gamma power during movement was not continuous but occurred in bursts. The increase of burst rate correlated with higher average of gamma power during movement. Both increase in movement-related gamma power and gamma burst rate correlated negatively with parkinsonian motor impairment, as assessed by the UPDRS-III score. In the OFF medication state, the parametric increase in gamma power with faster movements was lost and gamma burst rates significantly decreased in parallel with apparent movement slowing when patients had to perform the large movement condition. The evanescence of gradual gamma recruitment in rapid consecutive bursts during movement might therefore play a crucial role in the appearance of bradykinesia as one of the cardinal symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Movement-related changes in the theta and beta band showed no velocity-related modulation and were similarly pronounced bilaterally. The relative power change around maximal velocity was not dopamine dependent. However, beta desynchronization was significantly stronger in the ON vs OFF condition, when trials were aligned to movement onset, which may indicate an association of beta decrease with movement initiation. Movement-related averaged theta band synchronization correlated positively with the individual UPDRS score ON medication, highlighting its potential prokinetic role in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jenkinson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Before further discussing the significance of our findings in detail, some of the limitations of this study should be emphasized. First and foremost, the experiments were conducted in patients with Parkinson’s disease only; given the invasive character of intracranial recordings, no healthy control group could be tested which limits the generalizability of the reported results. However, as patients performed the task on their regular medication, the physiological basal ganglia activity was restored to the greatest possible extent. Previous studies that report similar movement-induced oscillatory changes across several nuclei of the basal ganglia in patients with different pathologies such as tremor or dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Androulidakis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brücke et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2013</xref>) and healthy non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtemanche et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connolly et al., 2015</xref>) further suggest generalizability to the physiological brain. While the study was designed to explore changes in gamma activity with movement amplitude and velocity, grip strength was not monitored. Therefore, varying grip forces across trials are may have added to the association of movement velocity and gamma activity. However, rotation of the handle required a coordinated movement of proximal and distal arm muscles. Maximal movement velocity correlated across trials and patients with gamma activity, which is unlikely related to sole changes in grip strength. Regarding the comparison to neuronal activation patterns in the OFF medication condition, it has to be considered that recordings shortly after deep brain stimulation surgery may be confounded by a transitional symptom alleviation due to electrode implantation and consecutive edema, the so-called stun effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mann et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, 4 out of 11 patients recorded OFF medication were not included in the direct ON/OFF comparison, as they showed no relevant deterioration in symptom severity. Another inherent limitation is the lack of histological verification of correct electrode position inside the subthalamic nucleus in deep brain stimulation patients. Nevertheless, electrode placement was guided by intraoperative microelectrode recordings and controlled postoperatively using the Lead-DBS toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn and Kühn, 2015</xref>). Moreover, effective intraoperative macrostimulation and a mean improvement of ~54% in motor symptoms (as assessed by UPDRS-III score) during chronic deep brain stimulation provide further evidence for correct deep brain stimulation lead location. Bipolar recordings of adjacent contact pairs additionally assure the focal origin of the analyzed local field potentials by avoiding volume conduction from more distant areas. The recordings from DBS-macro electrodes did not allow assessment of multi-unit activity. The overlap of changes in gamma power with asynchronous bursts of local spiking activity thus cannot be addressed conclusively. Indeed, broad gamma synchronization spreading between 30 and 200 Hz can be contaminated by parallel increases in neuronal firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pesaran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rasch et al., 2008</xref>). However, the narrowband gamma peaks in averaged power spectra during movement and the spectrally distinct (40–90 Hz) correlations to maximal velocity hint toward modulations in rhythmic activity instead of an uncoordinated increase in local neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fries et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Movement-related gamma synchronization reflects movement velocity or motor motivation</title><p>The basal ganglia are suggested to play a pivotal role in both movement initiation and execution. Because gamma synchrony of cortical and subcortical structures accompanies movement rather than preceding it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Androulidakis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brücke et al., 2012</xref>), it seems less related to motor planning than to monitoring or execution of ongoing movement without primarily depending on somatosensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). Velocity-dependent scaling of gamma band activity has been interpreted as physiological motor function in the internal globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brücke et al., 2012</xref>), the major efferent target of the subthalamic nucleus. Interestingly, subthalamic efferences have recently been shown to entrain the activity in downstream structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>) and gamma synchrony seems to play an important role in such network communication(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fries et al., 2007</xref>). The motor circuit is coupled in a narrow gamma band while movement is executed, a coupling that is strengthened by levodopa and shows an inverse correlation with symptom manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Litvak et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, movement execution is likely dependent on gamma-band synchronization in local and distant basal ganglia-cortex motor networks and its disturbances may lead to reduced motor vigor in Parkinson’s disease. Motor vigor describes the gain of the parameters for a purposive action, that is, speed or amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2015</xref>) and increasing evidence from animal models suggests that the encoding of motor vigor, with special emphasis on movement speed, is strongly dopamine dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</xref>). Several studies have shown in patients with Parkinson’s disease ON medication that subthalamic gamma synchrony scales with kinematic parameters albeit primarily focusing on force instead of velocity modulated movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anzak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). Given that patients with Parkinson’s disease OFF medication display increasingly bradykinetic and decrementing movements as signs of reduced motor vigor, the question arises whether dopamine affects the scaling capacity within the gamma frequency range. Indeed, ON-OFF medication comparisons in this regard have so far been missing, especially regarding movements that the patients are actually impaired in performing in the dopamine-depleted state. In the present study, the monitoring through gamma synchrony scaling turned out to be more precise ON than OFF medication as the general power decrease OFF medication was accompanied by a less discriminative modulation of gamma power that may have contributed to the slowing in peak-trial velocity in large and fast movements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Gamma synchronization occurs in bursts that reduce in rate in the dopamine-depleted state</title><p>In the basal ganglia, synchronization in the beta band has been shown to primarily rely on transient bursting activity that increases in rate during striatal post-movement beta synchronization in task-time-specific patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>). In the parkinsonian resting state, beta burst duration seems to be pathologically prolonged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>). So far, subcortical gamma synchronization as seen during motor performance has not been investigated in this regard while cortical gamma bursts seem to vary remarkably in rate during memory processing which has been attributed to a selective routing potential near the onset of oscillatory synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palmigiano et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we provide first evidence for discrete oscillatory dynamics in the gamma frequency range of the subthalamic nucleus during motor processing that showed increasing burst amplitude, duration and rate compared to baseline activity with the gamma burst rate correlating best with averaged increases of gamma power and showing similar scaling with movement velocity. Most interestingly, the movement-related bursting rate correlated with the patients’ clinical state and was significantly reduced in the dopamine-depleted state while burst amplitude and duration remained stable in both medication states. As complementary gamma and beta burst occurrence has been described in working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>), one could hypothesize that the afore evoked disadvantageous distribution toward long beta bursts in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>) would be more pronounced in the dopamine-depleted state thereby impeding fast repetitive synchronization in the gamma band that is needed for increasingly effortful movements. This could, however, not be tested here, as beta burst duration in Parkinson’s disease has been reported to rise above 1000 ms and performed movements did not exceed 600 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A spatially confined gamma oscillator in the dorsolateral subthalamic nucleus</title><p>The basal ganglia are functionally segregated into parallel cortico – subcortical loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</xref>) that result in partially overlapping segments of structural connectivity. We have recently reproduced this segregation on the level of resting oscillatory activity by demonstrating that the dorsolateral part of the subthalamic nucleus, most connected to cortical motor regions, was dominated by beta resting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accolla et al., 2016</xref>), whereas higher resting alpha power was associated with a more anterior recording location in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horn et al., 2017b</xref>). This study extends these findings to the precise localization of movement-related gamma synchronization. The significant correlation between contact pair location and movement-related gamma power indicates a spatially confined oscillator within the dorsolateral part of the subthalamic nucleus. Extracellular recordings of subthalamic neurons have previously characterized a somatotopic organization of the human subthalamic nucleus that showed higher local activity with arm movements localized more laterally than leg-related neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rodriguez-Oroz et al., 2001</xref>). Given that subjects in this study performed rotatory arm movements, the significant increase of gamma power toward more lateral electrode positions may relate to the somatotopic organization of the subthalamic nucleus. Interestingly, the percentage of units oscillating at gamma frequency correlates negatively with the bradykinesia scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharott et al., 2014</xref>) which additionally points toward a link between gamma oscillations and multi-unit activity as interconnected prokinetic features in the subthalamic network.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Disease-specific oscillations have reliably and repeatedly been associated to symptom severity – most prominently regarding the level of subthalamic resting beta synchrony in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silberstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neumann et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kühn and Volkmann, 2017</xref>). Its potential role in motor slowing is further supported by direct beta frequency stimulation effects at different nodes of the motor network leading to increased bradykinesia in Parkinson’s disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eusebio et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, synchronization in the gamma band using motor cortical transcranial alternating current stimulation speeds up movement in healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>) and deep brain stimulation at individual gamma band frequency improves motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsang et al., 2012</xref>). Our results provide additional evidence for a pathophysiological link between reduced movement-related gamma activity and Parkinson’s disease by showing a negative correlation between gamma synchronization during movement and motor impairment across 16 Parkinson’s disease patients. Moreover, our findings hint toward a potential marker for adaptive deep brain stimulation, considering that we were able to show that movement-related gamma synchronization indicates the current motor state in a spatially confined area while other disease-specific patterns such as the beta peak attenuates significantly during movement. Indeed, subthalamic activity in the gamma band has recently been used to decode the temporal profile of gripping force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2016</xref>), which further supports the notion of gamma activity comprising detailed information about specific aspects of movement performance rather than just encoding motor effort. This hypothesis is further supported by our finding that subthalamic gamma synchronization occurs in oscillatory bursts and seems to convey information by varying the rate of gamma bursts instead of their mere amplitude or duration which has been proven to be especially efficient in organizing information in distant networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palmigiano et al., 2017</xref>). The exact pattern of these discrete dynamics and their coding capacity within specific motor programs should be investigated in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and surgery</title><p>Sixteen patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (mean disease duration 11.8 years, range 4–20 years; mean age 59.5 years, range 39–75 years; four women; further clinical details given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) took part in this study. All participants provided written informed consent which was approved by the local review boards of the Charité- Universitätsmedizin Berlin and Hannover Medical School and in accordance with the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients underwent stereotactic functional neurosurgery for bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus. The surgical procedure has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kühn et al., 2005</xref>). Deep brain stimulation electrode extension cables were externalized for 1–7 days, offering access to subthalamic recording sites. The permanent quadripolar macroelectrode used was model 3389 (Medtronic Neurological Division, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with four platinum-iridium cylindrical surfaces (1.27 mm diameter, 1.5 mm length) and a center-to-center separation of 2 mm. Its contacts are numbered 0, 1, 2, and 3, with 0 being the most caudal and 3 the most cranial contact. The intended coordinates at the tip of the electrode (contact 0) were 12 mm from the midline, 0–4 mm behind the midcommissural point and 4–5 mm below the anterior-posterior commissure determined by T2-weighted magnetic resonance images adjusted to the individual patient’s anatomy. Electrode placement was refined by microelectrode recordings displaying typical activity patterns once the dorsal border of the subthalamic nucleus was reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hutchison et al., 1998</xref>), effective intra-operative macro-stimulation and postoperative stereotactic imaging. In all cases except of case 10 and 16, the electrode position was additionally controlled using the Lead-DBS toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn and Kühn, 2015</xref>) based on post-operative imaging. Specific methodology is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horn and Kühn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horn et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2017b</xref>). Briefly, postoperative acquisitions were linearly coregistered to preoperative acquisitions and normalized to standard stereotactic (ICBM 2009b NLIN Asym; ‘MNI’) space using DARTEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashburner, 2007</xref>) as implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox (SPM12; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/</ext-link>). Contacts can then be related to a version of the Morel atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morel, 2013</xref>) that was likewise defined in MNI space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jakab et al., 2012</xref>). All patients had at least one contact within the subthalamic nucleus based on postoperative imaging (except for the right electrode in Case 1). Specifically, 69/84 contact pairs (82%) of 14 patients had at least one contact inside the subthalamic nucleus. The remaining 15 contact pairs from 7 patients either lay below the edge of the target (Case 6: L01), dorso-lateral to the subthalamic border (Case 2: R23, L23; Case 8: R23, L23; Case 9: R23, L23; Case 13: R23, L23; Case 14: R23, L12, L23) or outside the subthalamic nucleus (Case 1: R01, R12, R23). Contact pairs outside the subthalamic nucleus (n = 15) were excluded from further analysis.

while patients engaged in a reaction time task in which they were asked to perform forearm pronation movements of 3 amplitudes (30°, 60° and 90°) in response to imperative visual cues. They were comfortably seated in front of a 15-inch laptop screen and held a light, rotatable grip with an integrated potentiometer that was able to sense rotatory movement. The investigator visually controlled for a steady posture and unchanged holding of the rotatory device throughout the recording session. On screen, the current handle position was shown as a red dot, the requested angular route as a black semicircle that changed to blue once the patient reached the target position. After 3 s, the color changed back to black, indicating that the patient should return to the starting position. The cues, labeled as ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’, were presented in randomized order and with inter-trial periods of 4 s (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Subjects were instructed to perform the task as quickly and accurately as possible. Before the LFP-recording a brief training session of 5–10 trials was performed. For each arm, patients performed at least 45 trials (15 per condition) during the recording session. The amplitude and duration of the presented cues and the consecutive rotation movements were recorded in parallel to local field potential signals via a 1401 DA converter using Spike 2 software. It has previously been shown in patients with idiopathic isolated dystonia that the three executed movement amplitudes also reflect different movement speed entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brücke et al., 2012</xref>), which we verified for the tested Parkinson’s disease patient cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Recordings</title><p>Recordings were made 1–4 days postoperatively while the deep brain stimulation electrodes were externalized. All patients performed experiments in 30–60 min following the intake of their regular dopaminergic medication (ON medication state). In 11/16 patients, experiments were also performed after they had been at least 12 hours withdrawn from dopaminergic medication. Patients were considered OFF medication when they showed <underline>&gt;</underline>30% UPDRS III score increase compared to UPDRS III score under dopaminergic substitution. 4 patients did not meet this criterion despite medication withdrawal, most likely due to the post-operative stun effect and were therefore not considered for further comparisons between the ON and OFF state. 10 patients performed the paradigm with both hands consecutively, four patients only with their left and two patients only with their right hand. In the OFF-medication state, an additional 2 patients performed it only with the left hand due to severe tremor or rigidity that obviated test performance in those patients. This led to a total of 26 sides from 16 patients in the ON-medication and 11 sides from 7 patients in the OFF-medication state that were finally analyzed. From the 7 patients included in the ON-OFF comparison, three performed the task first ON then OFF medication and 4 patients the other way around to limit order effect. Local field potentials were recorded in a bipolar montage between adjacent contact pairs (0–1, 1–2, 2–3). Signals were band-pass filtered between 1 and 250 Hz, amplified (x 50.000) using a D360 amplifier (Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, UK), and sampled at 1 kHz in parallel with the movement traces using a 1401 AD converter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analyses of both behavioral and electrophysiological data were performed in MATLAB (version R2016a; The MathWorks, Natick) using custom MATLAB code based on the Statistical Parametric Mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Litvak et al., 2011b</xref>Litvak et al., 2011) (SPM) and Fieldtrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) toolboxes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RoxanneLofredi/stn">https://github.com/RoxanneLofredi/stn</ext-link>). Continuous recordings were divided into epochs of 5 s (−2 to +3 s around movement onset of each trial). Fifth order butterworth, high-pass (&gt;1 Hz) and notch filters (48–52 Hz) were applied to limit effects of line noise. Epochs were rejected from further analysis if they contained artifacts and saturation in the local field potentials trace or abnormalities in the movement trace, leaving a mean (±SEM) of 27.6 ± 10.8 remaining trials in the ON-medication state and 27.0 ± 9.0 (mean ±SEM) in the OFF-medication state per hand and per condition for final analysis. The time points of the maximal amplitude (maxA), maximal velocity (maxV) and movement onset (MO) of each trial were automatically detected on the basis of the movement trace. Maximal amplitude was set as the highest point in the movement trace per trial. The velocity trace was defined as the first derivative of the movement trace and its highest point as maximal velocity. Movement onset was automatically defined as the time point where 10% of the peak-trial velocity were reached. All automatically defined time points were visually checked and adjusted if necessary. Reaction time was calculated as the interval between the imperative visual cue and movement onset. Accuracy was defined as the percentage deviation of a reference scaling movement, performed before starting the task. To investigate the changes in local field potential activity in the time-frequency domain, a time-frequency decomposition based on Morlet wavelets with seven cycles was applied to the local field potential recordings of all contact pairs from each trial. Local field potentials were analyzed over frequencies between 1 and 100 Hz with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz. Event-related local field potential power change was subsequently normalized in percentage relative to an averaged pre-trial baseline period (−2 to 0.5 s preceding the visual cue), smoothed over 6 Hz and 200 ms and averaged using robust averaging across trials and contact of pairs of the same patient. Normalized time frequency plots of each movement condition (small, medium, large) were aligned to movement onset, maximal velocity and maximal amplitude, averaged across contacts, hemispheres (ipsi- and contralateral) and patients for visualization. If not otherwise indicated, analyses were separately performed for both subthalamic nuclei ipsi- and contralateral to the moved hand.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Selection of time-frequency bands</title><p>For the main analysis, distinct frequency ranges and a time period of interest were designated. Frequency bands were determined according to significant cluster of movement-related modulation in the grand average from all patients during movement (0–500 ms after movement onset; theta-band 2–8 Hz and beta-band 13–30 Hz). As the study focuses on velocity-related modulation of gamma activity, the gamma band was restricted to the frequency range that showed modulation between conditions (gamma-band 40–90 Hz), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. In order to compare varying movement characteristics, mean power changes were averaged around a time period of 500 ms following movement onset, which included significant differences in amplitude and velocity as seen in the behavioral results while assuring an ongoing movement in all conditions. Thus, if not indicated otherwise, power changes averaged over time and frequency refer to the mean power changes in the theta, beta or gamma band from time points 0 to 0.5 s after movement onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Relative power changes in averaged time-frequency plots</title><p>We examined whether power changes averaged across all patients differed from baseline during movement, and compared time-frequency bins between the 3 task conditions (small, medium, large). We then tested if movement-related oscillatory patterns differed between the ipsi- and contralateral subthalamic nucleus to the moved hand by comparing averaged relative power changes in the predefined theta, beta and gamma bands. Mean relative power changes as seen when aligned on movement onset were juxtaposed to an alignment on the time points maximal velocity and maximal amplitude, in order to identify the condition that reflected best the maximal relative power change. Then, mean relative power changes in the 3 predefined time-frequency ranges were compared between conditions to determine an eventual parametric modulation of event-related changes in oscillatory activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Correlation between event-related power changes and behavioral parameters and clinical state</title><p>To evaluate the temporal and spectral specificity of movement-related oscillatory activity, the within-patient correlation between maximal inter-trial velocity and power changes in each time-frequency bin was calculated on a single-trial level (Spearman’s ρ) and results were tested for significance using one sample tests. In the same way, oscillatory activity was also correlated with single-trial amplitude, accuracy and reaction time. On a group level, correlation coefficients of the entire power spectra from all patients were tested against the null hypothesis using permutation tests and False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. Relative power changes in the subthalamic nucleus contralateral to the moved side were averaged across conditions for each of the three frequency bands of interest and correlated across all patients with the UPDRS-ON score using non-parametric Spearman rank correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Dopamine-dependence of movement-related modulation in oscillatory patterns</title><p>In a subpopulation of 7 patients, the influence of dopamine on movement-related modulation of oscillatory activity was assessed by matched group comparison of the mean relative power changes for the theta, beta and gamma time-frequency bands with and without dopaminergic medication. For visualization, averaged time-frequency plots in the ON- and OFF- medication state were shown separately for this subgroup. Only results of the subthalamic nucleus that was contralateral to the moved hand are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Burst determination and analysis</title><p>For burst determination, the criteria that have previously been established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tinkhauser et al. (2017)</xref> for beta burst analysis in patients with Parkinson’s disease were applied. The raw local field potential recording was band pass filtered (Fifth order butteworth filter) around the gamma band (40–90 Hz), rectified and smoothed with moving average gaussian smoothing kernel of 100 ms length. A gamma burst was determined when the resulting instantaneous power exceeded the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of the signal amplitude distribution of all data in each electrode. Threshold crossings lasting shorter than one gamma cycle were excluded from the analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). For ON-OFF comparisons (n = 7), the threshold of the ON medication state was applied to the OFF recordings of the matching hemisphere. The amplitude of a gamma burst was defined as the area under the curve between signal and threshold line. The density of gamma bursts, in the following ‘burst rate’, was defined as the number of bursts occurring in 0.5 s. The change of burst rate therefore serves as an estimate of the probability of bursting during movement (0.5 s following movement onset) compared to that in 0.5 s of baseline activity (2–1.5 s before movement onset). We also compared averaged burst duration and amplitude during movement with that during baseline activity. In a second step, we investigated which movement-related burst property changes (amplitude, duration or rate) correlated most with the movement-related increase of power in the gamma band. Correlation coefficients between power changes and changes in burst properties were calculated for each bipolar recording, and mean values from contact pairs of the same electrode (n = 26) were averaged on the group level and tested for differences using permutation tests. For the property that correlated best, we investigated whether it also exhibited scaling with task condition (small, medium, large) by averaging across hemispheres and patients (n = 16) as we did for averaged gamma power. Additionally, its relative change averaged across conditions was correlated with the clinical state as assessed by the UPDRS-III ON score, available in 14 patients ON medication. In the7 patients that performed the task both ON and OFF dopaminergic medication, gamma burst rate, amplitude and duration were averaged across contact pairs and ON-OFF comparison was performed separately for each hemisphere (n = 10) using permutation testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Spatial distribution of averaged power change in the gamma band</title><p>To create a spatial map of oscillatory changes in normalized three-dimensional anatomical space, all contact pair MNI coordinates from electrodes contralateral to the moved hand were extracted from electrode localization results following the subcortical electrophysiology mapping approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horn et al. (2017b)</xref>. Briefly, contact pair coordinates from the left hemisphere were flipped to the right hemisphere, averaged gamma power (see above) was then assigned to the respective contact pairs for each movement condition (small, medium, large), aligned to the time point of maximum velocity and visualized as a scattered point cloud in MNI space. A scattered interpolant was fit to these data points and values were projected to an equidistant grid using natural neighbor interpolation. This resulted in a volumetric description of gamma power distribution, which was then projected to the surface of the subthalamic nucleus using Surf Ice (Open Source; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/</ext-link>). In addition, a binary mask of the subthalamic nucleus motor part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ewert et al., 2017</xref>) was projected onto the surface of the subthalamic nucleus for visual comparison. Non-parametric rank-based Spearman correlations were calculated between averaged gamma power across all movement conditions and respective contact-pair locations on the X, Y, Z axes to test for a gamma gradient in MNI standard space. This was done to show a potential group effect of a statistical relation between recording site and movement-related gamma synchronization. Thereby potential group effects of contact pair location on movement-related gamma synchronization are verified, remaining unaffected by the described masking and interpolation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Non-parametric Monte Carlo permutation tests were used for statistical results reported in this study. Permutation tests do not rely on assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In brief, the sample of tested values was interchanged randomly 5000 times to generate a probability distribution in which the observed original sample rank is reported as the p-value. All tests were multiple comparisons corrected by controlling the false discovery rate for an α-level of α = 0.05. Only p-values smaller than the false discovery rate-corrected threshold were considered significant. When investigating power changes, each time-frequency bin was tested separately and only significant p-values that extended over a cluster of at least 150 time-frequency bins are shown. Rank-based Spearman correlations were calculated if data deviated significantly from a normal distribution as assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Otherwise, linear Pearson correlations were conducted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all patients for their

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper presents a very detailed analysis of changes in oscillatory activity in the subthalamic nucleus during a movement task in which the amplitude and velocity of movements were systematically varied. While STN oscillatory activity during movement and rest has been studied previously, there are some very interesting novel features of this study: a movement task and analytic approach designed to reveal how oscillatory activity scales with movement velocity; the demonstration that movement related gamma changes are actually composed of trial-by-trial changes in brief bursts of gamma activity, and the finding that movement related changes in bursts of gamma activity scale with movement velocity, are affected by dopaminergic state, and accordingly, the disease severity is negatively correlated with the level of gamma burst. This work is very timely in that it follows recent influential work of the Brown group on beta bursts, showing more or less opposite behavior of beta bursts. The paper makes an argument that PD-related changes in gamma bursting may be key in the expression of bradykinesia. In general, the figures and Results section are quite clear given the complexity of the analysis. The reviewers do have however, some concerns.</p><p>General Concerns:</p><p>1) The gamma bursts are so short that they are on average &lt; 2 cycles of the gamma oscillation, raising the question of whether one can define a gamma oscillation over such a short duration. Is it possible that these gamma bursts reflect underlying bursts of spiking activity, given the short durations of the bursts described here, and the similar duration of spike bursts in STN from human and nonhuman primate micro-recording?</p><p>2) Related to the origin of the gamma band activity studied here, the literature on cortical field potentials makes a clear distinction between two types of high frequency phenomena: &quot;broadband gamma&quot; which is asynchronous, spans a wide spectral range approximately between 50 and 200 Hz, and is modulated by movement; versus narrowband gamma phenomena which are associated with a distinct narrow peak in the power spectrum of the field potential, whose exact frequency may vary from 50-90 Hz.</p><p>The literature on STN LFP recording is in general much less clear and it is hard to tell from this paper, which type of phenomena is being studied. This distinction should be addressed in the Discussion, along with a consideration of whether the gamma activity studied is actually oscillatory or not. In this paper, the gamma activity is isolated by relatively broad bandpass filtering 40-90 Hz. Some figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, small amplitude) suggest more of a broadband phenomenon while others suggest more narrowband. This distinction is mechanistically important. Power spectra in the on state during rest and movement for individual subjects could be helpful if they show a narrow peak versus a broader band change. It seems very plausible that synchronized bursts of STN spiking could show up in LFP recordings as brief gamma band elevations in the LFP thus the authors should consider this mechanistic possibility.</p><p>Further clarification of the choice of definition of the gamma band would be useful. Why has the range 30-40Hz been excluded from the analysis? Perhaps some further annotation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> would be of help in this regard.</p><p>3) Clarifications/Questions:a) Did the subjects undergo a training period prior to the experiment?</p><p>b) Were fatigue effects accounted for as the trials progressed? Did this create a discord between encoded effort (gamma burst) and motor output (achieved velocity)? Insights into such a phenomenon may give us a better idea as to exactly what aspect of movement the gamma activity encodes.</p><p>c) Were LFP changes related to maintenance of posture accounted for (as a baseline)? In a similar vein, might an increase in grip-strength have gone hand-in-hand with the increased movement velocity (and thus have also been encoded by the gamma burst power?)</p><p>4) The Introduction it is quite verbose and while the discussion of the difference between &quot;finely tuned&quot; and &quot;broad&quot; gamma activity is important, as noted above, the treatment of this in the Introduction is unclear and the fine/broad distinction might best be just introduced briefly in the Introduction and dealt with more fully in the Discussion.</p><p>5) The Discussion is also quite verbose as well, and requires some revision to address the concerns described above. It states, for example, that movement related changes in beta band were not dopamine dependent. This needs some further discussion as it appears conceptually at odds with prior literature. Since dopamine has a major effect onSTN beta band activity, based on many prior papers, it seems possibly contradictory that there is no effect on movement related changes in beta.</p><p>6) Abstract: the use of the word &quot;seemed&quot; in the Abstract is unnecessary.</p><p>7) Materials and methods: in selection of time frequency bands – this statement is unclear: &quot;Specific frequency bands were determined as standard frequency bands according to the main effects of event-related oscillatory changes seen in the grand average from all patients&quot; – does this refer to the center frequency of each predetermined band? Determined by the most movement reactive frequencies within each band? Needs clarification.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> legend is unclear and may be mislabeled.

Before addressing it in detail, it might be important to highlight that the LFP recordings displayed a continuous gamma oscillation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and only the crossing of a predefined amplitude threshold lasted between 1-3 cycles depending on the peak frequency. It can be assumed that peak amplitude fluctuates in every gamma cycle and short elevations over few cycles are not generally in conflict with the definition of an oscillation.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms leading to amplitude changes in brain oscillations are an ongoing debate and the exact contribution of single bursts of spiking activity to rhythmic oscillations, especially in higher frequency bands, is difficult to work out. Multi-target recordings from cortical and subcortical structures may help to figure out whether the brief increase of gamma amplitude for 1-2 cycles during movement is traceable at the network level, which would be in favor of its oscillatory nature. Using Granger causality-based analysis of information flow, Litvak et al. (2012) were able to show that cortical gamma oscillations are driven from the subcortical gamma signal during movement and M1-STN coherence is spectrally specific to the 60 – 90 Hz range. Moreover, STN firing during movement could be shown to be synchronized to the envelope of gamma oscillations in primary motor cortex but not local STN with accompanying cell-specific up- or down-regulation of firing rates in PD patients (Lipski et al., 2017). Taken together, these results support the concept of precise timing in gamma power changes across the motor circuit leading to changes in local spiking activity rather than vice versa.</p><p>The specific contribution of bursty neurons in the STN to the movement-related gamma synchronization has to our knowledge not been investigated yet. High proportion of subthalamic neurons with burst firing seems a pathological feature of PD that correlates with beta power in in humans (Steigerwald et al., 2008) and increases in the dopamine-depleted state in non-human primates (Hammond et al., 2007). Thus, it is conceptually unlikely that apparently pro-kinetic gamma bursts predominantly reflect such underlying bursts of spiking activity. Ultimately, only multi-unit recordings could quantify the contribution of local bursts of spiking activity to brief transitory increases in movement-related gamma power.</p><p>To emphasize that we cannot definitely exclude the contribution of asynchronous bursts of local spiking activity to the brief bursts of increase in gamma amplitude in this study, we made the following changes to the manuscript:</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>“The recordings from DBS-macro electrodes did not allow assessment of multi-unit activity. […] However, the narrowband gamma peaks in averaged power spectra during movement and the spectrally distinct (40-90 Hz) correlations to maximal velocity hint towards modulations in rhythmic activity instead of an uncoordinated increase in local neuronal firing (Fries et al., 2007; Manning et al., 2009; Buzsaki and Wang, 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the origin of the gamma band activity studied here, the literature on cortical field potentials makes a clear distinction between two types of high frequency phenomena: &quot;broadband gamma&quot; which is asynchronous, spans a wide spectral range approximately between 50 and 200 Hz, and is modulated by movement; versus narrowband gamma phenomena which are associated with a distinct narrow peak in the power spectrum of the field potential, whose exact frequency may vary from 50-90 Hz.</p><p>The literature on STN LFP recording is in general much less clear and it is hard to tell from this paper, which type of phenomena is being studied.

Here, we focus on the narrow band gamma activity that was consistently increased with behavioral test conditions. This is in line with previous publications on scaling of narrowband gamma power with kinematic parameters in the basal ganglia (Anzak et al., 2012; Joundi et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2013, 2016; Fischer et al., 2017). However, as the referees correctly pointed out, both narrow- and broadband changes occur in the STN during movement. As shown in the averaged time frequency plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, there is a broad increase in high frequency activity (&gt;40 Hz) during movement. The broadband synchronization may partly relate to asynchronous activity during movement. However, correlation of spectrally specific power scaling with maximal velocity on a single trial level was confined to the narrow gamma band between 40-90 Hz (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that two co-occurring phenomena take place during movement: a synchronous oscillation that scales with motor output and an asynchronous broadband activity that may reflect local spiking activity without a direct behavioral correlate.</p><p>To visualize that movement-related increases in gamma power occurred in narrow band peaks, we followed the reviewers’ recommendation and added a figure both with averaged power spectra across patients and from a single patient at rest and during movement. In the averaged power spectrum, the frequencies that display a significant change between rest and movement are also labeled (highlighted in grey, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This new figure was integrated in the manuscript. The band between 30 – 40 Hz has been excluded because it contains periods of desynchronization at movement onset and synchronization in later phases of the trial and was generally not significant in the grand average time frequency analysis (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To emphasize the differentiation between narrow- and broadband changes in the gamma range we revised the first paragraph of the Discussion that now reads as follows:</p><p>“Our results provide first evidence for dopamine-dependent and finely-tuned scaling of movement-related gamma synchronization that occurs in transient bursts and is spatially confined to the dorsolateral part of the subthalamic nucleus in patients with Parkinson’s disease. […] Therefore, we hypothesize that two co-occurring phenomena take place in the subthalamic nucleus during movement: a narrowband gamma oscillation that scales with motor output and an asynchronous broadband activity that may reflect local spiking activity without a direct behavioral correlate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Clarifications/Questions:a) Did the subjects undergo a training period prior to the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the subjects underwent a brief training period of 10 trials prior to the experiments. The following changes were made to the manuscript:</p><p>“Before the LFP-recording a brief training session of 5 -10 trials was performed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Were fatigue effects accounted for as the trials progressed? Did this create a discord between encoded effort (gamma burst) and motor output (achieved velocity)? Insights into such a phenomenon may give us a better idea as to exactly what aspect of movement the gamma activity encodes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this very interesting aspect. A potential fatigue effect would indirectly assess the controversy whether gamma power scales with behavioral output or its effort. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we re-analysed our data in this regard. For each moved hand (26 sides ON medication, 10 sides OFF medication), we correlated the change in velocity and the change of averaged gamma power over trials in the course of the experiment. There was no general fatigue effect leading to progressively decreasing movement velocity across patients. In single patients, maximal velocity significantly decreased (ON medication, n=5/16; OFF medication, n= 3/7) or increased (ON medication, n=4/16; OFF medication, n= 2/7) over trials. In all cases, this progressive change of velocity across trials occurred only in one of both hands. One may hypothesize that fatigue may have led to a decreasing peak velocity over trials while gamma power stays stable; as fatigue leads to reduced motor output with stable effort. Or stable peak velocity might be accompanied by a continuous increase in gamma power over trials to compensate for the increasing effort demand for the same motor output. However, there was no significant correlation between changes of both variables over trials (Spearman’s Rho=-0.09, P=0.3). Thus, no systematic fatigue effect could be observed in our dataset. This may be related to the fact that subjects had to perform relatively short movements (500-700 ms) that were followed by rather long inter-trial durations (~4 seconds).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31895.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in maximal velocity and gamma synchronization over trials do not correlate.</title><p>Spearman’s correlation was conducted for both maximal velocity and averaged gamma power over trials.

There was no significant correlation between either variables over trials (Spearman’s Rho=-0.09, P=0.3) making a systematic fatigue effect unlikely.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Were LFP changes related to maintenance of posture accounted for (as a baseline)? In a similar vein, might an increase in grip-strength have gone hand-in-hand with the increased movement velocity (and thus have also been encoded by the gamma burst power?)</p></disp-quote><p>During the entire experiment, the investigator visually inspected the posture and holding of the rotatory device and instructed the subject to maintain those positions stable. The TF-plots were baseline-corrected on a single trial level, therefore changes of posture between trials should not account for changes in movement-related changes. However, we cannot exclude that within a trial a slight change of posture may have occurred which was not systematically monitored.</p><p>This information has now been included in the description of the experimental task (Materials and methods section):</p><p>“The investigator visually controlled for a steady posture and unchanged holding of the rotatory device throughout the recording session.”</p><p>Regarding the grip strength, it was not measured by the device used to track movement trajectories. Hence, we cannot exclude a potential confounder due to varying grip strength across trials. Given that movement velocity correlated on a single trial level with changes in the gamma frequency band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), it seems unlikely that changes in grip strength occurred accordingly. Moreover, gamma power peaked at the time point of maximal velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>/B) and one may assume that grip strength would be highest around movement onset. Finally, the rotatory movement of the handle required much more force increase in more proximal arm muscles than grip force. Nevertheless, to account for the potential limitation of our study, we added the following phrase to the Discussion:</p><p>“While the study was designed to explore changes in gamma activity with movement amplitude and velocity, grip strength was not monitored. […] Maximal movement velocity correlated across trials and patients with gamma activity, which is unlikely related to sole changes in grip strength.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Introduction it is quite verbose and while the discussion of the difference between &quot;finely tuned&quot; and &quot;broad&quot; gamma activity is important, as noted above, the treatment of this in the Introduction is unclear and the fine/broad distinction might best be just introduced briefly in the Introduction and dealt with more fully in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment to help make the article more concise. To meet the present request, we shortened the Introduction substantially, by removing two paragraphs, and we rewrote the paragraph on movement-related gamma synchronization and added a brief Introduction to the distinction between broad- and narrowband activity:</p><p>“In contrast to pathological activity at rest, less is known about the functional role of physiological movement-related changes of oscillatory patterns in the cortico-basal ganglia motor loop. […] Previous studies have shown that narrowband increases in gamma oscillations with a center frequency between 30-90 Hz and ~20 Hz width were of functional significance in encoding of movement parameters (Jenkinson et al., 2012; Joundi et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Discussion is also quite verbose as well and requires some revision to address the concerns described above. It states, for example, that movement related changes in beta band were not dopamine dependent. This needs some further discussion as it appears conceptually at odds with prior literature. Since dopamine has a major effect onSTN beta band activity, based on many prior papers, it seems possibly contradictory that there is no effect on movement related changes in beta.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the encouragement to discuss the role of beta desynchronization during movement in greater detail. Our statement regarding the lack of dopamine-dependence on beta desynchronization during movement focused on the averaged percentage of beta change around maximal velocity. The difference in the relative beta power (13-30 Hz) decrease in the 500 ms around maximal velocity (ON: – 29.5 ± 19.5%, OFF: – 22.3 ± 19.3%, p=0.062) did not reach significance. This finding may seem at odds with prior literature as beta power is a robust pathophysiological marker for Parkinson’s disease and is significantly increased in the dopamine-depleted state at rest (Kühn et al., 2006, 2009). It has to be considered that absolute beta suppression with dopaminergic therapy is well established but less is known about the influence of dopamine on relative beta dynamics during movement. Indeed, the few reports mainly focused on relative changes during movement initiation (Doyle et al., 2005; Foffani et al., 2005; Androulidakis et al., 2007; Anzak et al., 2012). We therefore re-analyzed our dataset by averaging the relative change in beta power around movement onset. In line with previous findings, there was significantly stronger beta desynchronization ON than OFF medication (ON: -29.37 ± 19.27%, OFF: -16.36 ± 16.01%, p=0.037, see figure below). This is an interesting aspect, which may relate to the difficulties in movement initiation in PD patients. Furthermore, the results are in line with the hypothesis that beta desynchronization acts as a binary gating function, which allows task-related processing to occur (Tan et al., 2013). To visualize the differential effects of dopamine over time we added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) to the manuscript.</p><p>The following remarks were added to the manuscript:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“Relative changes in beta desynchronization differed between time points. While beta ERD was significantly more pronounced in the ON medication state when averaged around movement onset (ON: -29.37 ± 19.27%, OFF: -16.36 ± 16.01%, p=0.037), this difference did not reach significance during maximal velocity (ON: – 29.5 ± 19.5%, OFF: – 22.3 ± 19.3%, p=0.062), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>.”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Movement-related changes in the theta and beta band showed no velocity-related modulation and were similarly pronounced bilaterally. The relative power change around maximal velocity was not dopamine dependent. However, beta desynchronization was significantly higher in the ON vs. OFF condition, when trials were aligned to movement onset, which may indicate an association of beta decrease with movement initiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Abstract: the use of the word &quot;seemed&quot; in the Abstract is unnecessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the Abstract accordingly and the phrase now reads as follows:</p><p>“These effects relied on movement-related bursts of transient synchrony in the gamma band.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Materials and methods: in selection of time frequency bands – this statement is unclear: &quot;Specific frequency bands were determined as standard frequency bands according to the main effects of event-related oscillatory changes seen in the grand average from all patients&quot; – does this refer to the center frequency of each predetermined band?
