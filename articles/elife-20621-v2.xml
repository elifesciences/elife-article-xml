host and arthropod vector. However, the molecular role of CelTOS is unknown because it lacks sequence similarity to proteins of known function. Here, we determined the crystal structure of CelTOS and discovered CelTOS resembles proteins that bind to and disrupt membranes. In contrast to known membrane disruptors, CelTOS has a distinct architecture, specifically binds phosphatidic acid commonly present within the inner leaflet of plasma membranes, and potently disrupts liposomes composed of phosphatidic acid by forming pores. Microinjection of CelTOS into cells resulted in observable membrane damage. Therefore, CelTOS is unique as it achieves nearly universal inner leaflet cellular activity to enable the exit of parasites from cells during traversal. By providing novel molecular insight into cell traversal by apicomplexan parasites, our work facilitates the design of therapeutics against global pathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20621.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20621.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20621.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Half of the world’s population are at risk of contracting malaria: a disease caused by parasites that are spread by mosquito bites. Yet antimalarial drugs are becoming less and less effective because many of the parasites have grown to be resistant to them. Furthermore, and although some vaccines are already being trialed, there is not an effective vaccine that has been approved to control the disease. As such, many researchers hope that understanding more about the critical stages in the life cycle of the parasites will unveil new targets for antimalarial drugs and vaccines.</p><p>To complete their life cycle, malaria parasites must move through various cells in the human and mosquito. Parasites that lack a protein called CelTOS can enter these cells, but remain stuck inside. It was not known why this was the case, in part because the sequence of building blocks called amino acids that make up CelTOS is unlike that of other proteins which do have a known activity or function.</p><p>Jimah et al. sought to understand how CelTOS allows malaria parasites to pass through cells by solving its three-dimensional structure. This is because a protein’s function often depends more on the protein’s structure than the specific sequence of its amino acids; such that two proteins that have a similar shape are very likely to work in similar ways.</p><p>Jimah et al. solved the structure of CelTOS using a technique called X-ray crystallography and found that it resembles proteins known to bind and disrupt cell membranes. Further experiments showed that CelTOS from malaria parasites specifically binds to a fatty molecule that is predominantly found in the inner face of cell surface membranes. It was also confirmed that CelTOS forms pores that disrupt cell membranes. Together, these findings suggest that CelTOS breaches the cell membranes from the inside of infected human and mosquito cells to enable the parasites to exit.</p><p>While a vaccine based on the CelTOS protein is already being tested in clinical trials, the findings of Jimah et al. should enable this vaccine to be refined if it is not effective, or redesigned based on knowledge of its structure, function and mechanism. This new knowledge could also provide clues as to which kinds of molecules might neutralize the CelTOS protein’s activity and therefore might lead to new antimalarial drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20621.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20621.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>vivax</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>pore</kwd><kwd>apicomplexan</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jimah</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name><name><surname>Salinas</surname><given-names>Nichole D</given-names></name><name><surname>Tolia</surname><given-names>Niraj H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56 AI080792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolia</surname><given-names>Niraj H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure, function and mechanism of the malaria vaccine candidate CelTOS reveal a unique pore-forming and membrane-disrupting protein with specificity for the inner leaflet of host and vector cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apicomplexan parasites of the genera <italic>Plasmodium, Babesia</italic>, <italic>Cytauxzoon</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> are responsible for the established and emerging global infectious diseases malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Black et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2007</xref>), babesiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Homer et al., 2000</xref>), cytauxzoonosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sherrill et al., 2015</xref>), and theileriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw, 2003</xref>), respectively. Although these parasites infect a range of hosts and cause different diseases, they share biological adaptations for traversal through a variety of cells within their mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors to complete their life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Homer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sherrill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mota et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yuda and Ishino, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinnis and Zavala, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ménard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gueirard et al., 2010</xref>). Traversal refers to the ability of a eukaryotic parasite to move through host or vector cells to complete essential segments of a complicated life cycle. Within the host, cell traversal by parasites is essential for successful infection as sporozoites must negotiate and cross several distinct cell types until they enter defined cells that are receptive for replication, leading to disease progression. Traversal is also essential for transmission by vectors as parasites must cross the arthropod midgut epithelia to mature into sporozoites that are the transmissible form of these apicomplexan parasites.</p><p>Traversal of parasites through host and vector cells relies on a number of different biological processes mediated by various parasite proteins. Gliding motility is the characteristic motion of parasites as they move through various tissues and invade cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yuda and Ishino, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ménard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harupa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreira et al., 2008</xref>). Parasites also physically breach cell barriers during the invasion of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Homer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sherrill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mota et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yuda and Ishino, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kadota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Risco-Castillo et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, parasites have developed strategies for immune evasion as they migrate through various cells, including phagocytic Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinnis and Zavala, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). Ongoing efforts to identify and elucidate the function and mechanism of parasite proteins involved in diverse cell traversal processes will advance our understanding of parasite biology, and will unveil new targets for therapeutics. Of all the apicomplexan parasites, therapeutics for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> are desperately needed as these parasites are leading causes of human death and major burdens to socio-economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Black et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><underline>Cel</underline>l-<underline>t</underline>raversal protein for <underline>o</underline>okinetes and <underline>s</underline>porozoites (CelTOS) is unique among traversal proteins as it is essential for traversal of malaria parasites in both the mosquito vector and human host and is therefore critical for malaria transmission and disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kariu et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, CelTOS has been identified as a promising malaria vaccine candidate referred to as Antigen 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doolan et al., 2003</xref>). Immunization of mice with recombinant CelTOS results in humoral and cellular immune responses that reduced infection, demonstrating that targeting CelTOS is a viable approach for developing a malaria vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergmann-Leitner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferraro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergmann-Leitner et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2013</xref>). Even though CelTOS is critical during cell traversal by malaria parasites and is a leading transmission- and infection-blocking malaria vaccine candidate, its function remains unknown as it has no sequence similarity to proteins of known function.</p><p>In this study, we determined the structure of CelTOS in order to gain insight into its function. CelTOS structurally resembles viral membrane fusion proteins and a bacterial pore-forming toxin. This observation informed our hypothesis that apicomplexan CelTOS directly binds to and breaches plasma membranes. We show that CelTOS specifically binds phosphatidic acid, a lipid predominantly found in the inner leaflet of plasma membranes, and potently disrupts defined liposomes composed of phosphatidic acid. We determine that liposome disruption is achieved by the formation of CelTOS-dependent pores. Additionally, microinjection of CelTOS into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes results in membrane damage. Together, these results demonstrate CelTOS is the only known apicomplexan protein with universal inner leaflet cellular activity as it addresses phosphatidic acid found specifically on the cytoplasmic face of plasma membranes, and disrupts these membranes to enable the exit of apicomplexan parasites through diverse vector and host cells. In addition to discovering this unique role of CelTOS in cell traversal, our work on the structure, function, and mechanism of CelTOS will enable structural vaccinology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dormitzer et al., 2012</xref>) to produce a potent protective malaria vaccine, and inform the development of other therapeutics targeting CelTOS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CelTOS is conserved in apicomplexans</title><p>As CelTOS is important for multiple stages of the parasite life cycle, we examined if CelTOS was evolutionarily conserved among other apicomplexan pathogens, including those with recently sequenced genomes. We found CelTOS is conserved across various diverse branches of apicomplexan parasites including the hemosporidia (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp.) and piroplasms (<italic>Theileria</italic>, <italic>Babesia</italic>, <italic>Cytauxzoon</italic> spp.), groups that are thought to have diverged more than 100 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeBarry and Kissinger, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, CelTOS represents an ancient and widespread adaptation that is common to apicomplexans that have two host life cycles alternating between asexual replication in their vertebrate hosts and a sexual cycle in their arthropod vectors. This is supported by the lack of CelTOS in the apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> that does not require an arthropod vector for transmission. This evolutionary conservation and importance in disease pathogenesis and transmission prompted the in-depth molecular study of CelTOS that is applicable to diverse pathogenic apicomplexan parasites.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20621.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alignment and structure of the conserved apicomplexan protein CelTOS from the human pathogen <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> (PvCelTOS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of CelTOS from apicomplexan parasites <italic>Plasmodium, Babesia, Theileria, Cytauxzoon,</italic> and mapping of the structural elements.

CelTOS could disrupt liposomes either by generalized solubilization and mixed micelle formation similar to detergents, or by forming defined protein-dependent pores within the lipid bilayer. A key test of pore formation is whether leakage of liposome contents can be prevented by plugging the pore using a molecule of the correct Stoke’s radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saito et al., 2000</xref>). We examined the CelTOS-dependent release of carboxyfluorescein from liposomes in the presence of 20 μM dextran molecules of various molecular weights: 66.9 kDa (Stoke’s radius:~5.8 nm), 148 kDa (Stoke’s radius:~8 nm), 500 kDa (Stoke’s radius: 14.7 nm), 1500–2800 kDa (Stoke’s radius ranging from ~25 to ~60 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tang et al., 2016</xref>); Stoke’s radius of 2000 kDa Dextran: 27 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2004</xref>]). Remarkably, only the 500 kDa dextran blocked carboxyfluorescein release from liposomes disrupted with PfCelTOS and PvCelTOS, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Dextran molecules of higher and lower molecular weights and Stoke’s radius had no effect on carboxyfluorescein release, similar to experiments without dextran. Therefore, only the 500 kDa dextran has the correct Stoke’s radius to occupy the pore, while the remaining dextran molecules are either too small and diffuse through the pore or too large and may not enter the pore. The 500 kDa dextran significantly lowered the maximum amount of carboxyfluorescein released disrupted (A, in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) compared to experiments with molecules of higher and lower molecular weights, or without dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that CelTOS forms pores of uniform size in liposomes and that the dextran-pore complex might be slowly reversibly tying up the protein in a non-functional pore. We visualized the CelTOS-pore in liposomes by transmission electron microscopy of negative stained liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The average diameter of the pores, reported as mean ± s.d., formed by PfCelTOS and PvCelTOS were 45.85 ± 15.55 nm and 58.62 ± 21.86 nm respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The dextran-blocking and electron microscopy studies suggest CelTOS forms a pore that opens a portal for parasite exit from invaded cells.

Once the parasite invades the cytosol of host and vector cells, CelTOS binds with high specificity to lipids in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.

Parasites utilize gliding motility during traversal and have the ability to breach plasma membranes from the extracellular space to invade cells. Parasite proteins involved in gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yuda and Ishino, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tardieux and Ménard, 2008</xref>), and the breaching of plasma membranes from the extracellular space to enable entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kadota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Risco-Castillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishino et al., 2005</xref>) have been reported. The current literature supports a model where perforin-like proteins (PLPs) mediate entry into various pre-erythrocytic cells including the PLP-1 dependent disruption of transient vacuoles created during entry of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Risco-Castillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishino et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests a mechanism in which PLPs engage outer leaflet lipids for disruption, although direct studies probing the biochemical function and lipid specificity of PLPs have not been described. Further, PLPs have been shown to play a role in egress of parasites from the parasitophorous vacuole and red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wirth et al., 2014</xref>). However, proteins involved in breaching the plasma membrane of invaded cells during traversal, from the cytoplasmic face, to enable the exit of parasites are unknown.</p><p>We have discovered that secreted apicomplexan CelTOS attacks plasma membranes from the cytoplasmic face. CelTOS had previously been identified as a malaria antigen, and CelTOS-deficient parasites are unable to traverse cells of their host and vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kariu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doolan et al., 2003</xref>). The results of our study indicate that CelTOS functions to breach plasma membranes from the cytoplasmic face to enable the exit of parasites from invaded host and vector cells during traversal. This study challenges the paradigm that motility alone is sufficient for parasite exit, as it is now clear that active membrane disruption by CelTOS is necessary for parasite release. This work identifies CelTOS-dependent pore formation leading to inner-leaflet membrane disruption as a new active molecular process during traversal, and presents novel avenues for preventing traversal by inhibiting inner leaflet membrane disruption. As CelTOS is conserved across several large groups of apicomplexan parasites including <italic>Plasmodium spp., Cytauxzoon, Theileria</italic> and <italic>Babesia,</italic> this finding informs fundamental pathogen biology applicable to multiple diseases and microorganisms of global importance with particular relevance to cell infection, traversal and membrane disruption.</p><p>While CelTOS resembles viral membrane fusion proteins and a bacterial pore-forming toxin, our findings define a new class of membrane disruption proteins. CelTOS has a distinct structural architecture with two subdomains that independently resemble membrane binding and/or disrupting proteins and could simultaneously act during disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Further, CelTOS employs a unique lipid specificity for phosphatidic acid to achieve nearly universal inner leaflet cellular activity. This new class is also supported by the fact that primary sequence similarity searches did not identify membrane disruption proteins as relatives of CelTOS.</p><p>Both the N-terminal and C-terminal helices in CelTOS resemble the heptad repeats that form helices in class I viral fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sackett and Shai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDuc and Shin, 2000</xref>). Viral heptad repeats undergo conformational changes that enhance the destabilization of host membranes post-insertion of the viral fusion peptide that enables lipid mixing during fusion(38). It is plausible that the N- and C-terminal helices in CelTOS may also undergo similar conformational changes during membrane disruption. However, CelTOS employs a distinct membrane disruption mechanism from viral proteins as lipid mixing is not required for CelTOS to target inner leaflet lipids and disrupt plasma membranes.</p><p>In addition, CelTOS is structurally similar to the pore-forming toxin <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Los et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). However, these toxins generally recognize a host cell target or receptor embedded within the target membrane, and ESAT-6 is secreted in complex with a chaperone that maintains it in an inactive state. Upon binding the membrane target, the toxin sheds the chaperone, oligomerizes and embeds into the membrane to form a pore on the angstrom length scale for the passage of ions and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Los et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to a membrane-embedded target or receptor, CelTOS specifically binds phosphatidic acid within the inner leaflet of host or vector cell membranes. The dimeric nature of CelTOS may serve as a chaperone-like function to retain CelTOS in an inactive state prior to membrane binding as the dimer masks the inner hydrophobic faces of CelTOS. We provide evidence from dextran block experiments and transmission electron microscopy that CelTOS forms a pore of uniform size in liposomes.</p><p>Malaria continues to be a global health problem, with half of the world’s population at risk. The lack of an effective vaccine against malaria, and the continuous evolution of drug-resistant parasites make malaria control difficult. Targeting the liver-stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Good and Doolan, 1999</xref>) and mosquito-stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">mCGo, 2011</xref>) are of high priority for malaria vaccine development. Immunization of human volunteers with radiation-attenuated sporozoites induces sterile immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Good and Doolan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffman et al., 2002</xref>), and all volunteers showed strong immune responses to CelTOS (referred to as Antigen 2) that were correlated with protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doolan et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, circumsporozoite protein, which is the major component of the most advanced malaria vaccine RTS,S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crompton et al., 2010</xref>), was only recognized by a third of the volunteers and mostly in those who were not protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doolan et al., 2003</xref>). Individuals living in malaria endemic regions mount IFN-γ responses to CelTOS suggesting that CelTOS is a target of protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anum et al., 2015</xref>). CelTOS is also unique as it is a promising multi-stage malaria vaccine target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergmann-Leitner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferraro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergmann-Leitner et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2013</xref>) for both infection-blocking and transmission-blocking vaccines currently in clinical trials.</p><p>We show that CelTOS has conserved critical function in both <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> that infect humans. The high-sequence similarity between Pf and PvCelTOS suggest that CelTOS may elicit cross-species protection. Therefore, CelTOS could be used alone or in combination with other antigens already in development to produce an effective multicomponent vaccine which targets both the mosquito and human stages and may be cross-species protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doolan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crompton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>). CelTOS-based vaccines have demonstrated the ability to elicit protection from malaria infection. However, protection is not absolute suggesting improvements in the immunogenicity, protectivity and formulation of CelTOS-based vaccines are necessary. Structure-function studies not only provide mechanistic insight into host-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tolia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batchelor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vulliez-Le Normand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malpede et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batchelor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wright et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2012</xref>), but also provide the necessary framework for improved vaccine design through structural vaccinology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dormitzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2016</xref>). Immune recognition depends on antigen conformation and on surface accessibility of individual residues. The structure and architecture of CelTOS provides necessary insight to inform immune recognition, and enables protein engineering to retain the structural fold during immunogen design. The functional and mechanistic analyses presented here will enable assaying of immune responses for their ability to disrupt CelTOS function and provide an accurate molecular correlate for protection. Collectively, this work enables rational approaches to block CelTOS function, and rational approaches for vaccine development of global and emerging infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Alignment of CelTOS from diverse apicomplexan parasites</title><p>CelTOS homologs in diverse apicomplexan parasites were identified using jackhammer and examination of the EuPathDB, and aligned in ClustalW.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Codon-optimized PfCelTOS amino acids 25–182, PvCelTOS amino acids 36–196 and EcIspF amino acids 1–159 with C-terminal hexahistidine tags, were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Stage V-VI oocytes were isolated and maintained at 18 in modified Barth’s solution of the following composition: 88 mM NaCl, 2.4 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM KCl, 0.3 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 10 mM HEPES/Tris pH 7.4, and supplemented with 50 mg/l gentamicin, 6 mg/l ciprofloxacin, and 100 mg/l streptomycin sulfate/100,000 units/l penicillin G sodium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). One day after isolation, oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl (0.1 nmol, approximately 100 µM final concentration) of EcIspF, PfCelTOS or PvCelTOS, prepared fresh as 2 mM stock solutions in Protein buffer composed of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 150 mM KCl; non-injected oocytes, oocytes injected with 50 nl of protein buffer, and oocytes injected with EcIspF, served as controls. Twenty-four oocytes per condition were individualized in 96-well plates, and monitored for membrane damage. Oocytes were monitored 24 hr post-infection under an Olympus SZX10 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Waltham, MA), and images captured with Infinity Lite camera using Infinity capture version 6.00 software (Lumnera Corporation). Results are shown as mean ± s.e.m. of six separate experiments with independent protein preparations and with oocytes from different donor frogs. Data were analyzed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) by performing Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RAW 264.7 macrophage cytotoxicity assay</title><p>RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC) liberated using CellStripper reagent (Corning, Corning, NY) were filtered through a 40 µm mesh to yield a single-cell suspension. Cells were seeded onto clear-bottomed, white-walled 96-well plates (Corning 3610) at 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in DMEM 10% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. Wells were washed with PBS and assay reagents added. The assay was conducted in 5% FBS with phenol-red-free DMEM. Recombinant proteins were added to 100 µM final concentration. Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.05% v/v served as a positive control. Total reaction volume was 100 µl. The plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 3.5 hr prior to the addition of 50 µl 1x CellTox Green reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and incubated for a further 30 min. Fluorescence at 485 nm was read using a Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Results are shown as the mean ± s.e.m. of three separate experiments with independent RAW 264.7 cells each with three technical replicates. Data were analyzed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) by performing Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Liposomes were treated with either 250 µM PfCelTOS or PvCelTOS. Suspension of liposomes were then allowed to absorb onto freshly glow discharged formvar/carbon-coated copper grids for 10 min. Grids were washed in dH<sub>2</sub>O and stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) for 1 min. Excess liquid was gently wicked off and grids were allowed to air dry. Samples were viewed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA) equipped with an AMT megapixel digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA). Pore diameters were determined using ImageJ 1.48V.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R56 AI080792 to NHT) and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund (to NHT).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Elena Levashina, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the other reviewers, Olivier Silvie, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In apicomplexan parasites, CelTOS is a critical protein required during cell traversal, and is a leading malaria vaccine candidate. CelTOS has no sequence similarity to proteins of known function, and its function remained unknown. In this study, the authors present an X-ray crystal structure of CelTOS from Plasmodium vivax. This protein is also found in several parasites other than Plasmodium providing a relevant model for other Apicomplexa. The structural data reveal that CelTOS forms an α helical dimer, and structurally resembles class I viral membrane fusion proteins and a bacterial pore-forming toxins. The authors further show that CelTOS specifically binds lipids predominantly found in the inner leaflet of plasma membranes (phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine), and potently disrupts liposomes of defined composition by the formation of CelTOS-dependent pores. Additionally, the authors show that CelTOS induces membrane damage in microinjected <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, but has no lytic activity on the outer membrane leaflet of RAW cells. Together, the results demonstrate that CelTOS has a universal inner leaflet cellular activity, and strongly support a role of CelTOS in inner membrane disruption to enable the exit of apicomplexan parasites through diverse vector and host cells.</p><p>This study is very well performed and provides novel and important insights into the structure, function and mechanism of a critical protein involved in host and vector cell traversal by apicomplexan parasites. In order to improve the manuscript, the authors may consider addressing the following points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The crystallographic work appears competently executed, yet insufficiently described for experiments to be repeated. For example, in the subsection “Crystallization, data collection, and structural studies”: Mercury and platinum derivative data, the authors should be more specific, and give more details (compound formula, concentration, soak duration).</p><p>2) The authors interpretation of their work depends on CelTOS forming an oligomer on the membrane but they provide no data to show this. The protein is a dimer in the crystal and in solution (AUC data). Does it act as a dimer or do the authors think it comes apart to act? Some other pore-forming proteins are constitutive dimers in solution and then monomerise before oligomerisation. This is a form of regulation.

For example, in the subsection “Crystallization, data collection, and structural studies”: Mercury and platinum derivative data, the authors should be more specific, and give more details (compound formula, concentration, soak duration).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for indicating that the crystallographic work appears competently executed and for pointing out the need to include sufficient description to facilitate future repetition of experiments. The description of the procedure for obtaining crystals of the native, platinum- and mercury-derivatives of CelTOS have been included in the Methods section, and are described below:</p><p>“PvCelTOS crystals were grown at 17<sup>o</sup>C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion after mixing 1 µl of protein at 20 mg/ml with 1 µl of reservoir containing 1.6 M Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.08 M Tris pH 8.5 and 20% glycerol and streak seeding PvCelTOS crystals previously obtained from the same crystallization condition. […] Crystals of the CelTOS Mercury- derivative were obtained by soaking native CelTOS crystals for 1-2 minutes in cryo-protectant solutions containing: 1 µM mercury ethylphosphate, 1.6 M Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.08 M Tris pH 8.5 and 30% glycerol.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors interpretation of their work depends on CelTOS forming an oligomer on the membrane but they provide no data to show this. The protein is a dimer in the crystal and in solution (AUC data). Does it act as a dimer or do the authors think it comes apart to act? Some other pore-forming proteins are constitutive dimers in solution and then monomerise before oligomerisation. This is a form of regulation. Since they do show binding to PA and PS-containing liposomes it can't be hard to also show that the protein then oligomerises, if it does. Can the authors propose a lipid-binding site on CelTOS?</italic> </p><p>We have provided additional experimental data to demonstrate that CelTOS forms pores of ~50 nm in diameter by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The large diameter and shape of the pore strongly suggest the pore is stabilized by an oligomer of CelTOS. While we agree with the reviewers that changes in oligomeric state (dimer to monomer to oligomer transitions) are important regulatory mechanisms, deciphering these changes and the steps that precede pore formation as visualized by the new data will require several months to a year to accurately characterize. We therefore feel these studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Never-the-less the additional electron microscopy data we now present strongly validates quantitative dextran blocking data and supports our model that CelTOS inserts in to membranes in a PA-specific manner to form large pores.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers request that we propose a lipid-binding site in CelTOS. While we strongly believe the basic patch on the surface of CelTOS may play a role in binding negatively charged phospholipids we feel this would be speculation at best (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). We therefore do not wish to over interpret the data at present and do not feel confident proposing an unambiguous lipid-binding site in CelTOS.</p><p><italic>3) Did the authors attempt microinjecting CelTOS in RAW or Hep G2 cells to demonstrate membrane rupture? In the context of malaria parasite infection, these cellular models are more relevant than the Xenopus oocyte system.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that RAW and HepG2 cells may be better cellular models for sporozoite traversal in the liver. <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> are an excellent model system for a generic cell to examine universal phenotypes of membrane disruption relevant to both the human host and mosquito vector. The requested experiment of microinjecting mammalian cells, which are far smaller and less robust than <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, requires extensive technical expertise and specialized instrumentation neither of which is available nor can be performed in a timely manner. Further, we do not feel these additional experiments will provide any new insight not already obtained from the <italic>Xenopus</italic> microinjection experiments, and would only confirm the current experiments.</p><p><italic>4) Other proteins are required for cell traversal in apicomplexan parasites, in particular perforin-like proteins (PLPs).

We have added the following to the manuscript to describe the relative functions of perforin-like proteins (PLPs) and CelTOS.</p><p>“The current literature supports a model where perforin-like proteins (PLPs) mediate entry into various pre-erythrocytic cells including the PLP-1 dependent disruption of transient vacuoles created during entry of hepatocytes (Risco-Castillo et al., 2015; Armstrong et al., 2004). This suggests a mechanism in which PLPs engage outer leaflet lipids for disruption although direct studies probing the biochemical function and lipid specificity of PLPs have not been described. Further, PLPs have been shown to play a role in egress of parasites from the parasitophorous vacuole and red blood cells (Tardieux and Ménard, 2008; Ishino, Chinzei and Yuda, 2005).<italic>”</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
