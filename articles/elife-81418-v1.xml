The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has contributed to aging research because of its short lifespan and easy genetic manipulation. When fed the standard laboratory diet, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiences an age-dependent decline in temperature–food associative learning, called thermotaxis. To address if diet affects this decline, we screened 35 lactic acid bacteria as alternative diet and found that animals maintained high thermotaxis ability when fed a clade of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> enriched with heterofermentative bacteria. Among them, <italic>Lactobacill</italic>us <italic>reuteri</italic> maintained the thermotaxis of aged animals without affecting their lifespan and motility. The effect of <italic>Lb. reuteri</italic> depends on the DAF-16 transcription factor functioning in neurons. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes between aged animals fed different bacteria were enriched with DAF-16 targets. Our results demonstrate that diet can impact brain aging in a <italic>daf-16</italic>-dependent manner without changing the lifespan.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>lactic acid bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Megmilk Snow Brand Co.

Although human studies suggest that genetic background, diet, and lifestyle might affect brain aging, the causality and mechanism of how they affect brain aging remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deary et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is ideal for addressing the mechanism of age-related phenotypes because of the 2- to 3-week lifespan and the variety of available genetic tools. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the age-related phenotypes can be readily separable from the organismal lifespan by directly measuring the lifespan. In the past decades, studies using <italic>C. elegans</italic> have contributed to aging research by revealing the molecular mechanism of how dietary restriction, insulin-like signaling, and germline stem cells affect organismal lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wolff and Dillin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mack et al., 2018</xref>). Like mammals, <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiences age-dependent functional changes in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stein and Murphy, 2012</xref>). Aged animals are defective in locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mulcahy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>), mechanosensory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck and Rankin, 1993</xref>), chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leinwand et al., 2015</xref>), thermotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murakami and Murakami, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), and food–butanone associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>). Age-dependent memory decline in the food–butanone association is ameliorated in the mutant of <italic>nkat-1</italic> encoding kynurenic acid-synthesizing enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vohra et al., 2018</xref>). Overactivation of Gα signaling in AWC sensory neurons also maintains the ability to form memory in aged animals in the food–butanone association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arey et al., 2018</xref>). These emerging evidence suggest that genetic manipulations can prevent age-dependent functional decline in the nervous system.</p><p>Compared to genetic manipulations, the modification of diet can be easily applicable to our daily lives. Studies in humans and mice imply that diet affects the cognitive decline in aged animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vauzour et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to address the dietary effect on the age-dependent behavioral decline and its underlying mechanism. In laboratories, <italic>C. elegans</italic> is maintained monoxenically with a uracil auxotroph <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain, OP50, as the standard diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner, 1974</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>C. elegans</italic> in natural habitat eats a wide variety of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dirksen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnke et al., 2020</xref>). These bacteria affect the physiology of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, such as growth rate, reproduction, and sensory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dirksen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O’Donnell et al., 2020</xref>). However, the effect of different bacteria on the behavioral decline during aging is unexplored. Among the potential bacterial diet for <italic>C. elegans</italic> in natural habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dirksen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>), we focused on lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are the most common probiotics for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2014</xref>). LAB, such as <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> (<italic>Lb</italic>.) and <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> (<italic>B</italic>.), are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming bacteria that produce lactic acid from carbohydrates as the primary metabolic product. Depending on the species, LAB have various effects on <italic>C. elegans</italic> physiology. <italic>Lb. gasseri</italic>, <italic>B. longum</italic>, and <italic>B. infantis</italic> extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Komura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakagawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Lb. helveticus</italic> does not increase the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakagawa et al., 2016</xref>). Even in the same species, different strains have different effects on lifespan, body size, and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, LAB modulate evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways such as the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grompone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sugawara and Sakamoto, 2018</xref>), which consists of the insulin receptor DAF-2, phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase cascade, and the downstream transcription factor DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin et al., 1997</xref>). DAF-16 is the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of mammalian FOXO transcription factor and is involved in various biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stein and Murphy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tissenbaum, 2018</xref>). Moreover, <italic>daf-16</italic> is involved in the age-dependent modulation of isothermal tracking behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with regular <italic>E. coli</italic> diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murakami et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To comprehensively understand the effect of LAB, we screened 35 different LAB species, including some subspecies. We examined the age-dependent functional decline of thermotaxis behavior, which reflects associative learning between temperature and food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mori and Ohshima, 1995</xref>). We demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> fed <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> in a clade maintained the thermotaxis behavior when aged, while <italic>E. coli-</italic>fed animals did not. Among those <italic>Lactobacilli</italic>, <italic>Lb. reuteri</italic> maintained the thermotaxis ability of aged animals without affecting the organismal lifespan or locomotion. The effect of <italic>Lb. reuteri</italic> on the thermotaxis of aged animals depends on the DAF-16 transcription factor functioning in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> thermotaxis behavior declines with age</title><p>After being cultivated with food at a temperature within the physiological range (15–25°C), <italic>C. elegans</italic> migrates toward and stays at the past cultivation temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>cult</sub>) on a linear thermal gradient without food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This behavior is called thermotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mori and Ohshima, 1995</xref>). To see the effect of aging on thermotaxis, we cultivated animals at 20°C with an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, OP50 (hereafter, <italic>E. coli</italic>, unless otherwise noted), commonly used in laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner, 1974</xref>). When the animals were placed at 17°C on a temperature gradient without food, young adults (day 1 of adulthood, D1) migrated up the temperature gradient toward 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, aged animals (day 5 of adulthood, D5) remained around the spotted area and did not reach the area near <italic>T</italic><sub>cult</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2020</xref>).

This age-dependent thermotaxis decline was not specific to OP50-fed animals because animals fed another <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, HT115, also showed a similar decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Thermotaxis performance declines with age.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of thermotaxis assay.

However, <italic>daf-2</italic> was required for normal thermotaxis in both young and aged animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). <italic>daf-16</italic> possesses several isoforms with different expression patterns and functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>).

The other isoforms are more broadly expressed in most tissues, including neurons.

We ruled out the possibility that the high performance of LAB-fed aged animals was due to thermophilicity, stronger association to LAB, better motility, dietary restriction, or longer lifespan. Thus, aging and diet likely affect the thermosensory circuit. The primary thermosensory neuron AFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mori and Ohshima, 1995</xref>) cell-autonomously stores temperature memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>). Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in AFD is reported to be defective in aged animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), the temperature sensation itself does not seem to be abolished in aged animals because they could migrate down the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). AFD thermosensory neurons synapse onto and regulate AIY interneurons by switching excitatory and inhibitory signals in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mori and Ohshima, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakano et al., 2020</xref>).

Thus, the different severities of thermotaxis decline between migration up and down the gradient in aged animals might be attributed to the different neural circuits responsible for those conditions, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeda et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal aging is discernible from organismal lifespan. <italic>nkat-1</italic> mutants prevent age-dependent memory decline in associative learning between food and butanone without changing lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vohra et al., 2018</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript examines how lactic acid producing <italic>E. coli</italic> impact age-related decline in neurological function through the use of temperature-food associative learning or thermotaxis. In particular, the authors screen a panel of different lactate producing <italic>E. coli</italic> and identify a particular clade of bacteria, <italic>Lactobacilli</italic>, that are able to suppress age-dependent decline in thermotaxis in a daf-16 dependent manner. Moreover, they uncouple improvement in neurological function from lifespan determination and locomotion. Overall, this manuscript represents an interesting phenomenon regarding the effects of the lactic acid producing bacteria. However, it is not clear what is happening in the worm to elicit this neurological response and much work remains to determine this mechanism of action.</p><p>The reviewers each appreciate the careful nature of these worm behavioral assays including a host of different controls. It is interesting that a clade of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can improve associative learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that many LAB strains of the same clade can improve thermotaxis in older nematodes, despite disparate results on longevity. However, there were some questions remaining about methodology, and more importantly, there is very little evidence provided on what the molecular mechanism might be behind this phenomenon.

In the current study, worms grown on <italic>E. coli</italic>, a common laboratory diet, were found to lose their thermotaxis ability as they grew older. Moreover, they identified that heterofermentive LAB bacteria help the worms maintain a high thermotaxis capability, with varying results on lifespan. The revised manuscript did a good job addressing many of the finer points brought up in the previous review, some of which are listed below, but failed to provide solid mechanistic evidence as to either what about the LAB bacteria causes these changes or what in the worm is responsible for the effects. While it is not necessary to have both of these mechanisms nailed down, I found the support for the daf-16 mechanistic data was still weak and am still not confident that what role, if any, daf-16 plays in this age- and diet-related degradation of thermotaxis. While this is an interesting study with well-described phenomenology and the revised manuscript addresses many of the minor issues raised, the mechanistic data remain the primary weakness of the manuscript, and a stronger or more detailed understanding of the mechanism involved in LAB-mediated thermotaxis is necessary.</p><p>Things which are improved in the revised manuscript</p><p>1. The revised version addressed the perception issue and demonstrated that it did not play a role in LAB-mediated thermotaxis.</p><p>2. Necessity of neuronal daf-16 is new in the revised manuscript</p><p>3. Heat killed LAB bacteria still helps in the thermotaxis ability, suggesting the possible role of metabolites.</p><p>There is still a major concern in the manuscript about the mechanism. As mentioned in the previous review, there are at least two clear approaches toward mechanism (what is important about the bacteria, or what is important in the worm). For the bacteria, the authors nicely show that smell is not likely to be involved and that dead LAB bacteria can replicate the effect, but go no further. In the worm, the authors chose to look at genes which are involved in worms, and again honed in on daf-16. Unfortunately, while the daf-16 KO data look promising at first, much of the rest of the data make me question whether daf-16 actually plays a direct role in this phenotype in WT worms, or whether it is just necessary to have daf-16 in developing neurons to properly develop key neurons like the AIY, as has been previously published. The evidence from daf-2 animals and from RNA seq data both point toward a repressive role of daf-16 for thermotaxis, which is consistent with daf-16 only being important during development. In short, the current manuscript does not show daf-16 activation or requirement during adulthood, or daf-16 targets that are required, leaving the possibility of developmental or other secondary effects being key to daf-16's necessity, while other mechanisms cause the interesting phenotype observed.</p><p>1. In contrast to LAB bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria that were killed showed better thermotaxis performance with age. It is therefore possible that thermotaxis behavior is negatively influenced by pathogenic response to <italic>E. coli</italic> that is absent in LAB bacteria?</p><p>2. The revised manuscript showed the necessity of neuronal daf-16 in regulating high thermotaxis ability of LAB fed aged animals. But it is still not clear whether/how LAB bacteria might activate the neuronal daf-16.</p><p>3. The transcriptomics signatures clusters the LAB bacteria together irrespective of the fermentative mode of LAB, suggesting that transcriptomic signaling may not be important for the thermotaxis behavior.</p><p>4. As mentioned above, the transcriptional changes in the worms grown on heterofermentative LAB bacteria do not depend on daf-16, since the directionality of the transcription changes is in the same direction as the daf-16 mutant. It contradicts the role of daf-16-mediated signaling for LAB-mediated higher thermotaxis behavior. Similarly, daf-2 mutant worms grown on <italic>E. coli</italic> and LAB bacteria don't show significant differences in thermotaxis, suggesting the possibility that activating daf-16 may blunt this effect. This brings the possibility that daf-16 negatively regulates thermotaxis in aged animals and that its requirement could be an artifact of daf-16's role in neural development.</p><p>To summarize, the authors should either identify something about the bacteria (e.g., metabolites, pathogenicity or lack thereof) or solidify/address signaling pathways that involve neuronal Daf-16 or another mechanism when fed LAB bacteria.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1. Figure 8C is missing/blank in the submission.</p><p>2. Lines 256-258 describe data about daf-16b that are not listed or in the figures from what I could find.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Higurashi et al. investigated how diet affects age-dependent thermotaxis behavioral decline in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the underlying mechanism involved. Using various behavioral studies, they showed that changing the animal's diet during aging, from <italic>E. coli</italic> to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), allowed the animals to retain a high thermotaxis performance index comparable to control. The authors demonstrated that this increase in performance index when animals are switched to a LAB diet is independent of thermophilicity, strength of association of lactic acid bacteria during learning, lifespan, motility, or starvation. By contrast, factors such as age, diet, and nutritional value of diet all seem to have an observable effect on age-dependent thermotaxis behavioral decline. Of the 35 lactic acid bacteria investigated within this study, the authors demonstrated that daf-16, which functions in the neurons, was necessary for the maintenance of thermotaxis of animals that were fed a Lb. reuteri diet during aging.</p><p>Overall, the authors were able to achieve their proposed aims and the data shown supports their main conclusions.</p><p>A strength of this study is the use of a vast array of behavioral assays (thermotaxis performance, motility, lifespan, nutrition, dietary restriction, chemotaxis) to assess the age-dependent decline in temperature-food associated learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The use of a wide variety of behavioral assays to support this hypothesis is worthy of mention. Additionally, the figures are nicely constructed and easy for a reader in any field to understand. The methods have been described in sufficient detail and clarity to allow for ease of replication and use by the scientific community.</p><p>Lacking within this study is a more in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism at play. The DAF-16 interpretation is confusing. First, with respect to tissue specificity, why was DAF-16 function in the intestine not examined (isoform independent) as this tissue, in addition to the nervous system, has been shown to be important for DAF-16 function in several lifespan extension paradigms. Second, why is DAF-16 required for the associative learning with age, yet the best performing heterofermentative LAB show a down-regulation of DAF-16. Moreover, activation of DAF-16 via daf-2 mutants shows very low learning. Perhaps reduction, but not loss, of DAF-16 activity is driving this improved age-associated learning.</p><p>Perhaps to obtain more clarity on the mechanism underlying their LAB learning phenomena, this group can examine more deeply their RNAseq datasets and focus on transcriptional changes distinct for their best performing heterofermentative Clade A. According to the GO term analysis, lipid homeostasis and nutrient catabolism would be a great place to start. Two kynerinine metabolism genes are examined (specific for tryptophan), but perhaps a quick examination a few more that were implicated by their RNAseq would be appropriate. Please provide a list or table of the 71 transcripts enriched in hetero over homo Lb.</p><p>Overall this provides a very interesting phenomena on age-associated learning and implicates heterofermentative LAB but their proposed molecular mechanism of action is not well stated or transparent to the reader.</p><p>Line 1: Please revise the title to &quot;Diet affects….&quot;</p><p>2.

The way the introduction section is currently written, the mention of daf-16 seems more of an afterthought. No clear introduction was given as to why including daf-16 within this study is pertinent for understanding the mechanism behind how diet affects age decline in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

Consider utilizing the RNASeq analysis (mentioned later in the manuscript) of D5 worms verses D1 worms (control) fed either <italic>E. coli</italic> or the LAB diet. The authors state that they tested mutants of 3 genes (nkat-1, kom-1, daf-16) and selected these genes based on previous studies, but for a more comprehensive analysis, RNASeq analysis should be used to determine if there are other genes that are highly/more regulated during aging when fed the LAB diet. A heat map would be a good visual of all the genes that are up or down regulated. A nice compliment would be to perform qPCR on the 3 genes that were selected for analysis. A transcription profile of each gene for D1, D5 <italic>E. coli</italic>, D5 Lb. reuteri conditions would help bolster the case for selection of these 3 genes.

The revised manuscript did a good job addressing many of the finer points brought up in the previous review, some of which are listed below, but failed to provide solid mechanistic evidence as to either what about the LAB bacteria causes these changes or what in the worm is responsible for the effects. While it is not necessary to have both of these mechanisms nailed down, I found the support for the daf-16 mechanistic data was still weak and am still not confident that what role, if any, daf-16 plays in this age- and diet-related degradation of thermotaxis. While this is an interesting study with well-described phenomenology and the revised manuscript addresses many of the minor issues raised, the mechanistic data remain the primary weakness of the manuscript, and a stronger or more detailed understanding of the mechanism involved in LAB-mediated thermotaxis is necessary.</p><p>Things which are improved in the revised manuscript</p><p>1. The revised version addressed the perception issue and demonstrated that it did not play a role in LAB-mediated thermotaxis.</p><p>2. Necessity of neuronal daf-16 is new in the revised manuscript</p><p>3. Heat killed LAB bacteria still helps in the thermotaxis ability, suggesting the possible role of metabolites.</p><p>There is still a major concern in the manuscript about the mechanism. As mentioned in the previous review, there are at least two clear approaches toward mechanism (what is important about the bacteria, or what is important in the worm). For the bacteria, the authors nicely show that smell is not likely to be involved and that dead LAB bacteria can replicate the effect, but go no further. In the worm, the authors chose to look at genes which are involved in worms, and again honed in on daf-16. Unfortunately, while the daf-16 KO data look promising at first, much of the rest of the data make me question whether daf-16 actually plays a direct role in this phenotype in WT worms, or whether it is just necessary to have daf-16 in developing neurons to properly develop key neurons like the AIY, as has been previously published. The evidence from daf-2 animals and from RNA seq data both point toward a repressive role of daf-16 for thermotaxis, which is consistent with daf-16 only being important during development. In short, the current manuscript does not show daf-16 activation or requirement during adulthood, or daf-16 targets that are required, leaving the possibility of developmental or other secondary effects being key to daf-16's necessity, while other mechanisms cause the interesting phenotype observed.</p><p>1. In contrast to LAB bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria that were killed showed better thermotaxis performance with age. It is therefore possible that thermotaxis behavior is negatively influenced by pathogenic response to <italic>E. coli</italic> that is absent in LAB bacteria?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, <italic>E. coli</italic> is known to be mildly pathogenic to <italic>C. elegans</italic> during aging (Cabreiro and Gems, EMBO Mol. Med. (review), 2013). However, in our case, <italic>E. coli</italic> killed at 65C had the same effects as live <italic>E. coli,</italic> suggesting that the pathogenic effects of live <italic>E. coli</italic> are not the primary cause. To make this point clearer, we added the following sentence (underlined) in Line 373:</p><p>“In our thermotaxis assay on aged animals, <italic>E. coli</italic> and LAB killed by 65 °C treatment had similar effects to live bacteria. This result implies that, instead of the action of live bacteria, such as pathogenic effects of <italic>E. coli</italic> (Cabreiro &amp; Gems, 2013), bacterial nutrition might be responsible for the effect on the thermotaxis of aged <italic>C. elegans</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The revised manuscript showed the necessity of neuronal daf-16 in regulating high thermotaxis ability of LAB fed aged animals. But it is still not clear whether/how LAB bacteria might activate the neuronal daf-16.</p></disp-quote><p>To get an insight into how bacterial diet affects neurons, we focused on the neuropeptides enriched in our RNAseq analysis. To avoid redundancy of the effect of neuropeptides, we wanted to analyze the neuropeptide synthesis or secretion pathway. Although <italic>unc-31</italic> encoding CAPS involved in dense-core vesicle exocytosis is commonly used, we could not use it because of its locomotion defects. Therefore, we focused on the four proprotein convertases crucial for neuropeptide synthesis and found that <italic>aex-5</italic> known to function in the intestine is involved in decreasing the thermotaxis ability of <italic>E. coli-</italic>fed aged mutants. Although we cannot provide direct evidence to answer the reviewer’s question, this experiment suggests that neuropeptide signaling may be involved in the dietary effect on the thermotaxis as a link between the intestine and neurons. We added Figure 9C and texts in Results (Line 292) and Discussion (Line 436).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The transcriptomics signatures clusters the LAB bacteria together irrespective of the fermentative mode of LAB, suggesting that transcriptomic signaling may not be important for the thermotaxis behavior.</p><p>4. As mentioned above, the transcriptional changes in the worms grown on heterofermentative LAB bacteria do not depend on daf-16, since the directionality of the transcription changes is in the same direction as the daf-16 mutant. It contradicts the role of daf-16-mediated signaling for LAB-mediated higher thermotaxis behavior. Similarly, daf-2 mutant worms grown on <italic>E. coli</italic> and LAB bacteria don't show significant differences in thermotaxis, suggesting the possibility that activating daf-16 may blunt this effect. This brings the possibility that daf-16 negatively regulates thermotaxis in aged animals and that its requirement could be an artifact of daf-16's role in neural development.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our transcriptome analysis did not capture the entire mechanism. This is mainly because both aging and different diet had pleiotropic effects on the entire body of the animals and changed the transcriptomic landscape of animals, including large tissues like the intestine. We showed that <italic>daf-16</italic> functions in the neurons in the thermotaxis of aged animals. Since neurons are relatively small, they had less impact on the transcriptomic data of the whole organism. Our data implied an interesting possibility that the <italic>daf-16</italic> regulates different genes between the neurons and other tissues. In the future, the transcriptome analysis of single-cell RNAseq can address this issue, but at this point, single-cell analysis is technically challenging to apply to adult animals and aged animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To summarize, the authors should either identify something about the bacteria (e.g., metabolites, pathogenicity or lack thereof) or solidify/address signaling pathways that involve neuronal Daf-16 or another mechanism when fed LAB bacteria.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1.

Using various behavioral studies, they showed that changing the animal's diet during aging, from <italic>E. coli</italic> to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), allowed the animals to retain a high thermotaxis performance index comparable to control. The authors demonstrated that this increase in performance index when animals are switched to a LAB diet is independent of thermophilicity, strength of association of lactic acid bacteria during learning, lifespan, motility, or starvation. By contrast, factors such as age, diet, and nutritional value of diet all seem to have an observable effect on age-dependent thermotaxis behavioral decline. Of the 35 lactic acid bacteria investigated within this study, the authors demonstrated that daf-16, which functions in the neurons, was necessary for the maintenance of thermotaxis of animals that were fed a Lb. reuteri diet during aging.</p><p>Overall, the authors were able to achieve their proposed aims and the data shown supports their main conclusions.</p><p>A strength of this study is the use of a vast array of behavioral assays (thermotaxis performance, motility, lifespan, nutrition, dietary restriction, chemotaxis) to assess the age-dependent decline in temperature-food associated learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The use of a wide variety of behavioral assays to support this hypothesis is worthy of mention. Additionally, the figures are nicely constructed and easy for a reader in any field to understand. The methods have been described in sufficient detail and clarity to allow for ease of replication and use by the scientific community.</p><p>Lacking within this study is a more in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism at play. The DAF-16 interpretation is confusing. First, with respect to tissue specificity, why was DAF-16 function in the intestine not examined (isoform independent) as this tissue, in addition to the nervous system, has been shown to be important for DAF-16 function in several lifespan extension paradigms. Second, why is DAF-16 required for the associative learning with age, yet the best performing heterofermentative LAB show a down-regulation of DAF-16. Moreover, activation of DAF-16 via daf-2 mutants shows very low learning. Perhaps reduction, but not loss, of DAF-16 activity is driving this improved age-associated learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that the intestine is the site of action for lifespan extension. However, we did not examine the rescue of the intestine because <italic>daf-16b</italic> that rescued the phenotype is not expressed in the intestine. We think that lifespan and behavioral aging have different mechanisms. The second point also makes sense. We speculate that the lack of tissue specificity caused this discrepancy. As discussed in the rebuttal for the first reviewer, the targets in the neurons important for thermotaxis may differ from those in the intestine, which is vital for the lifespan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps to obtain more clarity on the mechanism underlying their LAB learning phenomena, this group can examine more deeply their RNAseq datasets and focus on transcriptional changes distinct for their best performing heterofermentative Clade A. According to the GO term analysis, lipid homeostasis and nutrient catabolism would be a great place to start. Two kynerinine metabolism genes are examined (specific for tryptophan), but perhaps a quick examination a few more that were implicated by their RNAseq would be appropriate. Please provide a list or table of the 71 transcripts enriched in hetero over homo Lb.</p></disp-quote><p>We added new Supplementary file 3j and 3l to list the genes found from the comparison between Hetero LAB vs. Homo LAB or <italic>E. coli</italic>.

However, these mutants showed no phenotype in D1, <italic>E. coli</italic>-fed D5, or <italic>Lb. reuteri</italic>-fed D5.

Consider utilizing the RNASeq analysis (mentioned later in the manuscript) of D5 worms verses D1 worms (control) fed either <italic>E. coli</italic> or the LAB diet. The authors state that they tested mutants of 3 genes (nkat-1, kom-1, daf-16) and selected these genes based on previous studies, but for a more comprehensive analysis, RNASeq analysis should be used to determine if there are other genes that are highly/more regulated during aging when fed the LAB diet. A heat map would be a good visual of all the genes that are up or down regulated. A nice compliment would be to perform qPCR on the 3 genes that were selected for analysis. A transcription profile of each gene for D1, D5 <italic>E. coli</italic>, D5 Lb. reuteri conditions would help bolster the case for selection of these 3 genes.
