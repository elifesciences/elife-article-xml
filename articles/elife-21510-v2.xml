The exact <italic>modus operandi</italic> of Prp43 and of all other spliceosomal DEAH-box RNA helicases is still elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of Prp43 complexes in different functional states and the analysis of structure-based mutants providing insights into the unwinding and loading mechanism of RNAs. The Prp43•ATP-analog•RNA complex shows the localization of the RNA inside a tunnel formed by the two RecA-like and C-terminal domains. In the ATP-bound state this tunnel can be transformed into a groove prone for RNA binding by large rearrangements of the C-terminal domains. Several conformational changes between the ATP- and ADP-bound states explain the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation, mainly mediated by a β-turn of the RecA1 domain containing the newly identified RF motif. This mechanism is clearly different to those of other RNA helicases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21510.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21510.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>spliceosome</kwd><kwd>rRNA biogenesis</kwd><kwd>DHX15</kwd><kwd><italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic></kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB860 TPA2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ficner</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB860 TPA1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lührmann</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structural and functional analysis of the ATP-dependent RNA helicase Prp43 provides insights into the mechanisms of RNA binding and translocation, which could serve as paradigm for all DEAH-box proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Helicases are omnipresent enzymes, spread through the whole phylogenetic tree of life as well as viruses, since their unwinding capabilities are of striking importance for numerous cellular pathways of RNA and DNA metabolism. Based on sequence alignments, helicases were subdivided into six superfamilies (SF) which come in two different flavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jankowsky and Fairman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pyle, 2011</xref>). Most members of the SF1 or SF2 are monomeric, in contrast to the members of SF3 to SF6 which assemble as hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>). The latter are composed of either RecA- or AAA<sup>+</sup>-like domains, thus being distinct from the SF1 and SF2 helicases which are exclusively composed of two RecA-like domains in juxtaposition with each other.</p><p>The SF2 is by far the largest superfamily, comprising a vast number of RNA helicases with implications in numerous RNP metabolism pathways, such as translation initiation and termination, pre-mRNA editing and splicing, mRNA export as well as ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ozgur et al., 2015</xref>). The centerpiece of these helicases is formed by the two RecA-like domains, harboring conserved motifs which are crucial for these NTPase-dependent RNA helicases to accomplish their function. The motifs I, II, V and VI are required for nucleoside triphosphate binding and hydrolysis, motifs Ia, Ib and IV are involved in RNA binding and the motif III participates in coupling the NTPase and the unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caruthers and McKay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cordin and Beggs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cordin et al., 2012</xref>). Most SF2 helicases exhibit extensions at the N- and C-termini of the helicase core, which is also true for the DEAH-box proteins, a subfamily of the DEAH/RHA family. The C-terminal extension is highly conserved in DEAH-box helicases and is composed of three domains: a winged helix (WH), a ratchet and an oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walbott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>). The ratchet domain was originally named according to the homologous domain of the DNA helicase Hel308 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Büttner et al., 2007</xref>), but recent studies on MLE suggested that this domain has no ratcheting function and should be renamed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prabu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore it is hereinafter referred to as ratchet-like domain. In DEAH-box proteins the degrees of freedom of the helicase core are reduced by the interactions between the C-terminal domains and the two RecA-like domains in comparison to those DEAD-box proteins lacking such C-terminal domains. The conservation of the N-terminal extension is distinctly lower and they dramatically differ in length between the members of this subfamily. Reported functions for this N-terminal extension are, among others, the involvement in the recruitment as shown for Prp16 (pre-mRNA processing factor 16) as well as for Prp22 or for the subcellular targeting to the nucleus as elucidated for Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Guthrie, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider and Schwer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fouraux et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The latter mentioned helicase, Prp43, is an outstanding member of the DEAH-box subfamily since it has implications in different substantive cellular processes. The first reported function of Prp43 is its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing. In the course of this process, Prp43 acts at the latest stage of the splicing cycle and it is required to dismantle the intron-lariat spliceosome into the excised lariat and the U2•U5•U6 snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arenas and Abelson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fourmann et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2016a</xref>). Recently, the target substrate of Prp43 during this process was revealed which is the RNA network between the U2 snRNP and the branch site of the intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fourmann et al., 2016b</xref>). Indeed, in the spliceosome, Prp43 was crosslinked exclusively to the pre-mRNA and not to any snRNAs. Furthermore, Prp43 is also a key player for the disassembly of stalled spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pandit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Semlow and Staley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koodathingal et al., 2010</xref>). During these spliceosomal processes, Prp43 binds RNA in a sequence-independent manner. Prp43 action is also essential for ribosome biogenesis. Here, it is involved in the maturation of 18S and 25S rRNAs with several reported binding sites on intermediates which vary in sequence and thus make a sequenced-based binding mechanism unlikely for Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lebaron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohnsack et al., 2009</xref>). Lately, the involvement of Prp43 in a third distinct cellular function was illuminated and it was unraveled that Prp43 is also involved in the promotion of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heininger et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The distribution of Prp43 between these three fundamentally different processes is regulated by a fine-tuned interplay of the helicase itself and cofactors. These cofactors belong to the family of G-patch proteins, which share an intrinsically disordered glycine-rich region, the G-patch motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 1999</xref>). Apart from being involved in recruitment, these G-patch proteins also increase the NTPase and stimulate the helicase activity of Prp43. To date, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> five G-patch proteins were identified out of which four interact with Prp43. In the context of splicing, Prp43 function is modulated by Ntr1 (Nineteen complex-related proteins 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsai et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boon et al., 2006</xref>). During rRNA maturation, Prp43 is associated with Pfa1 (Prp forty-three associated 1) or Gno1 (G-patch nucleolar protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lebaron et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohnsack et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, its apoptotic function is implemented by the interaction with Cmg1 (Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial G-patch protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heininger et al., 2016</xref>). The remaining G-patch protein from yeast is Spp2 (Suppressor of PRP protein 2) which interacts with another spliceosomal DEAH-box helicase, Prp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Warkocki et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite intensive studies, the exact <italic>modus operandi</italic> of the DEAH-box helicases and thus of Prp43 is still elusive to date. This is primarily attributable to a lack of crystal structures of members of the DEAH-box subfamily in an active state and with bound interaction partners. Recently, the crystal structure of the related DExH-box helicase MLE (Maleless), which belongs to another DEAH/RHA subfamily, provided a first insight into how this helicase might function. The complex of MLE with a U<sub>10</sub>-RNA and ADP•AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> led to a proposed mechanism of how RNA is translocated through its interior tunnel driven by conformational changes of a Hook-Loop in the RecA2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prabu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>So far, three crystal structures of Prp43 in the post-catalytic ADP-bound state have been available from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> or <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walbott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tauchert et al., 2016</xref>). The latter mentioned organism might be a valuable alternative for structural studies on DEAH-box proteins, since several crystal structures of spliceosomal RNA helicases from this thermophilic fungus were solved only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tauchert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tauchert and Ficner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absmeier et al., 2015</xref>). Owing to this, intensive crystallization trails with Prp43 from <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> were performed leading to three new crystal structures. All three structures show Prp43 in an active state, since it was crystallized with a non-hydrolysable ATP-analog (ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) as well as one of these structures show Prp43 with an additional U<sub>7</sub>-RNA. The Prp43•U<sub>7</sub>-RNA•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>complex unveils the structural basis of why Prp43 can bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner. The Prp43•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> structures illustrate how Prp43 binds and releases complex RNA substrates due to massive rearrangements of the C-terminal domains which affect an opening of the interior RNA-binding tunnel which is formed by the two RecA-like and the C-terminal domains. The hydrolysis of an ATP molecule induces conformational rearrangements of the RecA-like domains which, in turn, allow the translocation of the RNA through the interior tunnel <italic>via</italic> the so far unrecognized RF motif present in a β-turn of all DEAH-box helicases. According to our results, the translocation mechanism of MLE is very unlikely to be compatible for Prp43. All proposed functional mechanisms of Prp43 are strengthened by functional analyses of structure-based mutants in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of Prp43 with bound RNA in an active state</title><p>In order to overcome the lack of crystal structures of DEAH-box helicases in an active state, we crystallized Prp43 in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP-analog ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> as well as a U<sub>16</sub>-RNA. For these crystallization approaches, an N-terminally truncated version of Prp43 from <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> was used (ctPrp43ΔN), which lacks the first 60 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Previously, we already demonstrated that this truncated ctPrp43 variant is fully capable of replacing its yeast ortholog in spliceosome disassembly assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tauchert et al., 2016</xref>). Crystals of ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the presence of the U<sub>16</sub>-RNA were obtained in the space group P6<sub>1</sub>22 and diffracted up to 2.62 Å.

into the sequence-unspecific RNA-binding mechanism of a genuine DEAH-box helicase were obtained. ctPrp43 consists of six different domains: an N-terminal extension (residues 1–96), the RecA1 (97–273) and RecA2 (274–458) domains, and the C-terminal domains which were assigned as degenerate winged helix domain (459–526), ratchet-like domain (527–640) and oligosaccharide binding-fold domain (641–764) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walbott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The RecA-like domains and the C-terminal domains appear to be stably associated by multiple interactions and form a tunnel inside the Prp43 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) which is the binding site of the U<sub>7</sub>-RNA. The 5’ end of the RNA is located at the RecA2 domain and the 3’ RNA end is situated at the RecA1 domain. For the first three nucleotides at the 5’ end (U1–U3) two alternative conformations are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The structure reveals the basis for the sequence-independent RNA binding of Prp43 which is in line with previous biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fourmann et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohnsack et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka and Schwer, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Prp43 binds RNA in a sequence-independent fashion</title><p>Interactions between Prp43 and the U<sub>7</sub>-RNA are sparsely present. Depending on which of the two alternative RNA conformations is analyzed, only 11 or 13 hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions between the RNA and Prp43 can be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref>). Most of these interactions are formed between the sugar-phosphate backbone of the RNA and the RecA1, RecA2 or the ratchet-like domain. On the contrary, the uracil moieties do not interact with the helicase with the exception of a hydrogen bond of U3 with the Ser 555 main-chain carboxyl group from the ratchet-like domain and a base stack between the U1 and Arg 562 which only occurs in one of the two alternative conformations. These Prp43-RNA interactions are, however, by far not enough for sequence-specific binding of a substrate RNA to Prp43. In addition to the unspecific RNA-binding mode of Prp43, RNA binding appears to be transient, as only four nucleotides are more tightly associated with Prp43. In the crystal structure presented, this corresponds to the nucleotides U4 to U7. At the 5’ end, the first three nucleotides are weakly bound by Prp43 since only 2 (conf. B) and 3 (conf. A) interactions are detectable, respectively. The weak interaction is additionally highlighted by elevated <italic>B</italic>-factors for this RNA region compared to the four other nucleotides (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). After the first two nucleotides, a kink is introduced in the RNA backbone and the number of Prp43-RNA interactions gets more numerous and more intense. At the 3’end, the RNA does not interact with Prp43 as soon as the end of the RNA-binding tunnel is reached. The phosphate group of the eighth nucleotide is exactly located at the end of this tunnel. Compared to the nucleotides U4 to U7, this phosphate exhibits elevated <italic>B</italic>-factors. The U8 nucleoside was not defined in the electron density map and thus might indicate the presence of multiple RNA conformations at this site out of which none is clearly favorable due the lack of interactions with Prp43.</p><p>Having determined the crystal structure of ctPrp43ΔN•U<sub>7</sub>•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> another question concerning Prp43’s <italic>modus operandi</italic> did arise which is directly linked to its cellular role. In the context of pre-mRNA splicing or rRNA biogenesis, Prp43 has to bind to or to be released from short singled-stranded RNA stretches within larger folded RNAs or RNPs. In the light of the fact that the RNA-binding site of Prp43 is located inside a tunnel, RNA loading appears to be non-trivial and thus requires further illumination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Crystal structure of Prp43 in the ATP-bound state</title><p>In pursuance of analyzing how Prp43 binds to ssRNA regions within folded RNAs, we targeted at determining the pre-catalytic state of Prp43 before RNA binding.

However, a large rearrangement of the C-terminal domains is seen in both ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which leads to the disruption of the interaction between two β-hairpin loops from the RecA2 domain and the OB-fold.

Thus, these rearrangements of the C-terminal domains are expected to be crucial for their unwinding function. The opening is feasible due to a large movement of the ratchet-like and the OB-fold domains. Rearrangements of the WH domain are less pronounced owing to the fact that the WH rather functions as a hinge region between the RecA2 and the ratchet-like domain. Comparison between the ctPrp43ΔN•U<sub>7</sub>•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) complex structures after alignment of the RecA-like domains revealed that the center of mass of the ratchet-like domain is shifted by 16.2 Å, and by 14.1 Å for the OB-fold domain. In the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(LR) complex structure, these values are equal to 17.0 Å (ratchet-like) and 11.7 Å (OB-fold), respectively. The ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) structure is in a marginally more closed conformation, hence the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structures are not completely identical. They represent two slightly different snapshots of Prp43 which both might exist in solution and presumably are favored by the different crystallization conditions or different crystal packing. These two states of ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> might also give a hint at how Prp43 switches into the closed conformation since in the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) complex structure one inter-domain contact is present between the RecA2 (Asp 486) and the ratchet-like domain (Lys 605). These interactions between sequentially distal residues might trigger the switching from the open into the closed conformation after the binding to RNA. The circumstance that both structures of the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex are in a similar, open conformation strongly suggests the possibility that the complex structures presented reflect the main conformation of Prp43 in an active state in solution. Owing to the fact that Prp43•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> crystallized in different space groups and in divergent crystallization conditions, the open conformation <italic>in crystallo</italic> is highly unlikely to be a crystallization artefact. This assumption is additionally supported by the low number of crystal contacts for the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) (355.3 Å² of buried surface/1.1% of the total surface) and the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(LR) (1524.3 Å²/4.7%) complex structure.</p><p>To further strengthen the hypothesis that the opening of the tunnel by the displacement of the C-terminal domains is crucial for the helicase function of Prp43, we designed a mutant of Prp43 which allows us to trap the closed conformation by the introduction of an internal disulfide bond (ctPrp43-IDSB). For this purpose, one cysteine was introduced into the RecA1 domain and another one into the ratchet-like domain at exposed positions to maximize the number of formed disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The functional impact of these mutations was analyzed by an ATPase assay, a fluorescence-based helicase assay and an intron-lariat spliceosome (ILS) disassembly assay. First of all, the percentage of formed disulfide bonds was experimentally estimated. The wild-type protein contains nine cysteines, the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant two additional ones. <italic>Via</italic> Ellman reaction, the number of cysteines was determined to be 8.5 ± 0.1 (ctPrp43) and 9.3 ± 0.1 (ctPrp43-IDSB), respectively. This allows us to conclude that the majority of ctPrp43-IDSB exhibits the internal disulfide bridge because oxidized cysteines cannot be detected by this method and only the nine cysteines, which are also present in the wild-type protein, were determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Prp43 trapped in the closed conformation is impaired in its helicase activity</title><p>Having determined that ctPrp43-IDSB is mainly present in the oxidized and therefore closed state, this mutant was subsequently analyzed concerning its helicase activity using a synthetic dsRNA with a 3’ssRNA overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Since wild-type Prp43 exhibited a very low activity (0.54 nM of unwound RNA/min) in the absence of any stimulatory G-patch (GP) protein, we tested its activity in the presence of the ctNtr1-GP (1.98 nM/min) and the ctPfa1-GP (60.03 nM/min). Since the ctPfa1-GP could increase the Prp43 activity to a much higher level, the ctPfa1-GP was used for the <italic>in vitro</italic> helicase activity analysis of all Prp43 mutants. ctPrp43-IDSB exhibited an activity of 12.18 nM/min which equals about 1/5th of the wild-type Prp43 activity and thus is clearly impaired concerning its ability to unwind dsRNA. The remaining helicase activity of the mutant is most likely caused by the fraction of ctPrp43-IDSB which does not contain the internal disulfide bond. The activity of ctPrp43 and the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant were also analyzed for a physiological and more complex substrate RNP by using the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ILS disassembly assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In previous work it was shown that ctPrp43 is capable of functionally replacing scPrp43 in the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tauchert et al., 2016</xref>). ctPrp43 can release about 60% of intron-lariat RNA from scILS in the presence of ATP and scNtr(1•2) and dissociate the remaining spliceosomal RNP core into the free U6 snRNA, 18S U5 and 20S U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This is close to the 65% efficiency of recombinant scPrp43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In case of the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant, these assays were performed in the presence and absence of DTT, which can reduce the disulfide bridge between the RecA1 and ratchet-like domain and thus free ctPrp43-IDSB from its locked conformation. Without DTT, the efficiency of ILS disassembly by ctPrp43-IDSB is clearly impaired compared to the wild-type protein since only 10% of all ILSs are dissociated which equals the amount of the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and d</xref>). In the presence of DTT, the ILS dissociation efficiency of ctPrp43-IDSB can be fully restored to the wild-type activity level of 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). This clearly hints at the fact that locking Prp43 in the closed conformation distinctly influences its activity as deduced from the crystal structures of ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and thus proving the importance of adopting the open conformation for the helicase activity of Prp43 also in the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21510.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Helicase activity and RNA-binding assays of ctPrp43 and mutants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The maximal unwinding velocity (nM/min) for a dsRNA with a 3’ overhang is shown.

For all ctPrp43 variants, the ATPase activity was analyzed for ctPrp43 itself, after the addition of a GP, or U<sub>16</sub>-RNA or in the presence of both. Since this was the first enzymatic characterization of Prp43 from <italic>C. thermophilum</italic>, several general results are worth mentioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The basal ATPase activity of ctPrp43 (1.81 min<sup>−1</sup>) is very similar to its ortholog from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (2.43 min<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christian et al., 2014</xref>). ctPrp43 is stimulated by both, the ctNtr1-GP and the ctPfa1-GP, but the effect by the latter is more pronounced. A clear difference between <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Prp43 is that ctPrp43 does not exhibit RNA-stimulated ATPase activity in the absence of a GP.

ctPrp43-IDSB is also stimulated by ctPfa1-GP and by U<sub>16</sub>-RNA in the presence of the ctPfa1-GP, but in the contrast to wild-type Prp43 also just by U<sub>16</sub>-RNA. These findings confirm that the difference in the helicase and the ILS disassembly assay between ctPrp43 and ctPrp43-IDSB is solely caused by the impairment of the unwinding capabilities. The RNA-induced stimulation of ctPrp43-IDSB in the trapped conformation might still be feasible due to the fact that a short single-stranded U<sub>16</sub>-RNA without any secondary structures was used for these assays. Binding to the entry or exit site of the RNA-binding tunnel, which does not require an opening of the tunnel, might be sufficient for the RNA-induced stimulation of the ATPase activity (see below). Furthermore, Prp43 in the trapped closed conformation appears to be more prone for the stimulation of the ATPase activity by RNA since the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant (24.99 min<sup>−1</sup>) is stimulated by U<sub>16</sub>-RNA while the wild-type protein is not (2.08 min<sup>−1</sup>). It is conceivable that the GP increases the number of Prp43 molecules in a closed conformation since in the presence of a GP also the wild-type protein is stimulated by RNA.</p><p>Having shown the importance of the opening of Prp43’s C-terminal domains for its unwinding capability, we asked how Prp43 couples ATP hydrolysis and RNA translocation, leading to its helicase activity. Since high-resolution structures of the pre- and post-catalytic state of a DEAH-box helicase are both now available, conformational rearrangements of Prp43 in the course of nucleotide hydrolysis were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conformational rearrangements at the helicase core</title><p>To investigate the effect of ATP hydrolysis on the Prp43 conformation, the structures of the ADP and the ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> bound state were compared. Since the conformations of the RecA-like domains of the three structures ctPrp43ΔN•U<sub>7</sub>•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) and ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(LR) are very similar, the analysis of the conformational switches was restricted to the comparison of ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) with the previously published ctPrp43ΔN•ADP structure.</p><p>The individual RecA-like domains of ctPrp43ΔN•ADP and ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) superimpose well with r.m.s.d. values of 0.36 Å (139 C<sub>α</sub>) for the RecA1 domains and 0.44 Å (142 C<sub>α</sub>) for the RecA2 domains. Superimposing the helicase cores consisting of both RecA-like domains shows that the RecA1 and RecA2 domains are rotated by ca. 4˚ and ca. 14˚, respectively. There is also a slight translational displacement of the RecA2 domain by a 2.7 Å shift of its center of mass with regard to the RecA1 domain. Depending on the ADP/ATP state, conformational changes of several of the conserved SF2 helicase motifs, most strikingly of those in the RecA2 domain are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The conformations of the motifs I, Ia, Ib and II, which are all located in the RecA1 domain, are similar between the ATP-bound and the ADP-bound state of Prp43. This ATP-bound state, mimicked by the bound ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, also allows to deduce how Prp43 does hydrolyze ATP. The Glu 219 of the eponymous DEAH-motif (motif II) binds a water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O 388) and positions it in close spatial proximity to the BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, which corresponds to the ATP γ-phosphate. Presumably, this H<sub>2</sub>O 388 performs the nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom of the γ-phosphate since it is in an almost perfect orientation for an S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution mechanism at 180° to the leaving group. In the ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structure, this water molecule is additionally bound <italic>via</italic> the interactions with Gln 428 and Arg 435 from motif VI. The region containing the motif VI undergoes one of the most pronounced conformational rearrangements of the helicase core and it is shifted in the ADP-bound state 5.1 Å apart from the bound nucleotide. In the ATP-bound state, also interactions between Arg 432 and Arg 435 from motif VI and the phosphate(-mimic) groups are detectable. In the ADP-bound state, only Arg 435 of motif VI interacts with the 3’OH of the ribose. Another noticeable rearrangement can be observed for Phe 360 which is not part of a classical SF2 helicase motif. In the ADP-bound state, the adenine moiety interacts with Phe 360 <italic>via</italic> π-electron stacking and by cation-π-interactions with Arg 162. In the ATP-bound state, Phe 360 is shifted 5.4 Å apart from the base which is now solely stabilized by Arg 162. The rearrangements of the other conserved motifs are less distinct but still notably. In the ADP-bound state, the motifs IV and V are shifted by 3.3 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively, apart from the C-terminal domains.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21510.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Active site of Prp43 in the ATP- and ADP-bound state.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>, Left panel) Active site of Prp43 with the bound ATP-analog ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> as present in ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) (PDBid: 5ltj).

The transition of this motif might be required to induce the global conformational rearrangements leading to the rotation of the RecA domains. The rotation leads to a movement of a β-turn in the RecA1 domain and of a β-hairpin in the RecA2 domain, which both are directly located at the RNA-binding tunnel and thus might be involved in RNA translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The β-turn in the RecA1 domain consists of the amino acids Arg 180 and Phe 181, and the β-hairpin of the RecA2 domain is composed of the amino acids Tyr 348, Gly 349 and Thr 350. Interestingly, this second loop has previously been identified to be crucial for the helicase activity of the DExH-box helicase MLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prabu et al., 2015</xref>). In this study by Prapu and co-workers, a triple-mutant of the MLE was generated in which all residues located in this loop were mutated to glycine residues. This loop was termed Hook-Loop as it hooks between the bases of the bound RNA. It was assumed that in the course of NTP hydrolysis the movement of this loop causes the translocation of the bound RNA. Replacing the wild-type Hook-Loop sequence by GGG led to a complete loss of the helicase activity of MLE. Notably, in contrast to MLE the corresponding residues of the Prp43 Hook-Loop do not contact the bound RNA. In order to analyze the impact of both β-hairpin loops on RNA unwinding, several mutants of Prp43 were generated. In the Hook-Turn mutant (ctPrp43-HT), the amino acids 180–181 were mutated to GG and in the Hook-Loop mutant (ctPrp43-HL) the residues 348 and 350 were replaced by glycines. In addition to this, a double mutant in which both, the Hook-Turn and the Hook-Loop, contain the glycine substitutions (ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL), was also analyzed.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21510.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Position of the Hook-Turn and Hook-Loop in ctPrp43.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The localization of the Hook-Turn in the RecA1 domain and of the Hook-Loop in the RecA2 domain in the ctPrp43ΔN•U<sub>7</sub>•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structure is shown.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, the ctPrp43-HT (0.68 nM/min) and the ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL (0.88 nM/min) mutants exhibit a strongly impaired RNA unwinding activity compared with wild-type ctPrp43 (60.03 nM/min) which corresponds to an almost complete loss of function as seen for the negative control (0.46 nM/min). Intriguingly, the ctPrp43-HL (61.87 nM/min) mutant shows an activity being almost equal to the wild-type protein. This high helicase activity of the ctPrp43-HL mutant is in clear contrast to the results for MLE and thus indicates a different RNA translocation mechanism between the two subfamilies of DEAH-box and DExH-box helicases. This difference in the translocation mechanism is consistent with the ctPrp43ΔN•U<sub>7</sub>•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structure. An interaction between the Hook-Loop and the RNA, as seen in MLE, is unlikely in Prp43 because the Hook-Loop residues point at the opposite direction and do not contact the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In contrast, Arg 180 and Phe 181 of the Hook-Turn directly point at the RNA, and after ATP-hydrolysis these residues are moving towards the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) and presumably hook in between the bases. The Hook-Turn exhibits some flexibility since its main chain is present in two alternative conformations in the ctPrp43ΔN•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) complex structure. According to this structure, this β-turn is present as type I (47%) and type II (53%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The assumption that the Hook-Turn is the key player of RNA translocation in Prp43 is additionally strengthened by the results of the ILS disassembly assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f, g and h</xref>). The ctPrp43-HL mutant dissociates ILSs at the wild-type protein level ~60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and g</xref>), while the activity of both ctPrp43-HT and ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL is abolished and is similar to the background level of scILS at ~10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a, f and h</xref>). These data confirmed that also in the spliceosome only the Hook-Turn residues are crucial for the function of Prp43, while the Hook-Loop residues are not required.</p><p>In order to address the possibility that the reduced helicase activity of the HT mutant is caused by a reduced affinity for RNA, the RNA binding was measured by means of fluorescence anisotropy revealing that this mutant is able to bind U<sub>16</sub>-RNA even with a higher affinity than the wild-type protein (<italic>K</italic><sub>D </sub>0.84 ± 0.05 µM vs. 4.98 ± 0.57 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the loss of helicase activity of the HT mutant is not caused by a loss of ATPase activity since all three mutants (ctPrp43-HT: 13.21 min<sup>−1</sup>, ctPrp43-HL: 6.19 min<sup>−1</sup>, ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL: 7.61 min<sup>−1</sup>) exhibit a level of intrinsic ATPase activity comparable to wild-type Prp43 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The increased activity of the HT mutant is presumably caused by the fact that the arginine from the Hook-Turn is involved in hydrogen-bonding which has to be disrupted in the course of ATP hydrolysis. In the corresponding Hook-Turn mutants these contacts are not present due to the substitution by glycines, and therefore less energy is consumed by the conformational rearrangements. Furthermore, all of the three Hook-Turn or Hook-Loop mutants are stimulated by G-patch proteins, but it is remarkable that the ctPrp43-HT and ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL mutants are not additionally stimulated by U<sub>16</sub>-RNA in contrast to the ctPrp43-HL mutant. The differences between the ATPase activity of ctPrp43-HT and ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL in the presence of the G-patch protein and of the G-patch protein with RNA are not significant. The lack of RNA-induced stimulation for these two constructs might hint at the fact that the ATPase activity stimulation of Prp43 by RNA occurs at the interior tunnel <italic>via</italic> the interaction with the Hook-Turn.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prp43 was known to bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner which is explained by the ctPrp43ΔN•U<sub>7</sub>•ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structure revealing the almost entire absence of interactions between the bases of the RNA and Prp43. The observed <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value in the μM range suggests that the RNA binding of Prp43 is transient, which is in line with the low number of hydrogen bonds primarily formed by four out of the seven nucleotides, and the high <italic>B</italic>-factors for U1-U3 and their alternative conformations. However, this unselective and transient binding mode of RNA by Prp43 is perfectly in line with its molecular function. Prp43 helicase activity is required in several distinct cellular processes. Target sites in rRNA maturation and pre-mRNA splicing are very different and thus selective RNA binding would not be compatible with Prp43’s mode of function. Furthermore, a tight binding of substrate RNA would be undesirable since it would decrease the efficiency of Prp43 and prolong the required time for the release of substrate RNA.</p><p>The comparison of the RNA-binding mode of Prp43 with that of MLE, a DExH-box protein from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that was previously crystallized with a U<sub>10</sub>-RNA and the transition state analog ADP•AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prabu et al., 2015</xref>), reveals several differences but also striking similarities. Despite the fact that the architecture of the conserved domains is almost identical and the relative position of the bound RNA in the helicase is similar, MLE binds poly-uridine RNA in a sequence-dependent manner. Numerous bases are specifically recognized by MLE and a tighter and much more elaborated interaction network between MLE and the RNA is present. Nonetheless, there are also noticeable similarities concerning the RNA interactions. In Prp43, four main-chain amide interaction interactions between residues of the RecA1 or RecA2 domains and the RNA are present, one with each of the tightly bound nucleotides (U4-U7). Glu 316 interacts with U4, Gly 349 with U5, Arg 153 with U6 and Arg 180 with U7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). There are also two threonine residues of conserved motifs that interact with the RNA. Thr 195 from motif Ib and Thr 381 from motif V are involved in hydrogen bonding <italic>via</italic> their sides chains with the phosphates of the nucleotides U7 and U5, respectively. Interestingly, these main-chain amide interactions are completely conserved in MLE. Despite the fact that the residues themselves are not conserved in MLE, the position at which the interaction takes place is virtually identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The corresponding interacting residues and nucleotides in MLE are Trp 663-U6, Ser 692-U7, Arg 443-U8 and Arg 470-U9. Furthermore, the interactions with the conserved threonine residues are also present in MLE (Thr 486-U9 and Thr 717-U7). Moreover, there are three additional side chain interactions which are conserved between Prp43 and MLE. The interaction of Arg 201 (motif Ib) with the ribose of the U7, the hydrogen bonding of Asn 382 with the ribose of U4 and the interaction of Lys 403 with the phosphate moiety of U4 in Prp43 have identical counterparts in MLE. These counterparts are Arg 492-U9, Asn 718-U6 and Arg 739-U6.</p><p>Having unraveled the conserved interactions with RNA between the two members of the DEAH/RHA subfamilies, the question arose whether these interactions are present also in the related family of viral NS3/NPH-II helicases. Members of the NS3/NPH-II family also contain a helicase core composed of two RecA-like domains with the protruding β-hairpin in the RecA2 domain. In the NS3/NPHII helicase family there is only one C-terminal domain present, which is not homologous to any C-terminal domain of the DEAH/RHA helicases, and no RNA-binding tunnel is formed. Owing to the fact that numerous NS3 helicases are encoded by human pathogenic viruses, such as hepatitis C, Zika or yellow fever, these helicases have been subject of intensive studies and various crystal structures are available. The comparison with Prp43 was restricted to the NS3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, as NS3 HCV binds RNA also in a sequence-independent manner and a crystal structure with a bound ATP-analog (ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and U<sub>8</sub>-RNA is available making a direct comparison with Prp43 very feasible (PDBid: 3o8r) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Appleby et al., 2011</xref>). The comparison between Prp43 and NS3 HCV revealed that the unspecific interactions between the RNA backbone and the main-chain amides as well as the two interactions with the conserved threonines from motif Ib and V are also present in NS3 HCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In NS3 HCV, the main-chain amides of the residues Lys 371, Arg 393, Val 232 and Gly 255 interact with the nucleotides U4-U7 and Thr 269 as well as Thr 411 are involved in hydrogen bonding <italic>via</italic> their site chains with U7 and U5, respectively. Hence, this RNA-binding mode appears to be conserved for the sequence-unspecific interaction of the RecA-like domains of several members of the DEAH/RHA and NS3 families. However, there are also differences in the RNA binding between the DEAH/RHA and NS3 families, e.g. a functionally important tryptophan of NS3 members (Trp 501 in NS3 HCV), which stacks on the nucleotide at the 3’ end, is not conserved in DEAH-box helicases.</p><p>With the set of new Prp43 structures novel insights into the mechanism of RNA loading are provided. Considering the fact that the RNA-binding site of Prp43 is in its interior tunnel and the circumstance that the substrates of Prp43 are highly folded RNA networks, RNA loading to Prp43 is not trivial. The Prp43 target sites in the spliceosome and in the pre-ribosomal subunits are surrounded by complex tertiary structures without single-stranded overhangs. Here, we could demonstrate that in the ATP-bound state Prp43 is capable of adopting an open conformation in which numerous interactions between the RecA-like domains and the C-terminal domains are disrupted converting the RNA-binding tunnel into a groove and thus enabling Prp43 to bind to single-stranded RNA regions within folded RNA stretches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This rearrangement of the C-terminal domains of Prp43 with bound ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> has not been observed in any other crystal structure of a DEAH- or DExH-box helicase, which demonstrates that Prp43 exhibits a higher degree of flexibility as initially expected from the previously determined crystal structures of Prp43•ADP complexes.</p><p>Since structures of both the ATP- and ADP-bound state of Prp43 are now available, an in-depth analysis of conformational rearrangements which occur at the active site is possible. One can assume that these rearrangements almost exclusively occur after the release of the γ-phosphate owing to the fact that the helicase cores of Prp43 with the ATP-analog ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and of MLE (chain A) with the transition state analog ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> superpose very well with an r.m.s.d. value of 0.70 Å for 235 C<sub>α</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). ATP hydrolysis causes the movement of one β-turn and one loop, located at the RNA-binding site of the RecA1 and RecA2 domain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The β-turn in the RecA1 domain, the Hook-Turn, was shown to be of crucial importance for Prp43’s helicase activity, its capability to disassemble ILSs and also for its RNA-induced ATPase activity. In contrast to this, the Hook-Loop, located in the RecA2 domain, does neither affect the unwinding activity nor the ATPase activity of Prp43. Remarkably, the integrity of this Hook-Loop was known to be essential for the helicase activity of MLE and it was therefore proposed that the Hook-Loop is presumably required in all DExH- but also all DEAH-box helicases for the translocation of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prabu et al., 2015</xref>). Unexpectedly, but according to our results, the difference in the mechanism of how DEAH-box and DExH-box helicases do translocate RNA through their interior tunnel seems to be tremendous. For Prp43, exclusively the interaction between the Hook-Turn and the RNA is required for successful translocation of the RNA. The mutation of the Hook-Loop, which is essential in MLE, is effectless in Prp43. Furthermore, the Hook-Turn is not required for RNA binding but it is involved in the RNA-induced stimulation of the ATPase activity. This is supported by the finding that the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant still exhibits RNA-stimulated ATPase activity. For this mutant, RNA binding in the tunnel is unlikely but the stimulation might be caused by the binding of the single stranded RNA only to the tunnel exit as this is formed, among others, by the Hook-Turn.</p><p>To further elaborate the difference in the RNA-translocation mechanism between the DEAH- and DExH-box subfamilies the conservation of the Hook-Turn and the Hook-Loop residues in family members from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, ctPrp43 and MLE was analyzed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">(Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The RF motif the Hook-Turn is conserved in all DEAH-box helicases, while in the DExH-box helicases, this motif is only present in MLE. Between DEAH-box and DExH-box helicases, the Hook-Loop is not conserved (Yxx vs. Hxx), but conservation among the individual members is noticeable. These findings are perfectly in line with our interpretation of the activity of the Hook-Turn and Hook-Loop mutants, which clearly hint at the fact that the RNA-translocation mechanism between DEAH- and DExH-box helicases is strikingly different. The Hook-Turn is presumably the key feature of genuine DEAH-box helicases for RNA translocation through the interior binding tunnel and the Hook-Turn RF motif should be added to the list of conserved DEAH-box helicase motifs. Like for MLE, the structure of the Prp43-RNA complex does not provide any indication for a ratcheting function of the C-terminal helical-bundle domain, which supports the idea of renaming this domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>ctPrp43 and ctPrp43(61–764) (ctPrp43ΔN) were expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tauchert et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Timothy W Nilsen (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see all were generally positive about the work but also raised some concerns. In particular, it is necessary to test the RNA binding affinity of the hook loop mutants to ensure that the effect on translocation is not simply because of failure of substrate binding. Another point that must be addressed is to put your work in context with work published on DEAH proteins found in flaviviruses. In addition to these points please deal with the other concerns raised as thoroughly as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Ficner and co-workers report the crystal structure of the DEAH RNA helicase Prp43 with bound RNA and an ATP ground state analog. Compared to a previously reported structure of Prpr43 with ADP (but without RNA), the new structure reveals a significant conformational change that is interpreted as facilitating RNA loading and movement of the RNA relative to the protein. The authors further identify a hairpin loop with a characteristic motif that is conserved among DEAH helicases. While the work focuses on structural data, the main structure-inspired claims are supported by biochemical and functional studies in yeast for several mutants.</p><p>The new structure provides critical information for understanding helicases of the DEAH family, many of which participate in pre-mRNA splicing. In addition, the work highlights potentially important differences to a recently reported structure of the related MLE helicase bound to RNA. The manuscript thus makes the point that even within the DEAH/RHA family differences exist with respect to the RNA binding mode.</p><p>While the data and the overall information mark an important contribution to our understanding of RNA biology, especially pre-mRNA splicing, the presentation leaves room for improvement. The writing is verbose, and the manuscript would probably benefit from tightening of the prose. In addition, the figures do not always convey a clear point and are at times hard to follow (examples include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It might be helpful to include more schematic representations of the structural features that are highlighted, and a model at the end that emphasizes the conformational changes for the proposed RNA loading process.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have determined the structure of a DEAH-box helicase, C. thermophilus Prp43, bound to RNA and to ADP-BeF, e.g. in the ground-state of the reaction. Comparing their ground-state structure with a previous one of ADP-bound Prp43, the authors identify a new element (a hook-loop) that is important for the translocation. Although there is currently no structure for the transition-state of the reaction, the authors include biochemical studies with structure-based mutants that support their proposed mechanism (with the caveat that an important control is missing – see below).</p><p>This mechanism proposed for Prp43 is different from that proposed in a previous study reporting the structure of a DEAH/RHA helicase, MLE, bound to RNA and ADP-AlF, e.g. in the transition-state of the reaction. In general, I find interesting that two helicases that are thought to belong to the same family differ in mechanisms. Indeed, not only the translocation mechanism appears to be different, but also the unwinding mechanism and the RNA-binding specificity. Rather than playing down the previous work and boosting their own (with several inappropriate 'first' claims), the authors could elaborate positively on the different mechanisms of translocation, unwinding and specificity of the RHA-like and Prp43-like subfamilies of DEAH helicases.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>The authors claim that this is the first structure of a DEAH helicase bound to RNA, and emphasize that the structure provides the first insight into the RNA-binding mechanism of a DEAH-box helicase. However, the RNA binding tunnel of Prp43 is essentially the same as previously reported for MLE. Indeed, the RNA seems to be less well defined in the electron density in the Prp43 structure, with fewer nucleotides and alternative conformations. The claim is therefore inappropriate.</p><p>Since the 'hook-loop' has been defined before, the authors should refer to the corresponding Prp43 348-349 residues as 'hook loop 1' and to their newly identified Prp43 180-181 residues as 'hook loop 2', rather than the other way round.</p><p>The important control that is currently missing is biochemical evidence that the proposed Prp43 hook-loop binds RNA. If the hook-loop mutant would be impaired in RNA binding, the impairment in unwinding cannot be interpreted as a failure of translocation, but simply as a failure of substrate binding. The authors should measure the RNA-binding affinity of the hook loop mutant and compare it to the wild type. The hook-loop mutant previously implied for translocation in the case of MLE, for example, can bind RNA but cannot unwind.</p><p>How is the hook-loop of Prp43 connected with the nucleotide state? In particular, how does it sense the presence or absence of the γ phosphate of ATP?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, ctPrp43-IDSB+U16-RNA is missing. The same should be done for the hook loop mutants. In the case of hook loop mutant, RNA activation is clear. But why is the activity going down when RNA is added in the case of the two hook-loop mutants combined? (ctPrpr43-Hook-Loop1&amp;2+ctPfa1-GP).</p><p>The authors refer to Prp43 residues 527-640 as the ratchet domain, from the original Hel308 structure paper. From their mechanism, what is the evidence that this domain is ratcheting? If they have no evidence, they should consider a more cautious nomenclature.</p><p>The title should more accurately define the content. Since it appears that the translocation mechanisms of Prp43 and MLE are distinct, the title should be more precise: 'Structural insights into the mechanism of the DEAH-box helicase Prp43'.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this comprehensive analysis of Prp43, the authors present a series of high resolution crystal structures of the protein, in various ligand-bound forms, as it samples conformational states that may play a role in RNA recognition and the function of Prp43 in splicing and translation. The quality of the data is particularly notable, and it is in large part due to the judicious choice of a stable thermophilic variant that can substitute for S.c. Prp43 in splicing assays. In addition, to trapping with specific ligands, the authors captured different conformational states by observing the molecule in different crystal forms. Particularly clever was the use of an engineered disulfide bridge to test the structure and functional attributes of the closed form, as this provided a very nice way to freeze the molecule in single state for solution experiments.</p><p>Other positive attributes of the paper are that a dynamic RNA tunnel is clearly observed, and it involves interesting auxiliary domains that are not common to all SF2 proteins. In this way, it does provide insights into the molecular mechanism for Prp43 translocation and binding to RNA. The splicing experiments and other biochemical experiments were of very high quality and these were used effectively to establish structure-function relationships among domains and motifs of the protein.</p><p>The major criticism of this work is that the investigators appeared to be functioning &quot;in a bubble&quot;, seemingly unaware of the vast crystallographic and biochemical literature on translocation by very closely related proteins. This negatively impacts the paper in several important ways: A) The paper consistently misrepresents the novelty of the findings, seeming to imply that this is the first time translocation has been structurally characterized for a motor protein in the DEXH family, including NS3 from HCV. B) Important similarities and differences from other motors are overlooked, leading to a missed opportunity for understanding the function of individual motor components. Adding to the issue of novelty is that nucleotide-bound Prp43 has been previously structurally characterized in the absence of RNA ligand. So, this is not the first time we have visualized this particular protein. In the opinion of this reviewer, it appears to bind ssRNA in a nonspecific manner not too dissimilar from other SF2 proteins, so it is not entirely clear what we have learned. Without any comparison to related proteins (other than MLE), the authors make it difficult for the reader to ascertain the structural significance of the reported findings.</p><p>Specific criticisms:</p><p>1) The Introduction, last paragraph, subsection “Crystal structure of Prp43 with bound RNA in an active state”, second paragraph and subsection “Prp43 trapped in the closed conformation is impaired in its helicase activity”, last paragraph, and many other places in the paper say this is the &quot;first insight&quot;, &quot;first insight into a genuine DEAH..&quot; These statements, and those throughout the paper, misrepresent the significance of this work, which is certainly not the first structural insight into a member of this family, and it does not provide the first structural or mechanistic insight into translocation by the family members. Full-length HCV NS3 is in the same DEXH family and it has been the subject of two studies in which translocation was captured on polynucleotide substrates. Indeed, in Appleby (JMB, 2011), NS3 opening and closing, together with sequential translocation along polyuridine, was captured in an exhaustive series of crystal structures that provide a complete mechanistic picture of translocation by this family along RNA. Similar work was done by Gu and Rice, but using a DNA oligonucleotide bound to a truncated NS3 variant, which is less directly comparable with the present study. All of that work built upon incisive single molecule experiments that specifically monitored the translocation of NS3 (Myong, Science 2007, and subsequent work from the Bustamante lab) and showed that it follows a mechanistic paradigm originally elucidated by Hopfner for Hel308. Indeed, it has been known for about ten years that SF1 and SF2 helicases translocate by opening and closing the RecA1 and RecA2 domains as a function of ATP binding and release. There are probably 50 papers on this. While HCV NS3 is formally a DECH variant, the related and structurally-characterized Dengue and YFV NS3 proteins are DEAH – so the significance of the third amino acid is not relevant to the argument.</p><p>2) Subsection “Prp43 binds RNA in a sequence-independent fashion”, first paragraph.

The writing is verbose, and the manuscript would probably benefit from tightening of the prose. In addition, the figures do not always convey a clear point and are at times hard to follow (examples include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It might be helpful to include more schematic representations of the structural features that are highlighted, and a model at the end that emphasizes the conformational changes for the proposed RNA loading process.</italic></p><p>As suggested several parts of the manuscript were rephrased to tighten the prose. We improved all figures which now should be much clearer. Schematic representations of the Prp43-RNA interaction interface in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and of the ADP/ATP binding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> have been added. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> the differences between the ATP and ADP states are highlighted. The conformational changes between the ADP/ATP states and as well the conformational changes allowing RNA loading are best visualized by the two supplementary movies, hence no additional schematic figure for the RNA loading was included.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors have determined the structure of a DEAH-box helicase, C. thermophilus Prp43, bound to RNA and to ADP-BeF, e.g. in the ground-state of the reaction. Comparing their ground-state structure with a previous one of ADP-bound Prp43, the authors identify a new element (a hook-loop) that is important for the translocation. Although there is currently no structure for the transition-state of the reaction, the authors include biochemical studies with structure-based mutants that support their proposed mechanism (with the caveat that an important control is missing – see below).</italic></p><p><italic>This mechanism proposed for Prp43 is different from that proposed in a previous study reporting the structure of a DEAH/RHA helicase, MLE, bound to RNA and ADP-AlF, e.g. in the transition-state of the reaction. In general, I find interesting that two helicases that are thought to belong to the same family differ in mechanisms. Indeed, not only the translocation mechanism appears to be different, but also the unwinding mechanism and the RNA-binding specificity. Rather than playing down the previous work and boosting their own (with several inappropriate 'first' claims), the authors could elaborate positively on the different mechanisms of translocation, unwinding and specificity of the RHA-like and Prp43-like subfamilies of DEAH helicases.</italic></p><p>We removed all “first” claims in order to prevent any potential inappropriateness. The differences in mechanisms and substrate specificity between the related RHA-like and DEAH-box helicases were discussed in more detail.</p><p><italic>Specific points:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors claim that this is the first structure of a DEAH helicase bound to RNA, and emphasize that the structure provides the first insight into the RNA-binding mechanism of a DEAH-box helicase. However, the RNA binding tunnel of Prp43 is essentially the same as previously reported for MLE. Indeed, the RNA seems to be less well defined in the electron density in the Prp43 structure, with fewer nucleotides and alternative conformations. The claim is therefore inappropriate.</italic></p><p>According to the classification of helicases, MLE was considered to belong not to the sub-family of (spliceosomal) DEAH helicases but rather to the closely related sub-family of RHA helicases. Due to the very high structural similarity, we followed the suggestion of the reviewer and removed the statement, that our structure represents the first structure of a DEAH-box helicase with bound RNA.</p><p><italic>Since the 'hook-loop' has been defined before, the authors should refer to the corresponding Prp43 348-349 residues as 'hook loop 1' and to their newly identified Prp43 180-181 residues as 'hook loop 2', rather than the other way round.</italic></p><p>In order to prevent any confusion with regard to the previous definition of the hook loop in the MLE structure, we introduced the name hook-turn for the region 180-181, as it is actually a β-turn, rather than a loop. The term hook loop is now used for the residues 348-350, which corresponds to the hook loop of MLE.</p><p><italic>The important control that is currently missing is biochemical evidence that the proposed Prp43 hook-loop binds RNA. If the hook-loop mutant would be impaired in RNA binding, the impairment in unwinding cannot be interpreted as a failure of translocation, but simply as a failure of substrate binding. The authors should measure the RNA-binding affinity of the hook loop mutant and compare it to the wild type. The hook-loop mutant previously implied for translocation in the case of MLE, for example, can bind RNA but cannot unwind.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the lack of dsRNA unwinding of the hook-turn mutant could be caused by a loss of RNA binding capability. We therefore measured the RNA binding of ctPrp43 and the ctPrp43 hook-turn mutant by means of fluorescence anisotropy. These experiments demonstrated that the binding of RNA to the mutated Prp43 is not impaired, and therefore the loss of unwinding activity is most likely caused by a loss of RNA translocation activity.</p><p>These new results were included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>How is the hook-loop of Prp43 connected with the nucleotide state? In particular, how does it sense the presence or absence of the γ phosphate of ATP?</italic></p><p>The hook-loop (now hook-turn) is not involved in any contacts with the bound ATP molecule or in particular with the γ phosphate. Thus, there is no direct sensing of the nucleotide state by the hook-turn. The movement of the hook-turn is caused by the global rotation of the RecA1 domain. This information is now provided in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, ctPrp43-IDSB+U16-RNA is missing. The same should be done for the hook loop mutants. In the case of hook loop mutant, RNA activation is clear. But why is the activity going down when RNA is added in the case of the two hook-loop mutants combined? (ctPrpr43-Hook-Loop1&amp;2+ctPfa1-GP).</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the ATPase activity was also determined for ctPrp43-IDSB+U16-RNA as well as for all other ctPrp43 mutants and these data were added to the revised <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>Regarding the question concerning the reduced RNA-induced stimulation of the double hook-loop mutant the changes in both <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> have to be addressed. The <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value for ATP is lower in the presence of RNA, which means that the affinity of ATP is increased, hence there is still a cooperative effect of RNA and ATP binding. The <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> value of the ctPrp43-GP is lower in presence of RNA, which appears to be puzzling. It is very difficult to explain this effect by the currently known structures, due to the fact that the G-patch protein is missing in all structures. As a consequence, the structural basis for the stimulation of ATPase and helicase activities by the G-patch proteins in not understood at all. Hence, one possibility is that the stimulating effect of the G-patch is reduced in case of the double hook-loop mutant upon binding of the RNA. However, this is pure speculation as no corresponding structural or biochemical data are available, and has therefore not been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors refer to Prp43 residues 527-640 as the ratchet domain, from the original Hel308 structure paper. From their mechanism, what is the evidence that this domain is ratcheting? If they have no evidence, they should consider a more cautious nomenclature.</italic></p><p>The name ratchet domain was introduced with the first crystal structure analysis of Prp43 by Walbott et al. (2010) and He et al. (2010) and was based on the structural similarity to the DNA helicase Hel308.</p><p>We fully agree with the referee that there is no evidence for a ratcheting function of this domain in Prp43, which is consistent with the Prp43-RNA complex structure, as no side chains of this domain bind to the RNA. The structural rearrangements of the C-terminal domains leading to the opening of the RNA-binding tunnel shows that most of the conformational changes occur mainly within the degenerate winged-helix domain, while the conformation of the ratchet domain remains unchanged. Hence, we prefer to keep these as two separate domains instead of using the term HA2 (helicase associated 2) domain, in which both domains are fused. We now denote the “ratchet domain” as “ratchet-like” domain in order to maintain the structural similarity to Hel308.</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript we included a clear statement, that the “ratchet-like” domain has no ratcheting function in Prp43.</p><p><italic>The title should more accurately define the content. Since it appears that the translocation mechanisms of Prp43 and MLE are distinct, the title should be more precise: 'Structural insights into the mechanism of the DEAH-box helicase Prp43'.</italic></p><p>We changed the title to 'Structural insights into the mechanism of the DEAH-box helicase Prp43' as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] The major criticism of this work is that the investigators appeared to be functioning &quot;in a bubble&quot;, seemingly unaware of the vast crystallographic and biochemical literature on translocation by very closely related proteins.
