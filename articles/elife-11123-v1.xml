'RASopathies' and is implicated in autism pathogenesis. Here, we have determined the functions of ERK/MAPK signaling in developing neocortical excitatory neurons. Our data reveal a critical requirement for ERK/MAPK signaling in the morphological development and survival of large Ctip2<sup>+</sup> neurons in layer 5. Loss of <italic>Map2k1/2 (Mek1/2)</italic> led to deficits in corticospinal tract formation and subsequent corticospinal neuron apoptosis. ERK/MAPK hyperactivation also led to reduced corticospinal axon elongation, but was associated with enhanced arborization. ERK/MAPK signaling was dispensable for axonal outgrowth of layer 2/3 callosal neurons. However, <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> deletion led to reduced expression of Arc and enhanced intrinsic excitability in both layers 2/3 and 5, in addition to imbalanced synaptic excitation and inhibition. These data demonstrate selective requirements for ERK/MAPK signaling in layer 5 circuit development and general effects on cortical pyramidal neuron excitability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11123.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11123.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11123.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the nervous system, cells called neurons form networks that relay information in the form of electrical signals around the brain and the rest of the body. Typically, an electrical signal travels from branch-like structures at one end of the cell, through the cell body and then along a long fiber called an axon to reach junctions with another neurons.</p><p>The connections between neurons start to form as the nervous system develops in the embryo, and any errors or delays in this process can cause severe neurological disorders and intellectual disabilities. For example, genetic mutations affecting a communication system within cells known as the ERK/MAPK pathway can lead to a family of syndromes called the “RASopathies”. Abnormalities in this pathway may also contribute to certain types of autism. However, it is not clear how alterations to the ERK/MAPK pathway cause these conditions.</p><p>Xing et al. investigated whether ERK/MAPK signaling regulates the formation of connections between neurons and the activity of neurons in mouse brains. The experiments showed that the growth of axons that extend from an area of the brain called the cerebral cortex towards the spinal cord are particularly sensitive to changes in the level of signaling through the ERK/MAPK pathway. On the other hand, inhibiting the pathway has relatively little effect on the growth of axons within the cerebral cortex. Further experiments showed that many neurons in the cerebral cortex require the ERK/MAPK pathway to activate genes that alter neuronal activity and the strength of the connections between neurons.</p><p>Xing et al.’s findings suggest that defects in the connections between the cerebral cortex and different regions of the nervous system may contribute to the symptoms observed in patients with conditions linked to alterations in ERK/MAPK activity. Future studies will focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms by which ERK/MAPK pathway influences the organization and activity of neuron circuits during the development of the nervous system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11123.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11123.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>excitatory neuron</kwd><kwd>corticospinal</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99/R00-NS076661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newbern</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS031768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snider</surname><given-names>William D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS085093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philpot</surname><given-names>Benjamin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFARI#274426</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philpot</surname><given-names>Benjamin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Children's Tumor Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#2015-01-013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xing</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aberrant ERK/MAPK signaling in cortical pyramidal neurons leads to selective disruption of layer 5 circuit development and generalized changes in neuronal excitability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The canonical Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway is a key intracellular signaling cascade downstream of cell surface receptors critical for brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Samuels et al., 2009</xref>). In the developing cortex, the ERK/MAPK pathway is thought to be particularly important for neuronal responses to neurotransmitters and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) ligands, such as FGFs and neurotrophins. In the mature brain, it is well established that ERK/MAPK plays a central role in the activity-dependent plasticity of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shilyansky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas and Huganir, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, a number of human neurodevelopmental syndromes have been linked to aberrant ERK/MAPK activity. This related group of human syndromes, increasingly referred to as RASopathies, are caused by genetic mutations in core components or regulators of the ERK/MAPK signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rauen, 2013</xref>). Macrocephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, cognitive impairment, and epilepsy are frequently observed in RASopathy patients with clinical manifestations being dependent on the precise causative mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rauen, 2013</xref>). RASopathies are most often associated with hyperactive ERK/MAPK signaling (eg. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan, Costello, and Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndromes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rauen, 2013</xref>). However, mutations that lead to diminished ERK/MAPK activation have been identified in a subset of LEOPARD and CFC syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kontaridis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nowaczyk et al., 2014</xref>). Abnormal Ras/MAPK signaling has also been observed in models of other monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders including Fragile X syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chévere-Torres et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faridar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Osterweil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Recent exciting work has shown that pharmacological normalization of pathological Ras/MAPK activity is sufficient for correcting select cellular and behavioral abnormalities in Fragile X, Tuberous Sclerosis, NF1, Noonan, and Costello syndrome mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Osterweil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, our understanding of these disorders remains rudimentary as there is limited information on brain cell type-specific consequences of either loss- or gain-of-function through this pathway.</p><p>Accumulating evidence also suggests that pathological ERK/MAPK signaling contributes to certain forms of autism. Altered Ras/MAPK signaling has been identified as a common downstream mediator of divergent genetic mutations linked to autism, and <italic>MAPK3/ERK1</italic> is present in a region of 16p11.2 mutated in ~1% of cases of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichler and Zimmerman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pinto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pucilowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weiss et al., 2008</xref>). Little is known about how ERK/MAPK signaling might relate to the pathogenesis of autism. An important current research theme is that the behavioral manifestations of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may be linked to both functional hypo- and hyper-connectivity between distinct brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geschwind and Levitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Just et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Supekar et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, recent work in postmortem brains of autistic patients suggests that local patches of disorganization, in which cortical layers 4–5 are particularly affected, play an important role in disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stoner et al., 2014</xref>). In one study, co-expression network analyses of autism-linked genetic mutations suggested that layer 5 in prefrontal and sensorimotor cortex is a key site of convergence for pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Willsey et al., 2013</xref>). Whether aberrant ERK/MAPK signaling might result in cortical layer disorganization and defective long-range connectivity is unknown.</p><p>To address questions of cell type specificity and consequences for circuit formation, we have defined the effects of ERK/MAPK loss- and gain-of-function on the development of cortical pyramidal neurons. Pyramidal neuron-specific functions of ERK/MAPK signaling were assessed by deleting the upstream kinases <italic>Map2k1/Mek1</italic> and <italic>Map2k2/Mek2</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Map2k1/2</italic>) or overexpressing hyperactive <italic>Map2k1</italic>. Conditional deletion of <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> led to major disruption of layer 5 with noticeably fewer CTIP2-expressing large neurons compared to controls. Further, long range axon extension of layer 5 corticospinal projection neurons during early development was markedly impaired. Subsequent to delayed entry of axons into the cervical spinal cord, many layer 5 projection neurons in sensorimotor cortices underwent apoptosis. Gain-of-function ERK/MAPK signaling also affected layer 5 CST neurons with a resultant decrease in axon elongation and associated increase in axon branching. The morphological requirement for ERK/MAPK signaling was specific for layer 5, as layer 2/3 was not disrupted and callosal projection neurons in upper cortical layers do not exhibit overt changes in axon extension or targeting following <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> deletion. In contrast to the layer-specific functions of ERK/MAPK on axonal development, we found that ERK/MAPK was required for the expression of ARC and other plasticity-associated genes across all cortical lamina. Further, loss of ERK/MAPK signaling in pyramidal neurons disrupted excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission and altered intrinsic excitability in both layers 2/3 and 5. Our data reveal unexpectedly specific requirements for ERK/MAPK signaling in layer 5 circuit development and general effects on the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons in multiple layers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Excitatory neuron-specific modification of ERK/MAPK activity</title><p>Previous work has shown that MAPK1/3 (aka ERK1/2) is activated in embryonic cortical neurons, albeit at much lower levels than in the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faedo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pucilowska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Toyoda et al., 2010</xref>). In western blots of sensorimotor cortical lysates from P1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 day old mice, we found that the levels of pan-MAPK1/3(ERK1/2) and pan-MAP2K1/2 show a steady but evident increase from a relatively lower level at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Phosphorylated-MAPK1/3(ERK1/2) and phosphorylated-MAP2K1/2 levels were also relatively low at birth but increased noticeably by P7 and peaked at P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oliveira et al., 2008</xref>). The pattern of phosphorylated-MAPK1/3(ERK1/2) expression in P3 histological sections of cortex did not exhibit any clear-cut laminar specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These findings indicate that ERK/MAPK signaling is activated in the developing cortex, peaking during the second postnatal week.</p><p>We generated a mouse model to test the direct, neuron-autonomous role of ERK/MAPK signaling by inactivating <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> specifically in immature mouse cortical excitatory neurons. We conditionally deleted <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> with a Cre-dependent <italic>Map2k1</italic> allele, a germ-line <italic>Map2k2</italic> deletion allele, and Cre-recombinase under the control of the <italic>NeuroD6/Nex</italic> promoter (<italic>Map2k1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup>;Map2k2<sup>-/-</sup>;Neurod6-Cre</italic>,referred to hereafter as <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>). As expected, <italic>Neurod6-Cre</italic> activated reporter-gene expression in the Cre-dependent EYFP mouse line, <italic>Ai3</italic>, in excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the neocortex by mid-embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). Western blotting of neocortical lysates and immunolabeling show that <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> mice exhibit significantly reduced MAP2K1 levels by birth and reduced phosphorylation of ERK/MAPK substrates, RSK, and MSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). Complete loss of MAP2K1 protein would not be expected in whole cortical lysates due to MAP2K1 expression in inhibitory interneurons and non-neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data show that the <italic>Neurod6-Cre</italic>-mediated genetic targeting strategy is effective at inducing loss of ERK/MAPK signaling in developing cortical excitatory neurons.</p><p><italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> pups were born at normal Mendelian ratios without overt differences from littermate controls. However, a delay in overall growth could be detected by the end of the first postnatal week and lethality was invariably observed in the third to fourth postnatal week. Behaviorally, P14 <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> mice exhibited spontaneous and persistent hindlimb clasping when lifted by the tail, an indicator of neurological impairment. A qualitatively similar effect on growth, neurological function, and viability was also observed in <italic>Mapk1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup>;Mapk3<sup>-/-</sup>;Neurod6-Cre</italic> mice (data not shown), demonstrating that phenotypes are conserved following deletion of different core components of the ERK/MAPK cascade.</p><p><italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> mice exhibited an average reduction in body weight of 37.1 ± 11.3% at P14 and neocortical volume was reduced by 23.2 ± 6.4% (mean ± SEM, n=7, &lt;0.0001). A significant increase in neuron (NEUN/RBFOX3<sup>+</sup> cell) density was observed in <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> sensory cortices from 1636 ± 185 neurons/mm<sup>2</sup> to 2168 ± 231 neurons/mm<sup>2</sup> (mean ± SEM, n=5, p=0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Given the significant difference in cortical size, we extrapolated a relative estimate of neuronal number by multiplying the density measurement by the relative change in cortical volume between individual littermate control and mutant pairs. This estimate showed no significant difference in relative global neuron number between mutant and control cortices (98.0 ± 3.5%, mean ± SEM, n=5, p=0.61). We did, however, detect a significant reduction in the size of NEUN<sup>+</sup> soma in P14 <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> sensory cortices in all cortical layers with the most pronounced effect on layer 5 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, no decrease in the size of parvalbumin-expressing, GABAergic neurons in the cortex was observed (data not shown). These data show that ERK/MAPK signaling is necessary for neurological function and the somal growth of excitatory neurons, but do not provide strong support for a widespread role in regulating global excitatory neuron number.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11123.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of ERK/MAPK signaling leads to a reduction in the number of CTIP<sup>+</sup> layer 5 neurons and reduced neuronal somal size.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>).

We directly tested whether ERK/MAPK was required for the normal development of intrinsic excitability using whole-cell recordings from P14 <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> sensory cortices. We observed a significant decrease in the average membrane capacitance and the membrane time constant, tau, of mutant P14 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result is an expected outcome from the smaller somal size of neurons in <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> cortices. No significant difference in the resting membrane potential or action potential amplitude/width was observed in mutant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, layer 2/3 neurons fired significantly more action potentials in response to increasing amounts of injected current, demonstrating that loss of <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> increases layer 2/3 neuronal excitability. In mutant neurons, the action potential threshold was significantly reduced and the slope of the action potential output in response to current injection was increased by 42.6% relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, a similar increase in intrinsic hyperexcitability was noted when we recorded from the surviving, presumably callosal, layer 5 neurons in P14 <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data show that ERK/MAPK signaling normally reduces the intrinsic excitability of both cortical layer 2/3 and layer 5 neurons during early postnatal development.</p><p>We sought to further understand how ERK/MAPK signaling regulates cortical excitability by measuring excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in neurons lacking <italic>Map2k1/2</italic>. To further minimize indirect effects due to overt loss of layer 5 neurons in sensorimotor cortices, we examined basal synaptic properties in visual cortex layer 2/3 neurons from <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> mice, where neuron number is relatively intact. We tested whether loss of ERK/MAPK signaling influences synaptic transmission by recording miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs, mIPSCs) from layer 2/3 neurons in control and <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> cortices. Interestingly, visual cortex layer 2/3 neurons exhibited a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude, while mEPSC frequency was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). These findings suggest that loss of ERK/MAPK signaling increases the strength of glutamatergic synapses, likely through increases in postsynaptic AMPA receptor number or function. We next tested whether GABAergic neurotransmission was disrupted in <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> cortices. In contrast to spontaneous excitatory transmission, mutant layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons had a substantial decrease in mIPSC frequency, but not mIPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Overall, these findings demonstrate that loss of <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> significantly disrupts the ratio of excitation to inhibition through increases in glutamatergic neurotransmission and decreases in GABAergic neurotransmission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The pathogenesis of neurological deficits in neurodevelopmental syndromes associated with altered ERK/MAPK signaling is poorly understood, due to the lack of knowledge regarding cell-type specific effects of loss and gain of function through the ERK/MAPK pathway. Here, we have identified a striking dependence on levels of ERK/MAPK signaling for the development of large CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in layer 5. Both high and low levels of ERK/MAPK signaling disrupted corticospinal axon projections. Interestingly, ERK/MAPK signaling does not appear to be a key regulator of projections for all excitatory neuron subtypes as axons of callosally projecting layer 2/3 neurons extend and target normally in the absence of ERK/MAPK signaling. In contrast to the neuronal subtype-specific effects on axonal outgrowth, the expression of plasticity associated proteins and neuronal intrinsic excitability were dependent on ERK/MAPK signaling in multiple cortical layers.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Specific regulation of layer 5 CST neuron morphology</title><p>In vitro analyses have suggested that ERK/MAPK signaling acts as an important regulator of cortical neuron dendritic and axonal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dijkhuizen and Ghosh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). However, our in vivo data reveal a remarkably specific requirement for the ERK/MAPK pathway in the morphological development of layer 5 long range projection neurons. ERK/MAPK signaling is dispensable for the early phases of CST neuronal differentiation, axon growth all the way to the medulla, and even responsiveness to midline guidance cues. However, a drastic delay in corticospinal axon growth was observed in <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> mutants between P2-4 when CST axons in control mice start to invade the spinal cord. By P14 in controls, CST axons have reached the lumbar spinal cord. In P14 mutant mice, only a few corticospinal axons were present in the cervical spinal cord and no axons reached lumbar segments.</p><p>Trophic cues linked to ERK/MAPK activation, specifically, BDNF, IGF1, IGF2, GDNF, and pleiotrophin, have been shown to regulate developing corticospinal neuron growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dugas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giehl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Özdinler and Macklis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). IGF1 has been described as a particularly potent growth factor for CST development both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Özdinler and Macklis, 2006</xref>). IGF1 protein levels are higher in the spinal cord than the brain in the early postnatal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rotwein et al., 1988</xref>) and we identified a focal pattern of IGF1 protein expression in the ventral medulla near the location where developing corticospinal axons enter the cervical spinal cord. However, we quite surprisingly found that deletion of <italic>Igf1r</italic> in long-range projection neurons did not lead to the predicted failure of CST development. Our results suggest that CST axon growth in the spinal cord may be orchestrated by multiple growth factors or via non-neuronal actions of IGF1. For example, vascular endothelial cells also express IGF1R and endothelial cell-derived trophic cues are potent regulators of corticospinal neuron survival and outgrowth in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dugas et al., 2008</xref>). Overall our data support the view that multiple cues converge upon ERK/MAPK to regulate transcriptional and cell biological processes required for extension of long axons.</p><p>Following the delayed entry of axons into the spinal cord in <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> mutants, we detected layer 5 neurons undergoing apoptosis in a restricted time frame during the first postnatal week. Counts revealed loss of roughly half of the CTIP2-expressing layer 5 neurons, which reflects a substantial proportion of the CST population. The reduced number of CST neurons in ERK/MAPK mutants is reminiscent of the loss of CST neurons after lesions to developing corticospinal projections in the neonatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Merline and Kalil, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tolbert and Der, 1987</xref>). Loss of trophic support from the spinal cord could plausibly account for these findings; an effect that might be exacerbated by known consequences of ERK/MAPK disruption on retrograde transport of growth factor signaling components including signaling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>). We cannot completely exclude that the reduced number of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in layer 5 results, in part, from conversion into an alternative neuronal type. For example, loss of <italic>Fezf2</italic> results in conversion of corticospinal neurons into a callosal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>). Our assessment of SATB2<sup>+</sup>/CTIP2<sup>-</sup> layer 5 neurons did not reveal a coincident increase in the number of presumed callosally fated layer 5 neurons in <italic>Map2k1/2;Neurod6-Cre</italic> mice. Interestingly we did not find similar layer 5 apoptosis occurring in conditional <italic>Igf1r</italic> mutants, placing our results at odds with a recent study suggesting that microglia-derived IGF1 is required for the survival of layer 5 long range projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). Whatever the mechanism, our data show that layer 5 corticospinal neurons are remarkably vulnerable to loss of ERK/MAPK signaling during the neonatal period and our results may be relevant to motor system dysfunction in RASopathy patients and layer 5 disorganization observed in ASDs.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, rostrocaudal corticospinal axon extension was also highly diminished in the setting of enhanced ERK/MAPK signaling. At every stage examined from P3 onward, the number of CST axons in the dorsal funiculus in response to gain of ERK/MAPK signaling was reduced. A distinct feature of axon growth in gain of function mutants was enhanced axonal branching in the hindbrain. Normally, over the first two postnatal weeks, ERK/MAPK activation is upregulated, coincident with increased BDNF/TrkB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maisonpierre et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Timmusk et al., 1994</xref>). BDNF/TrkB signaling has been shown to promote corticospinal axon branching in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Özdinler and Macklis, 2006</xref>). We suggest that hyperactivation of ERK/MAPK triggers mechanisms normally associated with BDNF induced corticospinal branching, possibly resulting in premature closure of the period of rostrocaudal axon elongation. Reduced axon extension of layer 5 projection neurons in the setting ERK/MAPK hyperactivation would likely have major implications for cortical circuit development in the human brain where distances are vastly longer than in rodents.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Global regulation of neuronal excitability</title><p>In addition to effects on axonal connectivity, dysregulated ERK/MAPK signaling is likely to disrupt glutamatergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Cristo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas and Huganir, 2004</xref>).

Unexpectedly, hyper-activation of ERK/MAPK signaling with the <italic>ca-Map2k1<sup>S217/221Q</sup></italic> mutant had little effect on the expression of these same plasticity associated genes. These findings are in line with a past study of hippocampal gene expression in a different ca-MAP2K1 mouse mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nateri et al., 2007</xref>). The severity of effects on expression of plasticity associated genes is likely correlated with the magnitude of ERK/MAPK hypo- or hyper-activity in response to specific mutations.</p><p>Since ERK/MAPK dependent changes in plasticity associated gene expression were widespread, we asked whether ERK/MAPK has general or layer-specific effects on developing projection neuron excitability and synaptic transmission. Our work demonstrates that complete loss of ERK/MAPK signaling leads to increased intrinsic excitability of both layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Further, we show that <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> deleted layer 2/3 neurons exhibited increased excitatory synaptic strength. We conclude that ERK/MAPK signaling contributes to excitatory/inhibitory balance during the early postnatal period by reducing the excitability of cortical excitatory neurons. Changes in excitatory drive in a subset of layer 2/3 neurons have been shown to trigger a compensatory homeostatic increase in inhibitory drive, thus maintaining a stable synaptic excitatory/inhibitory ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons lacking <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> exhibit reduced inhibitory synaptic input in the absence of a fully compensatory change in excitation. Loss of ERK/MAPK activity in cortical pyramidal neurons may disrupt the homeostatic balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition, a mechanism hypothesized to form the neurological basis of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>). ERK/MAPK may also regulate the release of BDNF from excitatory neurons, a well-known regulator of inhibitory synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Porcher et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>During postnatal cortical pyramidal neuron development, input resistance decreases and the frequency of GABAergic and amplitude of glutamatergic spontaneous neurotransmission increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morales et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings are consistent with pyramidal neurons lacking <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> failing to undergo these developmental alterations and further suggest that loss of ERK/MAPK signaling may arrest normal physiological development. Importantly, the alterations in action potential threshold in neurons lacking <italic>Map2k1/2</italic> may secondarily result from increased sodium channel density due to the smaller neuronal size or the observed increase in membrane resistance, which may also influence quantal amplitude measurements. Our observations that disruption of ERK/MAPK signaling alters excitatory/inhibitory balance and the expression of select plasticity associated genes, coupled with known effects on Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas and Huganir, 2004</xref>), suggest that alterations in ERK/MAPK signaling are likely to dramatically disrupt network activity and cortical re-wiring.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Circuit abnormalities in RASopathies</title><p>Hypotonia, muscle weakness, and delay in motor milestones are often observed in RASopathy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dileone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mejias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oberman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tidyman et al., 2011</xref>). Although some of these symptoms may be due to alterations in muscle development, we have shown here that upper motor neuron and corticospinal tract development are especially sensitive to both gain and loss of ERK/MAPK activity. Thus, deficits in motor function or motor learning in Ras/MAPK Syndromes may be explained, in part, by altered corticospinal connectivity. Importantly, our data point to distinct effects in gain vs loss of function mutants. Our results therefore argue for a mutation-specific approach to correct neurological dysfunction within the RASopathy spectrum.

For viral labeling, the AAV5-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato vector was prepared by the UNC Viral Vector Core and diluted in sterile PBS, 5% sorbitol, and 0.1% Fast Green to allow for visualization prior to injection. For DiI tracing, a 10% DiI solution (Life Technologies) was prepared in DMSO and injected into the primary motor cortex or the cervical spinal cord.

In brief, E14.5 timed-pregnant females were anesthetized with isoflurane and the uterine horn was accessed through a cesarean section procedure. The lateral ventricles of the embryos were injected with 1–2 µg of plasmid prepared using an EndoFree plasmid purification kit (Qiagen) diluted in 1 x PBS with 0.1% Fast Green dye for visualization. Five electrical pulses were delivered at 30V (50 ms duration) with a 950 ms interval using 5 mm paddle electrodes. The uterine horns were then gently reinserted into the abdominal cavity and the abdomen wall and skin was sutured. Electroporated mice were sacrificed at the appropriate time point and processed for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Mice of the appropriate age were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. For cryoprotection, subdissected samples were incubated in a graded series of 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose/PBS at 4°C before embedding in O.C.T. compound and freezing. Cryostat sections were collected on Fisherbrand Superfrost/Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and air-dried prior to staining.

Secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 488, 546 or 568, and 647 conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, anti-rat, or anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). For some experiments slides were then incubated in Hoechst or DAPI for nuclear labeling, rinsed, and mounted. Images were collected with a Zeiss LSM 710, 780, or Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image analysis and quantitation</title><p>Confocal images of regions of interest were collected from individual brain sections for each animal. For assessment of relative neocortical volume, cortical area was measured in five anatomically matched coronal sections along the rosto-caudal axis, averaged, and normalized against the control brain. For assessment of CTIP2, CUX1, SATB2, and NEUN expressing cells, regions of primary sensory, motor, and visual cortex from at least three anatomically matched sections of mutant and control cortices were defined using morphological and anatomical features. Radial columns were outlined within the cortical region of interest and measured. The total sampled area from a specific region of cortex of a single brain ranged from 1–3 mm<sup>2</sup>. Individual layer boundaries were determined by the changes in density and appearance of NEUN labeling. Images were then transferred into ImageJ, a pixel intensity threshold was set manually by an observer blind to the genotype, and watershed segmentation was performed. The binary image mask was then analyzed using the particle analysis tool to count the number of events with a min-max size cutoff of 50–600 µm<sup>2</sup> for NEUN labeling and 30–300 µm<sup>2</sup> for CTIP2<sup>+</sup>, CUX1<sup>+</sup>, or SATB2<sup>+</sup> labeled nuclei. For NEUN density determination, the total number of NEUN<sup>+</sup> cells within a radial column was divided by the area of the column and averaged across at least three separate columns within the cortical region of interest. For determination of the relative proportion of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> or SATB2<sup>+</sup> cells in layer 5 or CUX1<sup>+</sup> cells in layers 2–4, the number of each labeled cell within specific laminar boundaries was divided by the total NEUN count within the entire radial column to determine the proportion of each neuronal subtype per radial column. Results from this analysis were averaged across three individual radial columns per cortical region and normalized against the littermate control analyzed in parallel for each mutant. These images were also utilized for determination of the cross sectional area of neuronal soma. Randomly selected, well-labeled NEUN expressing neurons that included a DAPI labeled nucleus were outlined manually in Photoshop and measured.</p><p>For analysis of axonal innervation, a modification of the cell counting procedure described above was utilized where images of the region of axonal innervation from at least three anatomically matched sections were collected, manually thresholded in ImageJ, and the number of labeled pixels was measured. For measurement of <italic>ca-Map2k1;Emx1-Cre</italic> spinal cords background signal was determined by measuring a non-innervated area in the same section and subtracted from the mean intensity of an anatomical region of interest.</p><p>Representative images have been cropped and adjusted for brightness and contrast in Photoshop for presentation. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Sensorimotor cortices were dissected from both mutant and litter mate control mice and lysed inRIPA buffer (0.05M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5M NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% NP-40, and 1 mM EDTA, Millipore) supplemented with 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail II and III (Sigma). Lysates werecleared by centrifugation and protein concentration was determinedusing the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Equal amounts of protein were denatured in reducing sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE gels,and blotted to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 hr at roomtemperature, then incubated overnight at 4°C with primaryantibodies.

RNA was assayed for quality and quantity with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Total RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized on Affymetrix arrays in the UNC Functional Genomics Core. Slides were processed and scanned according to the manufacturer protocol. Data was further processed using the RMA algorithm for background adjustment, quantile normalization, and median polish probeset summarization. P14 and P21 cortical samples were log<sub>2</sub> transformed and differential expression and p-values were calculated using a mixed-model ANOVA in Partek Genomics Suite. Transcripts demonstrating an average change in expression that is &gt;1.5 fold (up-regulated) or &lt; –1.5 fold (down-regulated) and a p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered differentially expressed.

During this period and before transferring sections to the recording chamber, slices were maintained in ACSF supplemented with 1.25 mM ascorbic acid. Recordings were made in a submersion chamber at 32°C +/- 1°C in ACSF, except where noted.</p><p>Patch pipettes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass with open tip resistances of 2–7 MΩ. Neurons were recorded in either voltage- or current-clamp configuration with a patch clamp amplifier (Multiclamp 700A), and data were acquired and analyzed using pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices). L2/3 or L5 neurons were visually identified with infrared differential interference contrast optics. All recordings were performed from excitatory neurons as verified by the presence of dendritic spines and/or an apical dendrite oriented towards the pial surface. To minimize variability, recordings were performed from a mutant and control littermate with identical, same day conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Voltage-clamp recordings</title><p>Voltage-clamp recordings were performed from visual cortical layer 2/3 neurons, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larsen et al., 2011</xref>). Events with a rapid rise time and exponential decay were identified as mEPSCs or mIPSCS using an automatic detection template in pCLAMP 10. To isolate mEPSCs, slices were placed in a submersion chamber, maintained at 32°C and perfused at 2 mL/min with oxygenated ACSF containing 200 nM tetrodotoxin and 50 μM picrotoxin. Pipettes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 100 K-Gluconate, 20 KCl, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 10 HEPES, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, and 0.5% (w/v) neurobiotin with pH adjusted to 7.25 with 1M KOH and osmolarity adjusted to ~300 mOsm by addition of sucrose. To isolate mIPSCs, ACSF included 20 μM 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), 100 μM D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D,L-AP5), and 200 nM tetrodotoxin. Pipettes were filled with a high internal chloride concentration to increase the chloride driving force at -70 mV and contained (in mM): 134 KCl, 2 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 10 sucrose, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 14 Naphosphocreatine, 0.5% (w/v) neurobiotin, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH and osmolarity adjusted to ~300 mOsm by addition of sucrose. All voltage-clamp recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and Bessel filtered at 2 kHz. Series and input resistances were monitored throughout the experiments by measuring the response to a −5 mV step during each sweep. Series resistance was calculated using the capacitive transient at the onset of the step and input resistance was calculated from the steady-state current during the step. No series resistance compensation was applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Current-clamp recordings</title><p>Intrinsic excitability recordings were performed in L2/3 and L5 somatosensory cortex with AMPA/Kainate, NMDA, and GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission blocked by adding 20 μM DNQX, 100 μM D,L-AP5, and 50 μM picrotoxin to the ACSF. Throughout the experiment, current was injected to maintain a −70 mV resting potential. Action potential threshold was defined as the voltage at which dv/dt=20 V/s. Adaptation ratio was measured as the ratio of the third interspike interval to the last interspike interval at currents which evoked 6–7 action potentials to minimize confounds in adaptation ratio due to differences in action potential number between genotypes. Action potential amplitude was measured relative to the membrane potential prior to current injection (-70 mV). Action potential slope was analyzed by comparing threshold currents for generating action potentials to responses at two times the threshold current, which was divided by the difference in current levels. Input resistance was calculated by measuring the steady-state response to a 50 pA, 300 ms step at each current injection and was averaged across all current injections. Resting membrane potential was measured at the onset of the recording. Current clamp recordings were sampled at 20 kHz and Bessel filtered at 10 kHz. Membrane capacitance and time constant values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) were calculated in voltage-clamp at the onset of the recording. Capacitance values were measured from the averaged integrated transient capacitive current produced during a 10 mV step sampled at 100 kHz in membrane test mode. Membrane time constant values were measured from the transient portion of the current response to the voltage step and were fit by a single exponential.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to E.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigate the role of altered RAS/MAPK signaling in neurons of the postnatal mouse cortex. The authors use genetics to study the effects of loss and gain of function of this signaling pathway in pyramidal neurons and find that both manipulations impair normal formation of the corticospinal tract. In addition, loss of function manipulations has more subtle physiological effects on other classes of pyramidal neurons. Because this signaling pathway has previously been implicated in developmental brain disorders in humans, the present results are interesting for understanding how some of the features of these disorders arise.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers were concerned about the interpretation of the apparent loss of CTIP<sup>+</sup> corticospinal neurons. Although there is some evidence for cell death, the number of activated caspase positive neurons is small and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that some neurons have converted from a CTIP<sup>+</sup>, corticospinal fate to callosally projecting fate. Although reduced <italic>Fezf2</italic> expression is interpreted as reflecting a loss of these neurons, it could also have been down regulated which may cause neurons to switch their fate. Although it would be preferable to gain mechanistic insight into this question by performing additional experiments, the reviewers agreed that this could probably be addressed through textual changes.</p><p>As each reviewer raised some additional points which you may or may not choose to address, I have included the full reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors use mouse genetics to study the effects of loss and gain of function of ERK/MAPK kinase signaling in the neocortex and find that both manipulations impair normal formation of the corticospinal tract. In addition, loss of function manipulations has more subtle physiological effects on other classes of pyramidal neurons. Because this signaling pathway has previously been implicated in developmental brain disorders in humans, the present results are interesting for understanding how some of the features of these disorders arise.</p><p>My major concern about the paper in its present state is with respect to the interpretation of the results. The authors find that the cortex is reduced in volume but not in cell number. They then find that CTIP<sup>+</sup> neurons (that normally form the pyramidal tract) are greatly reduced in motor and somatosensory cortex, but are relatively unaffected in visual cortex (where this same class of neurons does not normally persist in projecting to the spinal cord). The interpretation is that there has been a selective loss the CTIP<sup>+</sup> neurons. In support of this there is an increase in activation of caspase 3, however the number of neurons with activated caspase 3 is small and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that some neurons have converted from a CTIP<sup>+</sup>, corticospinal fate to callosally projecting fate. I do not think that this is less interesting, or that the authors need to do additional experiments to sort out the relative contributions of cell death and change in cell fate. But they should acknowledge this likely possibility. One additional reason for thinking this likely is that it appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that the vast majority of the YFP16 neurons are thick-tufted L5 neurons (i.e. the large corticofugal neurons with a tuft in layer 1) whereas in the mutant these neurons take on the morphology (and presumably axonal projections and physiology) of the other major L5 population, the callosal neurons. This transformation occurs in knockout of the transcription factor Fezf2, which is upstream of CTIP2 expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript titled, &quot;Layer-specific and general requirements for ERK/MAPK signaling in the developing neocortex,&quot; Xing et al. investigate the role of altered RAS/MAPK signaling in neurons of the postnatal mouse cortex. This signaling pathway is altered in many neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively termed RASopathies, yet it remains unclear how increased and/or decreased activation of this pathway alters neuronal function. Through understanding this relationship, insights are made into the mechanisms underlying these neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, the questions addressed in this manuscript are of high importance, and may have broad interest in the general biomedical sciences.</p><p>The senior authors have an extensive track record studying the effect of altered ERK signaling using loss and gain of function genetics. In this article, the authors focus on post-mitotic postnatal cortical neurons by conditionally removing Mek1 in a Mek2 null background utilizing previously described Nex-cre mice, which do not express cre in glial cells, proliferating progenitors, nor inhibitory neurons (Goebbels et al., 2006) as well as using the EMX1-cre line which is more broadly expressed in multiple cell types of the forebrain, while excluding inhibitory neurons (Gorski et al., 2002).</p><p>The novel findings in this paper include the observation that loss of ERK/MAPK signaling in immature neurons leads to a decreased number of layer 5/CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in motor- and sensory-, but not visual-cortex. They further show a selective loss of layer 5 cortico-spinal tract deep projection neurons, preceded by apoptosis activation. In addition, they show that IGF1 and IGF1R are not significant participants in this phenotype. Surprisingly, they observe that gain of ERK/MAPK signaling also leads to projection neuron reductions, as well as increased arborization.</p><p>The authors also examined layer 2/3 neurons. Loss of MEK1/2 also decreased their soma size, as well as decreased dendrite length. Additional novel observations include a decrease in plasticity-associated genes, reduced AP threshold in 2/3 neurons, increased mEPSC amplitude and decreased mIPSC frequency.</p><p>The scientific methods, number of replicates, statistically analyses, and overall writing of this manuscript are of high quality. One main weakness in this paper is that all the observed phenotypes can be attributed to poor cell survival, and not other more specific mechanisms such as a decrease in plasticity genes. Also, the direct link between MEK and survival is not addressed. The following issues should be addressed before publication to clarify this manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors show that pERK is upregulated in cortex via Western blot. Is pERK selectively increased in layer 5 neurons in control postnatal mice, and as such, is that why this cell type is dramatically affected by the mutation? This should be examined with immunohistochemistry.</p><p>2) It is interesting that the layer 5 neurons in the visual cortex are not affected. Is the phenotype activity dependent? This makes sense since visual experience occurs after somatosensory experience. The manuscript would be less descriptive and improved by investigating this issue. One possibility would be to compare layer 5 in the barrel cortex from mice with and without whiskers removed.</p><p>3) Is cell death also occurring in 2/3? This should be analyzed with caspase-3 activation assay and added to the manuscript.</p><p>4) The reduction in AP threshold and increased mEPSC amplitude could arise due to smaller soma size, via increased sodium channel density and/or increased input resistance. Please mention this in the Discussion.</p><p>5) Explore why mIPSC frequency (in Visual Cortex Layer 2/3) is decreased despite the lack of cre expression in inhibitory neurons. Is this due to the deficiency of ERK/MAPK signaling postsynaptically causing decreased GABAergic synapse number?

Moreover, this study contradicts earlier findings by Ozdinler and Macklis, 2006, where they show that IGF1/IGFR1 drives CST formation in vitro and in vivo. In my opinion, the authors failed to take the full advantage of their microarray dataset to address this particular issue. First, their microarray data shows that <italic>Bcl11b/Ctip2</italic> expression is maybe slightly decreased, which is consistent with their other data. On the other hand, the expression levels of <italic>Fezf2</italic> (also known as <italic>Fezl</italic> or <italic>Zfp312</italic>) (PMID: 16157277; PMID: 16314561; PMID: 16284245) and <italic>Sox5</italic> (PMID: 18840685; PMID: 18215621), which were previously shown to be necessary for the specification of layer 5 projection neurons and the formation of CST, are dramatically reduced. Also, inactivation of Fezf2 leads to reduced soma size and dendritic arborization of layer 5 subcerebral (corticospinal) neurons (PMID: 16314561).Thus, it is possible that the two transcription factors are involved in mediating the effects of the ERK/MAPK pathway in layer 5 corticospinal neurons. Moreover, the authors speculate in paragraph one, subheading “ERK/MAPK signaling is necessary for corticospinal axon extension”, that the effects are postmitotic as &quot;Nex:Cre is not expressed until neurons are post-mitotic&quot;. Actually the SOX5 is expressed only postmitotically/postmigratory in layer 5 projection neurons according to PMID: 18840685, further reinforcing this possibility. Thus, the link to <italic>Fezf2</italic> and <italic>Sox5</italic> should be explored further as a possible mechanism. One possible experiment would be to overexpress or reduce <italic>Fezf2</italic> or <italic>Sox5</italic> in layer 5 neuron of <italic>Mek1/2cKO</italic> or <italic>caMEK1</italic>, respectively.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11123.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary: The authors investigate the role of altered RAS/MAPK signaling in neurons of the postnatal mouse cortex. The authors use genetics to study the effects of loss and gain of function of this signaling pathway in pyramidal neurons and find that both manipulations impair normal formation of the corticospinal tract.

All of the reviewers were concerned about the possible conversion of corticospinal neurons to an alternative fate in the <italic>Map2k1/2(Mek1/2)</italic> deleted cortices. In the revised version of the manuscript, we now provide additional analyses and textual revisions to address this point as outlined below under Essential revisions. Moreover, we have provided detailed responses to all of the reviewer’s individual concerns, and in some cases added additional data.</p><p>In the course of revising the manuscript we discovered a minor error in the presentation of the gene expression profiling data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> of the original manuscript. These data were originally described as P14 when they are actually from P9 cortices. Our P14 data set was inadvertently omitted, as were p-values. In the revised manuscript, we now include results from both the P9 and the P14 gene expression profiling together with p-values in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. The raw microarray data has been submitted to the GEO database and the accession number (GSE75129) has been added to the revised manuscript. Both the P9 and P14 results indicate that numerous genes known to be expressed in layer 5 are down-regulated in <italic>Map2k1/2(Mek1/2)</italic> deleted cortices.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) All three reviewers were concerned about the interpretation of the apparent loss of CTIP<sup>+</sup> corticospinal neurons. Although there is some evidence for cell death, the number of activated caspase positive neurons is small and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that some neurons have converted from a CTIP<sup>+</sup>, corticospinal fate to callosally projecting fate. Although reduced Fezf2 expression is interpreted as reflecting a loss of these neurons, it could also have been down regulated which may cause neurons to switch their fate. Although it would be preferable to gain mechanistic insight into this question by performing additional experiments, the reviewers agreed that this could probably be addressed through textual changes.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the insightful comments regarding this important mechanistic question. In the revised manuscript we have provided additional analyses to examine the possibility of conversion of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons to a callosal phenotype. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> of the revised manuscript, we report the proportion of layer 5 neurons that express SATB2, a putative marker of callosal projection neurons. We did not detect an increase in SATB2<sup>+</sup> neurons as might be expected if CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in layer 5 switched toward a callosal fate (paragraph two, subheading “Caspase-3 activation in Layer 5 neurons after ERK/MAPK deletion”). In fact the proportion was decreased in motor cortex. These results suggest that cell fate conversion did not occur on a large scale, however, this outcome does not definitively rule out the possibility. Therefore, we have now revised statements regarding the precise mechanism underlying the reduction in CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons (paragraph two, subheading “Failure of CST development and absence of large tufted neurons in layer 5” and paragraph two, subheading “Caspase-3 activation in Layer 5 neurons after ERK/MAPK deletion”), and we note altered expression of master transcription factors potentially involved in conversion, such as <italic>Fezf2</italic> (subheading “Gene expression profiling of ERK/MAPK inactivated cortices”). Further, we provide new references and new discussion of the possibility of altered fate specification (paragraph three, subheading “Specific regulation of layer 5 CST neuron morphology”).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The authors use mouse genetics to study the effects of loss and gain of function of ERK/MAPK kinase signaling in the neocortex and find that both manipulations impair normal formation of the corticospinal tract.

The authors find that the cortex is reduced in volume but not in cell number. They then find that CTIP<sup>+</sup> neurons (that normally form the pyramidal tract) are greatly reduced in motor and somatosensory cortex, but are relatively unaffected in visual cortex (where this same class of neurons does not normally persist in projecting to the spinal cord). The interpretation is that there has been a selective loss the CTIP<sup>+</sup> neurons. In support of this there is an increase in activation of caspase 3, however the number of neurons with activated caspase 3 is small and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that some neurons have converted from a CTIP<sup>+</sup>, corticospinal fate to callosally projecting fate. I do not think that this is less interesting, or that the authors need to do additional experiments to sort out the relative contributions of cell death and change in cell fate. But they should acknowledge this likely possibility.
