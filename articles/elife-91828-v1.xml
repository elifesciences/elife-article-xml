disorders include defects of functional maturation of the bladder. Current treatments do not target the primary pathobiology of these diseases. Some have a monogenic basis, such as urofacial, or Ochoa, syndrome (UFS). Here, the bladder does not empty fully because of incomplete relaxation of its outflow tract, and subsequent urosepsis can cause kidney failure. UFS is associated with biallelic variants of <italic>HPSE2</italic>, encoding heparanase-2. This protein is detected in pelvic ganglia, autonomic relay stations that innervate the bladder and control voiding. Bladder outflow tracts of <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant mice display impaired neurogenic relaxation. We hypothesized that <italic>HPSE2</italic> gene transfer soon after birth would ameliorate this defect and explored an adeno-associated viral (<italic>AAV</italic>) vector-based approach. AAV9<italic>/HPSE2,</italic> carrying human <italic>HPSE2</italic> driven by <italic>CAG</italic>, was administered intravenously into neonatal mice. In the third postnatal week, transgene transduction and expression were sought, and ex vivo myography was undertaken to measure bladder function. In mice administered AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic>, the viral genome was detected in pelvic ganglia. Human <italic>HPSE2</italic> was expressed and heparanase-2 became detectable in pelvic ganglia of treated mutant mice. On autopsy, wild-type mice had empty bladders, whereas bladders were uniformly distended in mutant mice, a defect ameliorated by AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> treatment. Therapeutically, AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> significantly ameliorated impaired neurogenic relaxation of <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant bladder outflow tracts. Impaired neurogenic contractility of mutant detrusor smooth muscle was also significantly improved. These results constitute first steps towards curing UFS, a clinically devastating genetic disease featuring a bladder autonomic neuropathy.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rare early-onset lower urinary tract (REOLUT) disorders comprise not only gross anatomical malformations but also primary defects of functional maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woolf et al., 2019</xref>). Although individually infrequent, these diseases are together a common cause of kidney failure in children and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harambat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woolf, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pepper and Trompeter, 2022</xref>). REOLUT disorders can also have negative impacts on the self-esteem, education, and socialization of affected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pepper and Trompeter, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hankinson et al., 2014</xref>). They have diverse phenotypes, including ureter malformations, such as megaureter; bladder malformations, such as exstrophy; and bladder outflow obstruction caused either by anatomical obstruction, as in urethral valves, or functional impairment of voiding without anatomical obstruction. The latter scenario occurs in urofacial, or Ochoa, syndrome (UFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Newman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>During healthy urinary voiding, the bladder outflow tract, comprising smooth muscle around the section of the urethra nearest the bladder, dilates while detrusor smooth muscle in the bladder body contracts. Conversely, in UFS, voiding is incomplete because of dyssynergia in which the outflow tract fails to fully dilate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa, 2004</xref>), and subsequent accumulation of urine in the LUT predisposes to urosepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osorio et al., 2021</xref>). UFS is an autosomal-recessive disease, and around half of families studied genetically carry biallelic variants in <italic>HPSE2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>). Most are frameshift or stop variants, most likely null alleles, although missense changes, triplication, and deletions have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaman et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>HPSE2</italic> codes for heparanase-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenzie et al., 2000</xref>), also known as Hpa2, which inhibits endoglycosidase activity of the classic heparanase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levy-Adam et al., 2010</xref>). Although subject to secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levy-Adam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaman et al., 2022</xref>), heparanase-2 has also been detected in the perinuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margulis et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting yet-to-be defined functions there. The biology of heparanase-2 has been most studied in relation to oncology. For example, in head and neck cancers, heparanase-2 has anti-tumour effects, enhancing epithelial characteristics and attenuating metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gross-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The autonomic nervous system controls voiding of the healthy bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keast et al., 2015</xref>). In fetal humans and mice, heparanase-2 is immunodetected in bladder nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>). The protein is also present in pelvic ganglia near the bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>). These ganglia contain neural cell bodies that send autonomic effector axons into the bladder body and its outflow tract, with this neural network maturing after birth in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keast et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>). Mice carrying biallelic gene-trap mutations of <italic>Hpse2</italic> have bladders that fail to fully void despite the absence of anatomical obstruction within the urethral lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Although <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant mice do have pelvic ganglia, autonomic nerves implicated in voiding are abnormally patterned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>). Ex vivo physiology experiments with <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant juvenile mice demonstrate impaired neurogenic bladder outflow tract relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manak et al., 2020</xref>), an observation broadly consistent with the functional bladder outflow obstruction reported in people with UFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa, 2004</xref>). Therefore, while not excluding additional aberrations, such as a central nervous system defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa, 2004</xref>), much evidence points to UFS featuring a genetic autonomic neuropathy affecting the bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roberts and Woolf, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recently, gene therapy has been used to treat animal models and human patients with previously incurable genetic diseases. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) has been used as a vector in successful gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, an early-onset genetic neural disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mendell et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that human <italic>HPSE2</italic> gene therapy would restore autonomic nerve function in the bladder. Given that UFS is a neural disease, we elected to use <italic>AAV</italic>2/9 (simplified to AAV9) vector, which transduces diverse neural tissues in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Foust et al., 2009</xref>), although uptake into the pelvic ganglia has not been reported. We administered AAV9 vector carrying human <italic>HPSE2</italic> to neonatal mice via the temporal vein, in the first day after birth when bladder neural circuitry is maturing. Several weeks later, evidence of transgene transduction and expression was sought and therapeutic effects on neuropathic dysfunction were investigated in smooth muscle relaxation of the bladder outflow tract and smooth muscle contractility of the bladder body.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Administration of AAV9/<italic>HPSE2</italic> to WT mice</title><p>We undertook exploratory experiments in WT mice, primarily to determine whether the viral vector was capable of transducing pelvic ganglia after neonatal intravenous injection. We also wished to determine whether administration of AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> was compatible with normal postnatal growth and general health. Given that human gene therapy with AAV9 vectors has been associated with a specific side effect, liver damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mendell et al., 2017</xref>), and the recent implication of AAV2 in community-acquired hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2023</xref>), we also examined mouse livers at the end of the experiment. To determine the efficacy of transduction, neonatal WT mice were administered the AAV9/<italic>HPSE2</italic> vector, and they were followed until they were young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Previous studies administering AAV9 carrying reporter genes to neonatal mice have used single doses of up to 10<sup>12</sup> genome copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Foust et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckinx et al., 2016</xref>). In the current experiments, because the AAV9/<italic>HPSE2</italic> vector was yet to be tested in vivo, we took a cautious approach, assessing single doses of 2 × 10<sup>10</sup> or 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> genome copies. WT neonatal mice administered either dose gained body weight in a similar manner to WT mice injected with vehicle only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Moreover, throughout the 5-week observation period, AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> administered mice displayed normal general appearances and behaviour (e.g. condition of skin and fur, ambulation, grooming, and feeding). As outlined in the ‘Introduction’, evidence points to UFS being an autonomic neuropathy of the bladder. Therefore, we determined whether the AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> vector had targeted pelvic ganglia that flank the base of the mouse bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keast et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Administration of AAV9/<italic>HPSE2</italic> to neonatal WT mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Graphic of study design.

Interventions for UFS are limited and include catheterization to empty the bladder, drugs to modify smooth muscle contractility, and antibiotics for urosepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osorio et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, surgery to refashion the LUT in UFS is either ineffective or even worsens symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa, 2004</xref>). Given that some REOLUT disorders have defined monogenic causes, it has been reasoned that gene therapy might be a future option, but the strategy must first be tested on genetic mouse models that mimic aspects of the human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lopes et al., 2021</xref>). The results presented in the current study constitute first steps towards curing UFS, a clinically devastating genetic disease featuring a bladder autonomic neuropathy.</p><p>We report several novel observations. First, female <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant mice have neurogenic defects in outflow tract relaxation and detrusor contraction that are similar to those reported for male <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manak et al., 2020</xref>). This sex equivalence in the mouse model is an important point because UFS affects both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, we observed nuanced differences between the mouse sexes. For example, regarding bladder bodies, females displayed a more profound defect in contractions elicited by EFS, while they lacked the hyper-sensitivity to carbachol shown by males. Second, we have demonstrated that an AAV can be used to transduce pelvic ganglia that are key autonomic neuronal structures in the pathobiology of UFS. Importantly, the neuromuscular circuitry of the bladder matures over the first three postnatal weeks in murine species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keast et al., 2015</xref>). A single dose of 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> genome copies of AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> was sufficient to transduce around half of neural cell bodies in these ganglia when assessed in the third postnatal week. It is possible that the administration of a higher dose of the vector would have resulted in a higher percent of positive cell bodies. Strikingly, heparanase-2 became detectable in the pelvic ganglia of treated Mut mice. Our third key observation is that the 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> dose significantly ameliorated defect in the mutant LUT despite not every neural cell body being transduced. On autopsy, wild-type (WT) mice had empty bladders, whereas bladders were uniformly distended in mutant mice, a defect ameliorated by AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> treatment. AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> significantly ameliorated the impaired neurogenic relaxation of outflow tracts and the impaired neurogenic contractility of mutant detrusor smooth muscle found in <italic>Hpse2</italic> Mut mice. In future, it will be important to study whether the gene transfer strategy might also ameliorate a dyssynergia between bladder and outflow as assessed by in vivo cystometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). These complex in vivo experiments are, however, beyond the remit of the current work.</p><p>Although our data support a neurogenic origin for defects in UFS bladder functionality, we cannot yet rule out an additional myogenic component. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>), however, we quantified smooth muscle actin (<italic>Acta2</italic>) and myosin heavy chain (<italic>Myh11</italic>) transcripts at 1 and 14 days after birth and recorded no significant differences between WT and <italic>Hpse2</italic> homozygous mutant mice. This suggests that detrusor smooth muscle itself is unchanged in the juvenile period. Moreover, in the current study, we did not detect transduction of AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> into detrusor smooth muscle. A more thorough molecular and structural analysis of the natural history of the detrusor will be an important future work. Similarly, fully elucidating the molecular basis of the UFS neurogenic defect is a key objective. A recent paper has demonstrated the feasibility of single-cell RNA sequencing in murine pelvic ganglia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivori et al., 2024</xref>) and so, in future, analysis of WT, <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant, and <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant-treated pelvic ganglia neurons could reveal the fundamental processes that are aberrant in UFS neurons and are rescued by gene addition treatment.</p><p>A feature of the current mouse model, also observed in a different <italic>Hpse2</italic> gene trap mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2015</xref>), is the poor whole body growth compared with WT controls. This becomes more marked during the first month of life, and, in the current study, it was not ameliorated by neonatal AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> administration. The cause of the growth impairment has not been established, but, as demonstrated in the current study, is not accompanied by structural kidney damage. Moreover, our unpublished observations found that <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant pups appear to feed normally, as assessed by finding their stomachs full of mother’s milk. Histological examination of their lungs is normal, excluding aspiration pneumonia. Whatever the cause of the general growth failure, it is notably dissociated from the LUT phenotype, given that AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> administration corrects bladder pathophysiology but not overall growth of the mutant mouse. Of note, a recently published study induced deletion of <italic>Hpse2</italic> in young adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kayal et al., 2023</xref>), and this was followed by fatty degeneration of pancreatic acinar cells. Whether the line of <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant mice used in the current study are born with a similar pancreatic exocrine pathology requires further investigation.</p><p>A small subset of individuals with UFS carry biallelic variants of <italic>leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 2</italic> (<italic>LRIG2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>). LRIG2, like heparanase-2, is immunodetected in pelvic ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, homozygous <italic>Lrig2</italic> mutant mice have abnormal patterns of bladder nerves and display ex vivo contractility defects in LUT tissues compatible with neurogenic pathobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>). In future, the neonatal gene therapy strategy outlined in the current study could be applied to ameliorate bladder pathophysiology in <italic>Lrig2</italic> mutant mice. As well as in UFS, functional bladder outflow obstruction occurs in some individuals with prune belly syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Volmar et al., 2001</xref>) and in megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gosemann and Puri, 2011</xref>). Moreover, apart from UFS, functional bladder outflow obstruction can be inherited as a Mendelian trait and some such individuals carry variants in genes other than <italic>HPSE2</italic> or <italic>LRIG2</italic>. These other genes are implicated in the biology of bladder innervation, neuromuscular transmission, or LUT smooth muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caubit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woolf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Houweling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hahn et al., 2022</xref>). Genetic mouse models exist for several of these human diseases and, again, could be used as models for gene therapy.</p><p>There are numerous challenges in translating work in mouse models to become effective therapies in humans. First, neonatal mice are immature compared to a newborn person, and the anatomy of their still developing kidneys and LUTs can be compared to those organs in the human foetus in the late second trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes and Woolf, 2023</xref>). Thus, gene replacement therapy for people with UFS and related genetic REOLUT disorders may need to be given before birth. In fact, UFS can present in the fetal period when ultrasonography reveals a dilated LUT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>). The ethics and feasibility of delivering genes and biological therapies to human foetuses are current topics of robust debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sagar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mimoun et al., 2023</xref>) and, with advances in early detection and therapies themselves, may become established in coming years. Second, there are concerns about the possible side effects of administering AAV vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Srivastava, 2023</xref>). Factoring weight for weight, the dose of AAV9 vector administered to the <italic>Hpse2</italic> mutant mice in the current study is of a similar order of magnitude as those used to treat babies with spinal muscular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mendell et al., 2017</xref>). In that report there was evidence of liver damage, as assessed by raised blood transaminases in a subset of treated patients. In the current mouse study, we found that the viral vector transduced livers, while kidneys were resistant to transduction. As assessed by histological analyses to seek fibrosis, livers from AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic>-treated mice appeared normal. We cannot, however, exclude transient liver damage, which could be assessed by alterations in blood transaminases. The fact that transduced livers expressed <italic>HPSE2</italic> transcripts, and the observation that heparanse-2 is a secreted protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levy-Adam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaman et al., 2022</xref>), raises the possibility that the livers of treated mice may act as a factory to produce heparanase-2 that then circulated and had beneficial effects on the LUT, akin to gene therapy to replace coagulation factors missing in haemophilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdary et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we used a viral vector-mediated gene supplementation approach to ameliorate tissue-level neurophysiological defects in UFS mouse bladders. This advance provides a proof of principle to act as a paradigm for treating other genetic mouse models of REOLUT disorders. In the longer term, application to humans may need to consider fetal therapy for reasons detailed above.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental strategy</title><p>In a first set of experiments to explore the feasibility of transducing pelvic ganglia, neonatal homozygous WT mice were intravenously administered the AAV9/<italic>HPSE2</italic> vector (described below).

Accordingly, homozygous mutant mouse bladder tissue contains a truncated <italic>Hpse2</italic> transcript and lacks full-length <italic>Hpse2</italic> transcripts extending beyond the trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>). Mating heterozygous parents leads to the birth of WT, heterozygous, and Mut offspring in the expected Mendelian ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>). In the first month after birth, Mut mice gain less weight than their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>) and, because they later fail to thrive, Mut mice are culled around a month of age before they become overtly unwell. Application of tattoo ink paste (Ketchum, Canada) on paws of neonates (i.e. in the first day after birth) was used to identify individual mice, and same-day genotyping was undertaken. This was carried out using a common forward primer (5′<named-content content-type="sequence">CCAGCCCTAATGCAATTACC</named-content>3′) and two reverse primers, one (5′<named-content content-type="sequence">TGAGCACTCACTTAAAAGGAC</named-content>3′) for the WT allele and the other (5′<named-content content-type="sequence">ATAAACCCTCTTGCAGTTGCA</named-content>3′) for the gene trap allele. Neonates underwent general anaesthesia with 4% isoflurane, and AAV9<italic>/HPSE2</italic> suspended in up to 20 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the temporal vein. This procedure took around 2 min, after which the baby mice were returned to their mother. Control neonates received either vehicle-only (PBS) injection or were not injected.

Functional smooth muscle defects of both the outflow tract and bladder body were previously characterized in juvenile <italic>Hpse2</italic> Mut mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manak et al., 2020</xref>), so mice of the same age were used here. Outflow tracts, which contained SM but not the external sphincter, were separated from the bladder body by dissection. Intact outflow tracts or full-thickness rings from the mid-portion of bladder bodies, containing detrusor smooth muscle, were mounted on pins in myography chambers (Danish Myo Technology, Hinnerup, Denmark) containing physiological salt solution (PSS) at 37°C. The PSS contained 122 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 0.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM <sc>d</sc>-glucose, and 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH.</p><p>The contractility of outflow tract and bladder body preparations was tested by applying 50 mM KCl to directly depolarize SM and stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Sympathetic stimulation of α-1 adrenergic receptors mediates urethral contraction in male mice and primates but has little effect in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2017</xref>). The α-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine (PE, 1 μM), was therefore used to contract male outflow tracts before applying EFS (1 ms pulses of 80 V at 0.5–15 Hz for 10 s) to induce nerve-mediated relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnett et al., 1997</xref>). Female outflow tracts were instead pre-contracted with vasopressin (10 nM) as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grenier et al., 2023</xref>) because they are known to express contractile arginine-vasopressin (AVP) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeng et al., 2015</xref>). Bladder body rings were subjected to EFS (1 ms pulses of 80 V at 0.5–25 Hz for 10 s) to induce frequency-dependent detrusor contractions. As these contractions are primarily mediated by acetylcholine, through its release from parasympathetic nerves and binding to muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsui et al., 2002</xref>), we also measured the degree of bladder body contractions evoked directly by the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (10 nM to 50 μM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>Samples of bladder body, liver, kidney, and pelvic ganglia flanking the base of the mouse bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keast et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>) were removed immediately after death and prepared for histology. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 5 μm for bladders and kidneys, or 6 μm for livers. After dewaxing and rehydrating tissue sections, BaseScope probes (ACDBio, Newark, CA) were applied.

Higher-powered images were acquired on an Olympus BX63 upright microscope using a DP80 camera (Olympus) through CellSens Dimension v1.16 software (Olympus). For immunohistochemistry, after dewaxing and rehydration, endogenous peroxidase was quenched with hydrogen peroxide.

A primary antibody raised in rabbit against heparanase-2 (Abcepta AP12994c; 1:400) was applied. The immunogen was a KLH-conjugated synthetic peptide between 451–480 amino acids in the C-terminal region of human heparanase-2, predicted to cross-react with mouse heparanase-2. The primary antibody was prepared in PBS Triton-X-100 (0.1%) and 3% serum and incubated overnight at 4°C. It was reacted with a second antibody and the positive brown signal generated with DAB peroxidase-based methodology (Vector Laboratories, SK4100).

Building on prior studies describing the nature of urinary tract dysfunction in Hpse2 mutant mice, the authors applied a gene therapy approach to determine whether gene replacement could be achieved, and if so, whether restoration of HPSE2 expression could mitigate the urinary tract dysfunction. Using a viral vector-based strategy, shown to be successful for gene replacement in humans, the authors demonstrated dose-dependent viral transduction of pelvic ganglia and liver in wild type mice. No impact on body weight or liver health was noted suggesting the approach was safe. Administration of AAV9/HPSE2 to Hpse2 mutant mice was associated with similar transduction of pelvic ganglia and a corresponding increase in heparanase-2 protein expression in this site. Analysis of bladder outflow tract and bladder body physiology using organ bath studies showed that re-expression of heparanase-2 in Hpse2 mutant mice was associated with restored neurogenic relaxation of the outflow tract and nerve-evoked contraction of the bladder body, albeit with notable variability in the response at lower frequencies across replicates. Differences were noted in the evoked response to carbachol with bladders from Hpse2 mutant male mice showing increased sensitivity upon HPSE2 replacement compared to wild type, but bladders from female mice showing no difference. Based on these findings the authors concluded that AAV9-based HPSE2 replacement is feasible and safe, mitigates some physiological deficits in outflow tract and bladder tissue from Hpse2 mutant mice and provides proof-of-principle for gene replacement approaches for other genes implicated in lower urinary tract disorders. Strengths include a solid experimental design and data in support of some of the conclusions, and discussion of limitations of the approach. Weaknesses include the variability, albeit acknowledged, in some of the functional assessments, and the limited investigation of bladder tissue morphology in Hpse2 mutant mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91828.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lopes</surname><given-names>Filipa M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grenier</surname><given-names>Celine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jarvis</surname><given-names>Benjamin W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Al Mahdy</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lène-McKay</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gurney</surname><given-names>Alison M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>William G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Waddington</surname><given-names>Simon N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Woolf</surname><given-names>Adrian S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Neil A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Manchester</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Manchester</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>Some important and interesting data are missing.

We know that the mutant mice usually become ill after the first month of life and can die. However, we wanted to study the mice when they were generally well so that there would be no confounding effects on the bladder physiology caused by general ill health. Indeed, a recent study of Hpse2 inducible deletion in adult mice has shown evidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (Kayal et al., PMID 37491420). We are currently exploring the status of the pancreas in our non-conditional juvenile Hpse2 mice, and whether gene transfer into the pancreas is possible.</p><p>We strongly agree that in vivo voiding studies will be important in the future, and suggest in vivo cystometry is the gold standard for this but is currently beyond the remit of this study.</p><p>It is correct that in this paper we focussed on gene transduction into the pelvic ganglia, because the evidence is mounting that this is a neurogenic disease, with our ex vivo physiological studies showing predominantly neurogenic defects that are corrected by the gene therapy. To further understand the biodistribution of the vector we have now sought evidence of viral transduction into the bladder itself (the new Figure 5). In contrast to the neurons of the pelvic ganglia, we observed very limited transduction: “The vector genome sequence WPRE3, and HPSE2 transcripts, were not detected in the urothelium or lamina propria, the loose tissue directly underneath the urothelium. Within the detrusor muscle layer itself, the large smooth muscle cells were not transduced. However, there were rare small foci of BaseScopeTM signal that may represent nerves coursing through the detrusor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>Weaknesses include a lack of discussion of the basis for differences in carbachol sensitivity in Hpse2 mutant mice, limited discussion of bladder tissue morphology in Hpse2 mutant mice, some questions over the variability of the functional data, and a need for clarification on the presentation of statistical significance of functional data</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is interesting that untreated male mutant mice have an increased bladder body contraction to carbachol compared with WT males. In a previous paper (Manak et al., 2020) we performed quantitative western blots for the M2 and M3 receptors and found levels were similar in mutants to the WTs, thus the increased sensitivity probably lies post-receptor.</p><p>A detailed study of the bladder body is an interesting idea, in terms of possible transgene expression and detailed histology, and is something we will pursue in future studies.</p><p>We have reported in our physiology graphs what we find.

The Hpse2 mutant animals are smaller than wildtype littermates, the reason for which has not been identified but could be due to defects in processing milk and food.
