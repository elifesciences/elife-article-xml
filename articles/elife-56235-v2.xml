Using a two-pronged drug screen employing the zebrafish lateral line as an in vivo readout for ototoxicity and kidney cell-based nephrotoxicity assay, we screened 1280 compounds and identified 22 that were both oto- and nephroprotective. Of these, dopamine and L-mimosine, a plant-based amino acid active in the dopamine pathway, were further investigated. Dopamine and L-mimosine protected the hair cells in the zebrafish otic vesicle from cisplatin-induced damage and preserved zebrafish larval glomerular filtration. Importantly, these compounds did not abrogate the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin on human cancer cells.

Cisplatin is a highlyÂ effective anticancer agent that primarily functions through covalent-binding to purine bases, resulting in DNA crosslinks, activation of repair pathways, formation of double stranded breaks (DSBs), increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dasari and Tchounwou, 2014</xref>). However, cisplatin treatment is associated with a variety of side effects, including dose-limiting toxicities such as oto- and nephrotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pabla and Dong, 2008</xref>). While ototoxicity is permanent in humans, nephrotoxicity can be acute or chronic in nature, and can sometimes demonstrate partial recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brock et al., 1991</xref>).Â The former is of particular concern in the treatment of pediatric cancers like neuroblastoma (NBL) or osteosarcoma, when survivors have many developmental life years that may be adversely effected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Finkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Skinner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">StÃ¶hr et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Studies suggest that ototoxicity is particularly detrimental in pediatric populations, resulting in a higher frequency of learning disabilities and a decreased self-reported quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knight et al., 2005</xref>). Approximately 61% of pediatric patients treated with cisplatin will experience hearing loss according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knight et al., 2005</xref>). While estimates vary greatly, cisplatin treatment is similarly correlated with changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in approximately 20â30% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hartmann et al., 1999</xref>). Hypomagnesemia, or low serum magnesium levels, is a common and persistent side-effect of cisplatin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">StÃ¶hr et al., 2007</xref>), which can lead to seizures, mood changes, tremors, and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lajer and Daugaard, 1999</xref>). Nephrotoxicity was observed in some of the first human trials using cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Higby et al., 1974</xref>), and occurs in approximately one third of patients, detectable approximately 10 days after cisplatin therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gonzales-Vitale et al., 1977</xref>). Unlike ototoxicity, renal damage appears to be at least partially reversible for some patients, usually in those that received low cumulative doses, or were young at the time of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brock et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Latcha et al., 2016</xref>). The ongoing search for oto- and nephroprotective agents highlights the relevance and significance of these toxicities and their mitigation, while maintaining anticancer efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitcher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vlasits et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs to protect against cisplatin ototoxicity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that has shown promise as an oto- and nephroprotective agent in multiple preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). NAC is currently in a Phase I clinical trial to assess safe dosing for children being treated with cisplatin, with secondary outcome measures of hearing and renal assessment to test for protective effects (NCT02094625). In the context of cisplatin exposure, studies suggest that NAC acts primarily by reducing the elevated levels of ROS that may induce cellular damage, as well as by direct inactivation by complexing with cisplatin in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Norman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rushworth and Megson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sooriyaarachchi et al., 2016</xref>). Sodium thiosulfate (STS) has also demonstrated otoprotective capacity preclinically, and in several pediatric Phase III clinical trials (ex. NCT00716976, NCT00652132) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doolittle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muldoon et al., 2000</xref>). However, STS is not typically used clinically because of its detrimental impact on overall survival in a subset of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freyer et al., 2017</xref>). While the reason for this decreased survival is unknown, authors noted that STS may also protect cancer cells from cisplatin-induced toxicity. In attempts to circumvent the potential protection of cancer cells, some studies have attempted to use intra-tympanic administration of protective agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Viglietta et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Options for protecting against nephrotoxicity are also limited. A systematic review of clinical trials suggests that, while hydration is critical for all patients, short-duration, outpatient hydration with potential magnesium supplementation is the safest way to administer cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crona et al., 2017</xref>). Some studies suggest the use of mannitol or furosemide as an osmotic diuretic to prevent renal toxicity, but results are inconsistent and furosemide may itself be ototoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hayes et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Santoso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless of best practice guidelines, renal toxicity remains problematic for patients, especially those with pre-existing kidney dysfunction. One of the main problems in identifying nephroprotective drugs is the lack of a suitable model organism. While murine models have extensive genetic similarities with humans, they are expensive and the kidneys are inaccessible in living animals. On the other hand, human cell lines may be too simplistic to faithfully represent a dynamic organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The zebrafish larva is uniquely suited to identifying novel protective compounds through drug screening, combining the advantages of cell lines (extremely small size suitable for multi-well plates, ease of chemical exposure) and vertebrate models (functional organ systems, genetic conservation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacRae and Peterson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zon and Peterson, 2005</xref>). Indeed, a zebrafish larval drug screen identified the natural product, visnagin, as a cardioprotectant against short-term anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Further, as a whole-animal drug screening platform, zebrafish can quickly identify compounds with obvious developmental toxicities or absorption issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zon and Peterson, 2005</xref>). Zebrafish are particularly well-suited for assessing in vivo oto- and nephrotoxicity as they have analogous organ systems. Zebrafish larvae as young as four days post-fertilization (dpf) possess a functional pronephros structure (a primitive kidney that resembles the two nephrons, running along the length of the larva) and a sophisticated oto-vestibulary system including an inner ear structure with multiple sensory placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxendale and Whitfield, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drummond and Davidson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hentschel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Whitfield et al., 2002</xref>). Equally important for in vivo drug screening, like many teleosts, the zebrafish possesses a lateral line consisting of clusters of hair cells (called neuromasts) for sensing water movement, which are analogous to the hair cells found in mammalian cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raible and Kruse, 2000</xref>). Neuromast hair cells are susceptible to ototoxins like cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ou et al., 2007</xref>) and the lateral line is superficial and accessible, making zebrafish an excellent in vivo ototoxicity screening system.</p><p>In this study, we report the results of a two-pronged screen incorporating an in vivo ototoxicity assay in zebrafish larvae and an in vitro nephrotoxicity assay using human proximal tubule cells. Over 1200 pharmacologically active compounds were screened to identify candidates that protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. This in vivo ototoxicity screen employed a novel automated Biosorter (similar to a flow cytometer, but used for large particles) to assess larval fluorescence. From the 22 compounds that were both oto- and nephroprotective, we further investigated the utility the endogenous neurotransmitter, dopamine, and the plant amino acid, L-mimosine. Further to their protective effects in vitro and in vivo, we found that these compounds do not impede the ability of cisplatin to induce DSBs and apoptosis in several relevant cancer cell lines, highlighting their potential as putative protective agents that may contribute to the safer administration of cisplatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cisplatin treatment results in a dose-dependent decrease in both neuromast health and proximal kidney tubule cell viability</title><p>To establish the toxicity profile for cisplatin in both the in vivo ototoxicity screen and the cell-based primary nephrotoxicity screen, initial toxicity curves were generated. In vivo ototoxicity was assessed by examining the health of the lateral line neuromast structures on cisplatin-treated zebrafish larvae, as has been done by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxendale and Whitfield, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ou et al., 2007</xref>).

Based on these preliminary results, we determined that a 12 hr pretreatment with the protective agent prior to cisplatin treatment was ideal, so all subsequent experiments used this time course. Following this schedule, we observed significant neuromast protection with dopamine at 0.03 mM, L-mimosine at both 0.03 and 0.04 mM, and with the combination of dopamine and L-mimosine at 0.02 mM each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), when compared to larvae treated with cisplatin alone. Representative images of these larvae at the indicated treatment concentrations can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>. Since none of the treatment doses resulted in complete protection of the neuromasts, in attempts to determine whether these results were biologically meaningful, we assessed the neuromast integrity following treatment with 0.01 mM cisplatin, or 50% of the dose administered to the larvae receiving the protective compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, column 1). Treatment with the full dose of cisplatin (100%, or 0.02 mM) and either L-mimosine at 0.04 mM or the combination of dopamine and L-mimosine at 0.02 mM each resulted in neuromast fluorescence that was not significantly different from the larvae treated with 0.01 mM cisplatin alone (the 50% dose). These data suggest that use of these protective agents could allow for larger doses of cisplatin to be given without further damage to the hair cells, which could have potential therapeutic benefit.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dopamine and L-mimosine pretreatment partially protects zebrafish larval neuromasts from cisplatin-induced damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Following dose and scheduling optimization, groups of larvae at 60 hr post-fertilization (hpf) were treated with either vehicle control or the indicated concentrations of protective agents.

The repair of inter-strand crosslinks typically involves the formation of at least a temporary DSB, which result in the phosphorylation of histone protein H2AX, called Î³H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rogakou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>).

To assess the contribution of DSB formation to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we used an Î³H2AX-based immunofluorescence assay.

Cisplatin is used in the treatment of multiple cancer types, including several pediatric malignancies like NBL, osteosarcoma and in germ cell tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kelland, 2007</xref>). However, like most cytotoxic drugs, cisplatin has a host of toxic side effects that are sometimes considered to be âcollateral damage.â Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are among the common dose-limiting side effects of cisplatin treatment. Approximately 30% of patients experience some type of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, while ototoxicity occurs in at least 60% of pediatric patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hartmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knight et al., 2005</xref>). In order to continue harnessing the utility of cisplatin, there have been many efforts to identify protective compounds.</p><p>STS is an otoprotective agent that was recently tested in a pediatric clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freyer et al., 2017</xref>). While the individuals that received STS had significantly less hearing loss (45 vs. 84%, p=0.00022), the individuals with disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis had worse overall survival when treated with STS (45% vs. 84%, respectively, p=0.009). It is not currently known why this difference in overall survival with STS treatment occurred, but it is worth noting that STS is known to function as a protective agent in several ways, both scavenging ROS and forming a direct complex with cisplatin, inactivating the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijarnia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sooriyaarachchi et al., 2012</xref>). While the direct complexing with cisplatin was known at the outset of the clinical trial, results from preclinical trials suggested that delayed administration of STS (4â8 hr following cisplatin therapy) would prevent any unwanted cancer cell protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muldoon et al., 2000</xref>). This highlights the delicate nature of identifying a protective agent to be given with a potentially life-saving chemotherapy â the adjuvant therapy must not interfere with the original compound. Thus, it would be prudent to identify compounds with a novel mechanism of oto- and/or nephroprotection, which may be best accomplished using an unbiased screening approach, rather than rational or target-based drug design.</p><p>Our study used a novel two-pronged drug screen approach that employed both a prototypical cell-based nephrotoxicity assay and a novel Biosorter-based fluorescence in vivo ototoxicity assay. Human studies suggest that over the initial 24 hr period following administration, plasma cisplatin levels range from approximately 1â10 Âµg/mL, which translates to 0.0033 mM-0.033Â mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lanvers-Kaminsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rajkumar et al., 2016</xref>), well within the range of what we used experimentally. By using both human cells and animal models, we were able to focus the list of potentially protective compounds to those that were likely to have good absorption and low levels of systemic toxicity at effective doses. For example, there were seven compounds in the Sigma LOPAC<sup>1280</sup> library that were hits in the in vitro nephrotoxicity assay that were toxic at the same dose to the zebrafish larvae (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It should also be noted that since these compounds were not assessed without cisplatin, we can only conclude that these compounds were toxic to approximately 75% of larvae when administered at a concentration of 0.01 mM in combination with 0.02 mM cisplatin. While this does not indicate that these compounds are not useful, it does suggest that their toxicity profiles may be challenging to surmount; thus, pushing them lower on the priority list.</p><p>While this study focused on the compounds that were hits in both assays, this does not imply that the compounds that were hits in only one of the assays are not of interest. For example, NAC was a hit in the ototoxicity screen, but not the nephrotoxicity screen. There is significant overlap between the mechanisms of oto- and nephrotoxicity, including the role of elevated ROS levels, but also important differences, including specific drug transporter expression in the kidney vs. the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciarimboli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sprowl et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, oto- and nephroprotective compounds do not necessarily share the same mechanism of protection. However, by studying two common toxicities caused by the same drug, we were able to identify compounds that could protect against both toxicities simultaneously, which would aid in avoiding polypharmacy in this already heavily treated population.</p><p>The multiple appearances of dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway modulators in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) is supported by similar findings in a study of both aminoglycoside- and cisplatin-induced zebrafish lateral line toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vlasits et al., 2012</xref>). Among the 10 hits emphasized in the Vlasits et al., study were paroxetine, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and fluspirilene, an antipsychotic compound that acts as an antagonist at the D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vlasits et al., 2012</xref>). While these specific compounds did not show up as hits in the present screen, similar compounds were identified. For example, trifluoperazine dihydrochloride, a D<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist was a hit in both assays in this study. Although this seems counterintuitive, the opposing effects of D1 vs. D2-like receptors means that a D2-like receptor antagonist might have the same net effect as a D1-agonist. Of note, 15% of the Sigma LOPAC1280 library consists of compounds that would interact with either the dopaminergic or serotonergic pathway (9% and 6%, respectively). This is a relatively high proportion of compounds that could have translated to a disproportionate number of positive âhitsâ in this pathway. It is also important to note that while L-mimosine may have dopaminergic effects, it also has a wide array of documented pharmacological effects, ranging from prolyl hydroxylase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mccaffrey et al., 1995</xref>) to copper and iron chelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kulp and Vulliet, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The potential effects of dopamine and L-mimosine, in addition to other hits shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, suggest that increased dopamine levels may be oto- and nephroprotective. However, further mechanistic experiments will need to be completed to support this hypothesis. D1 and D2-like receptors are both present in the mammalian inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011</xref>) and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris and Zhang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jose et al., 1992</xref>). Another point of interest is that organic anion transporter 2 (OCT2), the transporter that seems to play a role in cisplatin uptake into both renal tubule and cochlear cells, is also capable of transporting dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciarimboli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Filipski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filipski et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, there is also strong evidence that dopamine protects auditory nerves from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lendvai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ruel et al., 2001</xref>). Although the hypothesis that oto- and nephroprotection may be mediated by increased dopamine signaling still needs to be confirmed, it is possible that dopamine could bind to the D<sub>1</sub> or D<sub>5</sub> receptors present in the inner ear and/or pronephros structure, causing increases in intracellular cAMP, which seems to provide nephroprotection in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillies et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hans et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Palmieri et al., 1993</xref>) and cochlear nerve protection from noise-induced hearing damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darrow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lendvai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ruel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oestreicher et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>L-DOPA (levodopa), the biosynthetic precursor to dopamine, is currently used to treat Parkinsonâs disease, which is mostly caused by the pathological loss of dopaminergic neurons in regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Salat and Tolosa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sethi, 2010</xref>).

In the present study, L-DOPA was a hit in the otoprotection assay, but not the nephroprotection assay, which may have been a result of only testing one dose at one time point in the initial screen; however, the potential utility of this clinically utilized compound should be the topic for further investigation.</p><p>In terms of potential nephroprotective effects, researchers have previously attempted to use low dose dopamine (0.5â3 Âµg/kg/min) to increase renal blood flow and potentially protect the kidneys from cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kellum, 1997</xref>). The results of multiple studies were conflicting, and do not currently support the use of dopamine as a nephroprotectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crona et al., 2017</xref>). However, the inconsistency in findings may be a result of the presence of the antagonistic D1 and D2-like dopamine receptors in the kidney. One study found that fenoldopam, a selective D<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist reduced post-operative acute kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillies et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>This study presents in vitro evidence in three different cell lines that the protective compounds do not interfere with the anticancer effects of cisplatin. While the reason for the specific protective effects of these compounds in human proximal tubule cells and zebrafish pronephros, neuromast and inner ear structures is unknown at this time, it is likely a result of intrinsic differences between the cells themselves, potentially at the level of dopamine receptor subtype expression. Thus, it will be essential to perform these in vivo experiments in a murine model prior to moving these compounds into human trials. These murine experiments will also be important, as despite being an excellent model organism for the study of oto- and nephrotoxicity, the zebrafish does not possess certain anatomical features that are present in mammals, like the stria vascularis or cochlea in the inner ear. Another important difference between human inner ear hair cells and zebrafish hair cells is that teleost hair cells (both lateral line and inner ear) regenerate, while mammalian hair cells do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monroe et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly in our studies, we did take care to ensure that regenerated hair cells were not captured in our experiments by rinsing each group of larvae separately and imaging or assessing them immediately.</p><p>Future experiments should focus on investigating the putative mechanisms of protection, which require further validation following the initial identification of these candidate protective compounds from our innovative screening strategy. Given the similarity in structure between dopamine and L-mimosine, it would also be interesting to identify and assess similar chemical structures to potentially find more efficacious or potent compounds.</p><p>Despite advances in targeted chemotherapeutics and personalized medicine, broadly cytotoxic compounds like cisplatin remain a mainstay in the treatment of many malignancies. When cisplatin-induced toxicities are detected, clinicians are forced to decrease the dose or even discontinue this potentially life-saving drug. The present study developed a dual-purpose drug screen, identifying 22 compounds that showed potential as both oto- and nephroprotective. In particular, dopamine and L-mimosine were both oto- and nephroprotective in larval zebrafish. Further, in vitro studies in cancer cell lines demonstrated that dopamine and L-mimosine did not decrease the anticancer effects of cisplatin. These results demonstrate that dopamine and L-mimosine have significant promise as protective agents, warranting further investigation. These findings also suggest a potential biological role for elevated levels of dopamine in the protection against these toxicities. The drug screening methodology developed within this study could easily be applied to different libraries of compounds, either testing drugs for oto- or nephrotoxic effects, or for protection from these toxicities. Overall, the methods developed within this study, and the identification of several oto- and nephroprotective compounds, can hopefully inform future studies and improve the safety of cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HK-2, proximal tubule cells, HPV-16 transformed</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-2190, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0302">CVCL_0302</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HSC-3, oral squamous cell carcinoma</td><td valign="top">JCRB Cell Bank</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1288">CVCL_1288</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SK-N-AS, metastatic neuroblastoma cells</td><td valign="top">Gift from Dr. Meredith Irwin (SickKids)</td><td valign="top">CRL-2137, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1700">CVCL_1700</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LAN5, metastatic neuroblastoma cells</td><td valign="top">Gift from Dr. Meredith Irwin (SickKids)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0389">CVCL_0389</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Fish strain (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Casper</italic> double pigment mutant fish strain</td><td valign="top">Gift from Dr. Len Zon (Harvard), PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18371439">18371439</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><italic>mitfa<sup>w2/w2</sup>;mpv17<sup>a9/a9</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Used throughout the fish work</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">phospho-histone H2A.X (Ser139) (20E3) rabbit monoclonal antibody</td><td valign="top">Cell Signalling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat # 9718S</td><td valign="top">IF: 1:400</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Cisplatin</td><td valign="top">Cayman Chemicals</td><td valign="top">Cat # 15663-27-1</td><td valign="top">Prepared fresh in 0.9% NaCl before each experiment</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Dopamine hydrochloride</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # H60255</td><td valign="top">Prepared fresh in 0.9% NaCl before each experiment</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L-mimosine</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # M0253</td><td valign="top">Prepared in 0.9% NaCl, aliquoted and stored at â20Â°C</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Adult <italic>casper</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">White et al., 2008</xref>) zebrafish were housed in a recirculating commercial housing system (Pentair, Apopka, FL) at 28Â°C in 14 hr:10 hr light:dark conditions and bred according to standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Westerfield, 1995</xref>). <italic>Casper</italic> zebrafish were used throughout the study due to enhanced optical clarity and utility in fluorescence-based experimentation, without the need for phenylthiourea (PTU) treatment, which has been shown to influence both behavior and neural crest development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohnsack et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parker et al., 2013</xref>).

This library was used in both the in vitro and in vivo drug screens at a final concentration of 0.01 mM. Each drug screen was completed once, with either duplicate wells of HK-2 cells, or four larvae per well. These values were then averaged.</p><p>Cisplatin (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) was prepared fresh for each experiment as a stock solution of 1.67 mM in 0.9% NaCl, protected from light. Dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) was prepared fresh for each experiment as a stock solution of 50 mM in 0.9% NaCl, protected from light. L-mimosine (Sigma Aldrich) was prepared as a 72 mM stock solution in 0.9% NaCl, aliquoted to prevent freeze-thaw cycles, and stored at â20Â°C.</p><p>In all experiments, zebrafish larvae were incubated with drugs at 35Â°C to more closely replicate human body temperature, representing a midpoint between the ideal temperature for zebrafish development (28Â°C) and human cells (37Â°C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Neuromast labeling</title><p>Larvae were pretreated with desired compound(s), depending on the specific experiment. Treatment was removed prior to the staining procedure. Neuromasts were stained by incubating larvae in 2 Î¼M YO-PRO-1 Iodide 491â509 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in methylene blue-free E3 media at 35Â°C for 1 hr. YO-PRO-1 is a carbocyanine nucleic acid stain that labels the nuclei of viable hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxendale and Whitfield, 2016</xref>). Larvae were then rinsed 3X with methylene blue-free E3 media. Larvae were then analyzed using either an inverted Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), or a Biosorter, coupled to a Large Particle Handler (Union Biometrica Inc, Holliston, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Biosorting</title><p>Larval biosorting was completed with a Biosorter (Union Biometrica Inc) with or without an associated Large Particle Handler (Union Biometrica Inc). When sampling from a 96-well plate, larvae were arrayed with four larvae/well, and were exposed to 0.2 mg/ml tricaine immediately before sampling, to ensure linear passage of the larvae through the tubing. For these experiments, the unit was fitted with a 500 Î¼M fluidics and optics core assembly (FOCA), 1000 Î¼M fluid handling tubing, and a 488 nm laser. Although data were collected on all channels simultaneously, PH green fluorescence was examined in YO-PRO-1 studies, and overall green fluorescence was assessed in the GFR studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phalloidin inner ear hair cell staining</title><p>Staining of inner ear hair cells was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxendale and Whitfield, 2016</xref>. Briefly, larvae were treated at 60 hpf with either L-mimosine, dopamine, or a vehicle control. Larvae were rinsed at 72 hpf, then treated with 0.01 mM freshly-prepared cisplatin. At 120 hpf (48 hr cisplatin treatment), larvae were rinsed three times, euthanized with tricaine overdose, then fixed overnight at 4Â°C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixed larvae were washed 2X for 5 min in PBS+ 0.2% Triton-X100 (PBSTx), then permeabilized for 2 hr in PBS+2% Triton-X100. Following this, samples were washed 2X for 5 min in PBSTx, then incubated in Alexa Fluor 488 stock solution (diluted 1:20 in 1:1000 PBS-Tween), protected from light at room temperature (RT) for 1.5 hr. Samples were then washed 6X for 10 min in PBSTx, and stored at 4Â°C in the dark. Prior to imaging, samples were rinsed 4X for 15 min in PBS, then placed in a solution of 3:1 glycerol:Tris buffer (pH 8.1) containing 2% n-propyl gallate. Whole zebrafish larvae were mounted on standard slides with a 1.5-ounce cover slip, then viewed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss), using Zeiss Zen2009 software. Specimens were epi-illuminated with a mercury lamp (X-Cite 120Q; Lumen Dynamics Inc) or with 30 mW argon (488 nm) laser (Carl Zeiss) directed through a 488/543 nm dichroic mirror (HFT 488/543; Carl Zeiss) onto the preparation. Emitted fluorescence was collected with a 25Â ÃÂ 0.80 NA objective (LCI Plan-Neofluar; Carl Zeiss) through a 505â530 nm filter (BP505-530; Carl Zeiss). Z-stacks were taken at regions of interest surrounding optic placode tissues and ranged from 27 to 42 Âµm in depth.</p><p>To ensure that differences in hair cell stereocilia appearance were not due to differences in fluorophore labeling, a standard scanning protocol was created within Zen and used for all specimens (2.0 digital zoom; 488 nm laser: 55% power, 500 master gain, 1.0 digital gain, 0.0 digital offset, 1.0 AU pinhole; set relative to control treatment groups). The experiment was repeated twice at minimum, with a minimum of three larval placodes on different larvae examined each time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Volumetric/3D assessment of hair cell ellipticity</title><p>The 3D structure of the hair cell stereocilia was reconstructed from laser scanning microscope (LSM) images using Imaris software v.X64 9.1.2 (Bitplane, Andor Technology, Oxford Instruments). The original Zeiss LSM files of 2D images ranging from 27 to 42 Î¼m in depth were imported to Imaris software for surface reconstruction. This software was employed to obtain the topology of hair cells within the placode as well as overall hair cell morphology. Ellipticity (prolate, or elongation around the long axis) was used as a measure of the status of the hair cells with healthier hair cells exhibiting a higher prolate ellipticity. In order to analyze hair cell morphology, a total of 16 individual hair cells in six zebrafish from each of the treatment conditions were assessed. Any volumes outside of the placode, or hair cells which overlapped preventing individual quantification, were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Inner ear hair cell enumeration</title><p>Fiji (ImageJ) was used to first create maximum intensity Z-projections of confocal images to count hair cells in the inner ear. These were conducted with the same images used for volumetric/ellipticity measurements. Individual hair cells were marked and counted using the Cell Counter plugin within ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vivo glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assay</title><p>The in vivo assessment of GFR was adapted from experiments reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hentschel et al., 2005</xref>. Zebrafish larvae were treated at 60 hpf with either L-mimosine, dopamine, or a vehicle control. Larvae were rinsed at 72 hpf, then treated with 0.125 mM cisplatin. Larvae were rinsed three times with E3 media immediately before injection with FITC-inulin (Sigma Aldrich). A final concentration of 5% FITC-inulin was manually injected into the common cardinal vein using a PL1 Picoinjector (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) of freshly rinsed treated zebrafish. Immediately following injection, larvae were screened under a fluorescent stereoscope for the presence of FITC in circulation to remove any uninjected larvae, then sorted using the Biosorter. Three representative larvae/group were then imaged using the Zeiss SteREO Discovery.V20 dissecting microscope (Carl Zeiss) then incubated in fresh E3 medium for 2 hr at 35Â°C, at which point the larvae were biosorted and imaged again. Data are presented as the fold change in overall green fluorescence as an indication of the glomerular filtration that occurred over the 2 hr rest period, with the 0 hr timepoint set to 1. The experiment was completed three times, with aÂ minimumÂ of 50 larvae measured/group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histology</title><p>Larvae were treated in parallel with the GFR assay, then fixed overnight at 4Â°C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Larvae were then pre-embedded in 1.5% Ultrapure low-melting point agarose (Sigma Aldrich), to allow for alignment of the larvae for easy coronal cross-sectioning. Pre-embedded larvae were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for between 1Â andÂ 3 days, then embedded in Surgipath Paraplast (LEICA) with the Tissue Tek Embedding Station, Model TEC EMA-1 (Sakura Finetek USA Inc). Larvae were then sectioned to 4 Î¼m with a Nikon Eclipse Ni manual microtome with Nikon Plan Fluor objectives (Nikon), and stained with H and E with a Tissue-Tek Prisma automated slide stainer. Slides were preserved with the Tissue-Tek Glas g2 automated cover-slipper (Sakura Finetek USA Inc). Slides were examined and imaged with the Nikon Digital Sight DS-L3 (Nikon).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>An Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for the detection of apoptotic cells. Cells were seeded in six-well plates and according to previously optimized doses and timelines, cells were pretreated with vehicle control or either 0.03 mM dopamine or L-mimosine for 12 hr. Cells were then treated with 0.01 mM freshly-prepared cisplatin. Cells (1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>) were harvested with trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were washed 1X with PBS, 1X with Annexin V binding buffer, then were resuspended in binding buffer at a concentration of 1â5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. PE-conjugated Annexin V (5 Î¼l, excitation/emissionÂ =Â 488/561 nm) was added to 100 Î¼l of the cell suspension and incubated for 15 min at RT in the dark. Samples were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of Annexin binding buffer. SYTOXBlue dead cell stain (1 Î¼L, excitation/emissionÂ =Â 444/480 nm) was added to each sample and incubated for 15 min at RT in the dark. Samples were placed on ice and subjected to flow cytometry using the BD FACSCanto flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using BD FACSDiva Software. Gating strategies for doublet discrimination and dead cell exclusion are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2aâi</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Î³-H2AX labeling</title><p>Cells were plated similarly to the Annexin V apoptosis analysis, on sterile 18 Ã 18 mm glass coverslips (Globe Scientific, Mahwah, NJ) in six-well plates, then treated with the protective agents 12 hr prior to 0.01 mM cisplatin treatment. The following day, cells were rinsed once with PBS, then fixed with 4% PFA (in PBS) at 37Â°C for 20 min, then rinsed again with PBS. This time point was chosen as a result of a literature search that concluded that 24 hr following cisplatin administration is indicative of longer-term cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Olive and BanÃ¡th, 2009</xref>). Following fixation, cells were washed 3X with PBS, then permeabilized by incubating coverslips with 0.3% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 30 min at RT. Samples were then washed 3X with PBST. Samples were incubated with blocking buffer (5% donkey serum in PBST) for 1 hr at RT. In a dark humidity chamber, samples were incubated with phospho-histone H2A.X (Ser139) (20E3) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signalling Technology) at 1:400 in 2.5% donkey serum in PBST O/N at 4Â°C. The next day, samples were washed 4X with PBST, then were incubated in a dark humidity chamber with donkey polyclonal secondary antibody to rabbit IgG-H and L (Alexa Fluor 647) at 1:400 dilution, and 1:1000 DAPI (4â,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride) (Invitrogen) in 2.5% donkey serum in PBST for 1 hr at RT. Samples were then washed 4X with PBST. Following washing, coverslips were mounted with Dako Fluorescent mounting medium (Dako) onto Superfrost plus microslides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and kept in the dark at RT overnight. Coverslips were stored at 4Â°C in the dark until imaging. Imaging of samples was done using the Zeiss LSM 710 Laser scanning confocal microscope. Four images were acquired for each treatment group/replicate. NÂ =Â 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification of Î³H2AX staining</title><p>Quantification of Î³H2AX staining was completed with a custom ImageJ (Fiji) macro, written by Benno Orr (University of Toronto) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For each confocal image, regions of interest (ROIs) for individual nuclei were generated from a thresholded duplicate of the DAPI channel. Thresholding was performed with the âTriangleâ method, noise was reduced using the default âDespeckleâ functionality, and holes within thresholded nuclei below a 500-pixel size cut-off and above a 0.5 circularity cut-off were filled. Non-overlapping nuclei were detected as thresholded particles above size and circularity cut-offs of 1000 pixels and 0.65, respectively. Nuclei with overlap were separated with the âWatershedâ functionality and detected as particles above a size and circularity cut-offs of 1000 pixels and 0.8, respectively. Area and integrated density in the DAPI and Î³H2AX channels were measured for each nucleus. Data are reported as Î³H2AX integrated density/DAPI integrated density, with each data point corresponding to an individual nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics and data processing</title><p>Data were accumulated in Microsoft Excel for Mac (Office 365 Version 16.22) and subsequently analyzed using Prism eight for MacOS (Version 8.1.2, GraphPad Software Inc).

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is âin revision at <italic>eLife</italic>â. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript identifies compounds that prevent two common side-effects of cisplatin chemotherapy: ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The study uses an increasingly popular ototoxicity screening model, the larval zebrafish lateral line, and also employs a human kidney cell line for nephrotoxicity screening using the same drug library. This is a unique combination of two inter-related screens with the goal of identifying compounds that confer protection in both cell types. The study is clear and the findings are interesting; the screen hits include multiple modulators of dopaminergic synthesis and signalling. The authors also use a novel method (Biosorter) for lateral line screening, which increases the throughput of this assay. The nephrotoxicity studies in larval zebrafish are impressive â injecting into the cardinal vein of a larval fish is technically challenging. Also, the paper is written in a clear and logical manner.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>â While the study is interesting, mechanistic data are lacking. The suggestion of dopaminergic modulation of oto- and nephrotoxicity is fascinating but there are no mechanistic data to demonstrate that their hits do indeed modulate dopamine signaling. Studies with dopamine receptor antagonists or knockout lines would present compelling mechanistic evidence. Furthermore, there is little mechanistic speculation in the Discussion.</p><p>â Some methodological choices are unclear. Why use 72 hpf animals, when the hair cells don't show mature-like responses until 96 hpf? How does cisplatin toxicity in the lateral line compare between casper mutants and wildtype animals? The casper mutants are likely needed for sell sorting, but melanophores can play a role in antioxidant defenses and therefore this mutant line may have altered responses to cisplatin. Finally, why were the zebrafish experiments performed at 35 C? Optimal temperature is 28 C and morbidity would be expected at this high temperature.</p><p>â In the zebrafish inner ear experiments, did the authors quantify cells in the saccule or utricle? The otic placode represents two distinct epithelia at this time point and these epithelia likely have different responses to ototoxic drugs (based on studies in adult fishes). Also, the ellipticity measurements new to the field and it's unclear if they accurately represent hair cell survival. Suggest comparing the ellipticity measurements to direct counts of phalloidin-labeled hair bundles, which are obvious in their images and relatively simple to quantify.</p><p>â There is considerable variability in hair cell survival in Figure 1A and in 2A for the cisplatin-only groups (red dots). This variability suggests that the automated Biosorter assay may not be as robust as the authors state. It would be useful to see a comparison of the Biosorter assay with a second method of lateral line hair cell quantification, such as counts of Yo-Pro-1 labeled cells (since they already use that dye), or hair cell counts using a hair cell marker such as anti-parvalbumin or a transgenic line such as Brn3c:mGFP or ET4. It would also be helpful to see a secondary validation method for the hair cell protection conferred by dopamine and L-mimosine (shown in Figure 3), since the images don't demonstrate robust increases in fluorescence.</p><p>â Even though the zebrafish possesses hair cells and a renal system, the authors should also underline what are the limitations of the comparison with mammal hair cells and kidneys. A brief description of these structures would be helpful for readers not confident with zebrafish anatomy and physiology.</p><p>â It was stated that: ââ¦Treatment with any of these compounds may result in increased synaptic dopamine levelsâ¦.â Since these compounds protected also HK2 cells, which do not contain synapsis, this suggestion is not appropriate.</p><p>â Measurement of GFR in zebrafish: did the authors measure the effect of dopamine or mimosine alone on GFR?</p><p>â The authors speculate that the protection against cisplatin toxicities may be somehow associated with the characteristics of the protective substances as member of dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission. However, trifluoperazine dihydrochloride is a D2-receptor antagonist and dopamine, of course, an agonist of D-receptors. For this reason, the association between dopaminergic actions and protection is unclear.</p><p>â One of the possible explanations of cisplatin oto- and nephrotoxicity is a specific interaction of cisplatin with organic cation transporters (OCTs), which are highly expressed in the sites of cisplatin unwanted toxicities. Since dopamine is a well-known substrate of OCTs, it is unclear why the authors did not comment this. There are studies demonstrating the expression of OCTs in the zebrafish kidneys and hair cells. This may be an important point to be discussed.</p><p>â Please clarify whether the cisplatin dose range in neuromast and kidney tubule cells toxicity studies resembles the plasma/serum concentrations measured in paediatric cancer patients.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;The identification of dual protective agents against cisplatin-induced oto-and nephrotoxicity using the zebrafish model&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been re-reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor.</p><p>While the manuscript has been improved, there are still some issues remaining:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>â The manuscript has been strongly improved. Even though an elucidation of the mechanisms explaining the observed protection is beyond the aims of this work, there is no mechanistic comment on the missing protection by dopamine and mimosine of cancer cells: the treatment of these cells with these substances did not change or even increased cisplatin cellular toxicity. It would be of interest to discuss a little bit this point.</p><p>â I appreciate the authors adding some additional information about dopamine receptors. I would like an additional sentence or two tying their findings with dopamine and L-mimosine to what is known about dopaminergic signaling in the auditory periphery; why might increasing dopamine be protective?</p><p>â I still have concerns about the 35 C incubation temperature; zebrafish metabolism evolved to operate effectively at lower temperatures, not at human body temperature.

While we considered beginning these experiments at later time points, we ultimately decided to begin experiments at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) because we were conducting a relatively long-term treatment with cisplatin (48hrs) and it is part of our standard operating protocol to begin feeding larvae at 5 dpf. Please note that this is to ensure that there are fewer uncontrolled variables and that the food does not interfere with imaging or fluorescence. Furthermore, other similar studies begin short treatment at 4 or 5 days (Chiu et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2003), acknowledging that lateral line hair cells are present at 3 dpf (Harris et al., 2003). Thus, with our longer-term treatment, the end point of these experiments is similar to ours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does cisplatin toxicity in the lateral line compare between casper mutants and wildtype animals? The casper mutants are likely needed for sell sorting, but melanophores can play a role in antioxidant defenses and therefore this mutant line may have altered responses to cisplatin.</p></disp-quote><p>While we had originally planned to use wild type larvae, the reduced pigmentation afforded by <italic>casper</italic> double pigment mutants was needed for biosorting to measure both lateral line health (with YO-PRO1 staining) and pronephros filtration (with the inulin-based glomerular filtration assay). It also allowed for enhanced imaging opportunities for the phalloidin-based inner ear hair cells, without the need for treatment with a clearing agent. We have added a line in the Materials and methods section to reflect this choice. It reads as follows:</p><p>â<italic>Casper</italic> zebrafish were used throughout the study due to enhanced optical clarity and utility in fluorescent-based experimentation.â</p><p>While we have not specifically quantified the differences between <italic>casper</italic> vs. wild type larvae responses to ototoxins, studies have found similar leukocyte recruitment/inflammatory responses within the lateral line system following ototoxin insult in both <italic>casper</italic> and wild type larvae (dâAlenÃ§on et al., 2010). Other groups have also taken advantage of the optical transparency of <italic>casper</italic> larvae to further explore the auditory system in zebrafish (Wisniowiecki et al., 2016). Some studies have also warned against the use of PTU, as it can influence both behaviour (Parker et al., 2013) and neural crest formation (Bohnsack, Gallina and Kahana, 2011). As a result, we made the decision to work with the <italic>casper</italic> mutant larvae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, why were the zebrafish experiments performed at 35 C? Optimal temperature is 28 C and morbidity would be expected at this high temperature.</p></disp-quote><p>The zebrafish experiments were intentionally performed at 35Â°C, as this is closer to human body temperature. We have found through our toxicity assays that zebrafish respond differently to drugs at various temperatures. Since zebrafish larvae can tolerate being maintained at 35Â°C, as we have established with our xenograft studies (Bentley et al., 2014; El-Naggar et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014; Melong et al., 2017; Pringle et al., 2019; Veinotte, Dellaire and Berman, 2014)), we decided to perform drug-based experiments at this temperature, that more closely replicates human body temperature. It should also be noted that the untreated control zebrafish larvae were also maintained at 35Â°C for consistency. We note that we did not specify this in the Materials and methods and this statement has since been added:</p><p>âIn all experiments, zebrafish larvae were incubated with drugs at 35Â°C to more closely replicate the temperature of the human body, representing a midpoint between the ideal temperature for zebrafish development (28Â°C) and human cells (37Â°C).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â In the zebrafish inner ear experiments, did the authors quantify cells in the saccule or utricle?

We have performed this analysis on the same images that were used for the ellipticity measurements and have reported them in the manuscript as a new panel of this figure, replacing one of the ellipticity measurements (Figure 4F). We would like to point out that the overall trend between hair cell number is the same as ellipticity measurement. We have amended the Results section to reflect this, as follows:</p><p>âIn order to ensure that the ellipticity measurements reflected the same trends that we would see with overall hair cell number, we used the Cell Counter plugin for ImageJ to quantify the number of hair cells in the same maximum-projection z-stack images that were used for Imaris analysis (Figure 4F). It should be noted that the exact same trend is observed, where dopamine and L-mimosine pretreatments resulted in hair cell numbers that were higher than those observed in larvae treated with cisplatin alone.â</p><p>We have also amended the Materials and methods section to include this additional analysis.</p><p>We imaged the larvae with the following orientation â anterior to the left and dorsal at the top, as a lateral orientation of the zebrafish to the objective gave the most unobstructed view into the inner ear. This means that we were imaging the posterior macula. At this time point (6 dpf), there are two main macula â the anterior and posterior. The posterior macula is thought to give rise to the saccule. This orientation allowed for optical sectioning through the hair cells transversely, allowing more slices per hair cell to get a high-quality 3D reconstruction. If the same lateral orientation was used, it would be necessary to optically section any other placode longitudinally, reducing the number of slices per cell, ultimately reducing resolution of imaging. Attempting to adjust the orientation of the larvae to get transverse sections of the other placodes resulted in interference by bone and muscle tissues.</p><p>It should also be noted that, while differential organ sensitivities may be observed in adult zebrafish, this has not been closely studied in larvae. However, the posterior macula is thought to give rise to the saccule, which is a region that is investigated in adult zebrafish studies of related phenomenon, like noise-induced hearing loss (Monroe, Rajadinakaran and Smith, 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â There is considerable variability in hair cell survival in Figure 1A and in 2A for the cisplatin-only groups (red dots).

This degree of variability was fairly consistent across experiments. While this could be viewed as a potential weakness, we believe that this shows one of the strengths of the zebrafish model, namely the opportunity for the large number of animals available in zebrafish larvae experiments to capture some of the natural variability that may exist within a given population, with a large enough sample size to still detect meaningful differences.</p><p>That said, during the validation of the biosorter for this method, we did attempt several other approaches to determine the impact of cisplatin treatment on lateral line integrity. While other studies have employed manual counting of hair cell bundles, we saw this as cumbersome and prone to human error, especially seeing as neuromast hair cell bundles often contain living and dead hair cells simultaneously â making strict +/- counting challenging. We did assess neuromast integrity following YO-PRO1 staining in two different methods. First, we used built-in software on our fluorescent microscope (ZEN2, Blue Edition) to measure the change in neuromast fluorescence. While this method was able to detect a decrease in neuromast fluorescence following cisplatin treatment, it involved imaging each larva independently and was very time consuming. Before acquiring the biosorter, we also attempted to make the neuromast assay more high throughput by measuring the fluorescence of treated YO-PRO1 stained larvae in a 96-well plate format with a fluorescent plate reader. While this method was able to detect differences between treated vs. untreated larvae, it did not detect differences between larvae that were treated with two different doses of cisplatin, possibly limiting its utility.

We have added some more detail about their structure in the Introduction and a section in the Discussion that addresses the shortcomings of this model. In particular, we mention the fact the absence of certain physical structures that may modulate hair cell function, like the stria vascularis and cochlea.</p><p>The wording that was added to the Introduction. It now reads as follows: âZebrafish larvae as young as four days post-fertilization (dpf) possess a functional pronephros structure (a primitive kidney that resembles the two nephrons, running along the length of the larva) and a sophisticated oto-vestibulary system including an inner ear-like structure with multiple sensory placodes (Baxendale and Whitfield, 2016; Drummond and Davidson, 2010; Hentschel et al., 2005; Whitfield et al., 2002).â</p><p>The section that was inserted into the Discussion is as follows:</p><p>âThese murine experiments will also be important, as despite being an excellent model organism for the study of oto- and nephrotoxicity, the zebrafish does not possess certain anatomical features that are present in mammals, like the stria vascularis or cochlea in the inner ear.â</p><p>Another important difference between zebrafish hair cells (both inner ear and lateral line) and human inner ear hair cells is that teleost hair cells regenerate, and mammalian hair cells do not. This will be important for future work, which will hopefully involve an investigation into the mechanism of protection, but was also an important consideration for experimental design. Zebrafish hair cells have been observed to begin regenerating (from supporting cells) as early as 24 hr post damage, although this length of time seems to extend with increased levels of damage (Hernandez et al., 2007). To ensure that regeneration did not interfere with our experiments, we ensured that all groups of larvae were treated for the same length of time with cisplatin and were imaged/assessed/sacrificed and fixed the same length of time after rinsing. This meant that we rinsed each group individually, then measured it immediately, to avoid capturing any potential regeneration. A sentence has been added to the Discussion to reflect this important detail.</p><p>âAnother important difference between human inner ear hair cells and zebrafish hair cells is that teleost hair cells (both lateral line and inner ear) regenerate, while mammalian hair cells do not (Monroe et al., 2015).

This section of the text has been amended to read:</p><p>âTreatment with any of these compounds may result in increased dopamine signalling.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Measurement of GFR in zebrafish: did the authors measure the effect of dopamine or mimosine alone on GFR?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we did not measure the effects of dopamine or L-mimosine alone on zebrafish GFR. Although we wanted to complete this experiment, we were unable to do so for technical reasons. As the reviewers noted in their summary, common cardinal vein injection is technically challenging and time consuming. Operation of the biosorter is also a technical task that requires special training. Since we used the biosorter to measure larval fluorescence immediately after injection and at 2 hours post-injection, the timeline made adding additional groups into the experiment impracticable.</p><p>Although we were not able to test the effects of the protective agents in vivo in the absence of cisplatin, we did measure the impact of the protective agents on HK-2 human proximal tubule cell viability. At both 24 hours and 48 hours post-treatment, there was no change in viability of HK-2 cells with either 0.01 or 0.03mM protective agent pretreatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors speculate that the protection against cisplatin toxicities may be somehow associated with the characteristics of the protective substances as member of dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission. However, trifluoperazine dihydrochloride is a D2-receptor antagonist and dopamine, of course, an agonist of D-receptors. For this reason, the association between dopaminergic actions and protection is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this type of claim on the surface may sound counterintuitive, but the action of a D2-like receptor antagonist may have similar activity as dopamine itself. Generally speaking, the D1-like class of receptors activate GÎ±<sub>s/olf</sub> family of G proteins, stimulating production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase (AC). The D2-like class couple with the GÎ±<sub>i/o</sub> family of G proteins, resulting in the inhibition of AC, decreasing cAMP production. Thus, a D2-like antagonist could have the same net effect of increasing cAMP production as a D1-like receptor agonist. However, it should also be noted that dopamine itself is a âdirtyâ neurotransmitter â meaning it can activate both D1 and D2-like dopamine receptor classes (Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011). We also recognize that this study did not undertake any mechanistic analysis, so as mentioned above, we have attempted to temper the language surrounding these claims.</p><p>We have also inserted a sentence in the Discussion that addresses this:</p><p>âAlthough this seems counterintuitive, the opposing effects of D1 vs. D2-like receptors means that a D2-like receptor antagonist might have the same net effect as a D1-agonist.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â One of the possible explanations of cisplatin oto- and nephrotoxicity is a specific interaction of cisplatin with organic cation transporters (OCTs), which are highly expressed in the sites of cisplatin unwanted toxicities. Since dopamine is a well-known substrate of OCTs, it is unclear why the authors did not comment this. There are studies demonstrating the expression of OCTs in the zebrafish kidneys and hair cells. This may be an important point to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. This fact has been added to the Discussion, as it definitely represents an area of interest.</p><p>The section that has been added is as follows:</p><p>âAnother point of interest is that organic anion transporter 2 (OCT2), the transporter that seems to play a role in cisplatin uptake into both renal tubule and cochlear cells, is also capable of transporting dopamine (Ciarimboli et al., 2010; Filipski et al, 2008; Filipski et al., 2009).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Please clarify whether the cisplatin dose range in neuromast and kidney tubule cells toxicity studies resembles the plasma/serum concentrations measured in paediatric cancer patients.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question and we would like to thank the reviewers for raising this issue. Studies of serum cisplatin concentrations suggest that levels peak quickly after administration, then decline rapidly (Rajkumar et al., 2016). However, human studies suggest that over the initial 24 hour period following administration, plasma levels range from approx. 1-10 Âµg/mL, which translates to 0.0033 mM-0.033mM. This is within the range of what we used experimentally.</p><p>We have added a line in the Discussion to emphasize this:</p><p>âHuman studies suggest that over the initial 24 hr period following administration, plasma cisplatin levels range from approx. 1-10 Âµg/mL, which translates to 0.0033 mM-0.033mM (Lanvers-Kaminsky et al., 2006; Rajkumar et al., 2016), well within the range of what we used experimentally.â</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>â The manuscript has been strongly improved. Even though an elucidation of the mechanisms explaining the observed protection is beyond the aims of this work, there is no mechanistic comment on the missing protection by dopamine and mimosine of cancer cells: the treatment of these cells with these substances did not change or even increased cisplatin cellular toxicity. It would be of interest to discuss a little bit this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this should be mentioned in the manuscript. Although we do not know the reason for the differences in protection (between non-cancer vs. cancer cells) at this time, we have added in a suggestion that the differences likely are a result of intrinsic cell-based differences. This now reads as follows:</p><p>âThis study presents in vitro evidence in three different cell lines that the protective compounds do not interfere with the anticancer effects of cisplatin. While the reason for the specific protective effects of these compounds in human proximal tubule cells and zebrafish pronephros, neuromast and inner ear structures is unknown at this time, it is likely a result of intrinsic differences between the cells themselves, potentially at the level of dopamine receptor subtype expression.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â I appreciate the authors adding some additional information about dopamine receptors. I would like an additional sentence or two tying their findings with dopamine and L-mimosine to what is known about dopaminergic signaling in the auditory periphery; why might increasing dopamine be protective?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence in the Discussion addressing this notion.</p><p>âAlthough the hypothesis that oto- and nephroprotection may be mediated by increased dopamine signaling still needs to be confirmed, it is possible that dopamine could bind to the D<sub>1</sub> or D<sub>5</sub> receptors present in the inner ear and/or pronephros structure, causing increases in intracellular cAMP, which seems to provide nephroprotection in some studies (Gillies et al., 2015; Hans et al., 1990; Palmieri et al., 1993) and cochlear nerve protection from noise-induced hearing damage (Darrow et al., 2007; Lendvai et al., 2011; Nouvian et al., 2001; Oestreicher et al., 1997).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â I still have concerns about the 35 C incubation temperature; zebrafish metabolism evolved to operate effectively at lower temperatures, not at human body temperature. I recognize that all experiments were conducted at 35 C and do not suggest rerunning experiments for the present manuscript, but I caution the authors to use species-specific temperatures for their future work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, and we both appreciate and understand this concern. This will be discussed further before proceeding with future studies.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Baxendale, S., and Whitfield, T. T. (2016).
