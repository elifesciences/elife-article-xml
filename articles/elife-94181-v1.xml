However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli),</italic> a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPR<sup>ER</sup> -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>We quickly learn to steer clear of eating the moldy apple, the foul-smelling piece of chicken or the leftovers that taste a little ‘off’. This survival instinct is shared across most animal species – even those with extremely simple and limited visual or taste systems, like the tiny worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Indeed, assessing the safety and quality of available food items can also rely on cells activating built-in cascades of molecular reactions. However, it remains unclear how these ‘cellular stress response programs’ actually help guide feeding behaviors.</p><p>To better understand this process, Liu et al. conducted a series of experiments using <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms exposed to heat-killed bacteria, which are devoid of many nutrients essential for growth. After initially consuming these bacteria, the worms quickly started to avoid feeding on this type of low-quality food. This suggests that mechanisms occurring after ingestion allowed the worms to adjust their feeding choices.</p><p>Further work showed that the consumption of heat-killed bacteria triggered two essential stress response pathways, known as the unfolded protein response and the innate immune response. The activation of these pathways was essential for the animals to be able to change their behavior and avoid the heat-killed bacteria. These biochemical pathways were particularly active in the worms’ nerve cells, highlighting the importance of these cells in sensing and reacting to food. Finally, Liu et al. also found that adding sugars like lactose and sucrose to the low-quality food could prevent the activation of the stress response pathways. This result suggests that specific nutrients play a central role in how these worms decide what to eat.</p><p>These findings shed light on the complex systems that ensure organisms consume the nutritious food they need to survive. Understanding these processes in worms can provide insights into the broader biological mechanisms that help animals avoid harmful food.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aversion behavior</kwd><kwd>UPR<sup>ER</sup></kwd><kwd>mmune response</kwd><kwd>food quality evaluation</kwd><kwd>food sensing</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0802100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Project at Southwest United Graduate School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202302AP370005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008871</institution-id><institution>Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202201AT070196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Talent Cultivation Plan of Yunnan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K264202230211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0803100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cellular stress response pathway helps animals evaluate food quality and regulate feeding behavior to adapt in nutrient-deficient environments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Food is essential for the survival, growth, and fitness of all animals. To adapt to fluctuating environments with a wide range of food sources, animals have developed a food evaluation system. This system enables them to identify nutrient-rich food and avoids low-quality or toxic food, thereby maximizing their survival prospects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Filosa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Florsheim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McLachlan et al., 2022</xref>). Various sensory neuron evaluation systems in animals has evolved to evaluate food quality through vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avery et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melin et al., 2019</xref>), olfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fiala, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McLachlan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sengupta et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Troemel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and gustatory senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hukema et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott, 2018</xref>). Besides these sensory systems that facilitate quick feeding decisions, animals may also initiate cellular stress response programs to detect nutrition/toxin and trigger food response behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones and Candido, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). This could be one of physiological food quality evaluation systems that monitor the nutritional status of consumed food. However, the signaling events in cellular stress responses involved in evaluating of specific nutrients and the mechanisms that connect these signaling activities to food behaviors are largely unexplored. More specifically, while cellular stress response through UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson et al., 2010</xref>) and PMK-1/p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2002</xref>)-dependent immunity in response to pathogens have been extensively studied, the functions of these cellular stress response in sensing and evaluating specific nutrients from food remain unclear.</p><p>Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that cannot be synthesized by humans due to the loss of a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carr and Maggini, 2017</xref>). Animals obtain vitamin C from their diet and possibly also from gut microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steinert et al., 2020</xref>). Vitamin C is an important physiological antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes. It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr and Frei, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Schellhorn, 2007</xref>). Vitamin C has been associated with various human diseases including scurvy, immune defect and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carr and Maggini, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, in animals, having robust food evaluation systems to detect vitamin C levels could significantly impact their survival in the wild. However, the potential involvement of the cellular stress response pathway in this food evaluation system for sensing and assessing vitamin C remains largely unexplored.</p><p>In this study, using the low-quality food evaluation assay system we established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qi et al., 2017</xref>), we elucidated the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. This pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>ER</sup>) - innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis. This mechanism promotes animals to leave low-quality food and is critical for their survival in nature environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low-quality food induces stress response in animals</title><p>Our previous studies have shown that Heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>), which lacks certain molecules, is considered a low-quality food that is unable to support animal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qi and Han, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qi et al., 2017</xref>).

The activation of UPR<sup>ER</sup>, specifically in the nervous system, has been shown to promote changes in feeding and foraging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Özbey et al., 2020</xref>).

It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr and Frei, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Schellhorn, 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, VC helps animals to protect neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moritz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice, 2000</xref>), defend excessive immune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maggini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Webb and Villamor, 2007</xref>), and inhibit inflammatory and ER stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Su et al., 2019</xref> in order to better survive. The synthesis of vitamin C (VC) occurs through the glucuronate pathway, utilizing D-glucose as a precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patananan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yabuta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This led us to investigate whether the vitamin C biosynthesis pathway is involved in evaluating low-quality food by using D-glucose. In this study, we found that animals feeding live <italic>E. coli</italic>, which should produce more VC, exhibit higher glucose levels. However, our results show that animals maintain similar VC levels when fed ideal food (live <italic>E. coli</italic>) compared to low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that animals do not stimulate VC biosynthesis under favorable food conditions. In contrast, when animals are fed low-quality food (HK-OP50), we found that supplementing D-GlcA in HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>E. coli-yfbR</italic> mutation can improve VC levels and inhibit UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data indicate that glucose boosts the animal’s ability to adapt to unfavorable food environments by increasing VC levels, but not in favorable food conditions.</p><p>Unlike the sensory neuron evaluation system, which permits rapid feeding decisions through smell and taste, the cellular stress response as physiological food evaluation system describe here requires a slow and multi-step signal transduction process after the ingestion of food. The disruption of cellular homeostasis by ingested of low-quality or toxic food can activate stress response mechanisms that both increase the cellular ability to withstand and adapt to this disruption of homeostasis and promote behavioral strategies to avoid these conditions and lessen their impact on the organism. These cellular stress response mechanisms include heat shock response, unfolded protein response, oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Özbey et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, this slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by quick sensory nervous system.</p><p>One limitation of our study is the lack of explanation for why HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> activates UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity. We hypothesized that when heat-killed, HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> may lack or contain altered levels of certain metabolites that either activate or inhibit UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity, respectively. Additionally, we speculated that <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants killed by heat may lack metabolites that activate UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity, or conversely, have increased levels of metabolites that inhibit these pathways. Fortunately, our investigation led to the discovery of the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant <italic>yfbR</italic>, which inhibits UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immunity by increasing carbohydrates that aid in resisting these stress pathways. Moving forward, we intend to further explore the intricate relationship between HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and UPR<sup>ER</sup>-immunity. This will be a key focus of our future research efforts.</p><p>Collectively, this study uncovers the unexpected function of UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) as a physiological food evaluation system for evaluating and sensing food quality in animals. It also highlights the utility of the HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> (low-quality food) - <italic>C. elegans</italic> interaction as a means to dissect the mechanism of food evaluation system in assessing food. Most importantly, it reveals that animals are capable of altering their nutrient (Vitamin C) levels through in vivo synthesis or food intake to adapt to a poor food environment when better food choices are not available.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and maintenance</title><p>Nematode stocks were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with bacteria (<italic>E. coli OP50</italic>) at 20 °C.</p><p>(1) The following strains/alleles were obtained from the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC) or as indicated:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>N2 Bristol (wild type control strain);</p></list-item><list-item><p>AU78: <italic>agIs219 [T24B8.5p::GFP::unc-54 3' UTR +Pttx-3::GFP::unc-54 3' UTR]</italic>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>SJ4005: <italic>zcIs4 [Phsp-4::GFP]</italic>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>AY101: <italic>acIs101 [F35E12.5p::GFP +rol-6(su1006)]</italic>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>SJ17: <italic>xbp-1 (zc12</italic>);</p></list-item><list-item><p>KU25: <italic>pmk-1(km25</italic>);</p></list-item><list-item><p>AY102: <italic>pmk-1(km25) IV; acEx102 [Pvha-6::pmk-1::GFP +rol-6(su1006)]</italic>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>YNU108: <italic>Ex[Prgef-1::pmk-1::GFP; Podr-1::RFP]</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geng et al., 2022</xref>);</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>xbp-1(tm2482</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2011</xref>);</p></list-item><list-item><p>KU21：<italic>kgb-1(km21</italic>);</p></list-item><list-item><p>AU133: <italic>agIs17 [Pmyo-2::mCherry +Pirg-1::GFP] IV</italic>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>SJ4100: <italic>zcIs13 [Phsp-6::GFP +lin-15(+)]</italic>.</p></list-item></list><p>(2) The following strains were constructed by this study:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>YNU242: <italic>xbp-1(tm2482); pmk-1(km25</italic>) double mutant was constructed by crossing: <italic>xbp-1(tm2482</italic>) with KU25[<italic>pmk-1(km25</italic>)].</p></list-item><list-item><p>YNU240: <italic>ylfEx149 [xbp-1(tm2482); Prgef-1::xbp-1::GFP; Podr-1::RFP]</italic> transgene strain was constructed by injecting plasmid <italic>Prgef-1::xbp-1::GFP</italic> with <italic>Podr-1::RFP</italic> in <italic>xbp-1(tm2482</italic>) background</p></list-item><list-item><p>YNU241: <italic>ylfEx150 [xbp-1(tm2482); Pges-1::xbp-1::GFP; Podr-1::RFP]</italic> transgene strain was constructed by injecting plasmid P<italic>ges-1:xbp-1::GFP</italic> with <italic>Podr-1::RFP</italic> in <italic>xbp-1(tm2482</italic>) background</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><italic>E. coli-</italic>OP50, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa-PA14</italic>, <italic>E. coli-</italic>K12 (BW25113), and <italic>E. coli</italic>-K12 mutant were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium.

They find that HK food activates two canonical stress pathways, ER-UPR and innate immunity, in the nervous system to promote food aversion. Through the creative use of <italic>E. coli</italic> genetics and metabolomics, the authors provide evidence that the altered carbohydrate content of HK food is the trigger for the activation of these stress responses and that supplementation of HK food with sugars (or their biosynthetic product, vitamin C), reduces stress pathway induction and food avoidance. This work makes a valuable addition to the literature on metabolite detection as a mechanism for evaluation of nutritional value; it also provides some new insight into physiologically relevant roles of well-known stress pathways in modulating behavior.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-The work addresses an important question by focusing on understanding how the nervous system evaluates food quality and couples this to behavioral change.</p><p>-The work takes full advantage of the tools available in this powerful system and builds on extensive previous studies on feeding behavior and stress responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>-Creative use of <italic>E. coli</italic> genetics and metabolite profiling enabled identification of carbohydrate metabolism as a candidate source of food-quality signals.</p><p>-For the most part, the studies are rigorous and logically designed, providing good support for the authors' model.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-The authors' claim that they can detect induction of hsp-4 and irg-5 expression in neurons (Fig 1-S2A) requires further support. The two tail cells shown are quite a bit larger than would by typically expected for neurons. The rescue they observe by neuronal expression is largely convincing, so it's quite possible that these pathways do indeed function in neurons, but that their level of induction in the nervous system is below reporter detection limits (or is 'swamped out' by much higher levels of expression in the intestine).</p><p>-The authors conclude that &quot;the induction of Pirg-5::GFP was abolished in pmk-1 knockdown animals fed with HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>&quot; (Fig 2D). Because a negative control for induction (e.g., animals fed with control <italic>E. coli</italic>) is not shown, this conclusion must be regarded as tentative.</p><p>-The effect sizes in the food-preference assay shown in Figure 5 are extremely small and do not provide strong support for the strong conclusions about the role of stress response pathways in food preference behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94181.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Animals can evaluate food quality in many ways. In contrast to the rapid sensory evaluation with smell and taste, the mechanism of slow nutrient sensation and its impact on food choice is unexplored. The authors utilize <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae and their bacterial food as an elegant model to tackle this question and reveal the detailed molecular mechanism to avoid nutrient-poor foods.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The strength of this study is that they identified the molecular identities of the critical players in bacterial food and <italic>C. elegans</italic> using unbiased approaches, namely metabolome analysis, <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant screening, and RNA sequencing. Furthermore, they strengthened their findings by thorough experiments combining multiple methods such as genetics, fluorescent reporter analysis, and Western blot.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>The major caveat of this study is the reporter genes; specifically, transcriptional reporters used to monitor the UPRER and immune responses in the intestine of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, their tissue-specific rescue experiments suggest that the genes in the UPRER and immune response function in the neurons. Thus, we should carefully interpret the results of the reporter genes. Another point to be aware of is that although they show that lack of carbohydrates elicits the response to &quot;low-quality&quot; food, carbohydrate supplementation with heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> was insufficient to support animal growth.</p><p>Overall, this work provides convincing data to support their model.

They find that HK food activates two canonical stress pathways, ER-UPR, and innate immunity, in the nervous system to promote food aversion. Through the creative use of <italic>E. coli</italic> genetics and metabolomics, the authors provide evidence that the altered carbohydrate content of HK food is the trigger for the activation of these stress responses and that supplementation of HK food with sugars (or their biosynthetic product, vitamin C), reduces stress pathway induction and food avoidance. This work makes a valuable addition to the literature on metabolite detection as a mechanism for the evaluation of nutritional value; it also provides some new insight into the physiologically relevant roles of well-known stress pathways in modulating behavior.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-The work addresses an important question by focusing on understanding how the nervous system evaluates food quality and couples this with behavioral change. -The work takes full advantage of the tools available in this powerful system and builds on extensive previous studies on feeding behavior and stress responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>-Creative use of <italic>E. coli</italic> genetics and metabolite profiling enabled the identification of carbohydrate metabolism as a candidate source of food-quality signals.</p><p>-For the most part, the studies are rigorous and logically designed, providing good support for the authors' model.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply appreciate the reviewer's insightful assessment of our study's strengths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-It is not clear how the mechanism identified here is connected to previously described, related processes.

Further, the specificity of the ability of sugar/vitamin C to suppress stress pathway induction is unclear (i.e., does sugar/vitamin C have any effect on the activation of these pathways through other means?). Additionally, the relationship of this pathway to the vitamin B2-sensing mechanism previously described by the senior author is unclear. These issues do not weaken confidence in the authors' conclusions, but they do reduce the potential significance of the work.</p><p>(1) In particular, it is not clear whether this mechanism has a role in the detection of other low-quality foods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. In response to your inquiry, we investigated whether the UPRER (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis is specific to evaluating low-quality food (HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>) or if it plays a broader role in food detection.</p><p>We conducted behavioral assays using N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant animals fed with normal <italic>E. coli</italic> food, inedible food (<italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>)4, and pathogenic food (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa-PA14</italic>)5. We found that N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit avoidance behavior when presented with normal food (OP50). However, both N2 and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms were able to escape from inedible food (N2 was predominantly found on the border areas of the bacterial lawn and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms on border and in), <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit this avoidance behavior. Notably, N2 and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms exhibited even more pronounced avoidance behavior when exposed to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms were more susceptible to infection by this pathogen (Figure 2-figure supplement 2C). These findings suggest that the UPR-Immunity pathway plays a crucial role in helping animals avoid low-quality food (HK-E. coli) by triggering an avoidance response. In contrast, the Innate immunity pathway, mediated by PMK-1/p38 MAPK, appears to play a key role in evaluating unfavorable food sources, such as HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and helping animals avoid these environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Further, the specificity of the ability of sugar/vitamin C to suppress stress pathway induction is unclear (i.e., does sugar/vitamin C have any effect on the activation of these pathways through other means?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your inquiry regarding the specificity of the ability of sugar/vitamin C to suppress stress pathway induction.

For example, the rationale for screening the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant library is that some mutants, when heat-killed, may be missing a metabolite that induces the ER-UPR. A more straightforward hypothesis might be that some mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains aberrantly induce the ER-UPR when *not* heat-killed, because they are missing a metabolite that prevents stress pathway induction. This is not in itself a major concern, but it would be useful for the authors to provide a rationale for their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insightful suggestion. We acknowledge the importance of providing a clear rationale for our hypotheses in the paper. In response to this feedback, we have enhanced the discussion section to better elucidate the rationale behind our hypotheses.</p><p>One limitation of our study is the lack of explanation for why HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> activates UPRER and immunity. We hypothesized that when heat-killed, HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> may lack or contain altered levels of certain metabolites that either activate or inhibit UPRER and immunity, respectively. Additionally, we speculated that <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants killed by heat may lack metabolites that activate UPRER and immunity, or conversely, have increased levels of metabolites that inhibit these pathways.</p><p>Fortunately, our investigation led to the discovery of the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant <italic>yfbR</italic>, which inhibits UPRER and immunity by increasing carbohydrates that aid in resisting these stress pathways. Moving forward, we intend to further explore the intricate relationship between HK-<italic>E. coli</italic> and UPRER-immunity. This will be a key focus of our future research efforts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The authors do not provide any explanation for some unexpected results from the <italic>E. coli</italic> screen. Earlier in the paper, the authors found that innate immune signaling is downstream of ER-UPR activation. However, of the 20 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants that, when heat-killed, &quot;did not induce... the UPR-ER reporter,&quot; 9 of them still activate the innate immune response. This seems at odds with the authors' simple model since it suggests that low-quality food can induce innate immune signaling independently of the ER-UPR. Further, only one of the 9 has an effect on behavior, even though failure to activate the innate immune pathway might be expected to lead to a behavioral defect in all of these.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your understanding, and we apologize for any confusion caused by our earlier statement. To provide clarification, our study revealed that out of the 20 <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants examined, none activated the UPRER. Among these mutants, 9 did not induce immunity, and interestingly, one out of these 9 mutants demonstrated the ability to inhibit avoidance behavior.</p><p>This diversity in phenotypic outcomes can be attributed to the varied metabolites present in different <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants. To thoroughly evaluate the effects of these mutants, we conducted a comprehensive three-step screening process, utilizing UPRER marker, immunity marker, and avoidance behavior assays.</p><p>Through this rigorous approach, we identified the <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant, <italic>yfbR</italic>, which exhibited the desired inhibitory effects on UPRER, immunity, and avoidance behavior.</p><p>Subsequently, we conducted a metabolomics analysis of various food qualities (HK-K12, HK-<italic>yfbR</italic>, and Live-K12).

We found that N2, <italic>pmk-1</italic>, and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms did not exhibit avoidance behavior when presented with normal food (OP50). However, both <italic>N2</italic> and <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms were able to escape from inedible food, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms did not show this avoidance. Notably, <italic>xbp-1</italic> mutant worms exhibited even more pronounced avoidance behavior when exposed to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, whereas <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant worms were more susceptible to infection by this pathogen (Figure 2-figure supplement 2C). These findings suggest that the UPR-Immunity pathway plays a crucial role in helping animals avoid low-quality food by triggering an avoidance response. In contrast, the Innate immunity pathway, which is mediated by PMK-1/p38 MAPK, appears to play a key role in evaluating unfavorable food sources, such as HK-<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Saprophytic staphylococci</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and helping animals avoid these environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3C-F: The magnitude of the changes between conditions shown in these panels is small.

As intestinal fluorescence (<italic>Phsp-4::GFP</italic> or <italic>Pirg-5::GFP</italic>) is easy observation and scoring, the further analyses were done in the intestine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I have concerns about the interpretation of the p-PMK-1 data. Although the authors described that &quot;p-PMK-1 is prominently increased&quot; in the text (Line 150), it is unclear on the data (Figure 2E). Similarly, the authors' statement &quot;p-PMK-1 is decreased in animals with D-GlcA (F)..&quot; was not fully supported by the data in Figure 4F. The experiment should be repeated and quantified. Moreover, pPMK-1 showed single bands in Figure 2E, but double bands in Figure 3G, 4F, and 4G. The authors should explain why that is the case and which band we should look at for Figures 3G, 4F, and 4G.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer’s suggestion, we also repeated some of the western. We found that after longer expose, there are two bands for pPMK-1 (Figure 2E, new data; and “raw-data WB” file). The VHP-1 phosphatase is known to inhibit PMK-13. In our previous study, we found that worms treated with <italic>vhp-1</italic>(RNAi), which hyperactivates p-PMK-1 (lower band) 4. In contrast, the two bands are disappeared in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant (Author response image 4). Thus, the lower band indicates the pPMK-1. We now replace the Figure 2E and quantified relative intensity of pPMK-1/tublin.
