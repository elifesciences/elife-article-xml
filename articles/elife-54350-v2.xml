Remarkably, to date only a single subtype of inhibitory neuron has been documented in the VCN, a projection neuron termed the D-stellate cell. With the use of a transgenic mouse line, optical clearing, and imaging techniques, combined with electrophysiological tools, we revealed a population of glycinergic cells in the VCN distinct from the D-stellate cell. These multipolar glycinergic cells were smaller in soma size and dendritic area, but over ten-fold more numerous than D-stellate cells. They were activated by auditory nerve and T-stellate cells, and made local inhibitory synaptic contacts on principal cells of the VCN. Given their abundance, combined with their narrow dendritic fields and axonal projections, it is likely that these neurons, here termed L-stellate cells, play a significant role in frequency-specific processing of acoustic signals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>cell types</kwd><kwd>glycine</kwd><kwd>cochlear nucleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS028901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trussell</surname><given-names>Laurence O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC004450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trussell</surname><given-names>Laurence O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30NS061800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trussell</surname><given-names>Laurence O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emerging Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ngodup</surname><given-names>Tenzin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romero</surname><given-names>Gabriel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS116798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trussell</surname><given-names>Laurence O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A major new class of neuronal cell type has been discovered in the auditory system, having features that make it a critical component of auditory processing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), auditory nerve (AN) afferents make synapses onto multiple subtypes of excitatory neurons, setting up parallel streams of processing that are used by higher centers for processing auditory cues for sound intensity, frequency, and localization. This early-level activity of excitatory neurons is sculpted and stabilized by inhibitory neurons, which use the transmitter glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschuler et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wenthold et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu and Oertel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferragamo et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanda and Xu-Friedman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xie and Manis, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie and Manis, 2014</xref>). For example, glycinergic inputs onto excitatory bushy and T-stellate (i.e., <underline>T</underline>rapezoid body projecting) cells enhance acoustic tuning properties and temporal precision, and stabilize neuronal firing responses to acoustic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caspary et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gai and Carney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). However, the sources of these inhibitory glycinergic inputs onto the principal cells in the VCN are not well understood.</p><p>Within the VCN, only a single glycinergic inhibitory cell type, called the D-stellate or radiate multipolar cell, has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oertel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sento and Ryugo, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oertel et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doucet and Ryugo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oertel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie and Manis, 2014</xref>). D-stellate (i.e., <underline>D</underline>orsal projecting) cells are a small population of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doucet and Ryugo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doucet et al., 1999</xref>) that send their axons to the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Rhode, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oertel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campagnola and Manis, 2014</xref>) but also to sites as distant as the contralateral cochlear nucleus (CN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schofield and Cant, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Needham and Paolini, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, D-stellate cells provide broadband inhibition to their targets, as their large dendritic arbors receive input from a broad frequency spectrum of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Rhode, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oertel et al., 1990</xref>). Another source of inhibition in VCN is a projection neuron originating in the DCN, the tuberculoventral cells (also called vertical cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wickesberg and Oertel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wickesberg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xie and Manis, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campagnola and Manis, 2014</xref>). Recent studies suggest that D-stellate and tuberculoventral cells do not fully account for the inhibition observed in VCN principal cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campagnola and Manis, 2014</xref>). Indeed, no local inhibitory interneuron has ever been described for VCN, which is unlike most known brain regions. Early anatomical studies suggested the presence of short axon cells in the VCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lorente de Nó, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, previous histological studies also reported the presence of small inhibitory neurons (glycinergic or possibly GABAergic) that are different from the D-stellate cells, but the identity of such neurons is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wenthold, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doucet and Ryugo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleich and Vater, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doucet et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Here we comprehensively examined the diversity of inhibitory neurons in the VCN using a well-characterized transgenic mouse line, GlyT2-GFP, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeilhofer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore and Trussell, 2017</xref>) which labels virtually all glycinergic neurons in the CN. With the use of this transgenic mouse, as well as optical tissue clearing, whole CN super-resolution microscopy, electrophysiological, and morphological tools, we discovered a large population of inhibitory glycinergic cell types distinct from the D-stellate cell. The novel glycinergic neurons, which have a narrower dendritic field than D-stellate cells, form the vast majority of inhibitory neurons in the VCN. We show that these cells, which we have termed L-stellate cells, receive monosynaptic ANF inputs and polysynaptic inputs from axon collaterals of T-stellate cells, and in turn locally inhibit bushy and T-stellate cells in the VCN. Thus, the VCN has a rich diversity of glycinergic interneurons to provide maximum flexibility to control the excitability of projection neurons in the VCN.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell counts and soma size</title><p>We used a well-characterized GlyT2-GFP transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeilhofer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore and Trussell, 2017</xref>) in order to study the prevalence of glycinergic cells in the VCN. The neuronal glycine transporter, GlyT2, is a reliable marker of glycinergic cells, and GFP is selectively expressed in &gt;90% of glycinergic cells in the CN. To visualize all the glycinergic cells, we optically cleared whole CN (450–500 μm) using CUBIC-mount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Next, we imaged the entire CN, lateral to medial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a series of 50 μm thick image stacks of CN, lateral to medial. Not surprisingly, we observed a dense population of glycinergic cells in the DCN as described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oertel and Wu, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang and Oertel, 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang and Oertel, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apostolides and Trussell, 2014</xref>). Also apparent were thick tracts of glycinergic fibers that entered the dorsal part of VCN, presumably projections of the glycinergic tuberculoventral neurons (vertical cells) in the DCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). There was an obvious lack of glycinergic cells in the octopus cell region of the posterior VCN, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wickesberg and Oertel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wickesberg et al., 1991</xref>). However, we found a large population of glycinergic cells distributed across the rest of the VCN. To obtain a global view of their distribution, the images were stitched and combined to create a 3D image of the entire CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bi, ii</xref>). The high density of glycinergic cells throughout VCN was surprising, because D-stellate cells are thought to be sparse, and the only other known glycinergic cells are Golgi cells, which are present mainly in the granule cell layer overlying VCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferragamo et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yaeger and Trussell, 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diversity of glycinergic cell population in the CN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Entire CN was optically cleared using CUBIC-mount and imaged with a super-resolution confocal microscope.

Interestingly, RNA probes against the <italic>Slc6a5</italic> gene (GlyT2) also clearly reveal both large and small glycinergic cells types in VCN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/69874024">https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/69874024</ext-link>).</p><p>To study the existence of multiple glycinergic sources, we took an intersectional approach to test whether the population of glycinergic neurons in VCN consists of molecularly distinct glycinergic cell types. We used a somatostatin-Cre (SST-Cre) mouse line that has been used to identify and study somatostatin-containing neurons in the brain. An SST-Cre::Ai9 mouse line expresses tdTomato in a variety of neurons in the VCN. This mouse line was crossed to the GlyT2-GFP mouse line. In the resulting cross, large GFP-positive cells were clearly positive for tdTomato; given their size, these are candidate D-stellate cells, and this inference was confirmed by experiments described below on commissural projections.</p><p>However, closer examination revealed that the majority of the GFP positive cells were tdTomato-negative and thus formed a size class distinct from the double-labeled cells presumed to be D-stellate cells. GFP and tdTomato fluorescence was amplified with antibodies to ensure the visualization of cells with lower expression (n = 3 VCN, two mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). There was a strong correlation between GFP and tdTomato expression in presumptive D-stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, top row). By contrast, smaller cells that were GFP positive were clearly tdTomato negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom row). Thus, the small glycinergic cells were molecularly distinct from the larger D-stellate cells in that only the latter expressed Cre in this mouse line.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>D-stellate cells are molecularly distinct from the small glycinergic cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coronal section of a CN from an SST-tdTomato::GlyT2-GFP mouse.

CNs from SST-tdTomato::GlyT2-GFP mice were optically cleared using the CUBIC-mount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ai–iii</xref>). We then separately measured the soma volumes of glycinergic cells expressing GFP only and D-stellate cells expressing both GFP and tdTomato using the surface function in Imaris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi–v</xref>). We found a broad distribution of soma size of double-labeled, D-stellate cells. This suggest that soma size alone is not a predictive indicator of cell class. However, we found that on average double-labeled cells were significantly larger than GFP-only cells (average soma volume, GFP only, 1826.6 ± 12.9 μm<sup>3</sup> versus D-stellate cells, 4289.5 ± 98.3 μm<sup>3</sup>, n = 2 VCNs, two mice).

Large cells exhibited typical radiate morphology which have been described previously for D-stellate cells in the VCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oertel et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campagnola and Manis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie and Manis, 2014</xref>) (n = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and henceforth will be referred to as D-stellate cells. Unlike D-stellate cells, the small glycinergic cells had restricted axonal and dendritic arbors (n = 17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The spread of the axonal-dendritic field was quantified by measuring the longest and shortest axis of the reconstructed structures. The small glycinergic cells had significantly restricted branched processes compared with D-stellate cells (longest axis: D-stellate cells, 619.42 ± 45.78 μm versus small cells, 271.43 ± 26.27 μm, p&lt;0.001, t-test; shorter axis: D-stellate cells, 435.62 ± 1.82 μm, n = 6 cells versus small cells, 148.60 ± 12.03 μm, n = 17, p&lt;0.001, t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We also measured the volume and surface area under the axonal-dendritic field assessed by its convex hull, and found that the field encompassed by D-stellate cell processes had a larger volume and surface area than that of small glycinergic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).

Our morphological data indicate that smaller glycinergic cells are anatomically distinct from D-stellate cell types and provide further evidence that small glycinergic cells are a distinct class of inhibitory neuron. Finally, we compared the morphology of small glycinergic cells with excitatory T-stellate (planar) cells, defined as non-GFP containing, dendritic neurons with chopper firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We found that small glycinergic cells have a similar spread of the axonal-dendritic field in the longest axis but significantly larger spread in the shortest axis (longest axis: T-stellate cells, 237.03 ± 16.67 μm versus small cells, 271.43 ± 26.27 μm, p=0.33, t<italic>-</italic>test; shorter axis: T-stellate cells, 79.73 ± 13.68 μm versus small cells, 148.60 ± 12.03 μm, p&lt;0.005, t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

The presence of peaks with different latencies suggests that the small cells also receive polysynaptic excitation from neurons located within the brain slice. Specifically, the first EPSC always had a short synaptic latency consistent with a monosynaptic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, black arrowheads), but this was often followed by EPSCs two or more ms later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, gray arrowheads).

Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujino and Oertel, 2001</xref> showed that T-stellate cells can be excited by the cholinergic agonist carbachol. We reasoned that if T-stellate cells are responsible for the delayed EPSCs, the frequency of those EPSCs should be increased if the T-stellate cells were made more excitable with carbachol. To test this idea, carbachol (10 μM) was bath applied while monitoring spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) from small GFP-positive cells. We observed a significant increase in the amplitude and frequency of sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>), as expected if the T-stellate cells were firing spontaneously. In order to test the role of local collaterals in the delayed events, we recorded EPSCs in small GFP-positive cells evoked by AN root stimulation. A representative recording with 10 superimposed traces is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>. In this cell, we observed a first EPSC with a short latency (&lt;1 ms) followed by events with longer latencies (&gt;2 ms). Carbachol (10 μM) was then bath applied and EPSCs were recorded in response to the same AN root stimulation strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The latencies and numbers of EPSC were quantified and displayed as raster and PSTH plots (1-ms bin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–J</xref>). Across multiple cells (n = 5), there was no significant increase in the number of EPSCs with a latency &lt;1 ms (percentage increase from control = 17.57 ± 0.11%). By contrast, we observed a significant increase in the number of events with longer latencies (percentage increase from control = 92.00 ± 0.13%). These results strongly suggest that the local collaterals from T-stellates are the source of polysynaptic excitatory inputs onto the small glycinergic cells.</p><p>Next, we examined the projections of the small GFP-positive neurons.

To test this, we first tried paired-recordings between small cells and principal cells of the VCN, however, out of 40 paired-recordings, we found only a single successful pairing which a GFP-positive small cell generated IPSCs in a non-fluorescent VCN neuron. As the yield was so low we used a different approach. Interestingly, we have found that a subset (9/15) of the small GFP-positive cells can be activated by bath application of carbachol (10 μM; n = 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Carbachol sensitive and insensitive small cells did not differ in intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To examine whether the small cells provide inhibition to principal cells in the VCN, we enhanced their excitability by bath application of carbachol (10 μM) and recorded inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from bushy cells and T-stellate cells in the presence of excitatory synaptic blockers (10 μM NBQX, 5 μM MK-801). Carbachol application produced a clear increase in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in both bushy and T-stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D and E</xref>) (inter-event interval, control = 280.4 ± 47.6 ms versus carbachol = 191.2 ± 29.0 ms, p&lt;0.02, t-test, n = 18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>). The identity of the principal cells as both bushy and T-stellate cells were confirmed using their sIPSC kinetics. The decay time course of the sIPSCs (bushy cell, τ = 7.22 ± 1.40 ms, n = 9, T-stellate, τ = 2.28 ± 0.07 ms, n = 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F–I</xref>), consistent with cell-specific kinetics reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xie and Manis, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie and Manis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin and Xie, 2019</xref>). Thus, the small GFP-positive, glycinergic cells likely act as local interneurons.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Local stellate cells (L-cells) provide local inhibition to primary cells in the VCN.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Representative responses to cholinergic agonist (carbachol, 10 μM) by small (L-cells) (<bold>A</bold>), D-stellate (<bold>B</bold>), tuberculoventral (TV) cells (<bold>C</bold>).

Given their <underline>L</underline>ocal projections, we term the small, multipolar glycinergic cells ‘L-stellate cells’. This study used transgenic animals, combined with molecular, morphological, and electrophysiological techniques to show that the L-stellate cells are molecularly, anatomically, and electrophysiologically distinct from the well-studied, D-stellate cell types. Moreover, L-stellate cells constitute the vast majority of glycinergic cells in the VCN. They receive monosynaptic AN inputs and feedforward excitatory inputs from local T-stellate cells, and their axons appear to inhibit principal excitatory cells, bushy cells, and T-stellate cells of the VCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Therefore, the VCN has a distinct population of glycinergic interneurons that likely play a unique role in auditory processing.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Summary of circuitry in the VCN.</title><p>Neurons in the VCN including principal excitatory cells (T-stellate and bushy cells) and inhibitory cells (D-stellate and L-stellate cells) receive excitatory input from the auditory nerve (AN).

Therefore, diverse inhibitory cell types would be anticipated to exist in the VCN, one of the first stations of auditory signal processing. Thus, the VCN seemed quite different from this norm in that its only documented inhibitory cell, the D-stellate cell, is a projection neuron. Although previous staining and reconstruction studies have hinted at additional small, potentially local glycinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lorente de Nó, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wenthold, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doucet and Ryugo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleich and Vater, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doucet et al., 1999</xref>), it has been a challenge to identify such cells based only on morphological and electrophysiological features. Due to their size, small cells are generally not targeted well for cell-filling procedures, especially <italic>in vivo</italic>. Electrophysiologically, the glycinergic L-stellate cells fire regularly, similar to excitatory T-stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oertel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhode et al., 1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oertel et al., 2011</xref>), and thus could have occasionally been mistaken for T-stellate cells.</p><p>Morphological and electrophysiological features provide an initial platform for further classification of interneurons. When these approaches are applied to transgenic animals expressing different molecular markers in inhibitory cell types, a clearer systematic classification system can emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuzik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). In the SST-tdTomato::GlyT2-GFP line, large D-stellate cell types express both GFP and tdTomato, whereas smaller L-stellate cell types were only GFP-positive.</p><p>Although we have identified two major glycinergic interneuron populations, further studies may reveal additional diversity within the groups described in this paper. Our anatomical data show a variety of somatic, dendritic, and axonal morphologies within the L-stellate cell types. Electrophysiologically, L-stellate cell types display heterogeneity in their membrane properties, likely a consequence of diverse ion channel expression. We also found that only a subset of L-stellate cells was sensitive to the cholinergic agonist, carbachol. Previous studies have reported that medial olivocochlear axons may make synaptic contacts with T-stellate cells and small unidentified cells in the VCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benson and Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujino and Oertel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oertel and Fujino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mellott et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to major cholinergic projections from the superior olivary complex, a substantial cholinergic input into CN is also reported from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) and the latero-dorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mellott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schofield et al., 2011</xref>). Cholinergic inputs to CN have been proposed to improve frequency selectivity, improve sound detection, or improve speech in noisy backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Winslow and Sachs, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Winslow and Sachs, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawase et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujino and Oertel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulders et al., 2002</xref>). As some L-stellate cells were activated by bath application of carbachol, this suggests that the L-stellate cells might also receive inputs from cholinergic sources. L-cells may provide feedforward inhibition to control the excitability of T-stellate cells and bushy cells thereby regulating the signal detection in a noisy background. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis will likely allow further definition of subpopulations of glycinergic interneurons in the VCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuzik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Local inhibitory inputs in the VCN</title><p>In comparison to D-stellate cells, L-stellate cells had smaller soma sizes and exhibited tightly branched axons and dendrites. These restricted dendritic and axonal processes suggest that L-stellate cells have narrow frequency-band receptive fields. This morphology is very different from the D-stellate cell, which has been termed the ‘wide-band inhibitor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelken and Young, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnott et al., 2004</xref>). The potential for narrow band excitation of the L-stellate cells could provide a means for inhibition to excitatory cells in nearby isofrequency lamina in VCN. Indeed, when we activated the smaller L-stellate cells with carbachol, we recorded IPSCs from both bushy and T-stellate cells. This provides evidence that L-stellate cells could in principle mediate side-band inhibition. Inhibition has been proposed to improve tuning properties and temporal precision, and stabilizes neuronal firing responses to acoustic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gai and Carney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). Indeed, as the D-stellate cells are numerically a minority of the glycinergic VCN cell population compared to the L-stellate cells, we propose that the majority of local inhibitory inputs onto excitatory neurons could originate from L-stellate cells.</p><p>D-stellate cells send their axons to the DCN and also project to contralateral VCN via the commissural pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schofield and Cant, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doucet and Ryugo, 2006</xref>). The commissural D-stellate cell connects ipsi- and contralateral CN. Previous tract tracing studies in rat reported a presence of small commissural glycinergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doucet and Ryugo, 2006</xref>), but we did not observe any L-stellate cells retrogradely labelled in our mouse study, consistent with a locally restricted axonal arbor. However, our cell-filling experiments only sampled a subset of cells, and it remains possible that some L-stellate cells also project outside the VCN, perhaps to the ipsilateral DCN or the granule cell region. Indeed, many L-stellate cells were located near the margins of VCN, near granule cell regions. These could be the small multipolar marginal cells described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doucet and Ryugo, 2006</xref>. As inhibitory Golgi cells are located in and near the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mugnaini et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferragamo et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yaeger and Trussell, 2015</xref>), it is possible that some L-stellate cells were Golgi cells.</p><p>In addition to local glycinergic sources, VCN receives projecting glycinergic inputs from the tuberculoventral cells of the DCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wickesberg and Oertel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wickesberg and Oertel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wickesberg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xie and Manis, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campagnola and Manis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muniak and Ryugo, 2014</xref>). Tuberculoventral cells have narrow frequency-receptive fields and project to a tonotopically matched region in the VCN. Therefore, tuberculoventral cells have been proposed to provide narrow band inhibition, but at present, it is unclear whether the local glycinergic inputs from L-stellate cells and the long-range inputs from tuberculoventral cells play different roles in sculpting the responses of the excitatory VCN neurons. Conceivably, VCN principal cells could receive input from both subtypes of interneuron, and the differential activation and modulation of those interneurons could aid in fine tuning auditory processing under different conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Sucrose solution contained (in mM) 76 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 75 sucrose, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>: 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.8, 305 mOsm). Parasagittal slices of CN were cut at a slight angle from sagittal, to best preserve a straight projection of the AN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ngodup et al., 2015</xref>). The slices of CN were cut at 220–300 μm in ice-cold sucrose solution on a vibratome (Leica VT1200S or Campden 7000smz-2). Slices were transferred into standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 20 glucose, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 Na-pyruvate, and 0.4 Na L-ascorbate, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>:5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4, 300–310 mOsm). Slices recovered at 34°C for 40 min and were maintained at room temperature until recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused with standard ACSF (~34°C). Cells were viewed using an Olympus BX51WI microscope with a 60× objective, equipped with an infrared Dodt contrast, CCD camera (Retiga 2000R, QImaging), and fluorescence optics. In slices from GlyT2-GFP, glycinergic cells in the VCN were identified by their GFP expression. Recording pipettes were pulled from 1.5 mm OD, 0.84 mm ID borosilicate glass (WPI-1B150-F) to a resistance of 2–4 MΩ using a horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument P97). The internal recording solution contained in (mM) 113 K gluconate, 2.75 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.75 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 14 Tris<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, 9 HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.25 with KOH, mOsm adjusted to 290 with sucrose (E<sub>Cl</sub>−84 mV). For a few voltage-clamp experiments, we used an internal solution containing (in mM) 115 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Tris-GTP, 5 EGTA, 14 Tris<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 10 HEPES, 3 QX-314 (pH 7.2, 290 mOsm). Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices). Signals were digitized at 20–40 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz by Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). In voltage clamp, cells were held at −70 mV, with access resistance 5‒20 MΩ compensated to 50–60%. In the current clamp, the resting membrane potential was maintained at −60 to −70 mV with bias current. To isolate excitatory postsynaptic currents, inhibitory synaptic blockers SR-95531 (10 μM) and strychnine (0.5 μM) were added to the bath solution whereas to isolate inhibitory currents, excitatory synaptic blockers NBQX (10 μM) and MK-801 (5 μM) were added to the bath solution. The AN root was stimulated with brief voltage pulses (100 μs) using a stimulus isolation unit (Iso-Flex, A.M.P.I) via a bipolar microelectrode placed in the nerve root.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological analysis</title><p>Spike waveforms were analyzed using Igor Pro 8. Threshold was defined as the voltage at 5% of the peak of the spike’s first derivative, measured after subtracting the baseline dV/dt generated by the neuron’s electronic charging. This method was found empirically to identify the visually identified spike ‘onset’ much more reliably than the oft-used peak of the 3rd derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>). The latter method, when applied to diverse neurons in our dataset, often failed when the spike had a prominent initial segment ‘hump’ on the rising phase, or when the 3rd derivative was noisy. Spike overshoot was calculated as spike peak voltage relative to zero. Absolute amplitude of the spike was calculated from threshold to peak. Undershoot was the negative-most excursion of voltage, relative to threshold, and AHP latency was the time delay from spike peak to undershoot peak. Spike AHP was an arbitrary definition that measured the difference between voltage at the peak of the undershoot to the voltage one ms later. This time point captured well differences among neurons, since the D-stellate cells, and not the smaller cells, had extremely fast decaying AHPs. Membrane input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was measured by injecting a small hyperpolarizing current in voltage clamp mode, R<sub>in</sub> was calculated offline using Ohm’s law. Average spike rate was calculated in response to depolarizing 500 pA current injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Morphology</title><p>Morphological studies of individual cells were made by including 0.2‒0.4% biocytin (B1592, Molecular Probes) in the recording pipette solution. After loading each cell for 20 min, the recording electrode was slowly retracted, and the slice fixed overnight in 4% (w/v) buffered paraformaldehyde. After fixation, the slices were rinsed in PBS and stored for up to a week at 4°C in PBS until processing for biocytin labeling. To visualize biocytin labeling, the slices were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 solution (in PBS) for 2 hr at room temperature. Slices were incubated in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase, rinsed with PBS, incubated in ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 2 hr, rinsed with PBS, and then incubated for 3‒4 min in diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution containing 0.05 M Tris buffer, 10 mg/mL nickel ammonium sulfate, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mg (1 mg/100 μL) DAB, and 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then rinsed, mounted on glass slides, dehydrated in an ascending series of alcohols, delipidized in xylene, and cover slipped with Permount. DAB-stained cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 using a 40× oil immersion objective and reconstructed using Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience). Analyses of dendritic and axonal processes were made in Neurolucida explorer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For glycine labeling, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 0.9% warm saline followed by a fixative containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde buffered in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed for 30‒60 min. Sagittal sections were cut at 50 μm thickness on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Slices were rinsed in PBS and then incubated in fresh 1% NaBH<sub>4</sub> for 30 min to reduce autofluorescence from glutaraldehyde fixation. Slices were rinsed extensively in PBS.</p><p>For colabeling studies of SST-tdTomato and GlyT2-GFP-positive neurons, SST-tdTomato::GlyT2-GFP mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 0.9% warm saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde buffered in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at 4°C. Sections were cut at 50 μm thickness on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S).</p><p>All sections were then blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2% fish gelatin, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hr at room temperature on a 2-D shaker table. Next, the sections were incubated in primary antibody solution containing: primary antibody, 2% BSA, 2% fish gelatin PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 24‒48 hr at 4°C. The sections were then washed three times, 10-mins each, in PBS, and incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2 hr at room temperature or 24‒48 hr at 4°C on a shaker table. The following primary antibodies were used: 1:500 anti-glycine (Ab139, Millipore Sigma), 1:2000 chicken anti-GFP (GFP-1020, Aves Labs), and 1:1000 rabbit anti-DsRed (632496, Clontech). The following secondary antibodies were used: 1:500 Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Labs), 1:500 donkey anti-chicken conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (703-545-155, Jackson Immuno Research Labs), and 1:400 donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (711-585-152, Jackson Immuno Research Labs). Sections were rinsed in PBS three times, 10 min for each rinse, and in a few cases, sections were subsequently incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hr. Sections were then mounted on microscope slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Thick tissue clearing</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, then perfused transcardially with 0.9% warm saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde buffered in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at 4°C. The entire CN (450–500 μm) was cut from the brainstem using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Because the CN sits at the lateral edge of the brainstem, only a single cut was required to prepare the specimen. Samples were washed in 0.1 M PBS before clearing for 72 hr at room temperature on a shaker table with an accelerated ‘clear unobstructed brain imaging cocktail’ (CUBIC)-mount solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) containing sucrose (50%, w/v), urea (25%, w/v), and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-hydroxypropyl) ethylenediamine (25%, w/v) dissolved in 30 mL of dH<sub>2</sub>O. Once each sample was cleared and almost transparent, it was then mounted on a glass slide with 0.5 mm deep silicone spacers (EMS) in CUBIC-mount. The images were acquired within 24 hr to reduce volume changes in CUBIC-mount (10–20% increase in volume after incubation). The samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan microscope with a 25× objective. Tiles and z-stack of whole CN were imaged at 5 μm step size with the exception of one sample where images were obtained at 2 μm step size. Images were post-processed and individual tiles were stitched together using Zeiss Zen Black software. Analysis of cell count and soma volume were quantified using Imaris software (Bitplane 12.1). For optimal processing of large file sizes, files were separated into 3–4 smaller files each containing (30 GB)~150 μm of CN for faster processing. The image stacks were further processed for background correction and normalization in Imaris. VCN was selected for quantification by drawing regions of interest around the VCN followed by applying a mask outside the region of interest. The dorsal border of the VCN was defined by the granule cell lamina, and the medial border by the absence of glycinergic somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muniak et al., 2013</xref>). For cell count quantification, we used the built-in ‘spot detection’ algorithm in Imaris in which the program places a ‘spot’ on the soma of each cell. The spots are used for counting of GFP positive cells in the VCN. Automatically detected spots were verified by the eye and corrected manually. To test the validity of the automated spot function, certain regions of VCN were manually counted and compared against the spot function. The spot function detected more than 95% of all cells present in that area. For volume measurements, we used the in-built ‘surface’ rendering function in Imaris. The program rendered 3D surfaces on the soma of GFP positive cells. Rendered surfaces were used to extract the volume statistics. Surfaces were also verified and corrected manually.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Colocalization assay</title><p>For colocalization analysis of tdTomato with GFP in the VCN, images were obtained from CUBIC-cleared VCN of SST-tdTomato::GlyT2-GFP transgenic mice. Images were acquired at 5 μm steps with Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan as described above. Images were post-processed and stitched using Zeiss Zen Black software. Images were analyzed using the ‘ImarisColoc’ function in Imaris. 150 μm thickness of VCN was processed separately. ImarisColoc function allows to process the overlap between the two-color channels in an image. Minimum threshold was selected for the two-color channels. A new channel was generated that only contained colocalized voxels. Next, we used the surface rendering program, which turns voxels into solid objects, which were used to measure the volumes on double-labeled cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Retrobead injections</title><p>GlyT2-GFP mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf). Animal temperature was maintained near 37°C with a heating pad (T/pump Gaymar). The scalp was retracted, a portion of the skull above the left cerebellum was opened. VCN was located by stereotactic coordinates starting from the surface junction point of the inferior colliculus, cerebellar lobule IV-V, and simple lobule (0.7 mm lateral, 0.95 mm rostral, 4 mm depth). Glass capillaries (Wire Trol II, Drummond Scientific) were pulled on a horizontal puller (P-97, Sutter) and then beveled using a diamond lapping disc (0.5 μm grit, 3M DLF4XN_56611X) to an inside diameter of 20‒30 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>). Glass capillaries were advanced into the VCN with a microdrive (IVM-500, Scientifica) at a rate of 10 μm/s. 50 ‒100 nL of red retrobeads (LumaFluor Inc) was injected using a single axis manipulator (MO-10, Narishige) and pipette vice (Ronal). 5 min waiting periods were allowed before and after injections. The skin was sutured and mice were allowed to recover for 5‒6 days. After recovery, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde buffered in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at 4°C. Coronal sections were cut at 50 μm thickness on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Confocal images of the sections were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. Images were analyzed using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>All drugs in the slice experiments were bath applied.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This report describes the discovery and key properties of an additional class of glycinergic interneuron in the mouse ventral cochlear nucleus, the site at which auditory information is first processed in the brain. The authors demonstrate the existence of these cells using a GlyT2-GFP reporter mouse and perform a morphometric analysis to define their size and dendritic arborizations, noting that the cells are smaller than the previously described D-stellate cells. The cells (termed &quot;L-stellate&quot; cells) appear to represent a distinct class, as they are not labeled in SST-Cre mice, they do not appear to send projections to the contralateral cochlear nucleus, and they exhibit distinct morphological and electrophysiological properties. These cells appear to receive feedforward excitation from auditory nerve fibers, and using a pharmacological approach, the authors provide evidence that these neurons provide inhibitory input to both bushy calls and T-stellate cells. L-stellate cells represent the most numerous inhibitory cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus, suggesting that they play a critical role in processing sound information.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Discovery of a novel inhibitory neuron class, the L-Stellate cells of the cochlear nucleus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Dwight E Bergles as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The manuscript is very clearly written, and the experiments performed with a high degree of rigor, as expected from this outstanding group. The results are novel and important for the auditory field. However, all reviewers raised substantive major concerns, which preclude acceptance of the manuscript in its present form. There was a consensus that, while interesting for auditory neuroscientists, the studies do not go far enough to reveal how these cells influence information flow through the CN and thus many not be of broad enough interest to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, it the studies could be expanded to better define the role of these interneurons in the inhibitory control of auditory coding in the cochlear nucleus, the impact and interest would be substantially higher and thus appropriate for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers recommend addressing the following four major comments.</p><p>1) Relationship to previous findings: There is preceding data in the literature from several other species that revealed the presence of a set of small inhibitory interneurons in the VCN (glycinergic, and possibly also GABAergic) that are not part of the commissural pathway (Gleich and Vater, 1998; Kolston et al., 1992; Doucet and Ryugo, 1997; Doucet et al., 1999, etc). These observations are not often emphasized in the literature, probably because they are scattered and are not included in any of the standard conceptual frameworks about the CN circuit. However, here they should be acknowledged more clearly in the manuscript, both in the Introduction and Discussion. The L-stellate cells are not really &quot;novel&quot; (as stated in the Abstract and title), although the ability to target them for study, and revealing part of their position and function as inhibitory interneurons in the circuit, is a significant and important advance. What is most remarkable is the number of cells in this class, and that they have been &quot;missed&quot;, or at least not recognized, in most previous physiological studies. Thus, the title of the study should be adjusted to reflect this earlier work.</p><p>2) Role of L-stellate cells in the DCN: The main drawback of the study is that the functional impact of local inhibition vs. previously known sources of tonotopic inhibition from the DCN remains unclear, apart from differential sensitivity to cholinergic modulation. It is not apparent from the data presented how strong L-stellate connections are on their VCN targets, or their dynamics in response to ANF stimulation. The absence of paired recordings is a major weakness – does this reveal something unusual about their connections? Perhaps this could be addressed by using another approach – cell attached screening or using slices with a different orientation, etc. Without these data, or more detailed histological analysis (similar to what has been done at the EM level for interneurons in the hippocampus) it is difficult to place the cells in a functional context.</p><p>One of the main questions this study raises is what is the functional distinction of L-stellate vs. DCN (vertical cell) mediated tonotopic inhibition to VCN targets. Is L-stellate cell input functionally redundant? Can the authors preferentially stimulate this inhibition from the nerve without the DCN? Can the strength and dynamics of inhibition during repetitive stimulation from nerve stimulation be observed in the coronal plane in which the L-stellate cells are the only intact inhibitory cells in the slice? Some comparison with the T-stellate cells is warranted (perhaps in conjunction with Figure 5, in terms of dendritic and axonal morphology). This does not need to be an exhaustive comparison, just enough to help clarify if there are any pronounced differences. In this regard, the L-stellate dendritic fields look a lot like previous reconstructions of T-stellate cells, so how different are those 2 classes? How likely is it that previous studies claiming to record from T-stellate cells have actually mixed the populations?</p><p>3) Morphological characteristics of L-stellate cells: The axons of L-stellate cells are not clearly delineated in the experimental material. The drawings in Figure 5 show &quot;axonal and dendritic arbors&quot;, but do not indicate which of the traced processes belong to which part of the cell. Although the data support the conclusion that these cells do not project contralaterally in any major way, it is unclear whether they might have other projections, such as to the DCN (it does not appear so from the reconstructions, but that is not a foregone conclusion as it is unclear how visible the axon was or whether it could be followed to its terminations). The &quot;localness&quot; of these cell's targets should be better qualified. In Figure 5, the heterogeneity of dendritic morphology among L-stellate cells is striking. Does dendritic morphology reflect electrophysiological differences?</p><p>4) Physiological properties of L-stellate cells: The demonstration of chopping response to direct current injection in Figure 7 might be expected for any regularly firing neuron. It would be more informative if the authors could demonstrate chopping in response to ANF stimulation. The diversity in input resistance and spike parameters across cells (e.g., in Figure 6) might have interesting functional consequences in these experiments and might be distinct from vertical cell responses. As the authors point out, it seems likely that there are at least two classes of L-stellate cells, but their different physiological characteristics have not been related to differences in morphology (Figure 5 and 6), so it is difficult to place them in a relevant context. It would be helpful if the authors could provide more information on this issue from their existing data set. Does carbachol sensitivity correlate with differences in AP shape parameters or topographic location within the VCN? In other words, does carbachol sensitivity reflect differences in cell type or simply the location of the cell with respect to cholinergic input fields?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Identification of an Inhibitory Neuron Subtype, the L-Stellate Cell of the Cochlear Nucleus&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript has been substantially improved, despite the current limitations due to COVID-19, and that the work is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, several remaining issues need to be addressed before final acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Additional quantitative information should be included, if possible, about the dendritic morphology of L- vs. T-stellate cells. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1: the analyses of L- vs. T-stellate cell dendritic morphology appears anecdotal, with just one L-stellate and 3 T-stellate cells reconstructed. This should be better documented, as this is a substantial part of the comparison between excitatory and inhibitory stellate cells in the VCN. It seems feasible even in a reduced research state to flesh out this data set enough to provide a statistical comparison.</p><p>Please provide a small orientation indicator for all figures with anatomical images. If all are in the same orientation (they appear to be), then this should be clearly stated somewhere in the manuscript. While I can figure out what the orientation is from clues in the sections, other readers could have difficulty.</p><p>Figure 5: add statistical information for the added panel F legend, to be consistent with the rest of the legend.</p><p>Figure 6—figure supplement 1: There is no reference to this information in the main text. Please add any statistical information to the figure legend.</p><p>Introduction paragraph two: Lorente de No could not know neurons were &quot;small inhibitory neurons&quot;, but he did describe many small cells in the VCN. Please reword (you could just remove &quot;inhibitory&quot; from the sentence).</p><p>Introduction paragraph three: &quot;receptive field&quot; is still misleading here. They have a narrower dendritic field, from which a narrower receptive field would be inferred. Perhaps reword.</p><p>Introduction paragraph three : &quot;excitability of excitatory neurons &quot; suggest -&gt; &quot;excitability of projection neurons &quot;</p><p>Results paragraph three: the link is incorrect: it is &quot;http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiments/show/69874024&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “Synaptic connectivity”: Just to reinforce this observation, delayed firing after trains of AN stimulation were also reported in a subset of &quot;planar multipolar&quot; cells by Xie and Manis, 2017. However, it is unclear whether the cells in that study correspond to the L-stellate cells in this study as the cell identification was not as robust.</p><p>Paragraph two in subsection “Synaptic connectivity”: number agreement: &quot;cells have&quot; (not &quot;cells has&quot;)</p><p>&quot;For a few voltage-clamp experiments, we used an internal solution containing (in mM) 5 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Tris-GTP, 5 EGTA, 14 Tris2-phosphocreatine, 4 Na2-ATP, 10 HEPES, 3 QX-314 (pH 7.2, 290 mOsm).&quot; It is not clear to me how this electrode solution has an osmolarity of 290 mOsm.

We have revised our manuscript to explicitly acknowledge previous studies reporting the presence of small inhibitory neurons that are distinct from D-stellate cells, Introduction paragraph three. The word “novel” in the title and manuscript was used to describe the majority of unknown small inhibitory neurons that were not reported earlier. We have nevertheless changed the title to “Identification of an inhibitory neuron subtype, the L-stellate cell of the cochlear nucleus.” However, as the reviewers likely know, these cells are indeed novel to the extent that previous proposals about the key elements of circuitry and computation in the CN have ignored them, despite occasional reports their appearance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Role of L-stellate cells in the DCN: The main drawback of the study is that the functional impact of local inhibition vs. previously known sources of tonotopic inhibition from the DCN remains unclear, apart from differential sensitivity to cholinergic modulation.

How likely is it that previous studies claiming to record from T-stellate cells have actually mixed the populations?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data demonstrating carbachol-induced IPSCs onto both bushy and T-stellate cells is strong evidence for local inhibition provided by L-stellate cells. The only other interpretation is that inhibitory axons projecting from an unknown source external to CN reaches principal cells and happens to express presynaptic excitatory AChRs. Given the demonstrated excitatory actions of carbachol on L-cells (and not on other CN inhibitory neurons), we think Occam’s razor favors a local source of this inhibition. Indeed this is a powerful approach: unlike electrical stimulation of inhibitory sources in VCN and DCN in which the sources of inhibition are ambiguous, carbachol application allowed us to selectively activate L-stellate cells from all other known inhibitory cells in the CN. We agree that paired recordings would confirm the local connectivity. However, even after using numerous approaches suggested by the reviewer including cell-attached screening, puffing glutamate, potassium, cutting slices with a different orientation, establishing paired recording in the VCN remained extremely challenging. At this point, given the challenges of the COVID crisis, which of course shut down our lab and forced us to sacrifice a large fraction of our mouse colony, and given the extremely low yield of this experiment (we had stated we had only an N of 1 success in the paper), it would take an unreasonably long time to obtain such data. Another option as suggested by the reviewer, to perform a further detailed histological analysis, is very exciting but it is beyond the scope of the current work. We will consider this for a future research project when we are able to research again.</p><p>Inhibition from L-stellate cells may or may not be functionally redundant with the other classes of inhibitory cell. We showed that D-stellate cells and vertical cells do not respond to cholinergic agonist whereas many L-stellates showed increase in excitability. This suggests a specific role of cholinergic modulation of excitability of primary excitatory neurons through inhibitory neurons. We have expanded the Discussion of the possible function of cholinergic inputs onto L-stellate cells.</p><p>Stimulation of ANF without the DCN is an interesting thought, however as noted above, it could also activate collaterals of D-stellate cells. Prior to the lab’s shut down, we were actively pursuing a different targeted approach to activate only L-stellate cells in the CN.</p><p>However, we can report that just before the shutdown, we were able to pursue one of the reviewer’s suggested experiments, performing cell-fills followed by reconstruction of T-stellate cells. Our available data have been added in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and show that L-cells may have more tightly ramified dendritic branches compared to T-stellate cells. We agree with the reviewer that, given the regular firing/chopper responses of L-cells, it is possible that previous papers describing T-stellate cells could reflect a mixed excitatory/inhibitory population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Morphological characteristics of L-stellate cells: The axons of L-stellate cells are not clearly delineated in the experimental material. The drawings in Figure 5 show &quot;axonal and dendritic arbors&quot;, but do not indicate which of the traced processes belong to which part of the cell. Although the data support the conclusion that these cells do not project contralaterally in any major way, it is unclear whether they might have other projections, such as to the DCN (it does not appear so from the reconstructions, but that is not a foregone conclusion as it is unclear how visible the axon was or whether it could be followed to its terminations). The &quot;localness&quot; of these cell's targets should be better qualified. In Figure 5, the heterogeneity of dendritic morphology among L-stellate cells is striking. Does dendritic morphology reflect electrophysiological differences?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised a valid point that applies to most anatomical reconstructions: we cannot prove that an axonal branch does not exist. Moreover, given the thin and profusely branched processes of L-cells, it was difficult to indicate dendrites or axons confidently in the majority of the reconstructions. However, we do feel our carbachol evidence clearly indicates that L-cells make local connections. Regarding the reviewer’s last point, we did not observe obvious correlation between anatomy and intrinsic properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Physiological properties of L-stellate cells: The demonstration of chopping response to direct current injection in Figure 7 might be expected for any regularly firing neuron. It would be more informative if the authors could demonstrate chopping in response to ANF stimulation.

We anticipated that spikes driven by synaptic stimuli should also show a chopping pattern, unless the EPSPs were extremely strong. Using data collected prior to shut down, we now illustrate chopping responses to ANF stimulation in Figure 7. We have recorded from L-stellate cells with ANF stimulation (n = 6). All the cells displayed chopping responses to ANF stimulation. Interestingly, the cells also show delayed firing even after the end of stimulation, which will be explored in a future study. We did not find any significant correlation between morphology and physiological characteristics. We also quantified the intrinsic properties of L-cells to carbachol sensitivity (n = 21 cells, 11 responded to carbachol and 10 with no carbachol response). The quantification is presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and shows virtually no difference in spike properties of responders and non-responders.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional quantitative information should be included, if possible, about the dendritic morphology of L- vs. T-stellate cells. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1: the analyses of L- vs. T-stellate cell dendritic morphology appears anecdotal, with just one L-stellate and 3 T-stellate cells reconstructed. This should be better documented, as this is a substantial part of the comparison between excitatory and inhibitory stellate cells in the VCN. It seems feasible even in a reduced research state to flesh out this data set enough to provide a statistical comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the near-anecdotal level of T-stellate data. We had been unable to do more drawings due to the unavailability of the cell tracing equipment during the lockdown. However, we have since been able to gain access and now provide more complete analysis, showing statistically different morphological features between all stellate subtypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide a small orientation indicator for all figures with anatomical images. If all are in the same orientation (they appear to be), then this should be clearly stated somewhere in the manuscript. While I can figure out what the orientation is from clues in the sections, other readers could have difficulty.</p><p>Figure 5: add statistical information for the added panel F legend, to be consistent with the rest of the legend.</p><p>Figure 6—figure supplement 1: There is no reference to this information in the main text.

Please reword (you could just remove &quot;inhibitory&quot; from the sentence).</p><p>Introduction paragraph three: &quot;receptive field&quot; is still misleading here. They have a narrower dendritic field, from which a narrower receptive field would be inferred.
