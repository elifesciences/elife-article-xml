rare type of leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset macrocephaly and progressive white matter vacuolation that lead to ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive decline. During postnatal development (from P5 to P15 in the mouse), MLC1 forms a membrane complex with GlialCAM (another astrocytic transmembrane protein) at the junctions between perivascular astrocytic processes. Perivascular astrocytic processes along with blood vessels form the gliovascular unit. It was not previously known how MLC1 influences the physiology of the gliovascular unit. Here, using the <italic>Mlc1</italic> knock-out mouse model of MLC, we demonstrated that MLC1 controls the postnatal development and organization of perivascular astrocytic processes, vascular smooth muscle cell contractility, neurovascular coupling, and intraparenchymal interstitial fluid clearance. Our data suggest that MLC is a developmental disorder of the gliovascular unit, and perivascular astrocytic processes and vascular smooth muscle cell maturation defects are primary events in the pathogenesis of MLC and therapeutic targets for this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MLC</kwd><kwd>MLC1</kwd><kwd>gliovascular unit</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008731</institution-id><institution>Association Européenne contre les Leucodystrophies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ELA2012-014C2B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen-Salmon</surname><given-names>Martine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014865</institution-id><institution>Fondation Maladies Rares</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20170603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen-Salmon</surname><given-names>Martine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLP20170939025p60</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>Alice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AJE20171039094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen-Salmon</surname><given-names>Martine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of a mouse model of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) shows that the astrocyte-specific membrane protein MLC1 sustains the postnatal development of perivascular astrocytic processes and that MLC is a developmental disorder of the gliovascular unit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare type of leukodystrophy (OMIM 604004) mainly caused by mutations in the <italic>MLC1</italic> gene (MIM #605908) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leegwater et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Topçu et al., 2000</xref>). Patients with MLC display early-onset macrocephaly and progressive white matter vacuolation, leading to slowly progressive ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive decline. Most mutations in <italic>MLC1</italic> result in the degradation of the encoded protein MLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duarri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lanciotti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leegwater et al., 2001</xref>), a membrane protein that is specifically expressed by the astrocytic lineage in the brain and present at high levels at the junctions between perivascular astrocytic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoegg-Beiler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). At present, there is no cure for MLC, only symptomatic treatments and supportive care are available. Although the physiopathological mechanisms leading to MLC have not been characterized, the strong expression of MLC1 in perivascular astrocytic processes and other recent observations suggest that the protein has a role in gliovascular functions, particularly the regulation of ion/water homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capdevila-Nortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoegg-Beiler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ridder et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, MLC patients present widespread brain edema and swollen perivascular astrocytic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bugiani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>). GlialCAM, another transmembrane protein forming a complex with MLC1 and responsible for its endoplasmic reticulum exit, is an auxiliary subunit of ClC-2, an inward rectifier chloride channel expressed in a subtype of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benesova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bugiani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Estévez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoegg-Beiler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeworutzki et al., 2012</xref>). Recessive and dominant mutations in GlialCAM cause MLC subtypes MLC2A and MLC2B, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van der Knaap et al., 1993</xref>). In vitro, the MLC1/GlialCAM complex indirectly regulates other ion channels, such as TRPV4 and LRRC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elorza-Vidal et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite the above observations, it is still not known whether and how MLC1 influences the physiology of the gliovascular unit, the functional interface comprising perivascular astrocytic processes and the brain vessels. We recently reported that MLC1 expression in mouse perivascular astrocytic processes starts around postnatal day (P) 5 and that the MLC1/GlialCAM complex forms progressively from P5 to P15, with the protein deposits creating a meshwork between the astrocytes’ perivascular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>). We also demonstrated that this postnatal period is a developmental window for the molecular maturation of brain endothelial cells, particularly with regard to their efflux properties and for the contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slaoui et al., 2021</xref>). Given that astrocytes are key regulators of cerebrovascular development and function (e.g., blood–brain barrier integrity, immune quiescence and perivascular homeostasis, neurovascular coupling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castro Dias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen-Salmon et al., 2021</xref>), we hypothesized that the MLC1/GlialCAM complex might influence the postnatal differentiation of the vascular system.</p><p>Here, we characterized key aspects of the molecular and functional organization of the gliovascular unit in <italic>Mlc1</italic> knock-out (KO) mice, a preclinical model of MLC that recapitulates several important features of the disease and that can be used to examine the pathological cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoegg-Beiler et al., 2014</xref>). Our results revealed that MLC1 is a critical factor in the postnatal maturation and function of the gliovascular unit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The absence of MLC1 results in accumulation of fluid in the brain but does not alter blood–brain barrier integrity or the organization of the endothelial network</title><p>Astrocytes influence several properties of endothelial cells, such as blood–brain barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castro Dias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen-Salmon et al., 2021</xref>). We recently demonstrated that the postnatal maturation of the MLC1/GlialCAM complex in perivascular astrocytic processes from P5 to P15 coincides with the progressive increase in endothelium-specific proteins that contribute to blood–brain barrier integrity, such as the tight junction protein claudin5 and the endothelial luminal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gP), suggesting that perivascular astrocytic processes and the blood–brain barrier mature in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slaoui et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore investigated whether the absence of MLC1 in the <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mouse influenced postnatal endothelial maturation. To that end, we used qPCRs to characterize the expression of <italic>Abcb1</italic> (encoding P-gP) and <italic>Cldn5</italic> (encoding claudin5) on P5, P15, and P60 in whole-brain microvessels isolated from WT and <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boulay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In the WT, expression of both analyzed mRNAs on P5 and P15 confirmed the progressive postnatal molecular maturation of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). There were no significant differences between <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice and WT mice in this respect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistently, the protein levels of P-gP and claudin5 in purified brain microvessels determined by western blots were also similar in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO and WT mice at all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We next assessed the blood–brain barrier integrity in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO and WT mice on P60. We first observed that the apparent diffusion coefficient (measured using magnetic resonance imaging) was higher in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, the volume of the ventricles and the brain estimated from the anatomical T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging acquisition was larger in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), although the relative ventricular volumes did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Contrast-enhanced T1 mapping was used to quantify changes of the concentration of DOTA-Gd within the brain tissue over time. In line with the conventional models of cerebrospinal solute circulation, tracers injected into the cisterna magna dispersed into the subarachnoid space and then entered the parenchyma through the perivascular spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, a high concentration of DOTA-Gd was detected at the border of the brain as early as 10 min after injection in both WT and <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice; this reflected the initial dispersion of contrast within the subarachnoid space. 45 min after injection, the DOTA-Gd concentration in brain tissue rose as it penetrated into the parenchyma through the perivascular spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The dispersion kinetics for each route depends on anatomic differences between regions of the brain, such as the presence or absence of a perivascular space and the topology of the vascular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>).

However, examination of the quantitative maps suggested that DOTA-Gd transport into the CSF was less intense in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice than in WT mice.

Our previous research showed that, in the mouse, the MLC1/GlialCAM complex forms progressively after birth (between P5 and P15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>). Our present work demonstrated for the first time that the P5–P15 time window is also important for the formation of perivascular astrocyte coverage. On P5, perivascular astrocytic processes covered only 50% of the vascular surface, and this coverage increased rapidly until completion on P15. We show that the absence of MLC1 impairs this developmental process together with the astrocytic perivascular processes’ molecular maturation, with a lower Kir4.1 expression and a transient decrease in Aqp4 and Cx43 protein levels on P5. GlialCAM (whose anchorage in astrocytic membranes depends on MLC1) is distributed diffusely, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoegg-Beiler et al., 2014</xref>). From P10 onward, perivascular astrocytic processes incompletely cover the vessels and direct contact between neuronal components and the vessel wall are observed. Interestingly, the postnatal period is also an intense synaptogenic phase in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2015</xref>); astrocytes and neurons might compete for the perivascular space during this time. In the absence of MLC1, neurons might either stabilize or insert into the space left free by perivascular astrocytic processes.</p><p>Remodeling of the gliovascular interface is accompanied by a loss of astrocyte polarity in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO. Firstly, the perivascular distribution of Cx43 gap junction at the perivascular surface is modified with more and larger puncta, and the perivascular astrocytic processes are delineated by large gap junction plaques. Interestingly, disorganization of Cx43 was recently reported in <italic>GlialCAM</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin et al., 2021</xref>); this supports the hypothesis whereby the MLC1/GlialCAM complex organizes gap junction coupling in perivascular astrocytic processes. Secondly, <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO astrocytes have an abnormally high number of ramifications, which tend to project toward the blood vessels. Thirdly, there are changes in the perivascular astrocytic processes’ polarity and organization (stacking, interpenetration, and the presence of basal lamina on the parenchymal side). Lastly, astrocytic perivascular processes are less mechanically cohesive. It was recently demonstrated that the astrocyte arborization becomes more complex between P7 and P21 – the period during which the perivascular MLC1/GlialCAM astrocytic complex forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clavreul et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>). The formation of perivascular astrocytic process coverage (mediated by the MLC1/GliaCAM complex) might influence this process and thus polarize astrocytes. Taken as a whole, our data demonstrate that MLC1 is crucial for the development of astrocyte morphology, perivascular polarity, and perivascular coverage.</p><p>What impact, then, does the lack of MLC1 have on the gliovascular physiology? Although astrocytes are key regulators of the blood–brain barrier’s integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castro Dias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen-Salmon et al., 2021</xref>), the incomplete perivascular astrocyte coverage, the abnormal astrocytic polarity, and the loss of the perivascular astrocytic processes’ mechanical cohesiveness did not alter blood–brain barrier’s integrity in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO. Nevertheless, these changes probably alter the ‘barrier’ formed by perivascular astrocytic processes around the vessels. In turn, this might greatly affect perivascular homeostasis and astrocyte signaling toward the vascular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). The astrocytes’ perivascular organization is thought to be crucial for regulating the fluxes of CSF and interstitial fluid into the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbott et al., 2018</xref>). Perivascular astrocytic process alterations in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice might therefore be directly linked to the loss of DOTA-Gd intraparenchymal drainage observed. By reducing the volume of subarachnoid spaces, megalencephaly in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice may also alter the brain’s drainage capacity, as suggested by the lower level of DOTA-Gd transport into the CSF observed in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice. In the presence of an intact blood–brain barrier, impaired parenchymal circulation of the CSF/interstitial fluid might (i) contribute to the fluid accumulation and megalencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Knaap et al., 2012</xref>), (ii) lead to the progressive accumulation of harmful molecules in the brain, and (iii) thus increase susceptibility to neural disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Epilepsy is a significant component of MLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yalçinkaya et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice display spontaneous epileptiform activity, an abnormally low threshold for seizure induction, and an elevated extracellular potassium concentration in the hippocampus upon prolonged high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey et al., 2018</xref>). The absence of Kir4.1 leads to hyperexcitability and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sibille et al., 2014</xref>). The low level of perivascular Kir4.1 observed in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice might link MLC to epilepsy.</p><p>Unlike skeletal or cardiac muscle, SMCs are not terminally differentiated and are extremely plastic. They constantly integrate signals from their local environment and undergo profound phenotypic changes in response to variations in their local environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owens, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Owens et al., 2004</xref>). By perturbing perivascular homeostasis, the abnormal development of perivascular astrocytic processes in the absence of MLC1 might affect the postnatal acquisition of vascular smooth muscle cells’ contractile properties and thus result in hypoperfusion and defective neurovascular coupling. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that perivascular astrocyte coverage, MLC1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>), and vascular smooth muscle cell contractile differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slaoui et al., 2021</xref>) develop concomitantly. Interestingly, deletion of astrocytic laminin γ1 was shown to lead to the loss of vascular smooth muscle cell contractile proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), which indicated a functional link between astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Our data now suggest that astrocytes have a critical role in the postnatal differentiation of contractile vascular smooth muscle cells.</p><p>Alteration of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility might influence brain perfusion and neurovascular coupling, which are critical for oxygen and nutrient delivery to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iadecola, 2017</xref>) this impairment might compromise neuronal and cerebral functions. Furthermore, the maintenance of axonal myelination makes extraordinary metabolic demands on oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris and Attwell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosko et al., 2019</xref>). The lack of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility and the changes in blood perfusion and cerebral blood flow regulation resulting from the absence of MLC1 might contribute to progressive intramyelinic edema. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that myelin vacuolation in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice does not start until the age of 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoegg-Beiler et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, alteration of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility could affect circulation of the CSF and perivascular fluid, although the heart beat is the main driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Together, the development of perivascular astrocytic process, vascular smooth muscle cell maturation, CSF flux, and cerebral blood flow defects precede myelin vacuolation in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice and so are probably primary events in the pathogenesis of MLC. Our observation of swollen perivascular astrocytic processes on 1 year but not on P60 <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice indicates that edema develops progressively in the absence of MLC1 and suggests that the pathogenic process is irresistible.</p><p>In contrast to the mouse, expression of MLC1 and the astrocyte’s perivascular coverage are initiated prenatally in humans, as already suggested by earlier observations of perivascular GFAP and AQP4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El-Khoury et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest that in humans impaired perivascular astrocytic process formation linked to the absence of MLC1 might occur prenatally, deregulating perivascular homeostasis and then the perinatal differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slaoui et al., 2021</xref>), leading to a progressive white matter vacuolation.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that the astrocyte-specific protein MLC1, the absence of which causes MLC, is critical for the postnatal development of perivascular astrocyte coverage, the acquisition of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility, and parenchymal CFS/ISF (cerebrospinal fluid/interstitial fluid) efflux. Our results shed light on the role of astrocytes in the postnatal acquisition of vascular smooth muscle cell contractility, a crucial component of neurovascular coupling in the brain. Our data indicate that MLC could be considered primarily as an early developmental disorder of the gliovascular unit. Moreover, our study illustrates how looking at physiopathological processes in a rare disease can enlighten important aspects of the brain’s physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acta2_F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GTCCCAGACATCAGGGAGTAA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acta2_R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TCGGATACTTCAGCGTCAGGA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Atp1b1_F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GCTGCTAACCATCAGTGAACT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Atp1b1_R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GGGGTCATTAGGACGGAAGGA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mdr1a (Abcb1)_F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GATAGGCTGGTTTGATGTGC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mdr1a (Abcb1)_R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TCACAAGGGTTAGCTTCCAG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cldn5_F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TAAGGCACGGGTAGCACTCA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cldn5_R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GGACAACGATGTTGGCGAAC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gapdh_F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gapdh_R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Claudin 5 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">34-1600</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Western blot (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H3 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ozyme</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">14269S</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Western blot (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P-gP (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Enzo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ALX-801-002C100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Western blot (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SMA_cy3 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C6198</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Immunofluorescence (1:250);

Equal amounts of proteins were separated by denaturing electrophoresis on Mini-Protean TGX stain-free gels (Bio-Rad) and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Trans-blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Membranes were hybridized, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ezan et al., 2012</xref>). The antibodies used in this study are listed in the Key resources table.

The heart was incised, and the perfusion was started immediately (flow rate: 2.5 mL/min) so as to completely replace the blood with Krebs carbonate-buffered physiological saline (128 mM NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4.2 mM KCl, 2.4 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), (9 mM D-glucose) supplemented with [<sup>14</sup>C] sucrose (0.3 µCi/mL) (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France) as a marker of vascular integrity. The saline was bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for pH control (7.4) and warmed to 37°C. Perfusion was terminated after 120 s by decapitating the mouse. The whole brain was removed from the skull and dissected out on a freezer pack. Brain hemisphere and two aliquots of perfusion fluid were placed in tared vials and weighed, digested with Solvable (Perkin Elmer) and mixed with Ultima gold XR (Perkin Elmer) for <sup>14</sup>C dpm counting (Tri-Carb, Perkin Elmer). In some experiments, human serum albumin (40 g/L) (Vialebex, Paris, France) was added to the perfusion fluid in order to increase the hydrostatic pressure (~180 mmHg) and create shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ezan et al., 2012</xref>). The brain [<sup>14</sup>C]-sucrose vascular volume (Vv, in µL/g) was calculated from the distribution of the [<sup>14</sup>C]-sucrose: Vv = X<sub>v</sub>/C<sub>v</sub>, where X<sub>v</sub> (dpm/g) is the [<sup>14</sup>C] sucrose concentration in the hemispheres and C<sub>v</sub> (dpm/µL) is the [<sup>14</sup>C] sucrose concentration in the perfusion fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dagenais et al., 2000</xref>). It should be noted that in mammals the very hydrophilic, low-molecular-weight (342 Da) disaccharide sucrose does not bind to plasma proteins and does not have a dedicated transporter. Accordingly, sucrose does not diffuse passively and thus serves as a marker of blood–brain barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takasato et al., 1984</xref>). In this context, variations in sucrose’s distribution volume in the brain solely reflect changes in the blood–brain barrier’s physical integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Vascular smooth muscle cell responsiveness</title><p>Mice were rapidly decapitated, and the brains were quickly removed and placed in cold (~4°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution containing 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 11 mM D-glucose (pH = 7.35). Brains were constantly oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>–5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Brain cortex slices (400 µm thick) were cut with a vibratome (VT2000S, Leica) and transferred to a constantly oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>–5% CO<sub>2</sub>) holding chamber containing aCSF. Subsequently, individual slices were placed in a submerged recording chamber maintained at RT under an upright microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera (Qimaging) and perfused at 2 mL/min with oxygenated aCSF. Only one vessel per slice was selected for measurements of vascular responsiveness at the junction between layers I and II of the somatosensory cortex and with a well-defined luminal diameter (10–15 μm). An image was acquired every 30 s. Each recording started with the establishment of a control baseline for 5 min. Vessels with an unstable baseline (i.e., a change in diameter of more than 5%) were discarded from analysis. Vasoconstriction was induced by the application of the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-11a,9a- epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2α, 50 nM, Sigma) for 2 min. The signal was recorded until it had returned to the baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Functional ultrasound</title><p>Two-month-old mice were anesthetized, and cerebral blood flow responses to whisker stimulation were determined using functional ultrasound imaging. The protocol is described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anfray et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, mice were intubated and mechanically ventilated (frequency: 120 /min; tidal volume:10 mL/kg) by maintaining anesthesia with 2% isoflurane in 70% N<sub>2</sub>O/30% O<sub>2</sub>. Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame, and the head was shaved and cleaned with povidone-iodine. An incision was made along the midline head skin (to expose the skull), and lidocaine spray was applied to the head. Whiskers on the left side were cut to a length of 1 cm. Anesthesia was switched to a subcutaneous infusion of medetomidine (Domitor, Pfizer, 0.1 mg/kg) and isoflurane, N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> were withdrawn 10 min later. So that the isoflurane could dissipate and the cerebral blood flow could stabilization, the functional ultrasound measurements were initiated 20 min later. Ultrasound gel was applied between the ultrasound probe and the mouse’s skull to ensure good acoustic coupling. The probe was positioned in the coronal plane, corresponding to the somatosensory barrel field cortex (S1bf; bregma –1.5 mm). Ultrafast acquisition was performed with an ultrasound sequence based on compounded plane wave transmission (11 angles from 10° to 10°, in increments of 2°) using a 15 MHz probe (Vermon, France; 100 µm × 100 µm in-plane pixels; slice thickness: 300 µm; elevation focus: 8 µm; frame rate: 500 Hz). The whiskers were mechanically stimulated three times for 30 s, interspaced with a 60 s rest period (total duration of the experiment: 300 s). Using MATLAB (the MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA), we calculated the coefficient for the correlation between the normalized power Doppler (PD) intensity over time and a step function following the stimulation pattern. An activation map was reconstructed by selecting only pixels with a correlation coefficient above 0.2. The relative PD increase was quantified as the mean PD signal in the activated area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ultrasound localization microscopy</title><p>The acquisition and postprocessing steps for ultrasound localization microscopy were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hingot et al., 2020</xref>. For each image, 100 µL of Sonovue microbubbles were injected into the tail vein. Blocks of 800 compounded frames (–5° 0° 5°) at 1 kHz were acquired for 800 ms and saved for 200 ms; this scheme was repeated for 180 s. A combination of a Butterworth high-pass filter (second order, 20 Hz) and a singular value decomposition filter (10 values) was used to separate microbubble echoes from tissue echoes. The microbubbles’ centroid positions were localized using a weighted average algorithm. Microbubbles were tracked through consecutive frames using MathWorks (the MathWorks Inc). The tracks were interpolated and smoothed using a five-point sliding window, and redundant positions were removed. A density image was reconstructed on an 11 µm × 10 µm grid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 7 T Pharmascan magnetic resonance imaging system (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with volume transmit and surface receive coils and operated via Paravision 6.0 software (Bruker).

A micropipette formed from an elongated capillary glass tube and filled with 1 µL of DOTA-Gd was inserted into the cisterna magna. Before and after injection, 1 min pauses enabled the CSF pressure to normalize. Before micropipette removal, a drop of superglue was added to form a seal and prevent subsequent leakage of CSF.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Won-Suk Chung as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vincent Prevot (Reviewer #2); Injune Kim (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors reported that Mlc1 KO mice have more neuronal processes in contact with the vessels (Figure 6), and astrocytic processes appears to grow toward the vessels as well (Figure 5). However, they also suggested that the cohesiveness of PvAPs and the associated neuronal fibers to the vessels could be impaired based on the experiment from the mechanical purification of MVs (Figure 4). Since the interactions between PvAPs, neuronal fibers and the vessel are critical in understanding the neurovascular unit, the reduced cohesiveness of PvAPs and the associated neuronal fibers to the vessel in Mlc1 KO brains should be validated with additional experimental approach. Also, the authors need to discuss this point in more detail.</p><p>2) It is interesting that DOTA-Gd tracer shows different traces in Mlc1 KO brains. However, it is unclear how MLC1 deletion affects glymphatic system with different degrees in various brain regions. Does the tracer normally enter to the perivascular spaces in Mlc KO brains? Does the tracer leak out more from the perivascular spaces in Mlc1 KO mice? Is the general clearance or drainages of the tracer impaired in Mlc1 KO mice? Would these defects be originated by the reduced perivascular astrocyte coverage or the reduced vasoconstriction itself? Addressing these questions will strengthen the potential implication of Mlc1 in the circulation and clearance of CSF.</p><p>3) The defective polarity of astrocytes should be better described by using other markers other than GFAP.

In Figure 4B, why Glialcam western showed non-significant changes at P15 and P60 although IHC data showed Glialcam is not expressed at all in MLlc1 KO astrocytes?</p><p>4. In Figure 4C, Aquaporin4 western blot seems to be just copied from the previous western blot data from Figure 4B.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This very interesting manuscript by Gilbert and colleagues uncovers that the astrocyte specific membrane protein MLC1, the mutation of which causes a rare disease called megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical Cysts (MLC), plays a fundamental role in the postnatal development of the gliovascular unit and the organization of the perivascular astrocyte processes, in particular. To reach this conclusion, the authors used an elegant multiscale approach including in vivo MRI, in vivo functional ultrasound, ex vivo analysis of vascular constriction, anatomical approaches at the light and electron microscopic level, and molecular characterization of the gliovascular unit from isolated microvessels. The manuscript is very well-written although it uses too many (unnecessary) abbreviations, which prevents a fluid reading of the manuscript, results are well illustrated and convincing and the discussion is reasonable. The paper certainly is an important piece of work, which would feature well in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I have a major concern regarding the results reported in Figure 4D, which seem somewhat contradictory to those shown in Figure 6A-F. Indeed, the authors report in Figure 4D that there is less Neurofilament-M protein around isolated microvessels in MLC1 KO mice, whereas Figure 6A-F shows that these animals have more neuronal processes in contact with the vessels than in wiltypes. How can the authors explain this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Astrocytes unique to the central nervous system such as the brain is known to play a role in maintaining BBB integrity by surrounding brain vessels tightly vis their end-feet structure. However, how astrocytes form end-feet along brain vessels is largely unknown. The present manuscript by Gilbert et al., describes how perivascular astrocytic processes are established during postnatal development and pinpoint a player involved. They find that MLC1 deletion resulted in disorganized perivascular astrocytic processes and defective contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby leading to impaired neurovascular coupling and intraparenchymal fluid clearance. To assess the functions on top of anatomy, they monitored blood perfusion and fluid transport of CSF in vivo using ultrasound imaging and MRI. I think that only a few issues remain to be clarified publication of this manuscript.</p><p>1) In Figure 7D and 7G, but not in 7E and 7F, the basal values are significantly high in Mlc1 KO mice at 10 min after Gd infusion.

The results show that the part of the Aqp4 and NF-M perivascular immunolabeling is absent in the Mlc1 KO. Taken as a whole, our data demonstrate that PvAPs and the associated neuronal fibers (which normally remain attached to brain vessels during mechanical purification) are lost during the purification process in Mlc1 KO mice but not in the WT. In conclusion, the absence of MLC1 reduces the mechanical cohesiveness of PvAPs and the associated neuronal fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is interesting that DOTA-Gd tracer shows different traces in Mlc1 KO brains.

The uneven, slow dispersion of the tracer within the SAS means that the tracer’s kinetics in the parenchyma are region-dependent. These differences can be accentuated by regional differences in the anatomy of the brain’s vasculature, i.e. the presence or absence of a perivascular space and the vessel’s topology. Lastly, the amount of DOTA-Gd available for diffusion within the parenchyma depends directly on its local concentration in the SAS. This can be seen on our contrast concentration maps (see Figure 8), where the highest DOTA-Gd concentrations are found near the injection site (the cisterna magna), in line with previous reports (Iliff et al., 2012). In the <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO model, dispersion of DOTA-Gd is presumably affected in the SAS and the parenchyma.</p><p>With regard to tracer dispersion in the SAS and the cisternae, our anatomical MRI showed that the brain volume is greater in the <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mouse than in the WT (see Figure 1). These variations in the geometry of the SAS may account for much of the difference between the <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice and WT mice. Although tracer concentrations appear to be similar in the cerebellum (close to the injection site), they are much lower in the more distant septal area of <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice – suggesting that tracer transport within the SAS is restricted.</p><p>With regard to parenchymal dispersion, we showed that MLC1 is essential for the position of the astrocytes’ perivascular endfeet. Thus, in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice, the formation of the perivascular space (as a conduit for solute distribution) is likely to be deficient. This aspect is revealed by the slope of the tracer’s concentration-time curve, which indicate slower kinetics in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice; this might be due to poor integrity of the perivascular space. The higher volume of fluid in the <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO parenchyma (reflected by the increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); Figure 1 and S1) might also be involved in this phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would these defects be originated by the reduced perivascular astrocyte coverage or the reduced vasoconstriction itself? Addressing these questions will strengthen the potential implication of Mlc1 in the circulation and clearance of CSF.</p></disp-quote><p>The heart beat is the main driver of CSF circulation in the perivascular space (Iliff et al., 2013). The heart rate is very rapid and so the heart exerts a much greater driving force on the CSF than the vasodilation of the vessels induced by neuronal activity. Alterations in vascular contractility observed in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO mice might be involved in the impaired CSF flux but this is unlikely.</p><p>All these points are now discussed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Iliff JJ, Lee H, Yu M, Feng T, Logan J, Nedergaard M, and Benveniste H. 2013.

The distribution of Aquaporin4, Cx43 or several glutamate transporters in the specific compartment of astrocytes can be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>GFAP is the marker typically used to analyze the astrocytes’ overall morphology and polarity. Nevertheless, we agree that it is of interest to study the molecular polarity of PvAPs. Indeed, morphological changes in the PvAPs and astrocytes and changes in polarity in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO might all influence the localization of molecules in PvAPs. To address this question, we performed a quantitative stimulated emission depletion (STED) analysis of protein localization in PvAPs. Our results indicate that the perivascular localization of aquaporin 4 was not affected. However, the density and size of Cx43 puncta were greater – indicating that the gap junctions in PvAPs are not organized in the same way in the <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO as in the WT. This observation is consistent with our electron microscopy observations of perivascular astrocytic processes stacked on the top of each other and linked by extended gap junctions.</p><p>We have also added results for Kir4.1, a potassium channel that is expressed preferentially in PvAPs. The Kir4.1 expression level in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO was lower at all stages of development, indicating that perivascular potassium homeostasis was probably perturbed. These results are interesting because (i) epilepsy is a significant component of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy (Dubey et al., 2018; Yalcinkaya et al., 2003), and (ii) Kir4.1 deletion or downregulation is associated with greater susceptibility to epilepsy (Sibille et al., 2014).

This 30-year-old in vivo technique is extensively used in the BBB field to measure the qualitative and quantitative solute kinetic properties of the BBB and to assess the BBB’s physical integrity with compounds that normally fail to cross the BBB (Takasato et al., 1984). Here, we used sucrose – one of the best low-molecular-weight markers of vascular integrity. This hydrophilic compound does not bind to plasma proteins. Moreover, sucrose has no dedicated transporters in mammals and thus barely cross the BBB/cells (Takasato et al., 1984). Our data demonstrate that the BBB is not leaky in <italic>Mlc1</italic> KO – even under vascular shear stress conditions. Since astrocytes are critical for the maintenance of BBB integrity, our results indicate that the morphological change in the GVU induced by the absence of MLC1 is not enough to perturb BBB integrity.
