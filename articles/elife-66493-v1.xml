later in development this coupling between tail length and TE disappears. Here, we elucidate how this coupling is first established and why it disappears. Overexpressing cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes specifically improved translation of short-tailed mRNAs, thereby diminishing coupling between tail length and TE. Thus, strong coupling requires limiting PABPC, implying that in coupled systems longer-tail mRNAs better compete for limiting PABPC. In addition to expressing excess PABPC, post-embryonic mammalian cell lines had two other properties that prevented strong coupling: terminal-uridylation-dependent destabilization of mRNAs lacking bound PABPC, and a regulatory regime wherein PABPC contributes minimally to TE. Thus, these results revealed three fundamental mechanistic requirements for coupling and defined the context-dependent functions for PABPC, which promotes TE but not mRNA stability in coupled systems and mRNA stability but not TE in uncoupled systems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are microscopic biological factories that are constantly creating new proteins. To do so, a cell must first convert its master genetic blueprint, the DNA, into strands of messenger RNA or mRNA. These strands are subsequently translated to make proteins. Cells have two ways to adjust the number of proteins they generate so they do not produce too many or too few: by changing how many mRNA molecules are available for translation, and by regulating how efficiently they translate these mRNA molecules into proteins.</p><p>In animals, both unfertilized eggs and early-stage embryos lack the ability to create or destroy mRNAs, and consequently cannot adjust the number of mRNA molecules available for translation. These cells can therefore only regulate how efficiently each mRNA is translated. They do this by changing the length of the so-called poly(A) tail at the end of each mRNA molecule, which is made up of a long stretch of repeating adenosine nucleotides. The mRNAs with longer poly(A) tails are translated more efficiently than those with shorter poly(A) tails. However, this difference disappears in older embryos, when both long and short poly(A) tails are translated with equal efficiency, and it is largely unknown why.</p><p>To find out more, Xiang and Bartel studied frog eggs, and discovered that artificially raising levels of a protein that binds poly(A) tails, also known as PABPC, improved the translation of short-tailed mRNAs to create a situation in which both short- and long-tailed mRNAs were translated with near-equal efficiency. This suggested that short- and long-tailed mRNAs compete for limited amounts of the translation-enhancing PABPC, and that long-tailed mRNAs are better at it than short-tailed mRNAs. Further investigation revealed that eggs also had to establish the right conditions for PABPC to enhance translation and had to protect mRNAs not associated with PABPC from being destroyed before they could be translated.</p><p>Overall, Xiang and Bartel found that in eggs and early embryos, PABPC and poly(A) tails enhanced the translation of mRNAs but did not influence their stability, whereas later in development, they enhanced mRNA stability but not translation.</p><p>This research provides new insights into how protein production is controlled at different stages of animal development, from unfertilized eggs to older embryos. Understanding how this process is regulated during normal development is crucial for gaining insights into how it can become dysfunctional and cause disease. These findings may therefore have important implications for research into areas such as infertility, reproductive medicine and rare genetic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regulation of translation</kwd><kwd>regulation of mRNA stability</kwd><kwd>terminal uridylation</kwd><kwd>poly(A) tail</kwd><kwd>PABPC1</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartel</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartel</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Kehui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>For poly(A)-tail length to influence mRNA translational efficiency, poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) must be limiting, mRNAs lacking PABPC must be stable, and translation initiation must be sensitive to PABPC levels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated at their 3â² ends in a process associated with transcriptional termination. In the nucleus, these poly(A) tails can facilitate mRNA nucleocytoplasmic export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">KÃ¼hn and Wahle, 2004</xref>), whereas in the cytoplasm, they serve as molecular timers for mRNA decay, with their lengths becoming progressively shorter by deadenylation, which eventually leads to mRNA de-capping and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Shyu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldstrohm and Wickens, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The length of a poly(A) tail can also influence mRNA translational efficiency (TE). Pioneering studies in maturing oocytes and early embryos show that lengthening of poly(A) tails through cytoplasmic polyadenylation is critical for regulating gene expression during these early stages of animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">SallÃ©s et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sheets et al., 1995</xref>). Results from these and other single-gene studies in oocytes and early embryos had led to the notion that the length of a poly(A) tail generally correlates with TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eckmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). More recent transcriptome-wide studies confirm a strong global relationship between tail length and TE in oocytes and early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). However, in fish, frogs, and flies, this correlation diminishes near the time of gastrulation, and coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE is essentially nonexistent in post-embryonic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>; J.-E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, these global analyses reveal a developmental transition in how translation is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>), which closely follows the long-known maternal-to-zygotic transition in transcriptional control. The existence of this transition in translational control brings to the fore mechanistic questions as to how coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE is established in oocytes and early embryos and why this coupling disappears later in development.</p><p>Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPCs) are highly conserved RNA-binding proteins in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>). Although <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has only one PABPC (Pab1p), most animals contain multiple paralogs that have spatially and temporally varied expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wigington et al., 2014</xref>). PABPCs have high affinity to poly(A) sequences in vitro (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>Â ~5 nM for A<sub>25</sub>) and require at least 12 As for efficient binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">KÃ¼hn and Wahle, 2004</xref>). Binding of PABPCs to mRNA poly(A) tails can enhance translation, but the mechanism of this enhancement is unclear. One model posits that the mRNA forms a closed-loop structure mediated by the association of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G (a scaffolding protein) with both PABPC and the cap-binding protein eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thompson and Gilbert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wells et al., 1998</xref>). This association is proposed to stabilize the interaction between eIF4E and the mRNA 5â² cap and facilitate recruitment and/or recycling of ribosomes to increase translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kahvejian et al., 2001</xref>). However, despite direct visualization of loop-like assemblies both within some cells and in an in vitro reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christensen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wells et al., 1998</xref>), results of several studies have questioned the universality of this model among different mRNAs and biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adivarahan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amrani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rissland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thompson and Gilbert, 2017</xref>).</p><p>PABPCs can also influence mRNA stability, as shown in yeast. Genetic ablation of yeast Pab1p is lethal and causes lengthening of steady-state poly(A)-tail lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sachs and Davis, 1989</xref>), which is attributed to pre-mature mRNA decapping and compromised deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caponigro and Parker, 1995</xref>). Both yeast and mammalian PABPCs can interact with two mRNA deadenylation complexes PAN2-PAN3 and CCR4-NOT, and either promote or inhibit their activities in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">SchÃ¤fer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Webster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). Because mRNA decay is coupled to deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen et al., 2020</xref>), the deadenylation-stimulatory effects of PABPC would accelerate the demise of bound mRNAs, which contrasts to other studies suggesting PABPC protects mRNAs from degradation in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). The dichotomous and potentially conflicting functions of metazoan PABPC examined in vitro raise the question of the extents to which PABPC might influence mRNA poly(A)-tail length and stability in metazoan cells.</p><p>PABPCs are generally thought to coat mRNA poly(A) tails in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">KÃ¼hn and Wahle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>). However, the stoichiometry between PABPC and poly(A) sites might vary in different biological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Voeltz et al., 2001</xref>), and it is unclear whether this potentially variable stoichiometry might impact gene regulation in cells. Moreover, the possibility that PABPC might influence protein synthesis by affecting either mRNA stability or TE can complicate analysis of its molecular functions in different biological systems, leaving its mechanistic roles poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we uncover mechanistic requirements for coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE observed in oocytes and early embryos, showing that this coupling and the subsequent uncoupling observed later in development rely on a context-dependent switch in the function of PABPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Limiting PABPC is required for tail length to strongly influence TE of reporter mRNAs</title><p>To assay the influence of poly(A)-tail length on TE, we used an in vitro translation extract made from stage VI <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, where cytoplasmic polyadenylation leads to translational activation of the <italic>c-mos</italic>, <italic>cdk2</italic> and some cyclin mRNAsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter and Lasko, 2011</xref>).

In contrast, the same reporter mRNAs were translated nearly equally well in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, a post-embryonic differentiated system for which no coupling between tail length and TE was expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar results were observed for an analogous pair of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In both the oocyte and reticulocyte systems, the reporter mRNAs were stable with no detectable changes to their tail lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Thus, the large difference in luciferase signal observed between the short- and long-tailed reporters in the oocyte extract was attributable to a difference in TE. These results showed that the causal relationship between longer poly(A)-tail length and greater TE observed for some maturation-specific mRNAs in frog oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sheets et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stebbins-Boaz and Richter, 1994</xref>) is not unique to those mRNAs, and indicated that frog oocyte extracts provide a system for probing the mechanism that couples tail length to TE.</p><p>When considering the potential mechanisms for reading out tail length and promoting translation, a role for PABPC seemed plausible. For instance, translation might be sensitive to the number of PABPC molecules associated with an mRNA. In one mechanistic possibility, PABPC might be in excess over its binding sites within tails, such that tails are coated with the protein, as is generally thought to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">KÃ¼hn and Wahle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>), in which case, mRNAs with longer tails might be detected as those able to bind more PABPC molecules. At another mechanistic extreme, PABPC might be limiting, such that mRNAs compete with each other for PABPC binding, in which case, those with long poly(A)-tail lengths would compete more effectively and thereby preferentially benefit from any enhancement in TE that PABPC binding confers. To distinguish between these possibilities, we increased available PABPC in our oocyte extracts, reasoning that if PABPC were already coating the tails, adding more would have little effect, whereas if PABPC were limiting, adding more would diminish the competition for PABPC binding and thereby reduce the difference in TE observed between short-Â and long-tailed mRNAs. Accordingly, we purified recombinant <italic>Xenopus</italic> PABPC1 to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) and examined its influence when added to the in vitro translation extract derived from stage VI oocytes. As more PABPC1 was added, translation of the short-tailed reporter increased, with little change in translation of the long-tailed reporter, whereas adding equivalent amount of eGFP had little impact on translation of either reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This concentration-dependent diminution of coupling between tail-length and TE strongly supported the hypothesis that limiting PAPBC is required for strong coupling.</p><p>To investigate whether this requirement of limiting PABPC was restricted to our in vitro extracts or whether it also applied to living oocytes, we performed serial-injection experiments in oocytes. Stage VI frog oocytes were first injected with either <italic>PABPC1</italic> mRNA or a control, and after waiting 24 hr to allow PABPC1 protein to accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), oocytes were injected with the reporter mRNAs and assayed for luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Whereas injecting the control mRNA, <italic>eGFP</italic>, had no more influence than injecting water, injecting <italic>PABPC1</italic> mRNA significantly reduced the extent to which poly(A)-tail length and TE were coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Reporter poly(A)-tail lengths did not change over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>), which indicated that the increased relative translation of the short-tailed reporter mRNA was not due to elongated poly(A) tails.</p><p>Introducing additional PABPC into frog oocytes specifically improved translation of the short-tailed reporter while having little effect on translation of either the long-tailed reporter or reporters for which tails were replaced with either a stem-loop from the 3â² end of a histone mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ling et al., 2002</xref>) or a triple-helix from the 3â² end of the <italic>Malat1</italic> non-coding RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilusz et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The observation that mRNAs required a tail to benefit from added PABPC indicated that the effects of adding PABPC were mediated in cis through tail-bound PABPC molecules, and were direct and not some secondary consequence of altering translation. Moreover, the observation that PABPC had little effect on translation of long-tailed mRNAs suggested that these mRNAs competed for the limiting endogenous PABPC so effectively that binding of additional PABPC imparted no detectable additional benefit to their translation.</p><p>Introducing <italic>PABPC1(M161A)</italic>, which encodes a PABPC1 mutant that is unable to bind eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Groft and Burley, 2002</xref>), also diminished coupling but did so by repressing translation of the long-tailed reporter. The reduced translation of the long-tailed reporter was presumably due to a dominant-negative effect of replacing functional endogenous PABPC molecules with defectiveÂ ones. The observation that the long-tailed reporter was preferentially affected agreed with our conclusion that endogenous PABPC was limiting and preferentially binding to long-tailed mRNAs. The idea that the M161A mutant was unable to enhance translation in frog oocytes implied that the ability for PABPC to bind eIF4G and form the closed-loop structure is important for enhancing translation in this contextÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wakiyama et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results with reporters in oocytes and oocyte extracts confirmed both the positive effect of PABPC on translation and the causal relationship between poly(A)-tail length and TE in these systems.

Based on available mRNA-seq and mass spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nagaraj et al., 2011</xref>), PABPC1 and PABPC4 are the two major PABPC paralogs in HeLa cells, with PABPC1 four times more abundant than PABPC4 and the two together accounting forÂ &gt;95% of all PABPC in HeLa cells.

For each distribution, the abundance of tags was normalized to that of the spike-in tail-length standards.

Relative tag density was calculated by log-transforming linear tag density using normalized poly(A) tag counts. Median tail-length values are indicated (horizontal lines) and listed in parentheses. For RNase H northern blots, a DNA oligonucleotide complimentary to the 3â²-UTR was used to direct cleavage of the target mRNA by RNase H, leaving a 35-nt fragment of the 3â²-UTR appended to the poly(A) tail, which was resolved on a denaturing gel and detected by a radiolabeled probe.

Both northern blots and sequencing showed strong depletion of short-tailed isoforms for a cytoplasmic mRNA (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) after PABPC knockdown but no substantial change in the tail-length distribution of a mitochondrial mRNA (<italic>MT-CYB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Using sequencing data to examine the intragenic tail-length distributions of cytoplasmic mRNA from each of more than five thousand other genes revealed findings resembling those observed for <italic>GAPDH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâE</xref>). After knocking down PABPC1, the reduction in short-tailed mRNAs was typically most severe for mRNA isoforms with tail lengths ofÂ ~25 nt, and in the double knockdown, this dip atÂ ~25 nt became more pronounced, with reductions extending to all but the longest-tail isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâE</xref>). Indeed, for more than half of the genes examined,Â â¥2-fold reductions extended to isoforms with tails as long as 135 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâE</xref>). Similar results were observed when examining tail-length distributions in the NIH3T3 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), and when examining individual tail-length distributions for mRNAs of each of the top-expressed nuclear genes but not when examining those for mRNAs of mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2FâG</xref>).</p><p>These results, which showed that mRNAs with short tails were preferentially destabilized when PABPC was depleted provided genetic loss-of-function evidence that PABPC stabilizes mRNAs in mammalian cell lines. Although genetic evidence for the role of PABPC in mRNA stability has been reported in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caponigro and Parker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 1998</xref>), this function had not been established in mammalian cells. Although in principle the mRNA destabilization that we observed upon PABPC-depletion might have been indirect, two lines of evidence support the conclusion that this destabilization was a direct consequence of the loss of PABPC binding to poly(A) tails. First, destabilization preferentially occurred for short-tailed mRNAs, which were expected to be the least successful at competing for binding under conditions of limiting PABPC. Second, destabilization sharply diminished at tail lengths of 10â15 nt, which corresponded to the 12 nt poly(A) sequence reported to be the minimal length that can be bound by PABPC1 with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">KÃ¼hn and Pieler, 1996</xref>). Indeed, the modest loss observed for mRNAs with very short poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâE</xref>) suggested that even in control cells that had abundant PABPC, mRNAs with tails shorter than 12 nt were poorly bound by PABPCs, and thus PABPC depletion did not substantially influence their abundance.</p><p>A recent study observed similar poly(A) tail-length changes in PABPC1-depleted cells but attributed these changes to impaired deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). Because PABPC can promote deadenylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">SchÃ¤fer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uchida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Webster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yi et al., 2018</xref>), it is conceivable that the loss of PABPC would slow deadenylation, thereby increasing mRNA median tail lengths, as observed in Pab1-knockout yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caponigro and Parker, 1995</xref>). However, our analyses, which had the benefit of quantitative tail standards that enabled measurement of absolute abundance changes, revealed little added accumulation of long-tailed isoforms in PABPC-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplements 2B,Â F</xref>), indicating that a deadenylation defect was not the major cause for the perturbed tail-length distributions. Moreover, we found that mRNA half-life values, as determined by metabolic labeling, reduced significantly when PABPC was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3AâC</xref>), which concurred with the conclusion that PABPC knockdown destabilized short-tailed mRNA isoforms and argued against the previous assertion that PABPC knockdown impaired deadenylation, in that impaired deadenylation would have lengthened mRNA half-lives.</p><p>Taken together, these results show that PABPC binding stabilizes mRNAs of cultured mammalian cells; if PABPC becomes limiting in these cells, the short-tailed mRNAs become destabilized, presumably because they compete less effectively for PABPC. Most importantly, the destabilization of mRNAs that competed poorly for PABPC binding helps explain why limiting PABPC was insufficient to cause strong coupling in mammalian cell lines, in that strong coupling between tail length and TE would be difficult to establish in a regulatory regime in which short-tailed mRNA molecules that lack PABPC binding are degraded rather than translated less efficiently. Thus, these results identify a second mechanistic requirement for strong coupling between tail length and TE: In addition to limiting PABPC, strong coupling requires metabolic stability of the mRNAs that compete poorly for PABPC binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Terminal uridylation contributes to premature decay of short-tailed mRNAs in PABPC-depleted cells</title><p>The identification of this second requirement for strong coupling brought to the fore the question of why mRNAs that competed poorly for limiting PABPC were destabilized. To explore the possible mechanisms, we searched for perturbations that could restore stability of short-tailed mRNAs in HeLa cells undergoing PABPC knockdown, monitoring tail-length distributions of endogenous <italic>GAPDH</italic> using northern blots. As a positive control, expressing an siRNA-resistant PABPC1 restored stability of short-tailed species, as did frog ePAB, which further illustrated functional conservation of PABPC from different species and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, a PABPC1 variant with substitutions that disrupt its interaction with eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chorghade et al., 2017</xref>) also restored the stability of short-tailed species, implying that the classical closed loop is not necessary for PABPC1 to protect short-tailed mRNAs from degradation. Because PABPC has been implicated in inhibiting mRNA terminal uridylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2014</xref>) and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yi et al., 2018</xref>), and terminal uridylation has been linked to mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rissland and Norbury, 2009</xref>), we asked if terminal uridylation contributed to the loss of short-tailed mRNAs.

Knockdown of TUT4 and TUT7 in PABPC-depleted cells brought terminal uridylation of all tail-length isoforms to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâE</xref>) and, more importantly, preferentially rescued shorter-tail isoforms, thereby decreasing median tail lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results were consistent with those of our northern assays, and together, our results indicated that in these mammalian cells, limiting PABPC makes short- and medium-tailed mRNA isoforms that poorly compete for PABPC binding more susceptible to terminal uridylation, thereby accelerating their decay.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PABPC has little effect on TE in mammalian cell lines</title><p>Having found that destabilization of short-tailed mRNAs dampened coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE in PABPC-depleted mammalian cells, a key question remained regarding how mRNA TE, if not influenced strongly by poly(A)-tail length, was affected in these cells. To answer this question, we conducted global profiling of HeLa cells 48 hr after siRNA transfection, a time point at which PABPC1 and PABPC4 knockdowns were substantial but secondary effects were presumably not yet too severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We again implemented RNA-seq and ribosome-profiling protocols that enabled absolute TE comparison by using mitochondrial mRNAs for normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rooijers et al., 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, near-complete depletion of PABPCs had no detectable effect on global mRNA TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâB</xref>). Although the protein synthesis rate in double-knockdown cells was reduced to 75.7% of that observed in control cells, as measured by averaging ribosome-footprint changes observed for the 9697 analyzed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâB</xref>), which agreed with results of a global puromycin-based translation assay (78.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), this reduced protein synthesis was fully explained by the decrease in mRNA levels, as indicated by a distribution of TE changes that centered near zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâB</xref>).

Results of polysome profiling confirmed those of our sequencing-based methods, in that the reduction in translation output, as measured by the height of polysome peaks in double-knockdown cells, was attributable to an overall decrease of mRNA levels rather than to decreased TEs that would otherwise cause a shift of mRNA distribution from heavy to light fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

To examine this possibility, we monitored the dynamics of tail-length, mRNA-abundance, and translation changes soon after PABPC depletion, using the HCT116 PABPC1-AID degron cell line, in which PABPC1 was rapidly and efficiently depleted after adding IAA (85% within 30 min,Â &gt;99% within 1 hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Because PABPC1 is the primary PABPC isoform in HCT116 cells, depletion of PABPC1 alone caused substantial destabilization of shorter-tail mRNAs 1 hr after IAA addition, and this destabilization further increased after 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Accompanying the loss of shorter-tail mRNAs was a corresponding reduction of mRNA abundance for most genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, ribosome footprints declined in lockstep with mRNA abundance, leading to median TE changes that centered near zero over the entire course of PABPC1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, as PABPC became limiting, mRNAs that lost PABPC had no detectable reduction in TE before they were destabilized.</p><p>These data from the PABPC degron line allowed us to examine whether some coupling between tail length and TE might have occurred very soon after PABPC depletionâduring the time window in which PABPC had become limiting but short-tailed mRNAs had only started to degrade. However, no coupling between tail length and TE was detected over the course of rapid PABPC depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, in this context in which two conditions for strong coupling were satisfied (i.e. PABPC was limiting and short-tailed mRNAs were largely intact), no coupling was observed, presumably because coupling also requires a regulatory regime in which PABPC enhances translation.</p><p>These results show that in contrast to mRNAs of frog oocytes and presumably those of other coupled systems, mRNAs of HeLa and HCT116 cells do not require PABPC for efficient translation, which explains why poly(A)-tail lengths were not able to strongly influence TE after we reduced PABPC of these cells to limiting levels. Thus, these results identify a third mechanistic requirement for coupling between poly(A)-tail lengths and TE: coupling requires a regulatory regime in which PABPC affects mRNA translation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We find that three fundamental molecular conditions must be met for cells to use poly(A)-tail lengths to effectively regulate TE. First, PABPC must be limiting compared to the number of poly(A) sites available for binding. Under this condition, short-tailed mRNA isoforms that poorly compete for PABPC are less likely to have PABPC bound to their 3â² ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To the extent that PABPC is not bound, these isoforms lose the translation-activating capability of PABPC observed in coupled systems. Cooperative binding of adjacent PAPBC molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">SchÃ¤fer et al., 2019</xref>) would further enhance partitioning of limiting PABPC away from short-tailed mRNAs and onto longer-tailed mRNAs. When additional PABPC is introduced into a coupled system, short-tailed mRNAs benefit more from PABPC binding than long-tailed ones, which are more likely to already possess the number of PABPC molecules required for more efficient translation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE, and context-dependent roles of PABPC.</title><p>See text for details.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66493-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The requirement of limiting PABPC for coupling TE to poly(A)-tail length raises the question of the stoichiometry between PABPC and its sites in the poly(A) tails and whether this stoichiometry changes during the embryonic switch of gene-regulatory regimes. Our sequencing results indicated that the mRNAs of a stage VI frog oocyte haveÂ ~2.8Ã10<sup>11</sup> PABPC sites (~7Ã10<sup>10</sup> sites per 1 Âµg total RNA,Â ~4 Âµg total RNA per oocyte), which concurred with the previous estimate of 2Â ~Â 3Ã10<sup>11</sup> sites per oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sagata et al., 1980</xref>). The amount of PABPC (including both ePAB and PABPC1) in frog oocytes has been estimated at either 1 Ã 10<sup>11</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosson et al., 2002</xref>) or 1.4 Ã 10<sup>11</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smits et al., 2014</xref>) molecules per oocyte. Our results showing that PABPC activity is limiting in frog oocytes, agreed with these estimates that imply that PABPC levels are sufficient to bind no more than half of the available PABPC sites. Poly(A)-site occupancy would be even lower if some PABPC proteins were sequestered from the mRNA pool or in an inactive form, which could be conferred by factors that either bind to or post-translationally modify PABPC to affect its ability to either bind poly(A) tails or promote translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khaleghpour et al., 2001</xref>). Until stage 15, developing frog embryos maintain the number of PABPC sites at a level resembling that of oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sagata et al., 1980</xref>). In contrast, the total amount of PABPC molecules increases significantly, nearly tripling by stage 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peshkin et al., 2019</xref>)âthe stage at which the coupling between tail length and TE starts to disappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). This increased PABPC would shift the stoichiometry toward PABPC being less limiting. Importantly, dysregulation of this tightly controlled stoichiometry not only disrupts the normal gene-regulatory regime but also can cause severe consequences during oocyte maturation and embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gorgoni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wormington et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In our overexpression experiment, we increased the level of PABPC1 toÂ &gt;6 times its endogenous level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). When considering that the ratio between endogenous PABPC1 and ePAB is about 1:3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">WÃ¼hr et al., 2014</xref>), the estimated increase in overall PABPC level wasÂ &gt;2.5-fold, which might have been sufficient to saturate the poly(A) sites. Despite this potential saturation and diminished coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE, coupling was not completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3CâE</xref>). To the extent that poly(A) sites were saturated, the residual coupling suggests that oocytes might have a mechanism for counting bound PABC molecules that enables some coupling to persist even after PABPC overexpression saturates the poly(A) sites. One way to achieve this counting would be for a critical PABPC-interacting factor to also be limiting such that long-tailed mRNAs, with their higher number of bound PABPC molecules would more effectively compete for binding to this limiting factor. A top candidate for such a factor is eIF4G. Indeed, when eIF4G was overexpressed together with PABPC1 in frog oocytes, the coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE was further reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). The idea that PABPC interactions with limiting eIF4G might favor translation of long-tailed mRNAs in oocytes also helps to explain why overexpressing the PABPC1 M161A mutant was most detrimental to translation from the long-tailed reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Another way that some coupling could persist even after overexpressing saturating levels of PABPC is through sequestration of some mRNAs away from the translation machinery. One likely location for such sequestration would be germ granules, which have been implicated in regulating mRNA translation in oocytes of diverse animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>). This mechanism might reinforce coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE, perhaps by selectively sequestering short-tailed mRNAs from the active translation pool.</p><p>The second condition required for strong coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE is the survival of short-tailed mRNAs under conditions in which PABPC is limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This condition was not met in the post-embryonic mammalian cell lines we examined. When PABPC was depleted in these uncoupled systems, many mRNA molecules, particularly short-tailed ones that presumably competed poorly for the remaining PABPC, were degraded. The preferential loss of mRNAs not bound by PABPC reduced the range of tail lengths, which correspondingly reduced the range of TEs that could potentially be imparted by coupling between tail length and TE. This reduced range also presumably reduced the ability to detect coupling, although some ability was expected to be retained, as indicated by an analysis in which data from a coupled system was sampled to match the more restricted tail-length distribution of an uncoupled system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). More importantly, the loss of mRNAs not bound by PABPC reduced the number of PABPC-binding sites, thereby reducing the extent to which these sites were in excess over PABPC and thus reducing coupling between tail length and TE.</p><p>In oocytes and early embryos, mRNA decapping is uncoupled from deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gillian-Daniel et al., 1998</xref>), which helps explain why short-tailed mRNAs survive in these systems despite our finding that they have limiting PABPC activity. We suggest two nonexclusive mechanistic explanations for this unusual decoupling of decapping from deadenylation. First, oocytes and early embryos have relatively low expression of decapping enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peshkin et al., 2019</xref>). Second, mRNA terminal uridylation activity is very low in frog oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2018</xref>), and it remains low throughout early embryonic development and only starts to increase dramatically after zygotic genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). This developmental delay of terminal uridylation might help ensure the survival of short-tailed mRNAs when PABPC is limiting and thereby enable strong coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE in oocytes and early embryos. Later in development, short-tailed mRNAs are protected from terminal uridylation by saturating PABPC, which helps explain why deletion of TUT4 and TUT7 in mouse somatic cells has little impact on mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morgan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The third condition required for coupling between tail length and TE is that PABPC must have the ability to influence TE of bound mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the coupled system of frog oocytes, increasing PABPC levels substantially improved TE of nearly all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâE</xref>). In contrast, in uncoupled systems such as HeLa and HCT116 cells, severe depletion of PABPC, such that short- and medium-tailed mRNAs were markedly destabilized, had no consistent impact on mRNA TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and F</xref>). We suspect that the differential effect of PABPC on TE observed in coupled and uncoupled systems is related to the divergent levels of basal translation initiation observed between these systems. Indeed, the overall translation measured by polysome profiles in oocytes and early embryos is much lower than that observed in either later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Woodland, 1974</xref>) or post-embryonic mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), which provides the opportunity for a translation-activating effect of PABPC to be more prominent in the coupled systems.</p><p>Our results showing that PABPCs, while playing a crucial role in protecting mRNA from premature decay, have minimal contribution to translation in post-embryonic mammalian cell lines might seem to contradict the well-accepted function of PABPC as a translational activator. However, many previous studies that established the role for PABPC in promoting translation were carried out in frog oocytes or early embryonic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), where we found PABPC to globally enhance TE. Other previous studies were conducted in vitro, with mixed results: in reconstituted systems, PABPC is dispensable for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>), and in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, PABPC has a minimal effect on translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinton et al., 2007</xref>), whereas in some other cell extracts, PABPC activates translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kahvejian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tarun and Sachs, 1995</xref>). Additional experiments will be required to determine whether this discrepancy between results we obtained from living cells and those obtained in some post-embryonic cell extracts are attributable to differences between cell types or to differences between cellular cytoplasm and in vitro extractsâperhaps imparted by dilution of translational components in extracts. Such studies will need to differentiate between the translation-activation and mRNA-stabilization activities of PABPC. In the meantime, it is helpful to know that PABPC stabilizes mRNAs of post-embryonic metazoan cells and that the two activities of PABPC can be context dependent, such that in frog oocytes PABPC strongly activates translation and has no effect on mRNA stability, whereas in mammalian cell lines it stabilizes mRNAs and has no detectable effect on TE.</p><p>The dual potential of PABPC in stabilizing mRNA and promoting translation bestows PABPC with distinct and context-dependent roles in regulating protein synthesis. In oocytes and early embryos, the lack of mRNA transcription and degradation leaves differential TE as the primary option for modulating protein synthesis. Our work indicates that in this context limiting PABPC proteins bind primarily to mRNAs with longer poly(A) tails and activate their translation. In contrast, in post-embryonic mammalian cell lines, where transcription, mRNA degradation, and translation are each operating at high efficiency, PABPCs protect mRNAs from pre-mature decay, enabling them to contribute the proper amount of protein during their lifetimes, but without any additional enhancement of TE. These context-dependent activities are not only crucial for understanding how coupling between tail length and TE is established in oocytes and early embryos and why it is lost later in development, they also provide mechanistic insight into the effects of the many posttranscriptional regulatory phenomena that alter poly(A)-tail lengths. For example, during miRNA-mediated repression, the ArgonauteâmiRNA complex binds target mRNAs and recruits factors that displace PABPC from the poly(A) tail and accelerate tail shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fabian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giraldez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moretti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rissland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). In early zebrafish embryos, these effects are expected to disadvantage target mRNAs at competing for limited PABPC, which in this context would reduce their TE without changing their stability, thereby explaining why miRNAs primarily cause translational repression in these early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). However, in later embryonic development as well as in post-embryonic mammalian cells, displacement of PABPC and accelerated tail shortening would reduce PABPC binding to target mRNAs, which in this context would reduce their stability without changing their TE, thereby explaining why miRNAs primarily cause mRNA destabilization in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>How PABPC promotes translation remains an enigma, although the closed-loop model has offered a sound mechanistic explanation. The interaction between eIF4G and PABPC is well characterized and provides a physical link connecting both ends of the mRNA, and some studies are able to catch a glimpse of possible circular structures of mRNAs in fixed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christensen et al., 1987</xref>) or in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wells et al., 1998</xref>). However, recent single-molecule imaging studies in mammalian cells question the widespread existence of mRNA closed-loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adivarahan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koch et al., 2020</xref>). Our finding that depletion of PABPC had minimal impact on TE in mammalian cell lines supports a model in which pervasive eIF4GâPABPC-associated looping of mRNAs is generally lacking in uncoupled systems. This idea is consistent with the finding that the interaction between eIF4G and PABPC is dispensable in yeast (E.-H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2011</xref>) and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adivarahan et al., 2018</xref>), both of which are uncoupled systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the eIF4GâPABPC interaction is critical during frog oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wakiyama et al., 2000</xref>), a process that relies on coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter and Lasko, 2011</xref>), and our results showed that increasing PABPC had a global effect on upregulating TE in frog oocytes. Moreover, translation of a long-tailed reporter was substantially repressed when the PABPC M161A mutant was overexpressed in frog oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the closed-loop structure, if it exists, might be more prevalent in coupled systems, such as oocytes or early embryos.</p><p>Our experiments examined only a few systems that inherently possessed either all or none of the three molecular conditions that we found to be required for strong coupling between tail length and TE, thatÂ is, limiting PABPC activity, stabilization of mRNAs lacking a bound PABPC, and PABPC-sensitive translation. Whether these conditions are broadly applicable to many other systems remains to be investigated. For example, some cells might fall in between the two extremes, processing one or two of these conditions but not all three. The results of our experiments in which we removed one of the conditions from frog oocytes or imposed one or two of the conditions in post-embryonic mammalian cells, predict that such cells that inherently fall between the two extremes have minimal if any coupling. Indeed, the concept that multiple conditions must be met before strong coupling can be established helps to explain why coupling between tail length and TE has been so infrequently detected outside the gene regulatory regime operating in oocytes and early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

PAL-seq v3 differs from PAL-seq v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen et al., 2020</xref>) in two major ways: (1) Barcodes were embedded in the 3â² adapters so that different samples could be pooled for downstream stages of library construction. (2) Sequencing was performed with cDNA rather than PCR-amplified cDNA. Each reaction was set up in a total volume of 20 Âµl by mixing total RNA (0.3â3 Âµg) with two sets of tail-length standards (0.1 ng of each set per 1 Âµg total RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>), two splint DNA oligos (55 pmol A-splint and 2.75 pmol U-splint, which allowed polyadenylated RNAs with a terminal uridine to be more efficiently captured) and one barcoded 3â² adapter (50 pmol). Poly(A)-selected mRNA from zebrafish ZF4 cell line (0.1 ng per Âµg total RNA) was also added to mammalian RNA samples to enable additional assessment of tail-length measurement reproducibility. The RNAâDNA mix was incubated at 65Â°C for 5 min, and the temperature was gradually lowered to 16Â°C (0.1Â°C per sec) before other component were added to a volume of 30 Âµl containing 0.2 mM ATP, one unit/Âµl RNasin Plus, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1x T4 RNA Ligase 2 reaction buffer and 0.5 units/Âµl T4 RNA Ligase 2. After incubation at 16Â°C for 16 hr, EDTA (1 Âµl, 0.5 M, pH 8.0) was added to stop ligation and samples to be sequenced together (with different barcodes) were combined, phenol/chloroform extracted, and precipitated with ethanol. Ligated RNA was resuspended in 20 Âµl water, mixed with 180 Âµl RNase T1 buffer (20 mM sodium citrate pH 5.0, 1 mM EDTA, 7 M urea), heated to 50Â°C for 5 min, and chilled on ice for 5 min, before adding 1.6 Âµl RNase T1 (one unit/Âµl, Thermo Fisher, AM2283). After incubating the reaction at 23Â°C for 30 min, RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated using the Precipitation/Inactivation Buffer in the RNase T1 kit. Fragments between 150 and 760 nt were gel-purified, selected on beads, 5â²-end phosphorylated, ligated to a 5â² adapter, and used for cDNA synthesis in the same way as in our implementation of TAIL-seq, except one of the four phased 5â² adapters was used and cDNAs with lengths between 200 and 760 nt were selected. Sequencing was performed similarly as in PAL-seq v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen et al., 2020</xref>) but with some differences: (1) 1 fmol cDNA rather than PCR-amplified cDNA was used per lane. (2) A single primer was used to obtain two reads. (3) After cluster generation and sequencing-primer hybridization, and before extension of the primer through the poly(A)-tail region using the Klenow fragment, 16 dark cycles were performed in order to extend the sequencing primer past the barcode and constant regions of the 3â² adapters as well as past two nucleotides corresponding to the RNA 3â² termini. (4) 40 cycles of standard sequencing-by-synthesis were performed to yield the first sequencing read (read 1). (5) After obtaining read 1, the flow cell was stripped, the same sequencing primer was annealed, and 260 cycles of standard sequencing-by-synthesis were performed to read the barcode (six nt, which required seven cycles), a constant segment of the 3â² adapter (eight nt, which required only seven cycles because of an extra cycle in the barcode region), and the sequence of the RNA, beginning at its 3â² terminus, which revealed whether the RNA had a terminal uridine and provided information used to measure the length of the poly(A) tail.

Therefore, we developed the PAL-seq v4 protocol, in which we made several changes. The 3â²-ligation reaction was essentially the same, except that one 3â² adapter was used for all samples. After the ligation, each sample was processed separately rather than mixed. Ligated RNA was resuspended in 10 Âµl water and fragmented in a 100 Âµl rather than 200 Âµl volume, and fragments with sizes between 130 and 760 nt were then gel purified. For reverse transcription, different primers containing the multiplexing barcode sequences as well as a region with five random nucleotides was used. After cDNA elution from the beads, half of each sample was saved at â20Â°C for future use. cDNA samples to be sequenced on the same lane in a flow cell were combined, ethanol-precipitated and gel-purified as in PAL-seq v3, except cDNA fragments with sizes between 190 nt and 800 nt were selected. Sequencing cluster generation was performed similarly to PAL-seq v3, using 0.3 fmol cDNA mixture for each lane. Read 1 started with 12 cycles of standard sequencing-by-synthesis that first sequenced the 5-nt random region (used to call clusters) and then sequenced the 6-nt barcode region (which required seven cycles) with a custom primer. The flow cell was stripped, a second sequencing primer annealed, and two dark cycles were performed in order to extend this primer past the two nucleotides corresponding to the RNA 3â² termini. The custom extension of the primer through the poly(A) tail region with Klenow was then performed, as in PAL-seq v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen et al., 2020</xref>) and v3, followed by 40 cycles of standard sequencing-by-synthesis to complete the read 1, which was generated using two sequencing primers and had a total length of 52 nt (12 cycles before and 40 cycles after the Klenow reaction).

For each library, 1% of the filtered read clusters (but no more than 50,000 and no less than 5000) were randomly picked as the training set for determining the Hidden Markov Model.</p><p>For each Illumina sequencing cluster, average intensities of each channel from position 15â50 of read one were used to normalize intensities of each channel in read 2. Then a T-signal value for each cycle of read two in each cluster was calculated by dividing normalized intensity from T channel by the sum of normalized intensities from the other three channels. If the T-signal was 0 for a specific cycle, the T-signal values from neighboring cycles (up to 10, minimum 5) were averaged to infer the value for that cycle. If a cluster had more than five cycles with a read 2 T-signal value of 0, the cluster was discarded. A five-state mixed Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (from python ghmm package) was then used to decode the sequence of states that occurred in read 2. It consisted of an initiation state (state 0), a strong poly(A)-tail state (state 1), a weak poly(A)-tail state (state 2), a weak non-poly(A)-tail state (state 3) and a strong non-poly(A)-tail state (state 4). All reads started in state 0, and all states were only allowed to go forward (from 0 to 4).

For each cluster, the poly(A) tail length was determined by summing the number of states in state 1 and 2. Each cluster assigned to a specific gene by read one was considered as a poly(A) tag. When evaluating tail-length distributions of mRNAs from individual genes, only results from genes with at least 100 tags were considered. Note that the HiSeq 2500 machine in high-throughput mode raises the laser intensities after 50 cycles in read 2, causing irregular T-signal at this position and lower-than-expected state transition predicted by the Hidden Markov Model.

revisions, shown below.

It will therefore be of broad interest to readers from many areas of molecular biology including those interested in translation, mRNA stability, development and gene expression in general. The authors convincingly set out three criteria that must be met for coupling of poly(A) tail length with translation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The molecular basis of coupling between poly(A)-tail length and translational efficiency&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Timothy W Nilsen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were quite positive about the work. Nevertheless reviewer 3 raised a few concerns and reviewer 2 had some relatively minor suggestions. Please address these issues as thoroughly as possible. It seems like revision in the text will be sufficient.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an excellent manuscript in which Xiang and Bartel use an abundance of approaches to provide compelling evidence relevant to the coupling between poly(A)-tail length and translational efficiency. Without reiterating the results, the data are convincing and the paper is clearly written. Any concerns are too trivial to articulate. Publication of the work is recommended as is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1 â there is substantial variability across different extracts. For example, the difference in translation of short vs. long tail reporter is 15.2-fold (1B), 33.8-fold (1C), and 7.4-fold (1E). What is the source of this variability? Also, some panels have error bars and others do not. Can error bars be included in all panels?</p><p>Figure 1C and 1E â How does the overexpression level of PABPC compare to endogenous levels?</p><p>Please define &quot;poly(A) tags&quot; the first time it is mentioned (Figure legend 2?)</p><p>Figure 2c â are the more prominent bands eGFP and PABPC1? If so, please label them.</p><p>There are several different sequencing methods used (TAIL-seq, PAL-seq v3, PAL-seq v4) â why was a given method chosen? It would be helpful to mention which method was used in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. No error bars are presented in Figure 1A-B, why is this the case?</p><p>2. The authors conclude the loss of PABPC in cell lines results in the selective elimination of transcripts with short poly(A) tails. Can the authors exclude a role for poly(A) tail elongation in the absence of PABPC?</p><p>3. The authors conclude broad rules from a single coupled system and cell line experiments, where the depletion of PABPC has drastic consequences to the transcriptome (~70% reduction in mRNA abundance) and likely to the cell. The authors should acknowledge these limitations.</p><p>4. The authors fail to integrate previous findings in the model presented in figure 7. Morgan et al., 2017 have shown that loss of TUT4 and TUT7 in several cell systems and mouse tissues does not impact the transcriptome. The authors need to discuss these findings and integrate them into their model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66493.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1 â there is substantial variability across different extracts.

For experiments done in extracts, one source of variability might have been the different batches of oocyte lysates. Another might have been the different buffer conditions that resulted from protein-storage buffer being added to the reactions that differed by 33.8-fold but not to those that differed by 15.2-fold.</p><p>To address the question of experimental variability and lack of error bars, these three experiments were repeated with replicates. When repeating these experiments, we used <italic>Nluc/Rluc</italic> reporters and an <italic>Fluc</italic> normalization control that had a histone mRNA 3â²-end stem-loop. The new results resembled the original ones and are now shown as the (Figure 1B, C, E and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B), whereas one of the original panels has been moved to the supplement (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C and 1E â How does the overexpression level of PABPC compare to endogenous levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to quantify the overexpression of ePAB relative its endogenous level by western, but the ePAB antibody did not seem to recognize the tagged ePAB protein we overexpressed. We observed a signal for the FLAG tag but not for overexpressed ePAB, which migrated slower on the gel. Nonetheless, we were able to detect overexpressed PABPC1 (as shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E) and estimated that it reached a level more than six times that of endogenous PABPC1. This information is now mentioned and discussed in our revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please define &quot;poly(A) tags&quot; the first time it is mentioned (Figure legend 2?)</p></disp-quote><p>Weâve added the definition in the Figure 2 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2c â are the more prominent bands eGFP and PABPC1?

No error bars are presented in Figure 1A-B, why is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>When performing these experiments with different extracts, we observed consistent effects of adding PABPC but variable baseline ratios, presumably because of variable quality of the ovary we obtained from the vendor. To assess technical variability, we repeated the experiments in triplicate using the same batch of oocyte extract. Weâve replaced the original Figure 1AâB with the results of these new experiments, with error bars showing standard deviation for the technical replicates, and weâve moved the original panel A to Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors conclude the loss of PABPC in cell lines results in the selective elimination of transcripts with short poly(A) tails. Can the authors exclude a role for poly(A) tail elongation in the absence of PABPC?</p></disp-quote><p>The idea that short poly(A) tails might have globally elongated with no change in mRNA stability is not supported by our findings that (1) absolute levels of long-tailed mRNAs (determined using normalization to spike-in standards) remained constant and did not increase, (2) mRNA half-lives did decrease, and (3) TUT4/7, which have known roles in mRNA degradation but not tail lengthening, were required for the loss of short tails.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors conclude broad rules from a single coupled system and cell line experiments, where the depletion of PABPC has drastic consequences to the transcriptome (~70% reduction in mRNA abundance) and likely to the cell. The authors should acknowledge these limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason we created the PABPC-AID fusion and examined the effects of PAPBC depletion before large changes to the transcriptome could occur was to avoid the secondary effects of concern to the referee. Nonetheless, we now acknowledge the limitation of examining only a few systems in the last paragraph of our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors fail to integrate previous findings in the model presented in figure 7. Morgan et al., 2017 have shown that loss of TUT4 and TUT7 in several cell systems and mouse tissues does not impact the transcriptome. The authors need to discuss these findings and integrate them into their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We mention the results of Morgan et al. and integrate them into our model in our revised discussion. The finding that loss of TUT4 and TUT7 in somatic mouse cells does not influence mRNA abundance is consistent with our hypothesis that PABPC is not limiting in these cells. According to our model, in these cells in which PABPC is normally not limiting, PABPC coats the mRNA poly(A) tails thereby protecting them from TUT4 and TUT7.</p></body></sub-article></article>
