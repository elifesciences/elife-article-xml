However, the relevance of circadian clocks in fungal–fungal interactions remains largely unexplored. We sought to characterize a functional clock in the biocontrol agent <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> to assess its importance in the mycoparasitic interaction against the phytopathogen <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>. Thus, we confirmed the existence of circadian rhythms in <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, which are temperature-compensated and modulated by environmental cues such as light and temperature. Nevertheless, the presence of such molecular rhythms appears to be highly dependent on the nutritional composition of the media. Complementation of a clock null (<italic>Δfrq</italic>) <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> strain with the <italic>T. atroviride</italic>-negative clock component (<italic>tafrq</italic>) restored core clock function, with the same period observed in the latter fungus, confirming the role of <italic>tafrq</italic> as a <italic>bona fide</italic> core clock component. Confrontation assays between wild-type and clock mutant strains of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> and <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, in constant light or darkness, revealed an inhibitory effect of light on <italic>T. atroviride’s</italic> mycoparasitic capabilities. Interestingly, when confrontation assays were performed under light/dark cycles, <italic>T. atroviride’</italic>s overgrowth capacity was enhanced when inoculations were at dawn compared to dusk. Deleting the core clock-negative element FRQ in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, but not in <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, was vital for the daily differential phenotype, suggesting that the <italic>B. cinerea</italic> clock has a more significant influence on the result of this interaction. Additionally, we observed that <italic>T. atroviride</italic> clock components largely modulate development and secondary metabolism in this fungus, including the rhythmic production of distinct volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus, this study provides evidence on how clock components impact diverse aspects of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> lifestyle and how daily changes modulate fungal interactions and dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic></kwd><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>organismal interactions</kwd><kwd>photobiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020884</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FONDECYT Regular 1211715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larrondo</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020884</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FONDECYT Postdoc 3180328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seguel-Avello</surname><given-names>Aldo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020884</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FONDECYT Postdoc 3190628</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olivares-Yánez</surname><given-names>Consuelo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the International Research Scholar program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larrondo</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020884</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio ICN17_022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Canessa</surname><given-names>Paulo</given-names></name><name><surname>Larrondo</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The biocontrol fungus <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> possess a functional circadian clock, whose components impact the production of secondary metabolites and also play a role in the interaction with fungi such as the phytopathogen <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Trichoderma</italic> species are cosmopolitan soil fungi found in several substrates, including decaying wood and fungal fruiting bodies, establishing beneficial interactions with plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carreras-Villaseñor et al., 2012</xref>;

Additionally, light is also perceived as a stress signal, triggering conidiation: a light pulse (LP) given to a dark-grown <italic>T. atroviride</italic> generates several biochemical changes driving the formation of a green ring of conidia at the edge of the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casas-Flores et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casas-Flores et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Galun and Gressel, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schmoll et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, two genes called blue light regulators 1 and 2 (<italic>blr1</italic> and <italic>blr2</italic>) were identified as responsible for light-induced conidiation. The BLR proteins are homologs of the transcription factors WC-1 and WC-2, which in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> form the white collar complex (WCC), responsible for light and circadian regulation in this fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casas-Flores et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Froehlich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montenegro-Montero et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, light can be directly perceived thanks to the presence of a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain in WC-1/BLR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corrochano, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, BLRs have been described as critical for the effect of light on growth, oxidative stress responses, and light-controlled gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cervantes-Badillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Esquivel-Naranjo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Friedl et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Garcia-Esquivel et al., 2016</xref>). Studies on BLR1 and BLR2 and the presence of a <italic>frq</italic> homolog that is induced by light, and whose expression depends on BLR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Garcia-Esquivel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Steyaert et al., 2010a</xref>), suggest the presence of a functional clock and underlying circadian regulation in this fungus. However, to date, neither circadian oscillations of <italic>tafrq</italic>/TaFRQ levels nor circadian phenotypes have been reported in <italic>T. atroviride;</italic> meanwhile, various studies have failed at detecting overt or molecular circadian rhythms in several fungi across fungal clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cascant-Lopez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hevia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Larrondo and Canessa, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Circadian rhythms have emerged as an adaptation to Earth’s rotation around its axis, allowing organisms to keep track of time, anticipating and adapting to periodic and predictable environmental changes through the temporal coordination of gene expression, metabolic pathways, physiological responses, and even behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hurley et al., 2016</xref>). Recent findings have shown that interactions between organisms may also be subjected to circadian regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hevia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Larrondo and Canessa, 2019</xref>). And while several reports have highlighted the importance of the plant clock in plant–pathogen interactions, there has been scarce information from the pathogen perspective. Yet, it has been reported that the interaction between the phytopathogenic fungus <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> largely depends on the fungal functional circadian clock<italic>,</italic> with virulence reaching higher levels at nighttime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hevia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ingle et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ascomycete <italic>N. crassa</italic> is a salient model in chronobiology due to its robust circadian phenotype of daily spore production at dawn and a wealth of molecular resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Its central oscillator is based on a negative transcriptional–translational feedback loop (TTFL), a shared core architecture across phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunlap, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dunlap and Loros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Loros, 2020</xref>). In <italic>N. crassa</italic>, the WCC activates the expression of the TTFL-negative element, <italic>frequency</italic> (<italic>frq</italic>), which leads to increasing levels of the FRQ protein, that starts recruiting kinases and negatively regulates its own expression by phosphorylating and inactivating the WCC. FRQ itself is progressively modified until reaching its maximum phosphorylation state at nighttime, losing its affinity for WCC and allowing a new transcription/translation cycle to start. Both <italic>frq</italic> mRNA and FRQ protein levels oscillate during this process with a period close to 22.5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montenegro-Montero et al., 2015</xref>). Albeit <italic>wc-1, wc-2,</italic> and <italic>frq</italic> homologs are present in several fungi, the description of overt clock phenotypes, as the molecular characterization of circadian rhythms in fungal species besides <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa,</italic> has been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montenegro-Montero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salichos and Rokas, 2010</xref>). Indeed, despite different studies addressing the latter, there are seldom examples of characterized circadian oscillators in other fungi and few studies exploring fungal circadian phenomena and clock components. Among these is <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, where rhythms in BcFRQ1 levels were confirmed, along with BcFRQ1’s key role in conferring the daily difference on virulence potential. Remarkably, the evidence also suggests that in <italic>B. cinerea</italic> BcFRQ1 plays an extra-circadian role in developmental decisions as <italic>Δbcfrq1</italic> displays altered developmental phenotypes observed even under conditions where the clock function is abolished, such as constant light, and in contrast to the phenotype observed in the absence of BcWCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hevia et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To deepen the role of circadian regulation in organismal interactions, and simultaneously evaluate the presence of a functional circadian clock in <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, we sought to assess the daily oscillations of TaFRQ expression under free-running conditions while assessing canonical clock properties and the clock’s ability to respond to environmental stimuli. By generating clock mutant strains, we evaluated the impact of core clock components in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> secondary metabolism, developmental programs, and on its mycoparasitic capabilities against different <italic>B. cinerea</italic> strains, including those deficient in circadian regulation. Overall, our results reveal the presence of a functional circadian clock in <italic>T. atroviride,</italic> a role of core clock components in the modulation of mycoparasitic interactions, and extra-circadian functions for TaFRQ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>T. atroviride</italic> bears a functional circadian clock</title><p>We generated TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup>, a translational fusion reporter between luciferase and TaFRQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to assess oscillations of this putative <italic>T. atroviride</italic> core clock-negative element and quantify bioluminescence levels under free-running conditions (DD). Monitoring LUC activity after 3 days of constant light (LL) or light-dark (LD) 12:12 hr entrainment cycles, at 25°C, failed to reveal oscillations in multiple tested growth media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) with only one exception: GYEC, where weak but distinguishable oscillations were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Under the rationale that culture media appeared to be critical for <italic>T. atroviride’s</italic> oscillations and considering that the fungus also interacts with plants, we decided to modify the GYEC media by adding plant-derived material, ground peas (GYEC+ peas), observing that the quality of the oscillations greatly improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Notably, the results suggest that these rhythms are highly dependent on the nutritional composition of the media. The period estimation of those oscillations by fast Fourier transform nonlinear least squares (FFT-NLS) using BioDare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zielinski et al., 2014</xref>) revealed an average period of 26.5 ± 0.36 hr. The phase of the first peak of TaFRQ expression occurs at DD 22, which corresponds to circadian time CT8, and is roughly similar (albeit slightly advanced) compared to the phase of FRQ<sup>LUC</sup> expression (CT11) described in <italic>N. crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Larrondo et al., 2012</xref>). We could also observe oscillations (although weaker ones) by resetting the clock with 3 days in LL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and also with a short 20 min LP after 48 hr in DD, which elevates TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> levels, boosting sustained oscillations for at least 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Likewise, a low-temperature pulse of 4°C for 6 hr also served as a cue to reset the clock, shifting its phase almost 12 hr, similar to what can be seen in <italic>N. crassa</italic> when monitoring FRQ<sup>LUC</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Larrondo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). After both pulse protocols, the period also remained in the 26 hr range (26.30 hr and 26.49 hr, respectively), exhibiting even better oscillations after the perturbation, as previously observed for clock reporters under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). These findings indicate that circadian oscillations of TaFRQ can be entrained by LD cycles or shifted by light and temperature pulses. Indeed, the analyses of these perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) revealed a mean phase delay of 4.29 hr between LD and LP entrainment and 10.85 hr between LL reset and 4°C pulses, further showing that these oscillations behave as one would expect from a circadian oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heintzen and Liu, 2007</xref>). To complement these results, we used a Western blot with anti-LUC antibodies to obtain evidence of TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> oscillations in constant darkness over a 52 hr time course, further supporting the circadian variation of TaFRQ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Importantly, we also evaluated if the observed TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> oscillations were temperature-compensated, meaning that they should maintain about the same period in a physiological range of temperatures. Thus, TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> rhythms were assessed after 3 days in 12:12 LD entrainment regimes at 20, 22, 25, and 28°C and monitored in DD at the corresponding temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). While low-amplitude oscillations were observed at 20°C, changes in TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> levels exhibited higher amplitude at 22°C than at 25°C, whereas oscillations were lost at 28°C, indicating that of the tested temperatures the <italic>Trichoderma</italic> clock runs better at 22°C. To quantify the degree of temperature compensation, we calculated the Q<sub>10</sub> between 20 and 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), obtaining a Q<sub>10</sub> of 1.05 ± 0.07, which is in the range for temperature compensation described in other circadian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kusakina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mattern et al., 1982</xref>). Thus, the results show that the <italic>T. atroviride’</italic>s <italic>TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup></italic> circadian oscillations can compensate in a temperature range between 20 and 25°C, further supporting that a circadian clock is responsible for the observed rhythms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Circadian oscillations of TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> are reset by light and temperature and are temperature-compensated.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Raw TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> levels were quantified under DD in strains previously entrained for 3 days under LD (12:12 hr) cycles in GYEC (<bold>A</bold>) or GYEC+ peas (<bold>B</bold>) culture media.

However, no overt rhythmic conidiation was observed in these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), with or without LD entrainment, suggesting that whilst the core clock may function, the normal outputs of the clock in <italic>N. crassa</italic> may no longer be responding. Finally, to get a first glimpse of TaFRQ expression in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, we conducted a short 12 hr time course, confirming that after an LL to DD transfer this heterologous clock component is degraded as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TaFRQ is required for proper conidiation in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> after light exposure and mechanical injury</title><p>While in <italic>Neurospora</italic> FRQ appears to solely act as a clock component, in <italic>B. cinerea</italic> BcFRQ1 exhibits extra-circadian roles, impacting developmental phenotypes.

In TaWT, this molecule showed the greatest fold induction in LL and LP compared to DD. On the contrary, in <italic>Δblr1,</italic> its production was reduced in LL, but it was high in DD compared to TaWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This suggests that BLR1 is necessary for light induction of several diffusible compounds in TaWT, including 1679.08 m/z, as their production is severely dampened in the <italic>Δblr1</italic> mutant in LL. However, it seems that the production of a subset of diffusible molecules is either repressed in DD by BLR1 and/or additional photoreceptors are involved in light induction of diffusible molecules after an LP in <italic>Δblr1</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned, diffusible compounds are enhanced in <italic>Δtafrq,</italic> with several molecules showing at last a twofold induction compared to TaWT. The levels of some, like 381.77 m/z, appear downregulated in TaWT and <italic>Δblr1</italic> but enhanced in <italic>Δtafrq</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that TaFRQ represses the production of diffusible compounds under these conditions. On the contrary, TaFRQ could also have a positive role in the light-mediated biosynthesis of molecules such as 1679.08 m/z, which is one of the few downregulated compounds in <italic>Δtafrq</italic> in LL. Despite our findings, we did not observe a correlation between enhanced production of diffusible compounds with enhanced overgrowth of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> strains as <italic>Δtafrq</italic> has a weak overgrowth behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, levels of the detected compounds in OE::<italic>tafrq</italic> are also high in the three experimental conditions compared to TaWT but less than in <italic>Δtafrq</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the absence or misregulation of clock components causes an upregulation of SM, reinforcing the idea of extra-circadian roles for TaFRQ in secondary metabolism.</p><p>These analyses show that light induces the production of a group of diffusible compounds and that BLR1 and TaFRQ have distinct (opposite) roles in regulating such SMs.</p><p>As diffusible molecules represent only part of the metabolic complexity of <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, we also analyzed the profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by measuring their production in vivo with a low-temperature plasma ionization MS (LTP-MS) under the same previously described conditions. The analyses revealed that the production of 131 compounds (in a 50–500 m/z range) was statistically different across all strains and growth conditions (ANOVA p&lt;0.05). A global view of VOCs reveals an enhanced production in LL in <italic>Δblr1</italic> and <italic>Δtafrq,</italic> with a group of VOCs mainly induced in <italic>Δblr1</italic> and reduced in <italic>Δtafrq</italic>. On the contrary, in DD, many volatile compounds were upregulated in <italic>Δtafrq</italic> and downregulated in <italic>Δblr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>As volatile compounds showed higher dispersion and a narrow range of variation, we analyzed molecules that were statistically different across strains and culture conditions, leading to over 1.5-fold change between TaWT and mutant strains. Comparison between <italic>Δblr1</italic> and TaWT detected light-induced as well as dark-repressed compounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) in <italic>Δblr1</italic>. In <italic>Δtafrq,</italic> several compounds were induced in DD and LL compared to TaWT, but also some compounds appeared as repressed in all three conditions for <italic>Δtafrq</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In <italic>Δtafrq,</italic> the compound 371.03 m/z had the highest production in DD compared to TaWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). No significant differences were found between OE::<italic>tafrq</italic> and TaWT, except for enhanced production of few compounds after an LP in OE::<italic>tafrq</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In TaWT, few VOCs depicted differences between light conditions, being one of them the well-known antifungal volatile compound 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6-PP) (167.07 m/z). This compound showed to be induced in DD compared to LL, suggesting an inhibitory effect of light in 6-PP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In <italic>Δblr1,</italic> 6-PP production showed a 5.8-fold induction in LL, but no significant differences were observed in DD and LP compared to TaWT. A possible explanation is that BLR-1 could act as a repressor of 6-PP production in LL (which is consistent with the light repression of this molecule observed in TaWT and the augmented production in <italic>Δblr1</italic> under LL); nevertheless, we cannot rule out that other photoreceptors could be involved in potentiating 6-PP production under LL in <italic>Δblr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, a dramatic reduction of 6-PP production was observed in <italic>Δtafrq</italic> in DD, LL, and LP (61, 10, and 3 negative fold change, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results clearly show that the profile of volatile compounds is also broadly altered in <italic>Δtafrq</italic>. The differences found in VOCs, particularly 6-PP production, correlate with (but cannot fully explain) the different biocontrol effectiveness of the tested strains in LL and DD conditions.</p><p>Finally, we performed a circadian metabolic profile measuring VOCs every 4 hr during 48 hr in DD conditions for TaWT and <italic>Δtafrq</italic> strains in GYEC+ peas plates. Rhythmicity of VOC levels was calculated using BioDare (with FFT-NLS and BD2eLTK cycle algorithms with a p-value&lt;0.05), observing that 17 compounds exhibited a circadian profile with a calculated period between 24 and 26 hr in TaWT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In <italic>Δtafrq,</italic> as expected, most compounds profiles (13 out of the 17) lost rhythmicity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and, importantly, the remaining four compounds (63.83 m/z, 90.83 m/z, 388.87 m/z, and 389.77 m/z) exhibited weak oscillatory behavior (e.g., reduced amplitude and altered phase) as determined after manual examination of compounds dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The circadian abundance of two ions (148.97 and 81.59 m/z) and two arrhythmic ions (259.99 and 110.94 m/z) are shown for comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>. In total, these results suggest that the production of some VOCs in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> is under circadian control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While putative core clock components encoding genes can be found in fungi distributed between several orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montenegro-Montero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salichos and Rokas, 2010</xref>), phenotypic description of fungal circadian phenomena has been less common, and the molecular characterization of those rhythms has been even scarcer. One of the few examples (besides <italic>N. crassa</italic>) is the characterization of the <italic>B. cinerea</italic> core clock and its effect on fungal virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hevia et al., 2015</xref>). In our efforts to further understand the role of circadian clocks in fungal–fungal interactions, herein we provide evidence of a functional clock in the mycoparasitic fungus <italic>T. atroviride</italic>. TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup> reporter strains revealed circadian oscillations with a free-running period of ~26 hr, which could be entrained by LD cycles and reset by light and temperature pulses, consistent with what has been described in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and other organisms for bona fide circadian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 1998</xref>). These oscillations showed temperature compensation between 20 and 25°C, where, notably, the best rhythms in terms of amplitude were observed at 22°C, but they were lost at 28°C. While such a narrow range of temperatures allowing clear visualization of these molecular rhythms may be puzzling, it might also be associated with the environment in which <italic>Trichoderma</italic> is usually found – soil – in which temperature shifts are overall buffered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rodriguez-Romero et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the attempt to evaluate clock-controlled genes (<italic>ccg</italic>), we did not observe oscillations of additional luciferase transcriptional reporters of putative <italic>T. atroviride</italic> ccg promoters. This could be due to (i) the lack of circadian transcription of the assayed ccgs, (ii) the selected promoters fail to capture elements necessary for their circadian control, or (iii) the assay conditions were not appropriate to visualize their rhythmic expression (see below). Future analysis of the transcript levels of several ccgs will be performed under different culture conditions to confirm whether their expression is actually circadian in particular settings.</p><p>Interestingly, we found evidence of strong functional circadian conservation between <italic>Neurospora</italic> and <italic>Trichoderma</italic>. Firstly, conservation of clock <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs, as the <italic>c-box</italic> sequence from the former is recognized in the latter fungus. As the DNA binding domains of WC-1 and BLR1 share a 97.2% aa identity, we hypothesize that the BRL1/BLR2 complex can recognize the <italic><sub>Nc</sub>c-box</italic> element driving circadian oscillations and that a similar <italic>c-box sequence</italic> could be found in the <italic>tafrq</italic> promoter. Indeed, the high conservation of WC-1 and BLR1 DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casas-Flores et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cervantes-Badillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Froehlich et al., 2002</xref>) indicates that they are expected to recognize a similar motif considering general rules of eukaryotic transcription factor sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weirauch et al., 2014</xref>). Two putative light response elements in the <italic>tafrq’</italic>s promoter with a putative GATA box consensus sequence at proximal and distal locations (−355 to –319 and –1180 to –1171 from the TSS, respectively) have been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cervantes-Badillo et al., 2013</xref>), of which one of them could be acting as a putative <sub>Ta</sub><italic>cbox</italic> sequence.</p><p>We were able to generate ~26 hr rhythms in a <italic>Neurospora Δfrq</italic> strain complemented with the <italic>tafrq</italic> coding region, under the control of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> endogenous regulatory sequences. Comparison of the <italic>tafrq</italic> and nc<italic>frq</italic> sequences informs a 54 and 50% of identity at the DNA and protein levels, respectively (using Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment), which provides sufficient functional conservation to allow rescuing of the core clock function in a <italic>N. crassa</italic> arrhythmic strain. Most importantly, the fact that <italic>tafrq</italic> complements the function of the endogenous <italic>frq</italic> in <italic>Neurospora</italic> strongly validates the role of TaFRQ as a core clock circadian component. While we did not conduct some classic experiments such as the ones designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronson et al., 1994</xref>, we present compelling evidence of the existence of such a functional circadian TTFL. Thus, in addition to the complementation itself, it is the fact that TaFRQ is indeed acting as a negative element in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, which can be clearly inferred by the overall decrease of WCC activity (as seen by the reduction in luciferase expression when compared to the recipient strain). Importantly, as we restored the core clock in <italic>Δfrq,</italic> the resulting oscillations reflected the endogenous ~26 hr period originally observed in <italic>T. atroviride,</italic> instead of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> WT rhythm of ~22 hr, implying that period determinants are encoded in the TaFRQ protein sequence and that they are ‘read’ by the rest of the circadian machinery in a proper manner, despite the phylogenetic distance of both genera. Thus, this not only further validates TaFRQ as a bona fide core clock component, but it also highlights how its sequence determinants modulate period. Additionally, we also confirmed that TaFRQ is phosphorylated and degraded as seen over a 12 hr time course, after a light to dark transfer, in accordance to <italic>Neurospora</italic> FRQ behavior. Recent studies have shown that the quality of FRQ regarding phosphorylation status rather than its stability or half-life is important for period length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2009</xref> partially characterized FRQ’s phosphocode in <italic>N. crassa,</italic> of which some mutations in these sites were experimentally shown to affect clock properties. In TaFRQ, 82.6% (19/23) of such sites are preserved, with the divergent ones all residing in the C-terminal portion of the protein, after the PEST-2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The high conservation of known period-affecting phosphorylation sites could partially explain the ability of TaFRQ to function, whereas differential phosphorylation of TaFRQ compared to NcFRQ could potentially explain the longer period. Further analysis of TaFRQ characteristics and phosphorylation sites will shed additional light on the commonalities and peculiarities of the circadian clocks in these two fungi.</p><p>One of our study’s striking findings was the strong influence of culture media composition in allowing the visualization of molecular circadian oscillations. Indeed, rhythms in TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup>, or in <italic><sub>Nc</sub>c-box-luc</italic> levels, were only observed in GYEC media and then further improved when plant-derived material was included. While the impact of nutrient availability in certain aspects of circadian rhythms has been observed from mammals to <italic>N. crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oosterman et al., 2015</xref>), our results indicate an even bigger dependence on culture conditions in allowing molecular visualization of the <italic>Trichoderma</italic> clock. Thus, although the quality and other aspects of <italic>frq</italic> and clock-controlled genes can vary, depending on media characteristics in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Díaz and Larrondo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dunlap and Loros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hurley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Olivares-Yañez et al., 2016</xref>) we were surprised to observe such a dramatic effect in <italic>Trichoderma</italic>: that is, an almost nutritional-conditional rhythmicity dependent on media-derived cues. Besides the puzzling and yet uncharacterized mechanism underlying this nutritional conditionality, we believe that this may serve as a cautionary tale for other attempts to characterize circadian rhythms in different fungi. If we had limited our analysis to a small set of media or higher temperatures, we would have been prone to conclude that there were no rhythms in <italic>Trichoderma</italic> TaFRQ levels. Yet, hitting the right conditions allowed us to confirm their existence and therefore the presence of a circadian oscillations in this organism. It is also provoking and an exciting lesson to consider that the addition of plant-derived material in a fungus that naturally interacts with plants has such a strong effect on visualizing these rhythms (see below).</p><p>In <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, the use of different carbon sources in culture media allows, in some cases, observation of photostimulation of growth and conidiation in the dark, processes in which BLR1 plays a critical role in carbon-source selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Friedl et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Friedl et al., 2008b</xref>). Also, C:N ratios are relevant environmental factors influencing conidiation in <italic>Trichoderma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Steyaert et al., 2010b</xref>). Additionally, organic nitrogen sources in culture media have been described as important for fungal mycoparasitic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnett, 1963</xref>). Also, nitrogen sources are known to affect growth in <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Danielson and Davey, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nolan and Nolan, 1972</xref>). Due to the importance of nutrients in such processes, we hypothesize that the high amounts of organic nitrogen found in GYEC media (derived from casamino acids and yeast extract, absent in the other tested media) to some extent may mimic the composition of <italic>Trichoderma’</italic>s natural niche, in which different nitrogen sources derived from its preys are available.</p><p>Moreover, the addition of peas could better resemble the nutrients or chemical features found in <italic>Trichoderma</italic>’s interaction with plants, including different sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Druzhinina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Steyaert et al., 2010b</xref>). The latter also raises fundamental questions about the importance of plant-derived signals in <italic>Trichoderma</italic>’s clock robustness and its role in the outcome of plant–fungal interactions. A complex temporal communication could be occurring during their interaction in the soil, affecting clock synchronization in <italic>Trichoderma</italic>. Indeed, the plant circadian clock could alter the composition and function of the rhizosphere <italic>microbiome</italic> as it has been observed in the rhizosphere of WT and long/short period mutants of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hubbard et al., 2018</xref>). Rhythmically structured metabolic exchanges between the organisms in the community in collective benefit could be occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sartor et al., 2019</xref>), although it still remains to be studied in this context.</p><p>These findings reinforce the importance of defined nutrient/temperature conditions to monitor the clockworks and help future fungal circadian studies visualize otherwise weak oscillations, like those observed in <italic>Pyronema confluens</italic> and <italic>Ophiocordyceps kimflemingiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Bekker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Traeger and Nowrousian, 2015</xref>). This could also help monitor <italic>frq</italic> molecular oscillations in fungi where previous attempts have failed, like in <italic>Verticillium dahliae, Aureobasidium pullulans,</italic> and <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cascant-Lopez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Franco et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>frq</italic> in <italic>N. crassa</italic> does not have a described role outside the pacemaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronson et al., 1994</xref>), in <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, it exhibits extra-circadian roles associated with developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hevia et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>T. atroviride,</italic> we observed that the core clock components play a role in development, secondary metabolism, and mycoparasitism. Thus, TaFRQ is critical for conidia formation after an LP and mechanical damage, showing a dramatic reduction of conidiation in the latter. In fungi, little is known about FRQ function besides <italic>N. crassa</italic> and <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. A recent study of <italic>frq</italic> in the phytopathogen <italic>V. dahliae</italic> found no significant phenotypic differences in the deletion strain regarding sporulation and microsclerotia formation in DD or LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cascant-Lopez et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, in the entomopathogenic fungi <italic>Metarhizium robertsii</italic>, FRQ is necessary for ring formation under LD 12:12, although neither the WT nor the mutant strain displayed such rings under DD conditions. Besides this, <italic>M. robertsii</italic> FRQ is dispensable in almost all evaluated phenotypes (growth and conidiation in different stress conditions), including virulence against <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Peng et al., 2022</xref>). Meanwhile, studies in <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> (in which two <italic>frq</italic> homologs exists) and <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strain <italic>Guy11</italic> have shown that their <italic>frq</italic> knockouts exhibit diminished conidiation and virulence against <italic>G. mellonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tong et al., 2021</xref>) and rice seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shi et al., 2019</xref>), respectively. These findings pose new questions regarding the role in developmental decisions that FRQ may have acquired (or lost) across the fungal kingdom, raising questions about the extra-circadian role of clock negative elements in other organisms, including animals.</p><p>We found altered developmental responses and enhanced production of diffusible and volatile compounds in <italic>Δtafrq</italic>, suggesting a general repressor regulatory role of TaFRQ over secondary metabolism. Interestingly, the antifungal compound 6-PP, a key feature of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species, was dramatically reduced in <italic>Δtafrq</italic> even in LL. The clock function is expected to be abolished in LL, suggesting, therefore, a potential TaFRQ extra-circadian activator role in 6-PP production.</p><p>SMs have been related to developmental programs in fungi and could have a role in response to damage in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atriztán-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schmoll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tisch and Schmoll, 2010</xref>). Reports show that after injury and fungivory a group of VOCs, including 6-PP, increase in TaWT but not in the MAPK mutant <italic>Δtmk3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atriztán-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>), which shows diminished conidiation after an injury as observed in the <italic>Δtafrq</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Medina-Castellanos et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, it was previously suggested that oxylipin could be involved in signaling after damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Medina-Castellanos et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that the reduction of injury-induced conidiation in <italic>Δtafrq</italic> could be related to its dysregulated diffusible and VOC production profiles, in which further studies identifying those compounds could shed light on their role in injury-induced conidiation. On the contrary, <italic>Δblr1</italic> showed repressed production of several compounds (diffusible and VOCs), suggesting a role of light perception in secondary metabolism regulation. This is consistent with the light-induced production of several compounds in TaWT.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>Δblr1</italic> produced higher amounts of 6-PP in DD and even in LL, whereas in TaWT, 6-PP production is inhibited by light. This suggests a repressor role of light and BLR1 in the production of 6-PP and other molecules, as seen for 1679.08 m/z, and that other photoreceptors could activate its production in the absence of BLR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Garcia-Esquivel et al., 2016</xref>). A light-repression effect on 6-PP production was also observed in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> P1 and IMI 206040 strains when 6-PP production was analyzed under LD and DD conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Speckbacher et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Contreras-Cornejo et al., 2022</xref>) and when grown in different light wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moreno-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed differences in the SM profiles between LL and LP conditions, indicating that the duration of light stimuli differently activates/represses the production of several compounds. Whereas a short light exposure could be perceived as a strong environmental cue triggering the production of different metabolites, constant exposure to light could lead to a prolonged stress response marked by a different subset of metabolites. Light regulation of SMs has been reported in several fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tisch and Schmoll, 2010</xref>) as the involvement of WC-1 homologs in <italic>Cercospora zeae-maydis</italic> and <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> as repressors of cercosporin and trichothecene production, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the involvement of TaFRQ in the production of SMs in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> (or FRQ of any other fungus) has not been reported to date.</p><p>In concordance with the circadian oscillations of TaFRQ<sup>LUC</sup><italic>,</italic> we observed rhythmic levels of volatile SMs in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> under constant conditions (DD) but not in <italic>Δtafrq</italic>, suggesting circadian control of the production of these volatile compounds. Our experimental approach showed that these molecules exhibited rhythmic levels. Nevertheless, it did not provide their molecular identity. We expect future work to dive into their chemical identification and their specific role in <italic>T. atroviride’</italic>s lifestyle.</p><p>Overall, our results reinforce the importance of environmental perception (including time) in <italic>Trichoderma</italic>’s biology, particularly in the production of SMs involved in several processes from development to mycoparasitism. On the contrary, in <italic>Neurospora</italic> how these daily rhythms impact metabolite levels has not been described so far, despite ample efforts that have systematically shown the clock’s influence on its transcriptome and proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hurley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hurley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sancar et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting temporal compartmentalization of metabolism at large, with catabolic and anabolic reactions concentrated at dawn and dusk, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hurley et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we present a proof of concept that a fungal circadian clock can also impact the production of SMs. These studies and future comprehensive analyses of circadian metabolic profiles in classic models such as <italic>Neurospora</italic> and other fungi will help to bridge the gap on how clock regulation impacts a fungus’s daily life, from physiology to organismal interactions.</p><p>Our study also provides new insights into the mycoparasitic interaction between <italic>T. atroviride</italic> and <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and how its outcome is regulated by core clock components and LD conditions. <italic>Δblr1</italic> showed the strongest mycoparasitic behavior; in contrast<italic>, Δtafrq</italic> did not show significant differences to TaWT in most interactions, except a slightly weaker mycoparasitic behavior against <italic>Δbcwcl1</italic> and <italic>Δbcfrq1</italic> in LL. <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species' antagonistic capacity is correlated with their ability to produce 6-PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reino et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>Δblr1</italic> strain has higher amounts of this molecule, whereas, in <italic>Δtafrq,</italic> its production is severely dampened, consistent with their different mycoparasitic abilities. <italic>Trichoderma</italic>’s antagonist capacity was reduced in LL and enhanced in darkness, which could be due to differential metabolite profiles found in LL and DD. Similar inhibitory effects of light in mycoparasitism in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> have been reported against <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moreno-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Speckbacher et al., 2020b</xref>), along with differential VOC production upon illumination during confrontation assays. High amounts of 2-heptanone are produced during the confrontation against <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in a light-dependent manner that negatively correlates with <italic>Trichoderma</italic> antagonism, which proposes that 2-heptanone production was a result of a stress response elicited by <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in the light.</p><p>Finally, mycoparasitic interactions under a circadian paradigm revealed an enhanced overgrowth of TaWT and <italic>Δtafrq</italic> over B05.10 and <italic>Δbcwcl1</italic> when interactions started at dawn under LD cycles in contrast to a reduced overgrowth at dusk. We have previously observed differential interactions in the context of <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, where fungal virulence was enhanced at dusk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hevia et al., 2015</xref>). The differential effect on the <italic>Trichoderma–Botrytis</italic> dynamic was lost when <italic>Δblr1</italic> was used against all <italic>B. cinerea</italic> strains. A similar phenomenon was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hevia et al., 2015</xref>, when <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was infected with <italic>Δbcwcl1</italic>, which did not show circadian behavior. Disruption of BLR1 abrogates both light and circadian responses, so the effect observed for <italic>Δblr1</italic> could also be due to a light-driven phenomenon (besides a circadian effect) because the absence of the blue-light perception overrides the differential effect observed in TaWT. Yet, it is noteworthy that <italic>Δtafrq</italic> yields result comparable to what is seen in TaWT, suggesting that – paradoxically – the observed time-of-the-day effect does not appear to strongly depend on the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>atroviride</italic>’s clock.</p><p>On the other hand, under LD cycles, the loss of BcWCL1 does not considerably affect these fungal dynamics, whereas, in <italic>Δbcfrq1</italic>, the differential outcome of the daily interaction disappears. Lack of BcFRQ1 implies that temporal perception in <italic>B. cinerea</italic> is absent, in concordance with the loss of the time-of-the-day observed phenotype, something that is not seen when <italic>Trichoderma</italic> lacks TaFRQ. This suggests that the <italic>B. cinerea</italic> clock is critical in the outcome of the interaction of tested organisms – both plants and fungi – suggesting a complex mechanism in which light and time perception interact, giving rise to the observed phenotypes. Even though we lack a precise molecular understanding underlying this phenomenon (and integrating the role of the different clock/light-perception components), this work constitutes the first description of an interplay of core and light regulation in a mycoparasitic interaction. In nature, organisms are usually exposed to light/dark transitions. Therefore, the differential outcome depending on the time (or the light/dark cycles) at which confrontations are established could impact biocontrol strategies in agriculture, optimizing the application of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> in crops.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fungal strains and culture conditions</title><p><italic>T. atroviride</italic> IMI 206040, initially isolated from a plum tree of the Czar variety in an orchard in Urshult near Växjö in southern Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">EFSA European Food Safety, 2015</xref>), was used as wild-type strain (TaWT) and, along with <italic>Δblr1</italic>, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casas-Flores et al., 2004</xref>, were kindly provided by Dr. Alfredo Herrera-Estrella.

The Euclidean distance and Ward algorithm were used for clustering in the MetaboAnalyst platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pang et al., 2020</xref>). Fold change and <italic>t</italic>-test were calculated in pairs using the mean value of raw data for each comparison. A 2-fold change cutoff was established for diffusible and 1.5-fold change for volatile compounds.</p><p>For circadian VOC studies, a Bayesian analysis was executed using all 10 micro-scans taken as individual scans to identify ions related to the sample or noise (ambient noise and for GYEC+ 0.5% peas medium). The Bayesian analysis shows the percentage of the ion related to the sample: ions with 0% were eliminated. Adjustment of intensities was made on the spectra matrix made with means of the micro-scans. Determination of period and rhythmicity was carried out in the BioDare platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zielinski et al., 2014</xref>) using FFT-NLLS and BD2eJTK with p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Culture media used for in vivo luminescence assessment.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-71358-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Period analysis of transcriptional reporters in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> using BioDare platform.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-71358-supp2-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Mean overgrowth area of <italic>T. atroviride</italic> over <italic>B. cinerea</italic> in all confrontation assays performed.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-71358-supp3-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Circadian metabolites of <italic>T. atroviride</italic>.</title><p>The period was estimated using FFT-NLSS, and rhythmicity was evaluated using BD2eJTK in the BioDare platform.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-71358-supp4-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>List of primers used for <italic>tafrq</italic> replacement cassette, complementation cassette, and diagnostics PCR.</title><p>Fw: direct orientation;

The authors clearly establish rhythms in the organism that are dependent on TcFRQ, a homolog of the core clock component FRQ in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, and show that TcFRQ and BRL1, the homolog of the blue light photoreceptor and core clock component WC-1 in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, play differing roles in development, metabolite levels, and mycoparasitism in laboratory conditions. However, the authors do not fully establish that the rhythms are controlled by a circadian clock , nor that TcFRQ is a core clock component.

However, little is known about clocks in other fungi, despite conservation of core clock components found in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, including fungal pathogens and biocontrol agents like Trichoderma. Thus, the strength of this work is in that it goes a long way to establish a clock in T. atroviride that is directly, or indirectly involved in controlling development, metabolism, and mycoparasitism. Importantly, this work opens up the opportunity to determine how the clock impacts fungal-fungal interactions, with the potential of using this to improve biocontrol.</p><p>Weaknesses: There are several weaknesses. The first is that while the authors established conditions to demonstrate two canonical properties needed to establish a circadian clock, a free running rhythm that is close to 24 h and temperature compensation, the authors did not fully test one of the cardinal properties of a circadian clock, entrainment. Second, the authors do not establish that TcFRQ is a core component of the clock oscillator. Third, the authors made conclusions from a strain that is supposed to overexpress TcFRQ from an actin promoter but, there is no data demonstrating that TcFRQ is actually overexpressed. Fourth, the rationale for concluding that TcFRQ has an extra-clock role, as opposed to a clock role, in development and metabolism is not clear Finally, a red safety light was used in all circadian experiments in constant dark; however, there is no data to support that T. atroviride is not responsive to red light.</p><p>Figure 1 While these data support the existence of a circadian clock in this organism based on free running rhythms and temperature compensation, it is important to provide additional data to demonstrate that the rhythm is entrained, one of the 3 criteria established in the field.</p><p>a. To demonstrate circadian entrainment, as opposed to a direct response to the environmental cues, specifically light, they need to examine different length LD cycles to demonstrate that the clock entrains to the different cycles. In addition, to demonstrate that an acute light or temperature pulse is resetting the clock, as opposed to masking, a a phase response curve is needed to show advances and delays. It is not clear what phase the light pulse was given in Figure 1D.</p><p>b. In the Supplement to Figure 2, several genes are arrhythmic under conditions in which TAFRQLUC is rhythmic. This is an important control to show, for example, that there is not a rhythm in ATP levels that might be driving the rhythm in the TAFRQLUC reporter. I would like to see this mentioned earlier in relation to Figure 1.</p><p>c. It would be helpful to know circadian time in Figure 1, and of interest to know if the peak time is similar to <italic>N. crassa</italic> FRQ.</p><p>Figure 2 demonstrates that the cis-acting promoter element of <italic>N. crassa</italic> frq that bound by the positive element, the WCC, is necessary for frq mRNA rhythms and functioning of the feedback loop, is sufficient to drive rhythms in luciferase in T. atroviride in DD, and is responsive to light and temperature pulses. This experiment suggests that there is conservation of the c-box, and raises the possibility that TAFRQ functions similarly in the T. atroviride clock as a negative element; however, this experiment raises more questions than it answers, and therefore seems premature. There are several instances in the paper where TaFRQ is called a core clock component, but there are no data to support this claim.</p><p>a. Is there a similar sequence present in the promoter of TAFRQ? If so, what happens if this sequence is mutated?</p><p>b. What happens to the rhythm, levels, of TAFRQ in a Blr1 deletion or mutated strain?</p><p>c. Additional experiments are needed to show that Blr1 binds to this sequence and to fully describe TAFRQ role in the clock mechanism.</p><p>In Supplementary file 1, 2A, B and C, they examine if TaFRQ has a role in development, and this is supported by the data presented by comparing WT versus TaFRQ deletion strains. They show that conidia formation is delayed in the mutant compared to WT, and decreased following light treatment or injury. In addition, they also examined a construct aimed at overexpressing TaFRQ (OE::TaFRQ) using the actin promoter. No differences were observed between WT and OE::TaFRQ; however, it is difficult to make any conclusions here because there were no experiments demonstrating that TaFRQ was actually overexpressed in this strain.</p><p>Figure 3 examines the ability of T. atroviride to overgrow B. cinerea under different lighting conditions and in mutants as an indicator of mycoparasitic behavior. The key findings were that constant light inhibits overgrowth, and that mutations in blr1 in T. atroviride enhances overgrowth in constant darkness. However, it is not clear how these data and those that follow establish and extra-clock role for TaFRQ in these processes.</p><p>Figure 4 looks at dawn and dusk confrontations between T. atroviride and B. cinereai in LD cycles. They found that WT T. atroviride and TaFRQ deletion strains had overgrowth that was enhanced at dawn, whereas deletion of TaBLR1 did not show a time of day difference. However, when frq was deleted in B. cinerea, all T. atroviride strains overgrew. These data supported that homologs of <italic>N. crassa</italic> clock components in T. atroviride and B. cinereai play differing roles in time of day specific interactions, and this information could prove useful in biocontrol measures in the future.</p><p>Figure 5 examines if T. atroviride FRQ and BLR1 mutants alter secondary metabolism by examining diffusible and volatile compounds in DD and LL, and following a light pulse. They found several differences, but were unable to correlate these with the overgrowth experiments in Figures 3 and 4. A circadian metabolic profile demonstrated that some compounds were rhythmic in WT and arrhythmic in taFRQ deletion cells. These data provide evidence to support a role for a clock in controlling metabolism in T. atroviride.</p><p>Discussion: The paper lacks definitive experiments to show that taFRQ is a core clock component, and therefore, it is not clear how these data support a extra-circadian role for taFRQ. In addition, aspects of the discussion are very lengthy, especially the section describing how this work could foster looking for clocks in other fungi.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>a. It is critical to show that T. atroviride is not sensitive to red light given red safety lights were used in circadian experiments.</p><p>b.

Using both translational and transcriptional reporters for a core clock component, FRQ/frq, the authors demonstrate that the rhythm meets all the requirements of bona fide circadian oscillator, e.g. entrainment and temperature compensation. Interestingly and importantly, they demonstrate that the robustness of the oscillation is largely dependent on the nutritional environment; specifically, the rhythm was only discernable under growth conditions that likely resemble the natural environment of the fungus. This information will be of keen interest to the chronobiology community, particularly those that attempting to identify a clock in their microbe of interest. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that two processes are under control of the Trichoderma clock, or at least under the regulation of clock components: (1) secondary metabolism, and (2) the myoparasitic interaction with another fungus, Botrytis. Although the connection between those two phenomena in this study is unclear, together they demonstrate the importance of biological clocks in regulating fungal behaviors of interest. Understanding how the time-of-day influences fungal parasitism, for example, could inform the optimization of fungi as biocontrol agents in the agricultural setting. In conclusion, the work provided here is novel, the conclusions are supported by the data, the ideas are well-marshalled. Consequently, I believe this would be would be a good fit for <italic>eLife</italic> and its readership. However, the manuscript may be strengthened by an expanded discussion or additional experiments as outlined below.</p><p>1) The authors do an excellent job in defining how environmental parameters (e.g. nutrients and temperature), influence the robustness of Trichoderma core oscillation. It is therefore surprising that the Trichoderma/Botrytis interaction assays were not analyzed across a similar variety of conditions. For example, the authors performed the interaction assays on PDA media at 20C, the data from which support the conclusion the Trichoderma FRQ does not significantly influence its parasitism of Botrytis. However, what would these results look like on media in which the Trichoderma oscillator is more robust, i.e. on GYEC media at 22C? Conversely, how would these changing conditions influence the Botrtyis clock proteins and their role in the interaction? The inclusion of such data may strengthen the overall discussion of the fungal clock operating within stringent environmental conditions.</p><p>2) For the interaction assay, it is clear the inoculating the plates at dawn results in greater Trichoderma overgrowth compared to inoculation at dusk. However, the authors state in the discussion (pg 33, line 15), that &quot;overgrowth is increased when the &quot;interactions started at dawn…&quot;. Does the inoculation time really represent the time at which the fungal interaction take place? Surely there must be a lag that reflects the growth of the organisms towards each other. Perhaps the interaction begins 12 h after inoculation, i.e. at dusk. Relatedly, how does growth rate of the various mutant strains (of either species) under the various light conditions influence the time in the solar/circadian day in which the initial interaction takes place?</p><p>3) Much attention is given to circadian influence on Trichoderma secondary metabolism, which is indeed very interesting. However, the relationship between this and the Botrytis interaction results are fairly weak. Can the authors demonstrate that culture supernatants of Trichoderma taken at different times across the circadian day, or in DD v LL, have an differential impact on Botrytis growth or viability? Maybe this is an oversimplified expectation. In any case , it is noted that Botrytis proteins have the greatest impact on the interaction, which would suggest that the circadian regulation of Trichoderma metabolites may not be particularly important. Do the authors think the relative susceptibility of Botrytis to Trichoderma metabolites, or some other stressor, is regulated by the Bc clock proteins? In other words, some discussion about the fungal-fungal interaction from the Botrytis perspective may be welcomed.</p><p>4) Overall, the 'Introduction' and 'Discussion' sections are nicely written and easy to read. By contrast, the 'Results' section contains some phrasing and grammatical issues that should be revised.</p><p>This is a very interesting study and my major &quot;concerns&quot; are outlined above. I may have misunderstood key aspects of the experiments, in which case a clarifying statement in the rebuttal may suffice. However, I do think that the authors should clarify some things in the manuscript as outlined here.</p><p>1) Please describe the assay conditions more clearly throughout the manuscript. The assay medium for Figure 3, for example, is not mentioned in the results or figure legend. I can't even see a definitive mention of the medium in the methods. In fact, the figure 4 legend is the only place where PDA is explicitly stated. Similarly, it is unclear what media was used for the secondary metabolite profiles. Based on the language in the methods, it seems that the light experiments were performed on PDA and the circadian time course was on GYEC… is that correct? If so, why use different media? This conditions be clearly stated in the figure legends in any case.</p><p>2) To what extent does the relative growth rate of the two organisms influence the interaction? For example, if a particular B. cinerea (Bc) mutant were slow growing, would this make the apparent overgrowth of T. atroviride (Ta) seem larger? The methods state that the readout is based on percent overgrowth, but this isn't really obvious in most of the pictures. To me, and perhaps to many readers, the readout (dotted line) seems to reflect the point of contact between the two organisms, sort of like a mating assay, which would presumably be growth rate dependent.</p><p>– To perhaps clarify this issue, the authors might consider is showing the each strain (Ta and Bc) by itself on a plate under each of the conditions (e.g. DD, LL, LD, etc). This would allow the reader to better visualize the morphology and growth rate of each organism in isolation, and consequently interpret the interaction experiments better.</p><p>3) Pg. 13, line 12: &quot;After 72 h of cultivation in LL, conidia in Δtafrq exhibited a dark-green color compared to the TaWT and the OE::tafrq strains (Supplementary file 2A) which displayed the characteristic T. atroviride green coloration.&quot;</p><p>– This sentence is a bit confusing. So &quot;green&quot; is normal, and &quot;dark green&quot; is abnormal? It may be helpful for the unfamiliar reader if the authors briefly describe basic Trichoderma colony morphology, i.e. what color are the condia and underlying hyphae.</p><p>4) Some specific areas in the 'Results' section that need revision include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p>– Pg 13, line 8: &quot;This distinctive phenotype…&quot;</p><p>– Pg. 14, Line 15.</p><p>– Page 18, Line 2: &quot;Regarding…&quot;</p><p>5) Pg. 7, Line 14: &quot;ostensibly&quot; doesn't seem like the correct word here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The most obvious change during the course of a day is the dark-light cycle. Associated to light changes are changes in harmful UV light, in temperature, in humidity, the possibility for finding food or the orientation in the environment. Circadian clocks help organisms to adapt to these predictable periodic changes before they actually occur. E.g. for humans it was good to wake up during dusk and be alert before their predators are active. For microorganisms, like filamentous fungi, environmental parameters may be important for instance if they produce spores for distribution. It may be advantageous to produce them early in the morning, when the humidity is high, because spores are often produced at the surface of substrates and hence the mycelium is at risk for desiccation. In the case of plant-pathogenic fungi it may be advantageous to spread the spores at times where plants are more susceptible for a fungal attack. This had been shown before by the same research group in the case of Botrytis cinerea. The current paper is a continuation of the work on organismic interactions and highlights the role of a circadian clock in the mycoparasitic relationship between Trichoderma atroviride and the grey mold B. cinerea. They identified a circadian clock in T. atroviride and show that it influences spore and secondary metabolite production. In the mycoparasitic interaction the clock of the prey is important for the success of the intruder rather than the other way around. The downstream components of the circadian clock, which are important for the outcome of the mycoparasitic interaction, remain to be discovered.</p><p>The paper has many important implications. The molecular mechanism of circadian clocks has been studied extensively in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, but only in a few other fungi so far. Many fungi seem to lack one of the central components of the <italic>N. crassa</italic> clock, namely the negative element frequency. Therefore, it is important to collect more examples for circadian mechanisms in fungi. In T. atroviride the clock mechanism appears to be conserved in comparison to <italic>N. crassa</italic>. A second important aspect is that T. atroviride is used as a biocontrol agent and hence the work may help to optimize the application of the fungus in the field. Last but not least, the paper shows that secondary metabolism is largely influenced by the clock, an aspect so far largely neglected. Given that filamentous fungi are important producers of secondary metabolites, such as penicillin or lovastatin, circadian clocks should be considered when optimizing production processes.</p><p>The first two chapters describe the characterization of the circadian clock of T. atroviride. The authors show that it can be entrained by light-dark cycles, that it can be reset by a light or temperature pulse, and it is temperature compensated in a range between 20 and 26{degree sign}C. The mechanism of clock functioning appears to be similar to the one in <italic>N. crassa</italic> with a conserved cis element in the promoter of the frequency gene. Interestingly, addition of pea powder significantly enhanced the amplitude of the clock-dependent reporter expression. Is this a specific effect of pea or do other plants or fruits serve the same function? This is especially important because this aspect is also highlighted in the Discussion.</p><p>I find it very surprising, but interesting at the same time, that several tested and known clock-controlled genes apparently are not clock-controlled in T. atroviride. The authors should look at some regulators of the pathways they identified as being under clock control. The candidates could be further analyzed for the identified cis element in their promoters.</p><p>Next, they tested a function of the frq gene outside the clock function, because such an additional function had been described before in B. cinerea. They found that indeed conidiation is delayed in a frq-deletion strain, independent of ligh-dark cycles. To verify these results the deletion strain should be re-complemented with a wild-type copy.</p><p>In the following chapters they focus on the mycoparasitic interaction and use frq and wc mutant strains of both fungi in confrontation assays. They first found that light inhibits the parasitic capacity of T. atroviride and that the WC-1 orthologue is required for the aggressive behavior of T. atroviride in the dark. Again in this series of experiments a T. atroviride frq re-complemented strain is missing. In light-dark cycles it turned out that the B. cinerea Frq protein is important for the outcome of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is clock-controlled, but on the prey side.</p><p>In the last chapter they analyzed the production of different secondary metabolites and found that the production is under light control. The WC orthologue and Frq are involved in the regulation, independent of their functions in the circadian clock. However, the authors also show that the production of some compounds is clock controlled, and most required Frq. I guess for specialists the source data tables are useful. I cannot evaluate them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71358.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have made several constructive suggestions that you should carefully consider and address in a point-by-point reply.

Indeed, experimental work was severely hampered at our universities during most of 2021, as access was extremely restricted. Nevertheless, we generated new data that actually go towards that direction, providing additional proof that this is a proper circadian system (see response #1 to Reviewer 1). We truly appreciate the reviewer’s comments as they allowed us to strengthen the dataset regarding this point. We are convinced that the new results not only do that, but also provide new interesting observations included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please perform the interaction assays across a range of environmental conditions (nutritional, temperature) to determine if the contributions of the clock proteins (in either organism) change accordingly (as suggested by Reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>In the new text we now provide an important technical aspect of the confrontation experiments, commenting that only PDA media provides proper conditions to clearly visualize overgrowth or Trichoderma mycelia over Botrytis, as in other media (such as GYEC) Botrytis behaves oddly in terms of mycelia consistence and coloration. Importantly, the main purpose of these experiments was not to systematically test the effect of different conditions on the interaction but instead, to provide a proof of concept that two variables – light (Figure 3), and time (Figure 4) – have a relevant effect modulating the outcome of the interaction. We anticipate that future work in our lab (and the labs of others) will examine the additional effects of other variables in combination with the abovementioned ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please re-complement your mutants (as suggested by Reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this observation. Accordingly, we have now included complementation experiments as depicted in (new figures: Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and 4) confirming that, as expected, one of the hallmark phenotypes of the mutant is reversed in the complemented strain. We have included information of the new experiments in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The goal of this study was to establish that the fungus Trichoderma atroviride, and important biocontrol agent, has a circadian clock, and to test if this clock plays a role in development, secondary metabolite production, and mycoparasitism.

The reviewer's primary concern is related to the absence of data showing that TaFRQ is indeed a clockcore component. After careful examination, we have pondered our results and performed additional experiments that should help dissipate any potential doubts about that main conclusion. Thus, to fully support the latter, and to clearly establish that a circadian clock controls the observed rhythms, we now have included relevant additional information describing that TaFRQ is indeed a core clock component based on functional complementation experiments (<italic>aka</italic> classic old school approach) in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>. Accordingly, as highlighted in the new version of the MS, we do not only demonstrate that <italic>T. atroviride's</italic> clock free runs and compensates for temperature, but also that the <italic>tafrq</italic> gene is capable of functionally complementing a <italic>frq</italic> null strain of <italic>Neurospora</italic> (new figures: Figure 2 and figure supplement 2, and pages 12-13). Most notably, the latter experiment also shows that the “long” free running rhythms characterized in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> can be &quot;transplanted” along with the Tafrq sequence to Neurospora. We think that these data fully support our conclusions, including extra-circadian functions of TaFRQ (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths: The circadian clock in the fungus <italic>N. crassa</italic> serves as an important model for understanding the mechanisms that keep time in eukaryotes, and how this clock controls daily rhythms in gene expression.

Thus, we can now establish that TaFRQ indeed encodes a clock-core component (new figures: Figure 2-figure supplement 2, pages 12 and 13). Having cleared the waters in terms of its clock function, we can also mention about its extra-circadian roles (see following question-answer below).

Based on his/her observations we performed RT-qPCR analysis, which confirmed overexpression, particularly under DD conditions (<italic>circa</italic> 4-fold), info which can now be found in Figure 3figure supplement 2 (new figure) and page 14, Line 21-23. Since we also observed that in LL the degree of overexpression is less marked (albeit still statistically significant), we have made that explicit in the text and in the discussion of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, the rationale for concluding that TcFRQ has an extra-clock role, as opposed to a clock role, in development and metabolism is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this may have not been clear enough in the text. Now with the new data we have unmistakably stablished that <italic>Tafrq</italic> has a canonical role as a core-clock component. In addition, it has “extra-circadian” roles, as it affects (delays) sporulation and injury response even in LL conditions. As the clock only runs in DD (and not in LL) we refer to these effects as “extra circadian” since they are not based on a running clock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, a red safety light was used in all circadian experiments in constant dark; however, there is no data to support that T. atroviride is not responsive to red light.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion: in all free-running experiments, constant darkness means the total absence of light. Red safety lights are utilized in the dark room, which houses our light-proof incubators (Percival). Thus, experiments (CCD recordings, growth in Petri plates, etc.) were conducted inside the incubators in full darkness or in the presence of white light (when indicated). Red lights were only used to manipule equipment when required, or when opening incubators. Indeed, cultures were seldom exposed to red light in the experiments conducted in this MS. Related to the general question raised by the reviewer, only a few genes (three) have been detected as red-light regulated in <italic>T. atroviride</italic> after a 5 min red light-pulse (PMID: 17074901). In any case, both light intensity and time of exposure significantly differ from occasional expose to redlight during culture manipulation (i.e., harvesting).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 While these data support the existence of a circadian clock in this organism based on free running rhythms and temperature compensation, it is important to provide additional data to demonstrate that the rhythm is entrained, one of the 3 criteria established in the field.</p><p>a. To demonstrate circadian entrainment, as opposed to a direct response to the environmental cues, specifically light, they need to examine different length LD cycles to demonstrate that the clock entrains to the different cycles. In addition, to demonstrate that an acute light or temperature pulse is resetting the clock, as opposed to masking, a a phase response curve is needed to show advances and delays. It is not clear what phase the light pulse was given in Figure 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned earlier, we were unable to properly perform entrainment experiments. Instead, we adopted a different approach to provide compelling data regarding the characterization of the Trichoderma FRQ-based clock (see complementation experiments). Future work will, undoubtedly, focus on additional circadiana of this system, particularly phase response curves. Nevertheless, we estimate the revised data set provides sufficient information to support the main conclusions of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. In the Supplement to Figure 2, several genes are arrhythmic under conditions in which TAFRQLUC is rhythmic. This is an important control to show, for example, that there is not a rhythm in ATP levels that might be driving the rhythm in the TAFRQLUC reporter. I would like to see this mentioned earlier in relation to Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad to know that the reviewer also appreciates this data. Indeed, now we mention this is page 9, lines 1-13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. It would be helpful to know circadian time in Figure 1, and of interest to know if the peak time is similar to <italic>N. crassa</italic> FRQ.</p></disp-quote><p>The data suggests that the phase of the first peak of TaFRQ expression (as FRQ<sup>LUC</sup>) is similar, albeit slightly advanced, compared to what occurs in <italic>N. crassa</italic> (once converted to circadian time), being roughly CT 11 for the latter, and CT 8 for Trichoderma. This is now mentioned in page 7, line 18.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 demonstrates that the cis-acting promoter element of <italic>N. crassa</italic> frq that bound by the positive element, the WCC, is necessary for frq mRNA rhythms and functioning of the feedback loop, is sufficient to drive rhythms in luciferase in T. atroviride in DD, and is responsive to light and temperature pulses. This experiment suggests that there is conservation of the c-box, and raises the possibility that TAFRQ functions similarly in the T. atroviride clock as a negative element; however, this experiment raises more questions than it answers, and therefore seems premature. There are several instances in the paper where TaFRQ is called a core clock component, but there are no data to support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this experiment raises a lot of interesting new questions. Nevertheless, in addition to the new complementation data, it provides a general and valuable conclusion: there is conservation of core-clock mechanisms and components across two species belonging to the same class, and there is cross-class recognition of such components. Thus, we believe it nicely contributes to the story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. Is there a similar sequence present in the promoter of TAFRQ? If so, what happens if this sequence is mutated?</p><p>b. What happens to the rhythm, levels, of TAFRQ in a Blr1 deletion or mutated strain?</p><p>c. Additional experiments are needed to show that Blr1 binds to this sequence and to fully describe TAFRQ role in the clock mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer raises interesting observation/questions, that also intrigue us. While these formal questions are highly relevant, we deem that they are not essential in the context of the overall message of this manuscript. Indeed, we have not identified a defined &quot;endogenous&quot; c-box sequence in Trichoderma, nevertheless, as described in the manuscript, “Two putative light response elements in the tafrq’s promoter with a putative GATA box consensus sequence at proximal and distal locations (-355 to -319 and -1180 to -1171 from the TSS, respectively) have been postulated (Cervantes-Badillo et al., 2013), of which one of them could be acting as a putative <sub>Ta</sub>cbox sequence.”.</p><p>We did not directly determine TaFRQ levels in a BLR1 mutant strain. Importantly, transcriptomic datasets address this, confirming that, as expected, <italic>tafrq</italic> expression depends on BLR1, and is downregulated in the absence of this TF (PMID: 27020152).</p><p>This is now mentioned in Page 4, line 16.</p><p>In addition, the collective evidence of the new data showing how TaFRQ complements the Neurospora's <italic>frq</italic> null mutant, the fact that c-box of <italic>Neurospora</italic> works rhythmically in <italic>T. atroviride</italic>, and the absence of rhythms of other promoter-luc constructs in the latter fungus, all clearly reinforces the idea that we are describing a circadian clock and that TaFRQ is indeed a core clock component along with BLR1, aspects that are now commented in the discussion. Thus, while we appreciate and also share some of the questions raised by the reviewer, we believe they are beyond the current scope of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Supplementary file 1, 2A, B and C, they examine if TaFRQ has a role in development, and this is supported by the data presented by comparing WT versus TaFRQ deletion strains. They show that conidia formation is delayed in the mutant compared to WT, and decreased following light treatment or injury. In addition, they also examined a construct aimed at overexpressing TaFRQ (OE::TaFRQ) using the actin promoter. No differences were observed between WT and OE::TaFRQ; however, it is difficult to make any conclusions here because there were no experiments demonstrating that TaFRQ was actually overexpressed in this strain.</p></disp-quote><p>As commented above, we have now measured <italic>tafrq</italic> expression in the overexpressing strain, confirming that levels are statistically higher in the latter compared to WT, which is particularly marked in DD conditions. Indeed, when it comes to the mentioned phenotypes (conidiation, injury response) the OE strain behaves as the WT. Nevertheless, as evidenced in Figure 5, regarding metabolic profiles, the OE strain shows a pattern quite distinct compared to WT, particularly under DD, when expression levels of <italic>tafrq</italic> in OE versus WT are more pronounced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 examines the ability of T. atroviride to overgrow B. cinerea under different lighting conditions and in mutants as an indicator of mycoparasitic behavior. The key findings were that constant light inhibits overgrowth, and that mutations in blr1 in T. atroviride enhances overgrowth in constant darkness. However, it is not clear how these data and those that follow establish and extra-clock role for TaFRQ in these processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, as we did not intend to imply that the data in Figure 3 relates to the extra circadian role of TaFRQ. To provide more context, we were also interested to analyze whether TaFRQ had additional roles, besides its clock function, a thought inspired from our findings for Botrytis FRQ. This is a relevant observation since, in the case of Neurospora, the FRQ protein seems to have only clock-related functions, while in Botrytis, in an environmental condition where the clock is not functional (in constant light), the <italic>frq</italic> mutant shows additional extra-circadian functions related to altered development (conidiation). Now, this is better explained in the text in page 15, between lines 09-16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 looks at dawn and dusk confrontations between T. atroviride and B. cinereai in LD cycles. They found that WT T. atroviride and TaFRQ deletion strains had overgrowth that was enhanced at dawn, whereas deletion of TaBLR1 did not show a time of day difference. However, when frq was deleted in B. cinerea, all T. atroviride strains overgrew.

A circadian metabolic profile demonstrated that some compounds were rhythmic in WT and arrhythmic in taFRQ deletion cells.

Therefore, we took the approach of complementing an arrhythmic Neurospora strain with tafrq (see above). Such results not only provide compelling evidence of TaFRQ role in the clockworks, but also opens the door to interesting future comparative studies. Having dissipated such doubts, it may now be easier to visualize the concept of “extracircadian” roles of FRQ, as they lead to phenotypes even in a condition where clock function is abrogated (constant light).

Using both translational and transcriptional reporters for a core clock component, FRQ/frq, the authors demonstrate that the rhythm meets all the requirements of bona fide circadian oscillator, e.g. entrainment and temperature compensation. Interestingly and importantly, they demonstrate that the robustness of the oscillation is largely dependent on the nutritional environment; specifically, the rhythm was only discernable under growth conditions that likely resemble the natural environment of the fungus. This information will be of keen interest to the chronobiology community, particularly those that attempting to identify a clock in their microbe of interest. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that two processes are under control of the Trichoderma clock, or at least under the regulation of clock components: (1) secondary metabolism, and (2) the myoparasitic interaction with another fungus, Botrytis. Although the connection between those two phenomena in this study is unclear, together they demonstrate the importance of biological clocks in regulating fungal behaviors of interest. Understanding how the time-of-day influences fungal parasitism, for example, could inform the optimization of fungi as biocontrol agents in the agricultural setting. In conclusion, the work provided here is novel, the conclusions are supported by the data, the ideas are well-marshalled. Consequently, I believe this would be would be a good fit for eLife and its readership. However, the manuscript may be strengthened by an expanded discussion or additional experiments as outlined below.</p><p>1) The authors do an excellent job in defining how environmental parameters (e.g. nutrients and temperature), influence the robustness of Trichoderma core oscillation. It is therefore surprising that the Trichoderma/Botrytis interaction assays were not analyzed across a similar variety of conditions. For example, the authors performed the interaction assays on PDA media at 20C, the data from which support the conclusion the the Trichoderma FRQ does not significantly influence its parasitism of Botrytis. However, what would these results look like on media in which the Trichoderma oscillator is more robust, i.e. on GYEC media at 22C? Conversely, how would these changing conditions influence the Botrtyis clock proteins and their role in the interaction? The inclusion of such data may strengthen the overall discussion of the fungal clock operating within stringent environmental conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the curiosity expressed by the reviewer. Examination of different media modulating the Botrytis-Trichoderma interaction will be a future area of study (particularly involving conditions mimicking soil). Nevertheless, they were beyond the scope of this first report, and due to all the complications of a closed lab during almost 16 months, and people moving on to new jobs, this was further delayed. Based on the reactions of colleagues, as we first presented the data in public in 2022 (Fungal Genetics, and Botrytis meetings), we are convinced that the story, as it is, will be extremely well received and, most importantly, will inspire new angles of studies in different labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the interaction assay, it is clear the inoculating the plates at dawn results in greater Trichoderma overgrowth compared to inoculation at dusk. However, the authors state in the discussion (pg 33, line 15), that &quot;overgrowth is increased when the &quot;interactions started at dawn...&quot;. Does the inoculation time really represent the time at which the fungal interaction take place? Surely there must be a lag that reflects the growth of the organisms towards each other. Perhaps the interaction begins 12 h after inoculation, i.e. at dusk. Relatedly, how does growth rate of the various mutant strains (of either species) under the various light conditions influence the time in the solar/circadian day in which the initial interaction takes place?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noticed, there must be a lag reflecting the growth of both fungi towards each other. Interestingly, in the case of the Botrytis-plant interaction, which also is influenced by the time of the day as reported by our group years ago, there is also a lag: the infection assays are regularly conducted employing a droplet containing conidia that first needs to develop the infecting hyphae, and later, the appressorium to penetrate the plant tissue. However, differences are observed between dawn and dusk inoculation times irrespective of this delay.</p><p>The reviewer, for sure, is concerned that this delay might be too extended in time, explained, for example, by a significant difference in growth rate between the two fungi. Therefore, we controlled for it: after two days of growth, the colony sizes of Trichoderma and Botrytis was measured, and no statistical differences were observed. Please, refer to new figure (Figure 4-figure supplement 1) and page 17, Line 9-17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Much attention is given to circadian influence on Trichoderma secondary metabolism, which is indeed very interesting. However, the relationship between this and the Botrytis interaction results are fairly weak. Can the authors demonstrate that culture supernatants of Trichoderma taken at different times across the circadian day, or in DD v LL, have an differential impact on Botrytis growth or viability? Maybe this is an oversimplified expectation. In any case , it is noted that Botrytis proteins have the greatest impact on the interaction, which would suggest that the circadian regulation of Trichoderma metabolites may not be particularly important. Do the authors think the relative susceptibility of Botrytis to Trichoderma metabolites, or some other stressor, is regulated by the Bc clock proteins? In other words, some discussion about the fungal-fungal interaction from the Botrytis perspective may be welcomed.</p></disp-quote><p>The question raised by the reviewer is fascinating and could even have biotechnological implications in using Trichoderma for biocontrol. And although the products secreted by Trichoderma when growing alone in a liquid medium differ from those produced when growing with Botrytis in the same Petri dish, the interpretation of the data would be very complex since the secreted products (proteins, metabolites, etc.) are very stable over time. We have briefly included ideas as the ones mentioned by the reviewer, in the discussion session.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overall, the 'Introduction' and 'Discussion' sections are nicely written and easy to read. By contrast, the 'Results' section contains some phrasing and grammatical issues that should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have revised the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a very interesting study and my major &quot;concerns&quot; are outlined above. I may have misunderstood key aspects of the experiments, in which case a clarifying statement in the rebuttal may suffice. However, I do think that the authors should clarify some things in the manuscript as outlined here.</p><p>1) Please describe the assay conditions more clearly throughout the manuscript. The assay medium for Figure 3, for example, is not mentioned in the results or figure legend. I can't even see a definitive mention of the medium in the methods. In fact, the figure 4 legend is the only place where PDA is explicitly stated. Similarly, it is unclear what media was used for the secondary metabolite profiles. Based on the language in the methods, it seems that the light experiments were performed on PDA and the circadian time course was on GYEC… is that correct? If so, why use different media? This conditions be clearly stated in the figure legends in any case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing this up. We have now made sure that each key figure is explicit regarding the utilized media. The need to use PDA in some experiment’s and GYEC + peas media in others is discussed within the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To what extent does the relative growth rate of the two organisms influence the interaction? For example, if a particular B. cinerea (Bc) mutant were slow growing, would this make the apparent overgrowth of T. atroviride (Ta) seem larger? The methods state that the readout is based on percent overgrowth, but this isn't really obvious in most of the pictures. To me, and perhaps to many readers, the readout (dotted line) seems to reflect the point of contact between the two organisms, sort of like a mating assay, which would presumably be growth rate dependent.</p><p>– To perhaps clarify this issue, the authors might consider is showing the each strain (Ta and Bc) by itself on a plate under each of the conditions (e.g. DD, LL, LD, etc). This would allow the reader to better visualize the morphology and growth rate of each organism in isolation, and consequently interpret the interaction experiments better.</p></disp-quote><p>Originally, we asked ourselves questions similar to the ones raised by the reviewer. We explored them by changing the relative position of the inoculation point of one of the confronting fungi yet, we saw results similar to the ones presented in the manuscript. Please, refer to response #2 (above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Pg. 13, line 12: &quot;After 72 h of cultivation in LL, conidia in Δtafrq exhibited a dark-green color compared to the TaWT and the OE::tafrq strains (Supplementary file 2A) which displayed the characteristic T. atroviride green coloration.&quot;</p><p>– This sentence is a bit confusing. So &quot;green&quot; is normal, and &quot;dark green&quot; is abnormal? It may be helpful for the unfamiliar reader if the authors briefly describe basic Trichoderma colony morphology, i.e. what color are the condia and underlying hyphae.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see modification in page 14, lines 12-15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some specific areas in the 'Results' section that need revision include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p>– Pg 13, line 8: &quot;This distinctive phenotype…&quot;</p><p>– Pg. 14, Line 15.</p><p>– Page 18, Line 2: &quot;Regarding…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Reviews are appreciated.

Now you can read “quality of the oscillations greatly improved”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The first two chapters describe the characterization of the circadian clock of T. atroviride. The authors show that it can be entrained by light-dark cycles, that it can be reset by a light or temperature pulse, and it is temperature compensated in a range between 20 and 26{degree sign}C. The mechanism of clock functioning appears to be similar to the one in <italic>N. crassa</italic> with a conserved cis element in the promoter of the frequency gene. Interestingly, addition of pea powder significantly enhanced the amplitude of the clock-dependent reporter expression. Is this a specific effect of pea or do other plants or fruits serve the same function? This is especially important because this aspect is also highlighted in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>At present, we have not done systematic experiments to evaluate other plant species because this would deviate our efforts in the lab. But indeed, this is a very exciting area to explore, and particularly towards identifying the molecular nature of the plant element(s) that seem(s) to enhance rhythms. Future plans entertain the idea of adding different extracts from plant roots, which is a more &quot;natural&quot; environment for <italic>T. atroviride.</italic> Since, as a group, we have been working longer with <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, we routinely use plant material to stimulate conidiation in the latter fungus, but we also do not know the component(s) that promote this enhanced conidiation in <italic>B. cinerea.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find it very surprising, but interesting at the same time, that several tested and known clock-controlled genes apparently are not clock-controlled in T. atroviride. The authors should look at some regulators of the pathways they identified as being under clock control. The candidates could be further analyzed for the identified cis element in their promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we were surprised too by their lack of rhythmicity. It is possible that the promoter region used does not contain all the information which is discussed in the manuscript. In any case, a systematic and unbiased strategy (e.g., RNA-Seq) could help indicate, in the future, whether orthologs of known <italic>ccgs</italic> (as well as unexpected ones) are rhythmic in Trichoderma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, they tested a function of the frq gene outside the clock function, because such an additional function had been described before in B. cinerea. They found that indeed conidiation is delayed in a frq-deletion strain, independent of ligh-dark cycles. To verify these results the deletion strain should be re-complemented with a wild-type copy.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's suggestions. We have verified our results by performing complementation experiments: please, see new Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and 4, (<italic>Δtafrq</italic> complementation), pages 15, lines 9-15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the following chapters they focus on the mycoparasitic interaction and use frq and wc mutant strains of both fungi in confrontation assays. They first found that light inhibits the parasitic capacity of T. atroviride and that the WC-1 orthologue is required for the aggressive behavior of T. atroviride in the dark. Again in this series of experiments a T. atroviride frq re-complemented strain is missing. In light-dark cycles it turned out that the B. cinerea Frq protein is important for the outcome of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is clock-controlled, but on the prey side.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestions. As the lack of <italic>frq</italic> in Trichoderma does not have a major impact in these assays, we mainly looked at the complemented strain in the context of the previous question (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the last chapter they analyzed the production of different secondary metabolites and found that the production is under light control. The WC orthologue and Frq are involved in the regulation, independent of their functions in the circadian clock. However, the authors also show that the production of some compounds is clock controlled, and most required Frq. I guess for specialists the source data tables are useful. I cannot evaluate them.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the data provides nice evidence of rhythmic metabolites (which depend on TaFRQ). We look forward to unveiling the molecular events controlling their production as well as their identity and physiological role.</p></body></sub-article></article>
