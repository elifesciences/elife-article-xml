increases heart function and decreases heart dilation after myocardial infarction (MI). Here, we investigated whether part of the cardioprotective effect of BNP in infarcted hearts related to improved neovascularisation. Infarcted mice were treated with saline or BNP for 10 days. BNP treatment increased vascularisation and the number of endothelial cells in all areas of infarcted hearts. Endothelial cell lineage tracing showed that BNP directly stimulated the proliferation of resident endothelial cells via NPR-A binding and p38 MAP kinase activation. BNP also stimulated the proliferation of WT1<sup>+</sup> epicardium-derived cells but only in the hypoxic area of infarcted hearts. Our results demonstrated that these immature cells have a natural capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells in infarcted hearts. BNP treatment increased their proliferation but not their differentiation capacity. We identified new roles for BNP that hold potential for new therapeutic strategies to improve recovery and clinical outcome after MI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>brain natriuretic peptide</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>precursors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PMPDB310030_162985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblatt</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Emma Muschamp Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F34567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblatt</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17B079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblatt</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brain natriuretic peptide supplementation can increase cardiac neovascularization in infarcted hearts by stimulating endogenous endothelial cell proliferation and proliferation of precursor cells, which will differentiate into endothelial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increased vascularisation supports heart recovery after ischemia. The formation of new vessels in the hypoxic area restores blood flow, provides oxygen and nutriments to the surviving cells, and promotes the migration and engraftment of new cells. While angiogenic inhibition contributes to the development of heart failure in cardiac injury animal models, early heart reperfusion or increased angiogenesis improves cardiac function and delays the onset of heart failure in patients suffering from cardiac ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shiojima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friehs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tirziu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Angiogenesis is the main mechanism of neovascularisation in adult infarcted hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manavski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ray et al., 2010</xref>). The origin of new endothelial cells (i.e. resident or infiltrating) as well as the underlying mechanism leading to their proliferation (partial endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition [EndMT] or not) have long been debated. The current consensus is that after myocardial infarction (MI), angiogenesis in the infarct border zone of the heart occurs by clonal expansion of pre-existing resident endothelial cells with no EndMT mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manavski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2017</xref>). However, the molecular pathway involved in myocardial neovascularisation after ischemia remains unknown. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Payne et al., 2019</xref> recently demonstrated that the developmental VEGFA-MEF2 pathway, which was thought to be involved, is in fact impaired in adult ischaemic hearts.</p><p>Stimulating angiogenesis after MI can improve heart recovery. One complementary therapy could be ‘re-activating’ vasculogenesis (i.e. the differentiation of precursor cells into mature endothelial cells), a mechanism that occurs in the heart during development but is quiescent in adult hearts. Epicardial cells, and more precisely, cells expressing the Wilms’ tumour 1 transcription factor (WT1) migrate from the epicardium to the myocardium during heart development and then differentiate into coronary endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and even cardiomyocytes after epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smits et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, numerous WT1<sup>+</sup> cells are found in foetal and neonatal hearts, whereas only a few cells express WT1 in adult hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In hypoxic adult hearts, numerous proliferating WT1<sup>+</sup> cells can be localised in the epicardium near the infarct and border zone, suggesting that hypoxia stimulates either the proliferation of the remaining WT1<sup>+</sup> cells or the re-expression of WT1 in cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balbi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). WT1<sup>+</sup> epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) remain in a thickened layer on the heart surface without migrating into the myocardium or differentiating into other cell types such as cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Different treatments (e.g. injections of thymosin beta four or human amniotic fluid stem cell secretome) fail to induce WT1<sup>+</sup> cell differentiation into endothelial cells in adult hearts after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balbi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Despite enhanced WT1<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation and higher vessel density in these treated infarcted hearts, no WT1<sup>+</sup> cell differentiation into endothelial cells has been detected, implying that WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs improve neovascularisation in infarcted hearts via paracrine stimulation.</p><p>It is therefore important to identify soluble factors to increase neovascularisation in the heart after MI. For several years, we have studied the role of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the heart during ageing and after ischaemic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). BNP is a cardiac hormone belonging to the natriuretic peptide family along with atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). Although low levels of BNP are co-stored with ANP in atria, high levels of BNP are detected in the ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Potter et al., 2009</xref>). BNP is mainly secreted in the ventricles by cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial and precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Potter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenblatt-Velin et al., 2016</xref>). BNP binds to guanylyl cyclase receptors, NPR-A and NPR-B, thus increasing the intracellular cGMP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Potter et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>BNP is synthesised in the cell cytoplasm as pre-proBNP precursor, cleaved by furin and corin into proBNP peptide, and then into the biologically active carboxy-terminal BNP peptide (active BNP) and the inactive N-terminal fragment (NT-proBNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yandle and Richards, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clerico et al., 2012</xref>). ProBNP, active BNP, and NT-proBNP peptides are continuously secreted by cardiac cells and ProBNP peptide is the major circulating form of BNP in the plasma of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimizu et al., 2002</xref>). O-glycosylated proBNP was also detected in the plasma of patients suffering from heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Volpe et al., 2016</xref>), and O-glycosylation of proBNP prevents cleavage of this peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Volpe et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the balance between proBNP and active BNP is impaired in patients with heart diseases, as they have higher levels of inactive proBNP and reduced levels of active BNP. Patients with heart disease therefore have a deficit in functional active BNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen, 2007</xref>).</p><p>BNP secreted by cardiac cells acts on different organs such as the kidneys (modulating sodium and water excretion), vessels (increasing dilation), fat (increasing lipolysis), and pancreas (modulating insulin secretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenblatt-Velin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Volpe et al., 2016</xref>). In the heart, a majority of cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells) express BNP receptors in physiological and pathological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). BNP treatment after injury protects the heart by reducing fibrosis, cardiomyocyte death, and hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Souza and Baxter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moilanen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gorbe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the last few years, we and others reported that BNP supplementation after ischaemic damage promotes the recovery of cardiac function and prevents cardiac remodelling in adult rodent ischaemic hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moilanen et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, in clinic, a treatment (LCZ696 or Entresto, Novartis) based on inhibition of neprilysin, an enzyme involved in the degradation of the natriuretic peptides, leads to reduced rate of mortality in patients suffering from heart failure with reduced and preserved cardiac contractility or ejection fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McMurray et al., 2014</xref>). The cellular mechanisms by which BNP exerts its cardioprotective effect are not fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenblatt-Velin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moilanen et al., 2011</xref>). Curiously, we observed that BNP stimulates in vitro and in vivo (i.e. in adult infarcted hearts) the proliferation of cardiac non-myocyte cells (NMCs) expressing the stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rignault-Clerc et al., 2017</xref>). As Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells in adult hearts were reported to be pure endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), we questioned whether BNP modulates endothelial cell fate.</p><p>Thus, since high BNP levels in plasma are associated with increased collateral development in patients with coronary artery disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xi et al., 2011</xref>), this work aimed to determine whether part of the cardioprotective effect of BNP treatment after experimental MI involves increased neovascularisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BNP direct action on cardiac NMCs after intraperitoneal injections</title><p>MI was induced in mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery. Injection of BNP was immediately performed after surgery and then every 2 days for up to 10 days after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). BNP injections may have systemic effects and affect several cell types expressing its receptors (such as fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells in all organs and even cardiomyocytes). In previous work, we first controlled that with the doses of BNP used, we had no effect on systolic blood pressure (measured every day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). Secondly, we evaluated cardiac parameters and heart structure by echocardiography in BNP and saline-treated ‘unmanipulated’ and infarcted mice. No difference was detected in heart rate, cardiac output, left ventricular diastolic volume (LV Vol;d) as well as for the index of systemic vascular resistance between both groups, demonstrating that BNP treatment (at the dose used in this study) had no significant effect on volumia and no peripheral vascular effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). Third, contractility (EF@LV Vol;d) was twofold increased 4 weeks after MI in BNP-treated groups and BNP injections reduced clearly heart remodelling (which is the percentage of changes of the left ventricle volume) 1 (−45%, p=0.06) and 4 weeks (−79%, p=0.04) after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, BNP treatment of infarcted hearts reduced also mRNA levels coding for vimentin in the RZ of infarcted hearts 1 (−59%, p=0.004) and 4 (-36%, p=0.025) weeks after MI, which suggests an effect on fibrosis development as already demonstrated by other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moilanen et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, BNP treatment reduced also the infarct size (determined by echocardiography analysis with the % of MI length LA) by 15 and 20% 1 and 4 weeks after MI, respectively (results however not statistically different).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intraperitoneal BNP injection acts on cardiac non-myocyte cells (NMCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental protocol as described in details in Material and methods section.

Thus, we first aimed to determine whether intraperitoneally injected BNP acted directly or indirectly on cardiac cells.</p><p>For this purpose, activations of different components of the BNP signalling pathway were evaluated after BNP injections in unmanipulated or infarcted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). BNP binding to the receptors NPR-A and NPR-B, but not NPR-C, increases intracellular cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) levels. cGMP modulates the protein kinase G activity and induces phosphorylation at Ser16 of phospholamban (PLB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenblatt-Velin et al., 2016</xref>). Increased intracellular cGMP levels simultaneously activate GMP-related cation channels, leading to cGMP extrusion from the cytoplasm into the circulation.</p><p>BNP acts directly on the heart. Indeed, very rapidly after intraperitoneal (ip) BNP injections (i.e. 30 min), increased cGMP levels were detected by ELISA in cardiac tissue (x 3.13, p=0.006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the plasma of unmanipulated mice, cGMP concentration increased 3.8-fold (103 vs 25 pmoles/ml) after one BNP injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In infarcted mice, 1 day after BNP injection, the plasmatic cGMP concentration remained high (207 vs 51 pmoles/ml, p=0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but returned to the level detected in the plasma of saline-injected mice 2 days after BNP injection (data not shown). The increased cardiac and plasmatic cGMP concentrations demonstrate that injected BNP binds to NPR-A and/or NPR-B receptors.</p><p>PLB protein is expressed by contractile (cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells) and also by non-contractile cells, such as endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sutliff et al., 1999</xref>).

The pPLB/PLB ratio increased 2.1-fold in ‘unmanipulated’ hearts 1 to 3 hr after BNP injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In infarcted hearts of BNP-treated mice, the pPLB/PLB ratio increased 3 days after MI, 2.1- and 1.5-fold in the infarct and border zone (ZI+BZ) and in the remote zone (RZ), respectively. 10 days after MI, the pPLB/PLB ratio increased 4.0-fold in the ZI+BZ and was unchanged in the RZ. Furthermore, the pPLB/PLB ratio increased 197- and 179-fold in NMCs isolated from the ZI+BZ and RZ of infarcted hearts in BNP-treated mice 10 days after MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We already demonstrated that BNP injections in mice after MI decreased heart remodelling and increased heart function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). We thus questioned whether increased neovascularisation in infarcted hearts is part of the cardioprotective effect of BNP.</p><p>In this study, we first showed that BNP treatment increases myocardial vascularisation and the number of endothelial cells in the infarct zone and border zone (ZI+BZ) as a well as in the remote zone (RZ) of infarcted hearts. Second, BNP stimulates the proliferation of endogenous pre-existing endothelial cells, likely via NPR-A binding and p38 MAP kinase activation. Third, BNP stimulates and/or accelerates the re-expression of the WT1 transcription factor in cardiac cells after MI. Fourth, in the infarcted area of untreated injured hearts, WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs proliferate and modestly contribute to heart neovascularisation by differentiating into endothelial cells. Lastly, BNP stimulates WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDC proliferation, with more endothelial cells originating from WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs in BNP-treated infarcted hearts.</p><p>This is the first work to demonstrate that intraperitoneal injections of BNP increase neovascularisation of the heart after MI. Thus, part of the cardioprotective effect of BNP in infarcted hearts is probably due to accelerated and/or increased neovascularisation in both the ZI+BZ and RZ. This result corroborates works reporting that natriuretic peptides stimulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis during development and in adult ischaemic organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moyes and Hobbs, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuhn, 2012</xref>). ANP via NPR-A stimulates endothelial precursor cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in the skin during cutaneous wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). The restoration of blood flow is impaired after hindlimb ischemia in NPR-A KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuhn et al., 2009</xref>), while the injection of a high concentration of CNP increases vascular density in infarcted swine hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Ry et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, CNP was identified as a key regulator in angiogenesis and vascular remodelling after ischemia in patients suffering from peripheral artery disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bubb et al., 2019</xref>). Other findings reported that BNP injections in mice lead to increased vascular regeneration in ischaemic limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shmilovich et al., 2009</xref>) and that intramyocardial BNP gene delivery via adenovirus increased capillary density in normal rat hearts but not in infarcted hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moilanen et al., 2011</xref>). Our article makes a novel contribution by showing the ‘time- and area-dependent’ effect of BNP and the identification of both different mechanisms by which BNP increases the number of endothelial cells in infarcted hearts.</p><p>In our mouse model, the timing and action mechanisms of BNP stimulation differed in the myocardium in the ZI+BZ and RZ of infarcted hearts. In the RZ of infarcted hearts, the number of endothelial cells and vascularisation increased 3 days after MI. In the ZI+BZ, we detected more endothelial cells 3 days after MI but vascularisation increased only 10 days after MI. BNP stimulates endothelial cell proliferation first in the RZ (1–3 days after MI induction) and then in the ZI+BZ (10 days after MI). Although BNP seems to induce the re-expression of the WT1 transcription factor in cardiac cells in both areas of infarcted hearts (3 to 10 days after MI), its effect on WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs is limited to ZI+BZ of infarcted hearts 10 days after MI.</p><p>The delay in stimulating endothelial cell proliferation in the different areas of infarcted hearts can be explained by the bioavailability of BNP (less cell deaths, more vessels and capillaries in the RZ), but its effect on WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs must be favoured by the microenvironment and probably hypoxia. Indeed, in the ZI+BZ, cells undergo a synergistic effect of hypoxia and BNP.</p><p>Concerning the mechanisms, we showed that BNP acts directly on mature endothelial cells by stimulating their proliferation. The fact that BNP treatment did not increase the number of endothelial cells in neonatal NMCs isolated from neonatal NPR-A deficient hearts in our study demonstrates that BNP acts via NPR-A on neonatal cardiac cells. In the mouse model of hindlimb ischaemia, proliferating satellite cells secreted BNP, which stimulates angiogenesis in the neighbouring endothelium cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuhn et al., 2009</xref>). This mechanism is also impaired in NPR-A KO mice, suggesting that regardless of the organ, BNP stimulates mature endothelial cell proliferation via the NPR-A receptor.</p><p>In our work, BNP treatment modulated also the fate of immature cells such as WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs. This is not the first work to report the effect of BNP on immature or precursor cells. BNP level is highly correlated with the number of circulating endothelial precursor cells in patients suffering from heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shmilovich et al., 2009</xref>). In vitro, the proliferation, adhesion, and migration capacities of endothelial precursor cells increased in a dose-dependent manner after BNP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shmilovich et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, BNP stimulated the proliferation of satellite cells in a hindlimb ischemia model, which produced endogenous BNP stimulating the regeneration of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuhn et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Among cells expressing the WT1 transcription factor, it is important to discriminate between true WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs and cardiac cells re-expressing the WT1 transcription factor in ischaemic hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duim et al., 2015</xref>). While the function of WT1 re-expression in infarcted hearts is poorly understood, it seems necessary for endothelial cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duim et al., 2015</xref>), with our results showing that BNP treatment increases and/or accelerates this process. However, in Cdh5:ROSA infarcted hearts, we detected GFP<sup>+</sup> WT1<sup>+</sup> BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells (i.e. endothelial proliferating cells expressing WT1) as well as GFP<sup>+</sup> WT1<sup>-</sup> BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells (i.e. endothelial proliferating cells without WT1 expression), which shows that WT1 expression is transient or unnecessary for endothelial cell proliferation.</p><p>Regarding WT1<sup>+</sup> precursor cells, we induced MI in WT1:ROSA hearts and analysed the fate of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. We observed the proliferation of WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs, mainly localised in the subepicardial layer after MI as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balbi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Although the differentiation of WT1<sup>+</sup> cells into endothelial cells in infarcted hearts is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), we found that 5% of endothelial cells in the ZI+BZ originated from WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs in saline-treated infarcted hearts. Interestingly, 50% of WT1<sup>+</sup> cells differentiated into endothelial cells in these infarcted hearts. This shows that WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs have the natural capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells in adult hypoxic hearts, as is the case during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Due their low number, it was nevertheless difficult to highlight this process.</p><p>BNP increased the number of WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs in the subepicardial layer by stimulating their proliferation. Consequently, more cells migrated into the myocardium and differentiated into endothelial cells. We cannot exclude that BNP could also stimulate the migration of EPDCs into the myocardium, where the conditions could be adequate to differentiate into endothelial cells. Regardless of the mechanism, 10% of endothelial cells in the ZI+BZ originate from WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs in BNP-treated hearts. However, the differentiation capacity of the WT1<sup>+</sup> cells into endothelial cells was identical in saline- and BNP-treated hearts (about 50%). BNP therefore stimulates WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDC proliferation but not their differentiation into endothelial cells.</p><p>Our study does not fully elucidate the signalling pathways by which BNP induces endothelial cell and WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDC proliferation. Additional work is needed in this respect, especially regarding the link between BNP treatment and VEGF expression. Indeed, the reactivation of the VEGFA signalling pathway in adult infarcted hearts 10 days after surgery is likely the key of increased angiogenesis after BNP treatment. This pathway was shown to be inactive in adult ischaemic hearts, whereas it drives angiogenesis after ischemia in neonatal hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Payne et al., 2019</xref>). However, as some studies reported that natriuretic peptides repress VEGF synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pedram et al., 2001</xref>), it is unclear which mechanism(s) increased <italic>vegfa</italic> mRNA levels in both areas of the infarcted hearts 10 days after MI.</p><p>Interestingly, in our experiment, we did not detect increased <italic>vegfa</italic> mRNA levels in the RZ of infarcted hearts 1 or 3 days after MI, where the proliferation of endothelial cells increased. This suggests that, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuhn et al., 2009</xref> using a hindlimb ischemia model, BNP can also promote endothelial cell proliferation independently of VEGF secretion.</p><p>In the ZI+BZ, however, increased <italic>vegfa</italic> mRNA levels seem to induce the stimulation of WT1<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation. Indeed, by stimulating WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs with BNP, we obtained the same results as Zangi et al., who injected synthetic modified RNA encoding VEGF-A directly into the myocardium of infarcted mouse hearts, which stimulated WT1<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation and shifted their differentiation into endothelial cells (i.e. 50% of WT1<sup>+</sup> cells differentiated into endothelial cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zangi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it seems that hypoxia and BNP increase VEGF, which stimulates WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDC proliferation. The interactions between BNP and VEGF should therefore be studied in more detail to confirm whether BNP acts on endothelial cells via a VEGF-independent mechanism and on WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs via a VEGF-dependent mechanism.</p><p>The findings presented in our study hold potential to offer new therapeutic strategies to improve the neovascularisation of hearts after MI or to aid neovascularisation in ischaemic hearts in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. Indeed, we identified BNP as a ‘new cardiac angiogenic’ factor, which stimulates the proliferation of both resident cardiac mature endothelial cells and WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs. We have not yet identified the exact mechanisms by which BNP could act but re-activation of the VEGF-dependent pathway, active in infarcted neonatal hearts but inactive in adult infarcted hearts, may be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Payne et al., 2019</xref>). We also identified the proliferation and differentiation of WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDCs as a mechanism, which can be targeted in infarcted adult hearts to increase heart revascularisation. To summarise, BNP binds to NPR-A to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation via p38 MAP kinase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). BNP treatment also stimulates WT1<sup>+</sup> EPDC proliferation. It remains to be determined whether BNP acts directly on these cells or via increased VEGF level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Interestingly, the benefit of LCZ696 treatment which reduces significantly the mortality of patients with chronic heart failure seems also to be associated with increased heart vascularisation, as a result of increased endothelial and WT1<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation. However, whether this is associated with increased level of BNP remains to be demonstrated.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>BNP-mediated mechanisms leading to increased number of endothelial cells in infarcted hearts.</title><p>BNP binds directly on NPR-A receptor expressed on endothelial cells and activates p38 MAP kinase to induce their proliferation (left).

MI was induced in 8-week-old male C57 BL/6 mice by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Briefly, mice were anaesthetised (ketamine (65 mg/kg)/xylazine (15 mg/kg), acépromazine (2 mg/kg)), intubated and ventilated. The chest cavity was entered through the third intercostal space at the left upper sternal border, and MI was induced by ligature of the LAD with a 7–0 nylon suture at about 1–2 mm from the atria.</p><p>For Cdh5:ROSA and Wt1:ROSA mice, surgeries were performed in 8 week-old adult male mice injected 2 weeks before with Tamoxifen.Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) was dissolved in ethanol at 100 mg/ml and emulsified in peanut oil to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. 1 mg Tamoxifen/25 g body weight was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to adult mice every 3 days for 3 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Directly after the surgery, NaCl or BNP (1 µg / 20 g mouse in 20 µl, Bachem synthetic mouse BNP (1-45) peptide (catalog number H-7558)) was injected into the left ventricle cavity. Temgesic (Buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously as soon as the mice waked up and every 8–12 hr during 2 days.</p><p>BNP (2 µg / 25 g mouse) was injected i.p. every 2 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). After surgery (for the mice sacrificed after 1 day) or 24 hr after the surgery (for all other mice), BrdU (1 mg/ml, Sigma B5002) was added to drinking water and changed every 2 days during 10 days.</p><p>For the experiments related to LCZ696 (Entresto, Novartis) treatment, mice after MI were randomly assigned into three different groups: H2O, LCZ696 [6 mg/kg/day], or LCZ696 [60 mg/kg/day]. These two drug concentrations were chosen as LCZ696 [6 mg/kg/day] is the dose mostly used in patients (200–600 mg/day) and LCZ696 [60 mg/kg/day] induces a dose-dependent increase in plasmatic natriuretic peptides in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suematsu et al., 2016</xref>). LCZ696 drugs were grounded, formulated in water and sonicated for 1 hr before administration. Drugs were administrated 24 hr after MI and once daily for 10 days by oral gavage. Blood pressure was measured daily, from one week before surgery until sacrifice using a tail-cuff based CODA high throughput system (Kent Scientific Corporation).</p><p>Mice were sacrificed 1, 3, 10, or 28 days after infarct induction and hearts were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If immunofluorescence has to be carried out, apex was embedded into OCT and slowly frozen. Remaining heart was separated into three zones, the infarct zone (ZI), the border zone (BZ) and the remote zone (RZ). According the required experiment, ZI and BZ may be pooled. Tissues were either digested for flow cytometry analysis or quickly frozen for mRNA or protein analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>NMCs were isolated from the hearts of neonatal C57BL/6, NPR-A KO or NPR-B KO pups (1–2 days) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rignault-Clerc et al., 2017</xref>) and were cultured in medium composed of MEM Alpha (Gibco 32571–028), 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin with or without BNP (5 µg/ml) up to confluence (i.e. 10–11 days). Adult cardiac NMCs were isolated from adult C56BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) by digesting adult ventricles in buffer containing 1 mg/ml collagenase IV (Gibco 17104–019) and 1.2 mg/ml dispase II (Sigma, D4693) and were cultured in EGM−2 Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 BulletKit (Lonza, CC-3162) supplemented with 15% foetal calf serum (FCS) (invitrogen Corp) with or without BNP (5 µg/ml) up to confluence (i.e. 5–10 days).

In case of WT1:ROSA26 cells, cytoplasmic staining was done for GFP detection after fixation (1.5% PFA) and permeabilisation (0.2% saponin). All stainings were performed 20 min on ice. Cells were analysed with Gallios cytometer and data using FlowJo 10 software.</p><p>The numbers of CD31<sup>+</sup> cells in cell cultures or in NMCs isolated from hearts were obtained by relating the percentage of the CD31<sup>+</sup> cells obtained by flow cytometry analysis and the total number of NMCs in culture or obtained after heart digestion in the different area of infarcted hearts. The number of GFP<sup>+</sup> or GFP<sup>-</sup> cells among NMCs isolated from infarcted Cdh5:ROSA mice was determined by the same method, using flow cytometry analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Echocardiography and measurements</title><p>Transthoracic echocardiographies were performed on adult unmanipulated or infarcted mice using a 30 M-Hz probe and the Vevo 770 Ultrasound machine (VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielmann et al., 2015</xref>). All measurements were done from leading edge to leading edge according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening, were evaluated on lightly anaesthetised mice (1% isoflurane). Furthermore, according to the fact that changes in left ventricle volume can be considered as an index of remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Konstam et al., 2011</xref>), we calculated the percentage of increase of the left ventricle volume 10 days after surgery, which is the ratio between (LV Vol;d 1 or 4 weeks − LV Vol;d before surgery) and LV Vol;d before surgery ×100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Neonatal and adult hearts were embedded in OCT. Immunostainings were performed on 5 µm heart sections or on cells cultured for up to 11 days on coverslips. Tissue sections or cells were fixed 10 min in 2% PFA. The first antibodies were all incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies were incubated 1 hr at room temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matthias Barton as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Increasing heart vascularisation using brain natriuretic peptide stimulation of endothelial and WT1 + epicardial cells&quot; by Li et al. reports data of myocardial angiogenesis in mice subjected to experimental myocardial infarction. The study indicates that repeated intraperitoneal injections of synthetic BNP or oral treatment with Entresto, a drug inhibiting neprilysin-mediated degradation of the endogenous natriuretic peptides, possibly improves cardiac vascularization after ischemia.</p><p>Microvascular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a major clinical problem. Although primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has markedly improved patients' survival, despite epicardial reperfusion more than 30% of patients show signs of microvascular dysfunction leading to adverse left ventricular remodeling and heart failure. Impaired angiogenesis can contribute to myocardial tissue damage. Based on experimental studies, several clinical trials aimed to improve myocardial angiogenesis via intracoronary administration of vascular growth factors, gene transfer or bone marrow mononuclear cells, in patients who had successful primary PCI, but the results were disappointing. A better knowledge of the cellular pathways regulating myocardial (re)perfusion after ischemia is necessary to search for therapeutic strategies capable to restore the microvascular network and flow. The here presented study aimed to elucidate whether B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) can improve myocardial postischemic angiogenesis in as well as the potential pharmacological, therapeutic implications. Hence, this experimental, “preclinical&quot; study addresses an important, clinically relevant question.</p><p>Overall this study follows a very original question. But it includes many different data sets in somehow incomplete way, many of them generated with “NMC&quot;. It would profit a lot by concentrating in a clean way on some concrete aspects. Mechanistic studies should be preferentially conducted with sorted or cultured endothelia instead of a mixed cell population (NMC, containing fibroblasts, pericytes, inflammatory cells, besides endothelial cells).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Certain parts of the study should be completed. For example, why don't the authors present a fine and extensive analysis of cardiac function in animals treated with BNP? In the same way, the authors should complement their experimental approaches with an analysis of all parameters of cardiac remodeling and in particular infarct size and interstitial fibrosis.</p><p>2) Conversely, the authors made the effort to analyze cardiac function in animals treated with LCZ696 (Figure 9). However, there is no statistical analysis of these data? or the differences are not significant? in this case, what is the interest of a treatment that increases capillary density without modifying cardiac function? It is however likely that an analysis of cardiac function beyond 10 days post-MI could give significantly different results.</p><p>3) The authors should analyze whether or not LCZ696 directly stimulates the proliferation of resident mature endothelial cells and/or that of WT1+ cells.</p><p>4) Results: the authors state that &quot;first they determined whether ip BNP acted directly or indirectly on cardiac cells&quot;. But there is no single data set in this manuscript allowing to conclude that the observed effects are directly derived from endothelial actions of BNP. As they mention before, BNP acts on many types of cells and organs, and the observed effects could also be &quot;indirect&quot;.</p><p>5) Results paragraph three: plasma cGMP levels are a poor index of cardiac actions of BNP. It would be more meaningful to measure cardiac cGMP levels.</p><p>6) Results paragraph four: it is strange to use the phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) as index of BNP activity. This manuscript focuses on angiogenesis. PLB is a regulatory protein in cardiomyocytes. Where is the link to endothelial regeneration?</p><p>7) Results paragraph four: BNP increased phosphorylation of PLB by nearly 200-fold in &quot;non-myocyte cells&quot; from the heart. Which cells are these? Is this fraction contaminated by cardiomyocytes? Which non-myocytes have such high PLB levels?</p><p>8) How were BNP plasma levels in BNP versus vehicle treated mice after MI? Did Entresto increase BNP plasma levels and to what extend?</p><p>9) Most in vitro and ex vivo studies were performed with NMCs. How many endothelial cells are contained in such heterogenous populations?</p><p>10) Some basic parameters are missing: how did BNP administration affect cardiac contractile functions as well as the infarct area and area at risk? Did exogenous BNP lower arterial blood pressure?</p><p>11) Subsection “Stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells via p38 MAP kinase activation”: how does BNP, via NPR-A/cGMP-signaling, increase MAPK pp38?

But in the corresponding Figure 9, there is no single data set showing “statistically significant effects of entresto”. The figure just shows some preliminary data and trends obtained with very few mice.</p><p>13) Figure 1C: it is surprising that the basal levels of pPLB were so low (-). Normally, after MI in mice the endogenous ventricular expression levels of ANP and BNP significantly raise. Was there a difference in pPLB between sham and MI mice (vehicle treatments)?</p><p>14) Figure 1D: which types of non-myocyte cells express such high pPLB levels and what is the functional meaning?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Increasing heart vascularisation using brain natriuretic peptide stimulation of endothelial and WT1 + epicardial cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Cardiac structures and functions were evaluated by echocardiography in unmanipulated as well as 1 and 4 weeks after myocardial infarction in saline or BNP-treated mice.</p><p>However, we completed here the data and added the results concerning the mRNA level coding for vimentin (a key protein involved in the development of pathological fibrosis) and the estimation of the infarct size obtained by echocardiography. Thus, in the manuscript (Results section), we detailed the results already published and added the new information about vimentin mRNA expression and infarct size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Conversely, the authors made the effort to analyze cardiac function in animals treated with LCZ696 (Figure 9). However, there is no statistical analysis of these data? or the differences are not significant? in this case, what is the interest of a treatment that increases capillary density without modifying cardiac function? It is however likely that an analysis of cardiac function beyond 10 days post-MI could give significantly different results.</p></disp-quote><p>As the number of LCZ treated animals were less than 6 per group, we made no statistical analysis of the data presented on Figure 9. However, we performed for this revised manuscript an additional experiment concerning the LCZ treated infarcted mice. We add to our previous data 4 mice treated with 60 mg/day/kg LCZ696, 2 mice treated with 6 mg/kg/day and 5 infarcted mice treated with saline. Now, the number of mice is sufficient to perform correct statistical analysis on the results. Figure 9 was modified and we added new results to the manuscript. Interestingly, LCZ606 treatment at both concentrations increased heart vascularization due to stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation but cardiac function was increased and heart remodelling decreased only in mice treated with the high dose of LCZ696. Interestingly, at high concentration LCZ696 stimulated also WT1<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation in the ZI+BZ of infarcted hearts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should analyze whether or not LCZ696 directly stimulates the proliferation of resident mature endothelial cells and/or that of WT1+ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed immunostainings to detect proliferating CD31<sup>+</sup> cells and WT1<sup>+</sup> cells on LCZ696-treated hearts. We represented the percentage of proliferation of endothelial or WT1<sup>+</sup> cells on the Figure 9 (F and G) (i.e. we counted the BrdU<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> and BrdU<sup>+</sup>Wt1<sup>+</sup> cells and related the number by the total number of CD31<sup>+</sup> or WT1<sup>+</sup> cells, respectively). We added also representative pictures (Figure 9E), changed the figure legend and added these new results in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Results: the authors state that &quot;first they determined whether ip BNP acted directly or indirectly on cardiac cells&quot;.

However in Figure 6D, we demonstrated that BNP acts directly on isolated adult endothelial cells and activates p38 MAP kinase on these cells. in vivo, we detected also p38 phosphorylation on endothelial cells in infarcted hearts after BNP treatment (please refer to Figure 6E and subsection “Stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells via p38 MAP kinase activation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results paragraph three: plasma cGMP levels are a poor index of cardiac actions of BNP.

The text was modified accordingly as well as the legend of the Figure 1. This result demonstrates that BNP acts directly on the heart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Results paragraph four: it is strange to use the phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) as index of BNP activity. This manuscript focuses on angiogenesis. PLB is a regulatory protein in cardiomyocytes. Where is the link to endothelial regeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24-27 kDa protein involved in the modulation of the reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) <sup>3</sup>. PLB inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by SERCA. Phosphorylated form of PLB increases the affinity of SERCA for calcium and thus decreases the level of cytosolic calcium. It is well known than PLB is expressed by muscular cells such as cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells <sup>3, 4</sup>. PLB is also expressed by non-contractile cells, such as endothelial cells (we precised this point in subsection “BNP direct action on cardiac non-myocyte cells after intraperitoneal injections”) <sup>5</sup>. PLB modulates endothelium –dependent relaxation to acetylcholine<sup>5</sup> and regulates via SERCA the integrity of the vascular barrier <sup>6</sup>. Natriuretic peptides are able to increase cytoplasmic cGMP, which activates protein kinase G and leads to PLB phosphorylation. Thus, we used phosphorylation of PLB as a marker of BNP effect on the cardiac non-myocyte cells, including endothelial cells.</p><p>Previously, we showed that BNP via PKG activation and PLB phosphorylation, phosphorylates also p38 in Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells, which finally leads to their proliferation <sup>7</sup>. Sca-1 protein is expressed on endothelial cells. However, the direct link between PLB phosphorylation and angiogenesis remains to be established.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Results paragraph four: BNP increased phosphorylation of PLB by nearly 200-fold in &quot;non-myocyte cells&quot; from the heart. Which cells are these? Is this fraction contaminated by cardiomyocytes? Which non-myocytes have such high PLB levels?</p></disp-quote><p>In non-myocyte cells, endothelial and smooth muscle cells express PLB as explained above (point 6). We isolated these NMCs from adult hearts using enzymatic digestion and retrograde perfusion directly in the hearts as described by Ackers-Johnson <sup>8</sup>. We cannot exclude a small contamination with cardiomyocytes. However, we counted the cells and clearly discriminate between cardiomyocytes (large and medium cells) and NMCs (small cells). Thus, we estimated that the cardiomyocyte contamination is less than 5% among NMCs.</p><p>Furthermore, it is important to notice than all western blots depict on Figure 1 were performed using 25-30 microg proteins. This large amount of proteins allows to detect easily PLB and its phosphorylated form by western blot analysis. Finally, 200 fold increase is a relative unit, related to the level in NMCs isolated from saline treated hearts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) How were BNP plasma levels in BNP versus vehicle treated mice after MI? Did Entresto increase BNP plasma levels and to what extend?</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult to measure BNP plasma level for several reasons:</p><p>– The half-life of BNP active form is 9-20 min.</p><p>– BNP processing is very complex as described in the Introduction. Different forms of BNP are present in the circulation (proBNP, BNP and NT-proBNP form) and the different kits available to measure BNP are not specific for the BNP active form. However, we could measure the NT-proBNP form in the plasma.</p><p>We didn’t measure the NT-proBNP form in our treated animals, because we sacrificed the mice 24h after the last BNP injection and we estimated that it is too late to highlight an increase of NT-proBNP form in BNP treated animals. However, we measured the cGMP in the heart and plasma (Figure 1B and C). Increased cGMP level is the consequence of increased BNP level.</p><p>In Entresto treated mice we didn’t measured the BNP level but this was done by others <sup>9-11</sup>. We also measured the cGMP level in plasma of LCZ696 treated animals and detected a 3-fold increase of cGMP concentration 24h after LCZ696 treatment (60 mg/kg/day). This was explained in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Most in vitro and ex vivo studies were performed with NMCs. How many endothelial cells are contained in such heterogenous populations?</p></disp-quote><p>We isolated non-myocytes cells from neonatal and adult unmanipulated hearts to perform in vitro BNP-stimulations. As explained in the general comment above, isolated endothelial cells gradually die in culture. The presence of other non-myocyte cells allow to keep endothelial cells alive and to stimulate their proliferation.</p><p>At the end of the culture, the CD31<sup>+</sup> cells represent 24±3% of the untreated and 27±4% of the BNP treated neonatal cells (n=32 different cell cultures). In adult NMC culture, only 12±1% of the cells are CD31<sup>+</sup> cells 7 days after the onset of culture in untreated and BNP treated culture (n=16 different experiments).</p><p>In infarcted hearts, 3 days after MI, endothelial cells represent 21±3% of the NMCs in the ZI+BZ and 38±3% of the cells isolated from the RZ (n=16 different cell isolation). 10 days after MI, endothelial cells represent 25±2% of the NMCs of the ZI+BZ and 39±3% of the cells of the RZ (n=17 different cell isolation). The percentages didn’t vary between saline and BNP treated hearts but the number of cells is always increased in BNP treated animals, suggesting that BNP stimulated also the proliferation of other non-myocyte cells or protect these cells from apoptosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Some basic parameters are missing: how did BNP administration affect cardiac contractile functions as well as the infarct area and area at risk? Did exogenous BNP lower arterial blood pressure?</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis of cardiac functions of saline and BNP injected mice was already done and published in our first article (see Figure 7, Bielmann et al., 2014, Basic Research in Cardiology) <sup>2</sup>. Cardiac contractility was 2 fold increased 4 weeks after MI in BNP treated animals (already published)<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>We also measured blood pressure in unmanipulated mice injected or not with BNP. We detected no difference (saline injected: 100.83 ±8.26, BNP 101 ±2.15 mm Hg). This suggests that most BNP effects after MI depends on cardiac rather than on vascular effects. We explain this now in more details in the first paragraph of the Results.</p><p>We measured blood pressure in LCZ treated mice and found no difference 10 days after surgery: saline MI: 103±18 mmHg; LCZ6 treated mice: 103±9 mmHg; LCZ60 treated mice: 109±9 mmHg. We added this result in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “Stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells via p38 MAP kinase activation”: how does BNP, via NPR-A/cGMP-signaling, increase MAPK pp38? What is the signaling pathway and do the authors have any hint that this signaling pathway was also activated by BNP in vivo (in endothelial cells in situ)?</p></disp-quote><p>Previously, we showed that BNP via PKG activation and PLB phosphorylation, phosphorylates p38 in Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells, which finally leads to their proliferation <sup>7</sup>. Phosphorylation of PLB was assessed as a marker of PKG activation. However, BNP activates also cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), which is also able to phosphorylate PLB. PKG and PKA activation can both lead to p38 phosphorylation. We determined in the heart an increase of cGMP but we didn’t measure cAMP after BNP treatment. Thus, further experiments are needed on isolated CD31<sup>+</sup> cells to precisely determine the signaling pathway involved.</p><p>We performed immunostainings against phosphorylated p38 on infarcted hearts treated or not with BNP. These are new results depict on Figure 6E which showed that endothelial and even WT1<sup>+</sup> cells expressed pp38 in BNP-treated infarcted hearts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection &quot;Increased vascularization in infarcted hearts after LCZ696 treatment&quot;.

In contrast, we have a slight decrease which is consistent with the fact that patients with heart disease have in fact a deficit in functional active BNP and thus decreased level of PLB phosphorylation. As explained in the Introduction of the manuscript the balance between proBNP and active BNP is impaired in patients with heart diseases with higher levels of inactive proBNP and reduced levels of active BNP.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61050-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 1D: which types of non-myocyte cells express such high pPLB levels and what is the functional meaning?</p></disp-quote><p>Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24-27 kDa protein involved in the modulation of the reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) <sup>3</sup>.
