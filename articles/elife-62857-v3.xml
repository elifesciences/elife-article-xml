vascular sarcoma that metastasizes early in its clinical course and lacks an effective medical therapy. The TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 fusion proteins are chimeric transcription factors and initiating oncogenic drivers of EHE. A combined proteomic/genetic screen in human cell lines identified YEATS2 and ZZZ3, components of the <underline>A</underline>da<underline>2a-c</underline>ontaining histone acetyltransferase (ATAC) complex, as key interactors of both fusion proteins despite the dissimilarity of the C terminal fusion partners CAMTA1 and TFE3. Integrative next-generation sequencing approaches in human and murine cell lines showed that the fusion proteins drive a unique transcriptome by simultaneously hyperactivating a TEAD-based transcriptional program and modulating the chromatin environment via interaction with the ATAC complex. Interaction of the ATAC complex with both fusion proteins indicates that it is a key oncogenic driver and unifying enzymatic therapeutic target for this sarcoma. This study presents an approach to mechanistically dissect how chimeric transcription factors drive the formation of human cancers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The proliferation of human cells is tightly regulated to ensure that enough cells are made to build and repair organs and tissues, while at the same time stopping cells from dividing uncontrollably and damaging the body. To get the right balance, cells rely on physical and chemical cues from their environment that trigger the biochemical signals that regulate two proteins called TAZ and YAP. These proteins control gene activity by regulating the rate at which genes are copied to produce proteins. If this process becomes dysregulated, cells can grow uncontrollably, causing cancer.</p><p>In cancer cells, it is common to find TAZ and YAP fused to other proteins. In epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, a rare cancer that grows in the blood vessels, cancerous growth can be driven by a version of TAZ fused to the protein CAMTA1, or a version of YAP fused to the protein TFE3. While the role of TAZ and YAP in promoting gene activity is known, it is unclear how CAMTA1 and TFE3 contribute to cell growth becoming dysregulated.</p><p>Merritt, Garcia et al. studied sarcoma cell lines to show that these two fusion proteins, TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3, change the pattern of gene activity seen in the cells compared to TAZ or YAP alone. An analysis of molecules that interact with the two fusion proteins identified a complex called ATAC as the cause of these changes. This complex adds chemical markers to DNA-packaging proteins, which control which genes are available for activation. The fusion proteins combine the ability of TAZ and YAP to control gene activity and the ability of CAMTA1 and TFE3 to make DNA more accessible, allowing the fusion proteins to drive uncontrolled cancerous growth.</p><p>Similar TAZ and YAP fusion proteins have been found in other cancers, which can activate genes and potentially alter DNA packaging. Targeting drug development efforts at the proteins that complex with TAZ and YAP fusion proteins may lead to new therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippo

sarcoma that arises over a wide age range and can occur essentially anywhere anatomically. When it occurs in the lung or the liver, it frequently presents with metastasis early in its clinical course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldblum and Weiss, 2014</xref>). Two mutually exclusive gene fusions define this sarcoma which lacks an effective medical therapy. The <italic>WWTR1-CAMTA1</italic> gene fusion is encoded by a t(1;3)(p36;q25) chromosomal translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errani et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tanas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tanas et al., 2016</xref>) resulting in a TAZ-CAMTA1 fusion protein present in 85–90% of all EHE tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tanas et al., 2011</xref>). The other ~10–15% of EHE contain a t(X;11) (p11;q22) chromosomal translocation encoding a <italic>YAP1-TFE3</italic> gene fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonescu et al., 2013</xref>). Homologous to TAZ-CAMTA1, YAP-TFE3 fuses the N-terminus of YAP in frame to the C-terminus of TFE3 (transcription factor E3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonescu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The Hippo pathway is a serine/threonine kinase cascade involved in regulating tissue growth and organ size and is composed of the STE20-like protein kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2; homologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hpo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harvey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Udan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pantalacci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>) and the large tumor suppressor 1 and 2 (LATS1/2; homologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Justice et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tapon et al., 2002</xref>). In mammalian cells, the nuclear effectors of the Hippo pathway are TAZ (gene is <italic>WWTR1</italic>) and YAP, two paralogous transcriptional coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camargo et al., 2007</xref>). Hippo signaling limits TAZ and YAP activity by phosphorylating various serine residues, promoting their accumulation in the cytoplasm and ubiquitin-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). In the nucleus, TAZ and YAP bind to the TEA domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors to drive their transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). TAZ and YAP have emerged as central oncoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>) in many different cancers including breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>), colorectal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zender et al., 2006</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xie et al., 2012</xref>), pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), thyroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Cristofaro et al., 2011</xref>), and sarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fullenkamp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merritt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isfort et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisinger-Mathason et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crose et al., 2014</xref>). Despite this observation, point mutations within the Hippo signaling pathway are relatively rare in most cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>). This is especially true of TAZ and YAP, which instead appear to be more commonly mutated by virtue of gene fusions, including <italic>WWTR1</italic>(TAZ)-<italic>CAMTA1</italic> and <italic>YAP1-TFE3</italic>.</p><p>TAZ-CAMTA1 transforms cells by driving a predominantly TAZ-related transcriptional program that is mediated by binding to TEAD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tanas et al., 2016</xref>). Although homologous regions of YAP and TAZ are found in the YAP-TFE3 and TAZ-CAMTA1 fusion proteins, detailed functional studies of YAP-TFE3 have not been performed. Furthermore, the mechanism by which these hybrid transcription factors regulate transcription and subsequent cell transformation has not been defined. Herein we identify the <underline>A</underline>da<underline>2a-c</underline>ontaining histone acetyltransferase (ATAC) complex as a key epigenetic modifier of the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 oncogenic transcriptional programs. The ATAC complex is one of two metazoan complexes that incorporates the GCN5 or closely related PCAF histone acetyltransferase subunit, and primarily acetylates lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9) and to a lesser degree lysine 14 (H3K14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>There is emerging evidence that the ATAC complex is an oncogenic driver in cancer. YEATS2, one of the subunits of the ATAC complex, has been shown to be functionally important to the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mi et al., 2017</xref>). Amplification of <italic>YEATS2</italic> has been identified in ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, and uterine cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mi et al., 2017</xref>), as well as both well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beird et al., 2018</xref>). Herein, we show that the ATAC complex is a key epigenetic mediator of the oncogenic properties of both the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 fusion proteins and thereby a potential therapeutic target for essentially all cases of EHE.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 are chimeric transcription factors</title><p>The <italic>WWTR1</italic> (TAZ)-<italic>CAMTA1</italic> gene fusion fuses the end of exon 2 or exon 3 of <italic>WWTR1</italic> to a breakpoint with exon 9 of <italic>CAMTA1</italic>(<italic>2, 3</italic>).

Furthermore, the abundance of both YAP and TAZ is limited by ubiquitin-mediated degradation which is controlled by the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).

Like YAP, we found YAP-TFE3 to be localized within the nucleus when cells were plated under sparse conditions.

Although this is seemingly discrepant with in vitro data showing that YAP-TFE3 drives proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), the in vitro proliferation being measured was in the context of anchorage independent growth, which may play a more important role in tumor initiation. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 2 cm in the greatest dimension (according to animal use protocol).

Overall, the chromatin binding profile of TAZ-CAMTA1 more closely resembled TAZ4SA (HGD of 52.9) than CAMTA1 (HGD of 43.8). Likewise, YAP-TFE3 bound chromatin was more like that of YAP5SA (HGD of 166.8) than TFE3 (HGD of 11.8). Unbiased motif enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) showed that approximately the same proportion of TAZ4SA and TAZ-CAMTA1 peaks contained the TEAD binding sequence (58% vs. 61%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF) is a member of the TFE/MiTF transcription factor family known to complex with TFE3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steingrimsson et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, the MiTF binding motif was enriched in YAP-TFE3 (58%) compared to YAP5SA (16%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that, like TAZ-CAMTA1, TFE3 confers DNA binding properties to the YAP-TFE3 protein in addition to events mediated by YAP’s interaction with TEAD transcription factors.

We initially hypothesized that the accessible chromatin landscape for the fusion proteins would overwhelmingly resemble that of full length TAZ and YAP. However, hypergeometric analysis showed that the accessible chromatin profile of TAZ-CAMTA1 most closely resembled that of CAMTA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), while the -log<sub>10</sub>(hypergeometric density) HGD between YAP-TFE3 and YAP5SA (106.0) was roughly equivalent to that between YAP-TFE3 and TFE3 (98.0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>) also showed that both TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 promoted chromatin accessibility for unique genes not found in the control data sets, making them available for either transcriptional activation or repression.

'Diffbind' differential binding affinity analysis of consensus-derived peak sets was carried out with respect to empty vector controls. Dimensionality reduction with PCA showed that TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 samples clustered together with CAMTA1 and TFE3, suggesting a greater degree of similarity in ATAC peak affinity patterns, while TAZ4SA or YAP5SA were distinct and separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results are largely consistent with the hypergeometric analysis mentioned above. The homology of the resultant chromatin landscape for the two fusion proteins, despite the structural dissimilarity of the C termini of CAMTA1 and TFE3, independently supports a convergent function for the two fusion proteins. Integrating annotation results from all three NGS modalities (RNA-, ChIP-, and ATAC-seq) showed that the majority of genes bound by the fusion proteins, as well as those which were differentially expressed, were within euchromatin regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>).

TAZ-CAMTA1, YAP-TFE3, and full-length controls were fused on their N terminus to BirA*, an abortive biotin ligase, in a tetracycline-inducible vector, and stably transfected in Flp-In T-Rex HEK 293 cells. Proteins in proximity to the BirA*-tagged bait proteins were biotinylated, purified, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry and SAINT statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Prey proteins detected with at least 10 spectral counts in at least one biological replicate were represented in dot plot format as a composite of the relative abundance and spectral count, where the size of the dots represents the relative abundance and darkness represents the spectral count (the false discovery rate is represented as the color coding at the periphery of the dot). Sixty-eight prey proteins were identified that established high-confidence proximity interactions with the fusion proteins or the full-length controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). The YAP-TFE3 proximity interactome was composed predominantly of histone modifying enzymes (35%), transcriptional regulators (26%), proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (18%), and transcription factor/co-activators (15%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, the TAZ-CAMTA1 proximity interactome was composed predominantly of histone modifying enzymes (27%), transcriptional regulators (18%), transcription factor/co-activators (15%), and chromatin remodeling (13%). A smaller percentage of the TAZ-CAMTA1 interactome was involved in mediating cell-cell junctions (5%) and SUMO processing (4%). To identify proteins to prioritize for further study, we subtracted proteins that showed a decreased proximity interaction with the fusion proteins relative to full-length TAZ and YAP; many of which (e.g. MPDZ, PATJ) are part of the Crumbs complex, and the decreased interaction can be explained in part by loss/mitigation of the WW domain. This left 55 and 34 prey proteins in the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 interactomes, respectively. Known components of the Hippo pathway were subtracted from further analysis, leaving 49 proteins in the TAZ-CAMTA1 data set, and 31 proteins in the YAP-TFE3 data set. We then retained only prey proteins that demonstrated an increased interaction with the fusion proteins relative to full length TAZ and YAP, leaving 47 proteins in the TAZ-CAMTA1 data set and 28 remaining proteins in the YAP-TFE3 data set. The two data sets were intersected to demonstrate 27 shared proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>).

Proteins with weak interactions with both fusion proteins (generally these were in the lowest category of spectral count/relative abundance and FDR &gt; 5%) were eliminated, leaving 18 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Mechanistically, using a paired proteomic and genomic screen, we identify the ATAC complex as a key epigenetic mediator enabling both TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 to modulate the chromatin environment and transcription, thus transforming cells.

Further, the degree to which the fusion protein transcriptomes do overlap with the TAZ/YAP transcriptional programs is due to shared TEAD transcription factor binding. This is borne out via evaluation of the chromatin binding profiles of the two fusion proteins which showed similar levels of enrichment for TEAD-binding sites compared to full-length TAZ and YAP. Our findings are in keeping with previous functional studies of TAZ-CAMTA1 showing that it requires binding to TEAD4 in order to drive its oncogenic transcriptional program and transform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tanas et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The fusion protein transcriptomes differ from the full-length TAZ/YAP transcriptomes due to altered DNA binding</title><p>Although the transcriptional programs of TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 significantly overlap with the TAZ/YAP transcriptomes, they also differ in important ways. In both cell lines examined here, approximately 20–40% of differentially expressed genes were unique to the TAZ-CAMTA1- and YAP-TFE3-induced transcriptomes, indicating that the fusion proteins do not only regulate transcription via TEADs. Accordingly, unbiased motif enrichment analysis of TAZ-CAMTA1 revealed an enrichment for the EGR2 binding motif while YAP-TFE3 showed an enrichment for the MITF-binding motif. This indicates that the genomic occupancy of TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 is mediated by the C termini of CAMTA1 and TFE3 in addition to interactions with the TEAD transcription factors. Bioinformatic approaches predicting the chromatin binding of transcription factors that contain multiple DNA binding sites have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vandel et al., 2019</xref>), which in combination with structure-function studies should yield additional insight into how these chimeric transcription factors interface with the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The fusion protein transcriptomes differ from the TAZ/YAP transcriptomes due to shifts in the chromatin landscape</title><p>We found that TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 increased the amount of transcriptionally active chromatin when compared to TAZ and YAP overexpression. Although genes embedded in transcriptionally accessible portions of the genome showed a degree of overlap between the fusion proteins and either TAZ or YAP, hypergeometric analysis showed that the euchromatin landscape induced by TAZ-CAMTA1 more closely resembled that of CAMTA1, while that of YAP-TFE3 showed an almost equivalent level of similarity to TFE3 as it did to YAP. This observation is reflected in the PCA analysis, which showed that the distribution of transposase accessible chromatin for the fusion proteins was more closely related to each other, CAMTA1, and TFE3 than to TAZ/YAP. This indicates that CAMTA1 and TFE3 confer chromatin remodeling properties to the fusion proteins, while the N termini of TAZ and YAP essentially contribute the TEAD binding domain. This is consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated that TAZ/YAP’s interactions with epigenetic modifiers are key to their function. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Yorkie (YAP orthologue) can interact with Ncoa6, a subunit of the Trithorax-related histone H3 lysine four methyltransferase complex to drive tissue growth. Importantly, conjugation of Ncoa6 to Scalloped (TEAD orthologue) alone was sufficient to functionally activate the Yorkie transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qing et al., 2014</xref>). In mammalian/cancer cells, YAP/TAZ-driven transcription is facilitated by binding to BRD4, a member of the <underline>b</underline>romodomain and <underline>e</underline>xtra<underline>t</underline>erminal (BET) protein family of epigenetic modifiers that mediates interaction between enhancer sequences and associated promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zanconato et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, the above studies indicate that additional fine tuning of the TEAD-based transcriptional program is essential to TAZ/YAP function in both physiological and cancer-related contexts.</p><p>Although the overlap in euchromatin profile between the fusion proteins and CAMTA1/TFE3 can be partially explained by DNA-binding elements conferred by the C termini of CAMTA1 and TFE3, it also raises questions about how the TAZ-CAMTA1:ATAC and YAP-TFE3:ATAC complexes form. It remains to be determined how the fusion proteins dynamically recruit epigenetic modifiers to contact points in the genome where TEAD and non-TEAD binding sites (e.g. MITF or EGR2) are in close proximity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The enhanced euchromatin landscape in cells expressing TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 is mediated by the ATAC complex</title><p>Although we found that TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 interact with numerous epigenetic complexes, the combined proteomic/RNAi screen demonstrated that the ATAC complex is the most functionally relevant for cell transformation. <underline>A</underline>da<underline>2a-c</underline>ontaining acetyltransferase (ATAC) and <underline>S</underline>pt-<underline>A</underline>da-<underline>G</underline>cn5-<underline>a</underline>cetyltransferase (SAGA) are two closely related metazoan histone acetyltransferase complexes that both contain GCN5 or the closely related PCAF histone acetyltransferase catalytic subunits. While the SAGA complex is predominantly localized to promoter sequences, the ATAC complex is found at both promoter and enhancer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krebs et al., 2011</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3, which are predominantly localized at enhancer sequences, interact primarily with the ATAC complex rather than the SAGA complex. Although the ATAC complex can regulate both housekeeping and tissue specific functions, its binding to enhancer sequences is cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krebs et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, knock-down of subunits of the ATAC complex in cells expressing TAZ-CAMTA1 or YAP-TFE3 affected only a limited set of active genes rather than globally altering gene expression, another key piece of data demonstrating that the ATAC complex modulates a specific transcriptional program. The implication of these data is that the ATAC complex is recruited to a particular set of target genes and interacts with a specific set of transcription factors rather than ubiquitously interacting with many different transcription factors across the genome. This is corroborated by our BioID mass spectrometry data which showed that the ATAC complex preferentially binds to both fusion proteins as compared to full-length TAZ and YAP.</p><p>Importantly, our study also indicates that the ATAC complex represents a potential therapeutic target for EHE, a sarcoma currently lacking an effective medical therapy, regardless of which fusion protein it harbors. In addition, RNA expression profiling data show that expression of <italic>YEATS2</italic> and <italic>ZZZ3</italic> have prognostic significance in sarcoma clinical samples across various histological types, suggesting that the ATAC complex might represent a key oncogenic driver in other sarcomas. Future studies elucidating therapeutic strategies targeting the ATAC complex are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 have convergent oncogenic properties</title><p>Despite the observation that CAMTA1 and TFE3 are from entirely different protein families, several lines of evidence reveal that the function of TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 are remarkably similar. As mentioned above, the two fusion proteins are similar in terms of the genes they induce, their chromatin-binding profiles, and how they alter the chromatin landscape. This raises the question of whether other TAZ/YAP gene fusions show similar convergence of function. Instead of point mutations, gene fusions are the most common genetic alterations of TAZ(<italic>WWTR1</italic>) and YAP in cancer.

Here, we have outlined an approach integrating NGS modalities with combined proteomic/genetic screens to gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 fusion proteins. At its most essential, the mechanism of the two fusion proteins is the same in that a TEAD-based transcriptional program is modulated by interaction with an epigenetic modifier, the ATAC complex. Additional studies are needed to determine if YAP/TAZ/TEAD fusion proteins in other cancers also drive tumorigenesis via the ATAC complex or do so by recruiting different chromatin-modifying complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NIH 3T3 cells</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-1658; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0594">CVCL_0594</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><italic>Mycoplasma</italic> negative</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SW872 cells</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">HTB92; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1730">CVCL_1730</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><italic>Mycoplasma</italic> negative</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pPGS-3HA-TEAD1</td><td valign="top">Dr. Kunliang Guan (Addgene)</td><td valign="top">#33055; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_33055">Addgene_33055</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">8xGTIIC-luciferase</td><td valign="top">Dr. Stefano Piccolo <break/>(Addgene)</td><td valign="top">#34615; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_34615">Addgene_34615</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pRP-CMV-3xMyc-KAT14</td><td valign="top">Vector builder</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">#9003</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-DYKDDDDK antibody</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">#14793; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2572291">AB_2572291</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ChIP grade antibody</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>Double Flag TAZ-CAMTA1 and Double Flag CAMTA1 were cloned into pBabeNeo as previously described.

Finally, PCA analysis was performed to show how samples cluster at differentially accessible chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>BioID mass spectrometry and SAINT analysis</title><p>Full-length YAP, TFE3, TAZ, and CAMTA1, along with YAP-TFE3 and TAZ-CAMTA1 were cloned into pcDNA5 FRT/TO FLAG‐BirAR118G vectors, containing an N-terminal <italic>E. coli</italic> biotin ligase with an R118G mutation, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roux et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>. These bait proteins of interest were then stably expressed in Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couzens et al., 2013</xref>). Expression was then induced using 1 µg/mL tetracycline for 24 hr. The cells were also treated with 50 µM biotin at the time of induction. After 24 hr, cells harvested and processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>). Two biological replicates were made for each cell line. Affinity purification and proximity biotinylation coupled to mass spectrometry were performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>. SAINT (significance analysis of interactome) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2011</xref>) was performed on the mass spectrometry data, using 10 controls compressed to 5. Only proteins with iProphet protein probability ≥ 0.95 were used. Recovery of bait peptides was monitored to ensure that expression levels of the bait proteins were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Results are expressed in dotplot format. Columns show bait proteins, while the rows list the names of the identified prey proteins. Each prey protein is represented as a dot, with color signifying average spectral count, the darkness indicating average spectral count between the two biological replicates (the darker the dot, the higher the average spectral count), and the size represents the relative abundance. The ring around the dot indicates the false discovery rate (the darker the ring, the higher the confidence). The data was filtered so that each prey had a minimum of 10 spectral counts in at least one of the biological replicates. Results were also filtered to exclude components of trypsin, biotin, and streptavidin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Clinical samples</title><p>Six epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, six epithelioid hemangiomas, and five epithelioid angiosarcomas were obtained from the files of the Department of Pathology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Internal Review Board approval was obtained (IRB# 201609806).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Statistics</title><p>For soft agar assays, statistical significance was evaluated using an unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. For poly-HEMA proliferation assays, statistical significance was evaluated using fold change increase in proliferation at day 10 with an unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. For quantitative RT-PCR, standard deviation was calculated from fold change values for each triplicate. For Kaplan-Meier curves significance was determined by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Graphs were made using the average of the technical replicates. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. For NGS studies, biological triplicates were generated by separately transducing NIH 3T3 and SW872 cells with the various contructs followed by stable selection. Hypergeometric testing was performed using the phyper() function in the stats R package (v3.6.3) set to assess enrichment and the lower tail set to false. Hypergeometric density was calculated using the related dhyper function and converted using the negative log10 of the output. For gene expression data, the population was set to the total number of recovered genes with the mean of five counts across all samples. Both the ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, the population was set as the total number of genes annotated across all conditions. Error bars were used to define one standard deviation. For all panels, ****p&lt;0.0001, ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.01, *p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nicholas Scalora for critical reading of the manuscript and Mariah Leidinger for performing immunohistochemistry studies.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Merritt and Garcia et al. characterizes the molecular functions of two fusion proteins, YAP-TFE3 and TAZ-CAMTA1, that contribute to the vascular sarcoma Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE). The authors show that ectopic expression of the fusion proteins in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and SW872 liposarcoma cells promote pro-tumorigenic properties, such as increased proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and increased growth in subcutaneous xenograft experiments in mice. Novel aspects of the study include the analysis of YAP-TFE3, which has not yet been examined on a molecular level, mapping the genomic landscape of TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3, and identifying new associated chromatin modulators that distinctly contribute to pro-tumorigenic functions of the fusion proteins. The study is generally well conducted and identifies potential new mechanisms by which the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 fusion proteins contribute to the development of EHE.</p><p>Overall, the Reviewers agreed to recommend submission of a revised manuscript addressing the following points:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Given the comparisons between the various fusion and non-fusion proteins throughout many experiments, it is important to show similar expression levels of the respective proteins across the cell lines that were generated. Figure S1A and S1B show expression, but based on what is shown it is not possible to assess the similarities in expression between the cell lines. If the authors want to make arguments that post-transcriptional mechanisms may account for differences, they should show data to support this.</p><p>2. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions from the nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation of YAP and YAP-TFE3 in FiguresS2C and S2D since these data were not compared side-by-side. Further, the effects of confluence on the nuclear abundance of YAP vs YAP-TFE3 in Figure S2C is not very convincing. Please address.</p><p>3. The potential enrichment of EGR2 for TAZ-CAMTA1 that is suggested by the ChIP-seq analysis is interesting and should be biochemically tested. Further, the authors indicate that the YAP-TFE3 ChIP-seq analyses indicates enrichment for the MiTF motif, which suggests that the TFE3 domain mediates DNA binding. Prior studies have shown that the bHLH and LZ domains in TFE3 mediate homo and hetero association with MiTF family proteins to mediate DNA-binding. The authors should test whether YAP-TFE3 associates with TFE3 or other MiTF family members and/or test whether these domains are required for YAP-TFE3 oncogenic function.</p><p>4. The authors should better describe what is uniquely enriched in the YAP-TFE3 and TAZ-CAMTA1 gene expression programs and define whether these unique changes rely on ATAC complex component association. For example, are these genes altered in expression following YEATS2 or ZZZ3 knockdown?</p><p>5. The identification of YEATS2 and ZZZ3 as potential fusion protein associated chromatin remodeling factors is very interesting given the known functions of the ATAC complex. The authors should directly test whether YAP-TFE3 and/or TAZ-CAMTA1 modify ATAC complex activity (e.g. H3K9 acetylation on a subset of direct targets that they identified), comparing any findings to TAZ-4SA or YAP-5SA.</p><p>6. While it is interesting that YEATS2 and ZZZ3 expression is associated with poor prognosis across sarcomas, this does not necessarily link to YAP/TAZ or fusion protein activity in EHE. The study would greatly benefit from directly linking some of the discoveries made in the manuscript to the in vivo biology of EHE. For example, are any of the identified fusion protein gene targets (ideally direct targets that are uniquely expressed by the fusion proteins) elevated in EHE tissue biopsies?</p><p>7. Figure 1C-D, 1H. The YT and TC fusions regulate cell proliferation in vitro. However, this is inconsistent with in vivo data in which the fusions only seem to impact the rate of tumor initiation while the rate of tumor growth was similar between EV and the YT or TC fusions. Figure S3 also shows that Ki67 staining is the same between all three groups (actually lower in YT). Please address.</p><p>8. Figure 1J. The EV control in the SW872 model seems to not be tumorigenic. Others have used this cell line for xenograft studies (Stratford et al. Sarcoma. 2012; Zhang et al. Cancer Res. 2013; Li et al. Transl Oncol. 2014). Could there have been problems with the EV that impacted cell viability? Would EV tumors have eventually emerged if the experiment was carried out longer? Please address.</p><p>9. Figure 2. The authors reference their previous work showing the oncogenic properties of the TC fusion is dependent on TEAD4 but the data reported here focuses on TEAD1. Is this due to tissue specificity or a general dependency on both TEAD1/4? Last, what is the dominant band in the YAP-TFE3 S94A immunoblot in Figure 2D?</p><p>10. Figure 3-5. Ideally ChIP-seq would be performed on endogenous proteins as overexpression can induce non-specific and altered DNA binding profiles (Kidder et al. Nat Immunol. 2011.) However, the lack of EHE cell lines precludes using endogenous proteins. In this case, it would be helpful to combine the overexpression vectors with knockdown of TEADs or ATAC members to show that the described DNA binding and chromatin accessibility are specific.</p><p>11. The authors commented that the genomic occupancy of TC and YT fusions is predominantly at enhancers. What histone markers were used to identify enhancer regions?</p><p>12. Figure 6C. The profile of chromatin modifiers for wildtype YAP and TAZ is minimal compared to the fusions. How was the relative expression of proteins normalized for BioID? Could the differences in interactors be explained by massive overexpression of the fusions in comparison to WT?</p><p>13. Figure 7-8. Does knockdown of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 alter expression of canonical TEAD-dependent YAP/TAZ target genes such as CTGF or CYR61? Based on the ATAC-Seq data, is there a subset of genes that one could probe to determine if loss of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 impacts their expression? The co-IPs should be performed using wildtype YAP and TAZ as negative controls to confirm that interactions with the ATAC complex occur via contributions from CAMTA1 and TFE3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62857.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

As noted previously, we do see variability in expression of the various proteins, but that the phenotypes we have observed run counter to differences in expression (e.g. YAP-TFE3 drives greater anchorage independent growth than YAP-TFE3 S94A despite YAP-TFE3 S94A demonstrating higher expression). We have in the past attempted modulating multiplicity of infection when transducing cell lines with the various constructs, and have been unable to standardize expression levels, suggesting that the differences in protein stability may be accounting for those differences in expression.</p><p>We have also made sure to test various hypothesis from multiple angles/approaches supporting the conclusions that have been made (e.g. the importance of TEAD binding to YAP-TFE3 was demonstrated by (a) TEAD knock-down experiments and anchorage independent growth experiments, (b) qRT-PCR experiments with the YAP-TFE3 S94A mutant, (c) ChIP-qPCR with the YAP-TFE3 S94A mutant, and (d) luciferase reporter assay with the YAP-TFE3 S94A mutant.)</p><p>2. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions from the nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation of YAP and YAP-TFE3 in FiguresS2C and S2D since these data were not compared side-by-side. Further, the effects of confluence on the nuclear abundance of YAP vs YAP-TFE3 in Figure S2C is not very convincing. Please address.</p><p>We agree this could have been more clearly demonstrated. Nuclear fractions for YAP and YAP-TFE3 were run on the same gel and cytoplasmic fractions for YAP and YAP-TFE3 were run together on a separate gel. They are separated in Figures S2C and S2D to facilitate comparison of nuclear levels of YAP during sparse vs. confluent plating, and nuclear levels of YAP-TFE3 during sparse vs. confluent plating (YAP-TFE3 requires a longer exposure than YAP since YAP-TFE3 is expressed at lower levels). This was performed to illustrate how YAP-TFE3 remains within the nucleus under confluent conditions (because it is not being negatively regulated by the Hippo pathway) while YAP expression in the nucleus decreases (because it is regulated normally by the Hippo pathway). We agree that the previous blot was overexposed, and so we have reprobed the membrane and are including a more appropriately exposed blot in Figures S2C and S2D.</p><p>3. The potential enrichment of EGR2 for TAZ-CAMTA1 that is suggested by the ChIP-seq analysis is interesting and should be biochemically tested. Further, the authors indicate that the YAP-TFE3 ChIP-seq analyses indicates enrichment for the MiTF motif, which suggests that the TFE3 domain mediates DNA binding. Prior studies have shown that the bHLH and LZ domains in TFE3 mediate homo and hetero association with MiTF family proteins to mediate DNA-binding. The authors should test whether YAP-TFE3 associates with TFE3 or other MiTF family members and/or test whether these domains are required for YAP-TFE3 oncogenic function.</p><p>Thank you for these comments. To address the point raised regarding the interaction of MiTF family members, we noted that by our BioID mass spectrometry results (Figure S9) that TFE3 was the chief MiTF family candidate that could potentially interact with YAP-TFE3 directly. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated TFE3 and probed for YAP-TFE3 and showed that YAP-TFE3 does interact with TFE3 (see Figure S6A and discussed in lines 281-285). To determine whether the bHLH/leucine zipper domain is required for YAP-TFE3’s oncogenic function, we evaluated the function of the YAP-TFE3 R358K-I354N (disrupts helix 1 of the bHLH domain) and showed that it altered anchorage independent growth (Figure S6A and discussed in lines 281-285). Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the functional role of the bHLH domain further, and anticipate doing so in a subsequent manuscript.</p><p>To address the potential enrichment of EGR2 for TAZ-CAMTA1 suggested by the ChIP-seq analysis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies for TAZ-CAMTA1 and EGR2. By co-immunoprecipitation, we did not observe an interaction between TAZ-CAMTA1 and EGR2, suggesting that TAZ-CAMTA1 and EGR2 do not directly interact with one another. It is possible another protein may bridge the interaction between TAZ-CAMTA1 and EGR2, which is something we can follow up on in future studies.</p><p>4. The authors should better describe what is uniquely enriched in the YAP-TFE3 and TAZ-CAMTA1 gene expression programs and define whether these unique changes rely on ATAC complex component association. For example, are these genes altered in expression following YEATS2 or ZZZ3 knockdown?</p><p>We agree this is an important point. To address this, we performed RNA-Seq on SW872 TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 expressing cells with either ZZZ3 or YEATS2 knock-down and compared the resultant transcriptomes to non-targeting controls. We found by principal component analysis (Figure 8A) that both knock-down of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 altered the transcriptome of both TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3. Comparison of genes within the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 transcriptomes with the largest decrease in expression after knock-down of YEATS2 and ZZZ3 showed that many of them were extracellular matrix proteins (Figure 8B) and were validated by qRT-PCR (Figure 8C); discussed in lines 416-419. Additional pathway analysis on the above RNA-Seq experiment showed that pathways (e.g. MAPK and PI3K pathways) activated by YAP-TFE3 (Figure 3I) are inactivated with YEATS2 and ZZZ3 knock-down (Figure 8D and Figure S12A-D); discussed in lines 419-424.</p><p>5. The identification of YEATS2 and ZZZ3 as potential fusion protein associated chromatin remodeling factors is very interesting given the known functions of the ATAC complex. The authors should directly test whether YAP-TFE3 and/or TAZ-CAMTA1 modify ATAC complex activity (e.g. H3K9 acetylation on a subset of direct targets that they identified), comparing any findings to TAZ-4SA or YAP-5SA.</p><p>We agree that the proposed studies are important, but would be most informative if performed at a genome-wide level (e.g. H3K9ac ChIP-seq) and in conjunction with other mechanistic studies dissecting the function of the ATAC complex, which we anticipate doing in our follow-up studies to this manuscript. After additional editorial correspondence, we have instead elected to focus on dissecting the function of the ATAC complex in a related experiment for the current manuscript, the RNA-Seq experiment delineated above in response to point 4, since it would more directly address the main thesis of the manuscript which is focused on the transcriptomic changes the ATAC complex promotes.</p><p>6. While it is interesting that YEATS2 and ZZZ3 expression is associated with poor prognosis across sarcomas, this does not necessarily link to YAP/TAZ or fusion protein activity in EHE. The study would greatly benefit from directly linking some of the discoveries made in the manuscript to the in vivo biology of EHE. For example, are any of the identified fusion protein gene targets (ideally direct targets that are uniquely expressed by the fusion proteins) elevated in EHE tissue biopsies?</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To address this, we have performed immunohistochemistry for various extracellular matrix proteins, enriched in pathway analysis performed on the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 transcriptional programs. We performed immunohistochemistry for COL1A1 (Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain), CTGF (Connective Tissue Growth Factor), FBLN5 (Fibulin-5), and VTN (vitronectin) on 6 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) FFPE samples as well as two histological mimics: epithelioid angiosarcoma (E-AS) and epithelioid hemangioma (EH). We showed that COL1A1, CTGF, FBLN5, and VTN were widely expressed in all of the EHE samples evaluated (Figures8H and Figure S12E-F). In addition, VTN appears to be specifically upregulated in EHE in a statistically significant manner as compared to E-AS and EH controls (Figure 8H).</p><p>7. Figure 1C-D, 1H. The YT and TC fusions regulate cell proliferation in vitro. However, this is inconsistent with in vivo data in which the fusions only seem to impact the rate of tumor initiation while the rate of tumor growth was similar between EV and the YT or TC fusions. Figure S3 also shows that Ki67 staining is the same between all three groups (actually lower in YT). Please address.</p><p>We agree with the above points that have been raised. TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 promote proliferation in the very specific context of anchorage independent growth which captures only some aspects of tumor growth in vivo. In vitro experiments in cancer cell lines can give mechanistic insight, but cannot recapitulate every aspect of in vivo biology (Liu K, et al. Nat Commun 2019; 10 (2138); Gould S, et al. Nat Med 2015; 21:431-439). This is addressed in the revised manuscript in lines 147-149.</p><p>8. Figure 1J. The EV control in the SW872 model seems to not be tumorigenic. Others have used this cell line for xenograft studies (Stratford et al. Sarcoma. 2012; Zhang et al. Cancer Res. 2013; Li et al. Transl Oncol. 2014). Could there have been problems with the EV that impacted cell viability? Would EV tumors have eventually emerged if the experiment was carried out longer? Please address.</p></disp-quote><p>The above is entirely correct. We have carried the experiment out longer, and empty vector tumors will eventually emerge. To address this, a discussion of the above has been included in the revised manuscript in lines 155-157, which reads: <italic>“</italic>In the mildly tumorigenic SW872 cell line (above references added), expression of YAP-TFE3 and TAZ-CAMTA1 decreased latency to tumor formation compared to empty vector in vivo (<bold>Figure 1J</bold>), similar to NIH 3T3 cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 2. The authors reference their previous work showing the oncogenic properties of the TC fusion is dependent on TEAD4 but the data reported here focuses on TEAD1. Is this due to tissue specificity or a general dependency on both TEAD1/4? Last, what is the dominant band in the YAP-TFE3 S94A immunoblot in Figure 2D?</p><p>The mass spectrometry dot plot (Figure S9) showed that TAZ-CAMTA1 interacted with TEAD4, but that YAP-TFE3 interacted with predominantly TEAD1 and TEAD3 but not TEAD4; hence leading us to evaluate and confirm the interaction of YAP-TFE3 with TEAD1 by co-IP in Figure 2. The BioID mass spectrometry experiment for YAP-TFE3 and TAZ-CAMTA1 was performed in the same cell line (HEK293 cells) which argues against the interaction with different TEAD transcription factors being due to tissue specificity, and suggests this is due to intrinsically different protein binding properties of the fusion proteins themselves. We anticipate that the dominant band in the YAP-TFE3 S94A blot is an unstable degradation product. The above has been addressed in the revised manuscript in lines 180-182.</p><p>10. Figure 3-5. Ideally ChIP-seq would be performed on endogenous proteins as overexpression can induce non-specific and altered DNA binding profiles (Kidder et al. Nat Immunol. 2011.) However, the lack of EHE cell lines precludes using endogenous proteins. In this case, it would be helpful to combine the overexpression vectors with knockdown of TEADs or ATAC members to show that the described DNA binding and chromatin accessibility are specific.</p><p>We have previously addressed the specificity of binding the TEAD consensus binding sequence at least one way with the luciferase reporter assay in Figure 2I. To further address the specificity of TEAD mediated DNA binding, we have performed ChIP-qPCR for CTGF (a well-established TEAD-bound gene) in SW872 cells overexpressing YAP-TFE3 or YAP-TFE3 S94A (mutant that abrogates TEAD binding) shown in Figure 2H. ChIP-qPCR for the CTGF promoter (contains the TEAD binding consensus sequence) showed a 6-fold decrease in CTGF promoter binding by YAP-TFE3 S94A overexpressing cells as compared to YAP-TFE3 control, discussed in lines 185-187. The above study furthers shows that the TEAD binding profile described for YAP-TFE3 is not an artifact of overexpression but rather a property of the fusion protein itself.</p><p>Evaluating chromatin accessibility by ATAC-Seq as a function of ZZZ3 or YEATS2 knock-down is important to do and will be part of future studies. For this current manuscript, we have chosen to address the specificity of chromatin accessibility in a way that is in keeping with the main message of the manuscript which is focused on how the ATAC complex modulates the TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 transcriptomes. To do this we have performed the RNA-Seq experiment mentioned in point 4 and identified the resultant transcriptomes after YEATS2 and ZZZ3 knock-down. We have then intersected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after YEATS2 and ZZZ3 knock-down in YAP-TFE3 expressing cells and intersected them with transposase accessible areas of the genome identified by ATAC-Seq (Figure 8E and 8F). We showed that 71% of DEGs after YEATS2 knock-down were present within transposase accessible areas of the genome (Figure 8E), while 74% of DEGs after ZZZ3 knock-down were present within transposase accessible portions of the genome (Figure 8F), linking the described chromatin accessibility due to expression of YAP-TFE3 to ATAC-dependent components of the YAP-TFE3 transcriptome. This is discussed in lines 424-428 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>11. The authors commented that the genomic occupancy of TC and YT fusions is predominantly at enhancers. What histone markers were used to identify enhancer regions?</p><p>Distal intergenic sequences, which are known to contain sequences functioning as enhancers were defined as sequences greater than 3kb (Zhang Y, et al. Nature 2013; 504(7479): 306-310) from the assigned gene closest to them. To further define the location of enhancer regions, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27ac (Calo E, et al. Mol Cell 2013; 49(5): 825-837; Creyghton MP, et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2010; 107: 21931-21936) in SW872 cells expressing the fusion proteins and controls, and overlapped with the chromatin binding profile of TAZ-CAMTA1, YAP-TFE3, and controls. By overlapping H3K27ac ChIP peaks with ChIP peaks for the various constructs, we confirmed that distal intergenic sequences were predominantly composed of active enhancer sequences (69% overlap with TAZ-CAMTA1 distal intergenic sequences and 68% overlap in YAP-TFE3 distal intergenic sequences) (Figure 4D and E). This discussion including the above references have been included in lines 248-261 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>12. Figure 6C. The profile of chromatin modifiers for wildtype YAP and TAZ is minimal compared to the fusions. How was the relative expression of proteins normalized for BioID? Could the differences in interactors be explained by massive overexpression of the fusions in comparison to WT?</p><p>We agree this is an important point. While we do not systematically normalize the BioID data to account for differential protein expression (which could introduce unwanted bias), we do monitor the recovery of the bait peptides to ensure that we do not have massive differences in expression levels. Here, for YAP and YAP-TFE3, analysis of spectra for shared peptides showed no clear difference in relative abundance, while there was a ~2-fold increase in peptide detection for TAZ-CAMTA1 as compared to TAZ. While it is not impossible that these changes in relative expression increase some of the associations, this is not likely to explain the large changes in the recruitment of chromatin modifiers detected in the study. We have added the protein quantification tables and associated method text in the revised manuscript (Figure S9 D,E and lines 937-938).</p><p>13. Figure 7-8. Does knockdown of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 alter expression of canonical TEAD-dependent YAP/TAZ target genes such as CTGF or CYR61? Based on the ATAC-Seq data, is there a subset of genes that one could probe to determine if loss of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 impacts their expression? The co-IPs should be performed using wildtype YAP and TAZ as negative controls to confirm that interactions with the ATAC complex occur via contributions from CAMTA1 and TFE3.</p><p>As mentioned above, to address whether knock-down of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 affected expression of CTGF or CYR61, we performed RNA-Seq on TAZ-CAMTA1 or YAP-TFE3 expressing cells with either YEATS2 or ZZZ3 knock-down. Of the different combinations, only YAP-TFE3 expressing cells with YEATS2 or ZZZ3 knock-down demonstrated a modest reduction of CTGF (log<sub>2</sub> of -0.64 and -0.91, respectively) (Table S7). As shown in Figures 8B and 8D genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins or resulting in activation of PI3K-Akt signaling were affected by ZZZ3 or YEATS2 knock-down. As shown in Figure 8E 71% of DEGs after YEATS2 knock-down were present within transposase accessible areas of the genome as defined by ATAC-Seq. Similarly, 74% of DEGs after ZZZ3 knock-down were present within transposase accessible portions of the genome. The above discussion has been included in lines 410-428. We have confirmed that TAZ-CAMTA1 co-immunoprecipitates with the KAT14 subunit of the ATAC complex while the TAZ control does not (Figure S 11E and lines 407-409).</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
