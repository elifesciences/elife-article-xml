However, the mechanisms controlling ripple initiation in behaving animals remain poorly understood. Here we combine multisite extracellular and whole-cell recordings in awake mice to contrast the brain state and ripple modulation of subthreshold dynamics across hippocampal subfields. We find that entorhinal input to the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits UP and DOWN dynamics with ripples occurring exclusively in UP states. While elevated cortical input in UP states generates depolarization in DG and CA1, it produces persistent hyperpolarization in CA3 neurons. Furthermore, growing inhibition is evident in CA3 throughout the course of the ripple buildup, while DG and CA1 neurons exhibit depolarization transients 100 ms before and during ripples. These observations highlight the importance of CA3 inhibition for ripple generation, while pre-ripple responses indicate a long and orchestrated ripple initiation process in the awake state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ripples</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>brain states</kwd><kwd>whole-cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DoD</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siapas</surname><given-names>Athanassios G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1MH113016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siapas</surname><given-names>Athanassios G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011671</institution-id><institution>Mathers Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siapas</surname><given-names>Athanassios G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siapas</surname><given-names>Athanassios G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The majority of hippocampal neurons in CA3 experience inhibition before and during ripple buildup, while dentate and CA1 cells display depolarizing transients preceding and following ripple onset pointing to a long and orchestrated awake ripple initiation process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bidirectional interactions between the hippocampus and neocortical areas are believed to play a key role in memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Squire, 1992</xref>). Hippocampal ripples are deemed essential for this process because the associated population activity reflects prior experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kudrimoti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>) and ripple disruption results in memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>). Ripples provide synchronous volleys that drive cortical targets and co-occur with distinct cortical network patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battaglia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mölle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wierzynski et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, ripples normally occur during slow-wave sleep and quiet wakefulness when hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) display large-amplitude irregular activity (LIA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosiewicz and Skaggs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O’Keefe, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanderwolf, 1969</xref>), whereas neocortical dynamics are marked by the presence of UP and DOWN states (UDS), alternating periods of elevated and depressed network activity that can also be observed under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cowan and Wilson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steriade et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steriade et al., 1993c</xref>). Neocortical and hippocampal dynamics can be coordinated via the entorhinal cortex (EC), the main gateway between neocortical areas and the hippocampus, which provides direct input to the dentate gyrus (DG), and areas CA3 and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral and Witter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steward et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1993</xref>). Experiments in sleeping and anesthetized animals show that the EC also exhibits UDS that modulate activity across hippocampal subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>). However, the influence of cortical UDS on hippocampal dynamics and ripple generation in wakefulness are not well understood.</p><p>Ripples are believed to be the product of excitatory buildup in the recurrent CA3 network, culminating in a population burst that drives CA1 spiking organized by the transient ripple oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miles and Wong, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Traub and Miles, 1991</xref>). This suggests that CA3 neurons should get progressively depolarized and come closer to firing threshold through the course of the ripple buildup. Separate from the buildup itself, the processes controlling ripple initiation and termination are not fully understood. In vitro experiments indicate that ripples are initiated once stochastic fluctuations in the population firing rate of CA3 pyramidal cells exceed a threshold level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de la Prida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>), implying that an increase in the firing of CA3 neurons should result in a corresponding increase in the rate of ripple occurrence. Recent in vitro studies have also emphasized the importance of inhibitory neurons in ripple initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazelot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>), while other studies suggested that area CA2 and a special class of CA3 cells play a key role in ripple initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the functional role of ripples as well as the mechanism of their initiation may differ across the awake and sleep states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Middleton and McHugh, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roumis and Frank, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang and Jadhav, 2019</xref>). Whole-cell recordings in awake animals have opened a window to understanding the interplay between collective network activity and membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) dynamics of hippocampal neurons, which can reveal the nature and timing of synaptic inputs and subthreshold changes that are invisible to extracellular recordings. While recent efforts have examined the V<sub>m</sub> of CA1 neurons around ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">English et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>) and the V<sub>m</sub> modulation by brain state across hippocampal subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hulse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malezieux et al., 2020</xref>), the subthreshold dynamics of CA3 pyramidal cells around ripples and the impact of cortical inputs on V<sub>m</sub> behavior in CA3 remain unknown.</p><p>Here we combine multisite extracellular and whole-cell recordings in awake mice to characterize and contrast the membrane potential dynamics of principal neurons in CA3 with that in the DG and CA1. Our results reveal that the membrane potential of CA3 neurons is modulated by brain state and ripples in a way that is largely opposite to the modulation of dentate granule cells and CA1 neurons. This divergent modulation across hippocampal subfields is surprising given that they are interconnected and all receive inputs from the entorhinal cortex, and offers insights into the processes of ripple initiation, build up, and termination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We combined whole-cell recordings of principal neurons across DG (22 cells), CA3 (32 cells), and CA1 (32 cells) with multisite extracellular LFP recordings spanning the radial extent of dorsal CA1 and DG in awake head-fixed mice that were free to run on a spherical treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The location, morphology, and membrane properties of the recorded cells are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>. Below we show that entorhinal inputs to DG exhibit UP and DOWN dynamics during quiet wakefulness, with ripples occurring exclusively in the UP state. Analysis of how these brain states influence membrane potential dynamics reveals that CA3 neurons hyperpolarize in the UP state when ripples occur, in contrast to neurons in DG and CA1. We then focus on characterizing how brain state is reflected in slow V<sub>m</sub> trends around ripples. Finally, we analyze ripple triggered modulation of fast V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations which reveals a prevalence of inhibition in CA3 which grows through the ripple buildup. In contrast, DG and CA1 neurons exhibit transient depolarization not only after ripple onset but also 100 ms earlier.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simultaneous multisite extracellular and whole-cell recordings across hippocampal subfields.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of setup for simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings from awake head-fixed mice free to run on a spherical treadmill.

Since this classification is typically based on a single hippocampal LFP, it does not consider the origin of the observed field fluctuations, but only their amplitude and frequency content. As a consequence, synaptic currents due to inputs from the EC as well as other hippocampal subfields are reflected in the local field and cannot be dissociated. In order to address this, we used multisite LFP recordings and computed the laminar current source density (CSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitzdorf, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pettersen et al., 2006</xref>) throughout CA1 and DG, which in combination with the known circuit anatomy allowed us to infer the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic activity. An example estimate of this laminar CSD is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which shows several sharp wave-ripples associated with pronounced current sinks in stratum radiatum of CA1 due to CA3 synaptic input, occurring against a background of synaptic activity in DG (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). On a longer timescale, the CSD clearly reveals alternating periods of high and low rates of transient synaptic activity lasting several seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that are particularly prominent within the DG. Strikingly, these alternating periods appear to coincide with slow shifts in the membrane potential of an example CA3 pyramidal neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To quantify the level of cortical input to the hippocampus, we averaged the rectified CSD over the molecular layer of DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This measure reflects the magnitude and rate of transient synaptic currents due to inputs from layer II of the lateral and medial EC arriving at the outer two-thirds of the dentate molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>), as well as associational and return currents flowing in the inner third. Confirming our observations, the rectified DG CSD showed strong coherence with the subthreshold membrane potential of the example CA3 neuron for frequencies below 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result was consistent across DG, CA3, and CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>UP and DOWN states modulate slow V<sub>m</sub> shifts and ripple occurrence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image of current source density (CSD) derived from the local field potential (LFP) traces (gray).

Since EC inputs are responsible for much of the dentate synaptic currents, we identify these regimes as corresponding to entorhinal UDS. Since UDS in EC are coordinated with UDS in other cortical and thalamic areas, we reasoned that the DG CSD contains information about widespread brain state modulation and would therefore be correlated to other brain state signatures and behavioral metrics. Indeed we found that ripples tended to occur almost exclusively when DG CSD activity was high (UP state), while eyeblinks had the opposite relationship and occurred when DG CSD activity was low (DOWN state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the DG CSD showed a strong coherence with the slow changes (below 1 Hz) in pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate these effects further we developed an unsupervised method for extracting UDS from the DG CSD based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). In addition to identifying state transition points, the segmentation allows the translation of the time axis into a circular UDS phase, so that event distributions can be computed with respect to the UP-DOWN phase. This analysis demonstrates that essentially all ripples occur within the UP state and the rate of ripple occurrence ramps up to a steady state value in the course of the UP state itself and abruptly terminates upon transition to a DOWN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). It also shows that upon transition to the DOWN state the pupil quickly dilates, signaling increased arousal, and then gradually constricts through the course of the UP state, indicating a progressive reduction of arousal and attention to external stimuli through the course of the UP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both UP and DOWN epoch durations were distributed approximately exponentially with means of 3.06 s (UP) and 3.25 s (DOWN) and these values were consistent across recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>These observations show that quiet wakefulness can be reliably decomposed into UDS that reflect increased and decreased EC inputs, respectively. This UDS classification reflects the dynamics of the cortical input to the hippocampus, in contrast to LIA/SIA segmentation that is influenced by the states of the hippocampal subfields themselves, which as we describe below are not necessarily coherent. Nevertheless, LIA→SIA transitions mapped closely to UP→DOWN transitions, with SIA→LIA transitions also concentrated around DOWN→UP transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>).

The subthreshold membrane potential of the example CA3 neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is clearly related to the DG CSD and consequently to UP-DOWN states. Importantly, the relation is evident in the slow shifts in V<sub>m</sub> and not in the superimposed faster fluctuations. This is confirmed by the fact that all significant coherence between V<sub>m</sub> and rectified DG CSD occurs below 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore separated the fast from the slow dynamics of the subthreshold membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) fluctuations with a cutoff frequency of approximately 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, the membrane potential of the CA3 pyramidal neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is more hyperpolarized when DG CSD activity and hence the excitatory EC input rate is high, and conversely, more depolarized when EC input rate is low. Does EC input impact subthreshold activity in other hippocampal subfields in a similar way? To address this, we computed the cross-covariance between DG CSD activity and the slow V<sub>m</sub> component of cells in DG, CA3, and CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The majority of DG cells (21/22) displayed a positive correlation to EC inputs, the majority of CA3 neurons (26/32) exhibited a negative correlation, while CA1 neurons were split in half. In other words, while the slow V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations in DG are nearly in sync with the DG CSD activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), they are anticorrelated in CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, a closer look at the lag associated with peak absolute correlation reveals that while DG neurons follow DG CSD activity very closely (37 ms median lag), the significantly correlated CA1 neurons actually lead DG CSD activity (–225ms median lag), while the trough of the CA3 negative correlation follows DG CSD activity (296 ms median lag) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

All hippocampal subfields receive direct input from the entorhinal cortex (EC), and yet the pattern of modulation by the UP-DOWN state cycle varies across subfields. In order to understand how EC inputs influence hippocampal neurons we used the measured DG CSD as a proxy of EC input and estimated linear transfer models for each cell treating DG CSD activity as input and the cell’s slow V<sub>m</sub> component as the model output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We considered a class of finite impulse response (FIR) models allowing for non-zero filter values at negative lags and hence for a non-causal influence of the input on the output. The estimated impulse responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A2–D2</xref>) revealed that while DG granule cells had causal responses, many CA3 and CA1 cells showed positive filter values at negative lags (up to –250 ms) signaling a non-causal relation between DG CSD and V<sub>m</sub>. This was consistent with the positive/negative peak correlation lags observed for DG/CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), but revealed a non-causal effect in CA3 which was not evident in the cross-covariance analysis. At positive lags the impulse responses for the majority of DG and CA1 cells were positive, while they were negative (inhibitory) for the majority of CA3 pyramidal neurons. The estimated models allowed us to simulate the step responses of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A1–D1</xref>) and showed that as a population DG and CA3 exhibited persistent depolarization and hyperpolarization in response to sustained EC input, respectively, while CA1 showed a transient depolarizing response that decayed within 1 s. We also simulated the slow V<sub>m</sub> components of hippocampal neurons from DG CSD and found good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that the transfer models provide a succinct description of the behavior of hippocampal neurons in response to changing EC input levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Entorhinal input differentially modulates slow V<sub>m</sub> shifts across hippocampal subfields.</title><p>(<bold>A1</bold>) Each row of the pseudocolor image shows the step response of a linear transfer model describing the effect of dentate gyrus (DG) current source density (CSD) activity on the slow V<sub>m</sub> component for a given DG cell.

To understand their behavior through the course of the UDS cycle, we analyzed the subthreshold membrane potential and spiking of hippocampal neurons as a function of the UDS phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In particular, we computed the distribution of V<sub>m</sub> values conditioned on the phase of the UDS cycle. These distributions displayed phase-dependent V<sub>m</sub> means for the majority (82/86) of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A1–D1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) and many cells (42/86) also exhibited phase-dependent fast V<sub>m</sub> component variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A2–D2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Several important differences between the hippocampal subfields were evident. Dentate granule cells were quite homogeneous in their behavior through the course of the UP-DOWN state and all but one cell showed sustained V<sub>m</sub> depolarization which was maintained through the course of the UP state and was mirrored by a persistent hyperpolarization throughout the DOWN phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>). In contrast, about a third (9/32) of CA3 neurons exhibited the exact opposite behavior: sustained V<sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization through the UP state and depolarization through the DOWN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>). The remaining population exhibited a more transient depolarization with a peak slightly preceding or coincident with the UP transition point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B1</xref>). The CA1 pyramidal cell population displayed a level of diversity that was intermediate to that of DG and CA3. About 40% of CA1 neurons (13/32) were depolarized in the UP state and hyperpolarized in the DOWN state, but the responses were more transient than in DG, with depolarization/hyperpolarization decaying through the course of the UP/DOWN state, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C1</xref>). The behavior of the remaining CA1 neurons appeared similar to that of the CA3 population. With respect to V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations, DG granule cells exhibited the highest variability, exceeding that in CA3 and CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A1-D1</xref>). With respect to overall V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations only CA1 neurons displayed state-dependent modulation of V<sub>m</sub> variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D1</xref>), with the UP state being associated with more variable V<sub>m</sub>. Focusing on the fast V<sub>m</sub> component alone, both CA1 neurons (14/32) and DG granule cells (9/22) showed a significant jump in variability during the UP state with no granule cells and only three CA1 neurons having the opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A2–D2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5C</xref>). In contrast, CA3 pyramidal neurons exhibited both jumps and drops and at the population level had a nearly constant level of V<sub>m</sub> variability throughout the UP-DOWN state cycle, which equaled that of CA1 in the UP state, but exceeded it in the DOWN phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B2 and D2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D1</xref>).

Furthermore, here we showed that when quiet wakefulness is segmented into periods of UDS, essentially all ripples occur in the EC UP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The prevailing view is that ripples are the result of self-organized population bursts of activity that build within the recurrent CA3 network and then are transmitted to and further patterned by the CA1 network, where the ripple oscillation itself is readily observable in the local field near the pyramidal cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miles and Wong, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Traub and Miles, 1991</xref>). How do neurons across the different hippocampal subfields participate in this process? To address this question we detected ripple onset times from the CA1 local field near the pyramidal cell layer and determined the ripple-triggered average (RTA) V<sub>m</sub> and firing rate modulation for each recorded cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since the RTA of the V<sub>m</sub> is the sum of the RTAs of the fast and slow V<sub>m</sub> components, we determined these average responses separately for each cell and component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A1–D1 and A3–D3</xref> ). The RTAs of the slow V<sub>m</sub> component showed pronounced depolarization in DG with a peak before the ripple onset, a hyperpolarization in CA3 with a trough following the ripple onset, and mixed responses in CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A1–D1</xref>). Since ripples occurred exclusively during the UP state and the slow V<sub>m</sub> component of hippocampal neurons was strongly influenced by state, we hypothesized that the RTA slow V<sub>m</sub> response depended strongly on the pattern of EC input and how each cell was impacted by it. We therefore simulated the slow V<sub>m</sub> component for each cell using the linear transfer models we had estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and computed the RTA of the simulated slow V<sub>m</sub> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A2–D2</xref>).

Consistent with previous studies, we found that the fast RTA V<sub>m</sub> waveform for most CA1 pyramidal neurons had a sharp prominent peak following the ripple onset, followed by a steep return to baseline or hyperpolarization within a 100ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>). This behavior was mirrored in the firing rate modulation of CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D3</xref>) and is consistent with the notion that CA1 exhibits a highly synchronous population burst associated with ripple oscillations.</p><p>Since the population event in CA1 is presumably due to a self-organized population burst in CA3, one might expect that the fast RTA waveforms in CA3 should resemble those in CA1, but this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B3</xref>). While a minority CA3 neurons (9/32) exhibited a small depolarizing peak near the ripple-onset, the most consistent feature of the fast RTA V<sub>m</sub> waveform in CA3 was the prominent hyperpolarization that reached a trough roughly 100 ms following ripple onset and recovered within 300 ms. The population average response shows that the decrease in V<sub>m</sub> had begun as early as 150 ms prior to the ripple onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D3</xref>). Similarly, while several CA3 neurons showed an increase in firing rate just prior to the ripple onset, about a third of the CA3 population exhibited a reduction in firing rate before and especially following the ripple onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B4 and D4</xref>). These data demonstrate that extensive inhibition, rather than excitation, is the hallmark of CA3 subthreshold activity before and after ripple bursts. It is worth noting that most neurons, even with hyperpolarizing average response, experienced depolarization and firing during a subset of ripples, consistent with a sparse activation of CA3 during ripples. Further analysis of the CA3 cells with a depolarizing peak near the ripple onset (9/32 cells) revealed that they do not have significantly different resting V<sub>m</sub>, spike threshold, burst index or spikes per burst compared to the rest of the CA3 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). However, these CA3 cells had a lower firing probability in the DOWN state compared to the rest of the CA3 population.</p><p>Finally, while the dentate gyrus has not been traditionally considered to be instrumental to the process of ripple generation, the fast RTA V<sub>m</sub> waveforms of granule cells showed clear modulation with about half of the population exhibiting a depolarization peak following ripple onset with a similar time course to that seen in CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A3</xref>). Interestingly, about half of DG granule cells also showed another depolarization peak occurring 100 ms prior to ripple onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A3 and D3</xref>). Upon closer examination a similarly timed depolarizing peak could be seen in the CA1 response prior to ripple onset, although of much smaller magnitude in comparison to the post-ripple depolarization. Similarly, a sharp wave of smaller amplitude is also consistently observed 100ms before ripple onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>). The two peaks were also present in the rectified DG CSD triggered on ripple onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A3</xref>). Since ripples can occur in close succession at intervals close to 100ms, we wondered if such ripple bursts could contribute to the observed pre-ripple depolarization. To test this hypothesis we compared the fast RTA V<sub>m</sub> aligned to the onset of isolated single ripples with that aligned to the onset of ripple doublets. The pre-ripple depolarization in DG and CA1 was similar for isolated ripples and ripple doublets arguing against the hypothesis that pre-ripple responses were due to ripple bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data indicate that DG should not be viewed as a passive bystander in the awake ripple generation process and that the ripple proper is preceded by coordinated activity not only in CA3, but also in CA1 and DG.</p><p>What circuit mechanisms may be responsible for the observed subthreshold activity around ripples? Since CA3 is considered to play a key role in the process of ripple generation, we reasoned that influences on subthreshold activity originating in CA3 should scale in proportion to the CA3 population burst size. We inferred this size indirectly from the amplitude of the ripple-associated sharp wave in stratum radiatum of CA1 or equivalently by the magnitude of the underlying synaptic current due to Schaffer collateral activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizunuma et al., 2014</xref>). We then divided the ripples from each recording session in two halves, big and small, depending on whether they were associated with above-median or below-median CA3 burst size. Finally, we computed the fast RTA V<sub>m</sub> waveform separately for big and small CA3 events and compared the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The size of the CA3 burst had little effect on the DG RTA waveform, apart from a slight increase in hyperpolarization about 100ms following ripple onset that was associated with the bigger events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A1–A3</xref>). In contrast, subthreshold activity in CA3 clearly reflected the size of the CA3 population event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B1–B3</xref>). Larger CA3 events were associated with more sustained depolarization up to 300ms prior to the ripple onset and deeper hyperpolarization following (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B3</xref>). In CA1, bigger CA3 events were associated with slightly more depolarization up to 250ms prior to the ripple onset and during the post-ripple peak, but the most notable difference was the increased hyperpolarization about 100ms following the ripple onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C1–C3</xref>). These data indicate that feedback inhibition within CA3 is most likely responsible for the subthreshold hyperpolarization seen in the fast V<sub>m</sub> component around ripples in CA3. Consistent with our previous study, it also suggests that feedforward inhibition from CA3 to CA1 may play an important role in controlling the population event size in CA1 and may contribute to the post-ripple hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fast V<sub>m</sub> inhibitory responses to ripples scale with CA3 population burst size.</title><p>(<bold>A1</bold>) Mean fast V<sub>m</sub> components of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells triggered on ripples with small (below average) sharp-wave (SPW) amplitudes.

On the timescale of seconds, slow shifts in the V<sub>m</sub> of CA3 neurons are negatively correlated to the UP-DOWN transitions in the level of entorhinal input to DG. Consequently many CA3 neurons exhibit hyperpolarization in the UP state in contrast to DG and CA1 neurons, which are in sync with EC inputs. This subfield-specific modulation by UDS explains the slow trends in the membrane potential leading to and following awake ripples. On a sub-second timescale, both DG and CA1 neurons exhibit depolarization transients both ~100 ms before and immediately after the ripple onset, while CA3 neurons show a prominent hyperpolarization that starts to build before and reaches maximum after the ripple onset. The magnitude of the CA3 hyperpolarization scales with the size of the CA3 population burst pointing to feedback inhibition as its likely source.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>UDS differentially modulate activity across DG, CA3, and CA1</title><p>Neocortical dynamics during NREM (non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and anesthesia show intrinsic alternation between periods of elevated activity (UP states) and relative quiescence (DOWN states) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cowan and Wilson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steriade et al., 1993a</xref>). The entorhinal cortex is the major gateway linking the neocortex with the hippocampal formation and has been shown to exhibit UDS associated with bimodal membrane potential distributions of EC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>). Despite an absence of bimodality, the subthreshold activity and the spiking of hippocampal neurons is modulated by cortical UDS in a subfield-specific manner both in sleep and under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hahn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>). We found that DG molecular layer currents exhibit UP-DOWN dynamics indicating that the EC undergoes UDS transitions in quiet wakefulness as well that modulate activity across hippocampal subfields.</p><p>Our results regarding UDS modulation in quiet wakefulness are largely consistent with corresponding observations in NREM sleep and under anesthesia, but there were also some notable differences that we highlight below. We observed pronounced modulation of both subthreshold activity and spiking at the DOWN→UP transition in all hippocampal subfields including a 50% increase in the baseline firing rate of CA3 neurons preceding the DOWN→UP transition, consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>) and in contrast to previous reports which found no modulation of CA3 unit activity in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>) or weak and mixed modulation in anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hahn et al., 2007</xref>). We also find that awake ripples occur essentially exclusively during the UP state, and not merely with an increased probability relative to the DOWN state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, awake ripples occurred throughout the UP state and were not concentrated near the DOWN→UP transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battaglia et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, in our data the vast majority of CA1 neurons were depolarized on the DOWN→UP transition and had elevated firing rates in the UP state in contrast to previous observations under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hahn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>While the majority of recorded neurons were influenced by UDS, the nature of the modulation is subfield-specific. Granule cells in DG by and large follow the EC inputs and show sustained depolarization and firing rate increase throughout the UP state mirrored by relative hyperpolarization and reduced firing in the DOWN state. Pyramidal neurons in CA1 also depolarize and fire more on the DOWN→UP transition, but these responses are more transient than in DG. Consequently, the expected membrane potential across the CA1 population has a triangular wave shape as a function of UDS phase, unlike the square wave shape characteristic of the DG population. This triangular wave shape is almost symmetric with respect to DOWN→UP transition and as a result the V<sub>m</sub> conditional means in the UDS are very similar, despite the clear V<sub>m</sub> modulation by UDS phase. The CA1 population starts depolarizing before the DOWN→UP transition and the DG granule cells. This is reflected in the non-causal transfer model impulse response of CA1 pyramidal cells, which is consistent with the presence of a feedback loop via the CA1→EC connection, but also suggests the presence of another excitatory source, such as CA3, that leads EC activity.</p><p>How can activity in CA3 lead given that CA3 is downstream of both the EC and the DG? The majority of CA3 pyramidal neurons are negatively correlated to DG molecular layer currents, which is surprising since CA3 and DG receive excitatory input from EC, while the mossy fibers (DG→CA3) form powerful excitatory ‘detonator’ synapses on the proximal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Despite this anatomical organization suggesting that CA3 activity should follow that in EC and DG, CA3 pyramidal cells in fact show peak depolarization and elevated firing before the DOWN→UP transition, thus leading both CA1 and DG. Furthermore, a third of the CA3 population is more depolarized in the DOWN state, while the rest exhibit transient depolarization right before the DOWN→UP transition. This is reflected in the negative impulse response of the CA3 transfer model with sustained negative step response. The modulation of the population firing rate in CA3 by UDS is consistent with CA3 being responsible for the CA1 lead over DG activity.</p><p>What mechanisms may account for the CA3 behavior? One possibility is that DG and/or EC inputs provide powerful feedforward inhibition to CA3 pyramidal neurons. Indeed mossy fibers (DG→CA3) not only form large mossy terminals on CA3 pyramidal cells but also contact interneurons via filopodial extensions, providing an anatomical substrate for feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>). The balance between feedforward excitation and inhibition depends on the pattern of granule cell activity: low frequency activation of the mossy fibers results in powerful slow inhibition of CA3 pyramidal neurons while at higher frequencies an initial depolarization precedes the inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zucca et al., 2017</xref>). Through this mechanism the elevated DG activity in the UP state may induce a concomitant suppression in the majority of CA3 pyramidal neurons during the UP state. As granule cells reduce their firing in the DOWN state, the CA3 circuit is released from the DG-mediated feedforward inhibition and the recurrent CA3 connections may support a sustained increase in population activity. This recurrent excitation is controlled by the strong feedback inhibition present in CA3. The non-causal positive component of the CA3 transfer model impulse response and the timing of CA3 firing relative to the DOWN→UP transition indicate that CA3 may play an important role in ushering the subsequent UP state by providing excitation to EC via CA1. These observations are inconsistent with a feedforward activation of the trisynaptic pathway, suggesting a more complex interplay of intrahippocampal and perforant pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Membrane potential dynamics around ripples in quiet wakefulness</title><p>The recurrent circuit of CA3 has long been hypothesized to function as an autoassociative memory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marr, 1971</xref>) and to support the buildup of population activity underlying the ripple generation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>). Indeed, acute silencing of Schaffer collaterals during wakefulness abolishes ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davoudi and Foster, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017</xref>). While the membrane potential of CA1 pyramidal neurons near ripples has been shown to exhibit a gradual ramping and a transient depolarization followed by a prolonged inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>), the subthreshold dynamics of DG granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons near ripples in awake animals had not been fully characterized.</p><p>We observed that the ripple-triggered membrane potential of hippocampal neurons is modulated on a timescale of seconds, with DG granule cells showing depolarization, CA3 pyramidal neurons hyperpolarization, and CA1 cells exhibiting weaker modulation. Since ripples occur almost exclusively in the UP state and the slow V<sub>m</sub> dynamics of hippocampal cells are modulated by UDS in a subfield-specific fashion, we hypothesized and confirmed that the slow V<sub>m</sub> responses near ripples can be qualitatively accounted for by the UDS influence on hippocampal cells.</p><p>How does UDS influence hippocampal network excitability? It has been proposed that during NREM sleep hippocampal dynamics exhibit a stable, but excitable quiescent state, such that activity fluctuations can produce a transient population excitation representing a ripple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levenstein et al., 2019</xref>). Our data indicate that in quiet wakefulness UDS modify hippocampal network excitability because no ripples are produced in the DOWN state. We illustrate this behavior in a mean firing rate model in the framework described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levenstein et al., 2019</xref>, featuring two (EC and CA3) adapting recurrent neural populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the model the EC population influences CA3 activity by providing a net inhibitory input as well as by modulating the strength of the CA3 recurrent excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In the real circuit the latter influence may be due to UDS-dependent changes in neuromodulatory inputs, such as cholinergic tone, as exhibited, for example, by pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mena-Segovia et al., 2008</xref>). The majority of the cholinergic input to the hippocampus originates in the medial septum and optogenetic stimulation of septal ChAT-positive neurons suppresses ripple generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vandecasteele et al., 2014</xref>). Acetylcholine is known to inhibit the efficacy of recurrent synaptic transmission in CA3 by acting on presynaptic muscarinic receptors in the associational–commissural fiber system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasselmo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasselmo and Schnell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vogt and Regehr, 2001</xref>) and cholinergic tone is presumably at its lowest during ripple generation in the EC UP state. Thus the efficacy of CA3 recurrent connections together with dentate and entorhinal input to CA3 and the associated feedforward inhibition can act as bifurcation parameters for the CA3 network dynamics that change network excitability thereby preventing ripple occurrence during the cortical DOWN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). This is counterintuitive because many CA3 neurons are more active and depolarized in the DOWN state or near the DOWN→UP transition and so, according to the stochastic-refractory model of ripple initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>) the rate of ripple occurrence should coincide with the modulation of CA3 activity by UDS, which is contradicted by the fact that ripples occur in the UP state. In our model, CA3 network excitability is shown to be restricted to the EC UP state when the mean CA3 rate is lower compared to the DOWN state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>). This is possible because of the push-pull influences of the net inhibitory input which lowers CA3 network excitability, and the CA3 recurrent strength potentiation which increases it. Hence, in the UP state the CA3 network is inhibited but excitable, while in the DOWN state it is disinhibited but not excitable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of UP and DOWN states (UDS) control of CA3 network excitability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Idealized model of entorhinal cortex (EC) and CA3 adapting recurrent neural populations.

This is consistent with in vitro work showing that reducing GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition in hippocampal slices abolishes spontaneously occurring sharp wave-ripple events in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazelot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>). The relative hyperpolarization in CA3 during the UP state may reflect the role of certain local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katona et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Viney et al., 2013</xref>) or long-range projecting interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Unal et al., 2018</xref>) in suppressing the initiation of ripples. According to one view, ripple generation may be the result of disinhibition; however, our data does not offer clear evidence for widespread disinhibition in CA3 preceding the population burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evangelista et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, ripple generation by disinhibition does not account for the lack of ripples in the DOWN state, despite the elevated neuronal activity in CA3. Its origin notwithstanding, membrane hyperpolarization in CA3 may influence ripple initiation by affecting voltage-gated conductances and thereby changing the excitability of CA3 neurons to make them more likely to fire or burst in response to transient depolarizing input. Changes in inhibition across the CA3 network may shift the region of ripple initiation, allowing for reactivation of diverse memory traces stored within the CA3 network.</p><p>On a faster timescale, the average V<sub>m</sub> responses near ripples reveal two consistent features. First, the majority of CA3 neurons exhibit a brief (~300 ms) hyperpolarization locked to the ripple onset in addition to the broad (~3 s) UDS-mediated hyperpolarization. This brief hyperpolarization grows with the size of the CA3 population burst, quantified by the associated sharp wave amplitude, therefore pointing to feedback inhibition as its source. This suggests that feedback inhibition is a consistent feature of the buildup process in CA3. This inhibition likely arises from several classes of interneurons that have been shown to exhibit elevated firing around ripples in both CA3 and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Somogyi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tukker et al., 2013</xref>). However, the distinct V<sub>m</sub> responses we observed around ripples indicate that inhibition is tuned differently in CA3 and CA1. In particular, in CA1 inhibition imposes oscillatory patterning on the V<sub>m</sub> that rides on a wave of depolarization, while in CA3 inhibition summates to produce a net hyperpolarization. In both areas however, fast fluctuations in the membrane potential persist throughout the ripple period allowing CA3 neurons to fire despite the net hyperpolarization. These results suggest that the relative gain of feedback inhibition is greater than that of recurrent excitation for the majority of the CA3 neurons and hence the population burst can only build up by recruiting the CA3 neurons most strongly connected to a sparse active subset. This may reflect a winner-take-all mechanism for controlling both the sparsity and the specificity of the neuronal sequences activated in CA3 during a ripple. The growing inhibition during the course of a ripple also provides a mechanism for ripple termination.</p><p>Second, DG granule cells exhibit two transient depolarizations of comparable amplitude ~100ms before and immediately after the ripple onset. Similarly timed features are present in the V<sub>m</sub> of CA1 pyramidal neurons, albeit the pre-ripple depolarization is significantly smaller than the post-ripple one. In CA1, both depolarizations are associated with sharp waves of proportional magnitudes in stratum radiatum (Figrue 4A in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>), implicating CA3 as the source for both. The DG activation is consistent with the presence of a backprojection from CA3 to DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scharfman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Szabo et al., 2017</xref>) and can influence ripple-associated CA3 activity, consistent with previous lesion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>). These results indicate a long and orchestrated ripple initiation process in the awake state, extending beyond the roughly 50ms period of excitatory activity buildup that proceeds ripples in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While there are consistent features within each subfield with respect to UDS and ripple modulation, there is also variability of responses across cells. Resting V<sub>m</sub> and cell location along the proximodistal and deep-superficial axes could be factors influencing the UDS and ripple modulation. Indeed, previous studies have shown a gradient of connectivity and intrinsic cell properties along the proximodistal axis in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), and differential responses of CA1 neurons in deep and superficial layers of CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Valero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Valero and de la Prida, 2018</xref>). Analysis of UP-DOWN modulation as a function of resting V<sub>m</sub> and proximodistal location of each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) did not reveal any significant trends. Furthermore, similar analysis of ripple modulation did not reveal significant trends either, except for the fact that the most depolarized CA3 cells tend to hyperpolarize most during ripples, consistent with the fact that these cells are furthest away from the GABAa reversal potential and experience the highest driving force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, our recordings do not span the full proximodistal axis and may hence not be ideally suited to test the dependence of our results on proximodistal location. Furthermore, we record from multiple neurons in each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) which does not allow us to unequivocally identify the depth of each neuron within the cell layer. Future experiments can provide more conclusive evidence concerning the factors that explain the variability of subthreshold modulation by UDS and ripples across the hippocampal subfields.</p><p>These results provide novel insights into the processes of ripple initiation, build up, and termination in awake animals. Ripples occur exclusively in UP states characterized by increased entorhinal inputs to DG and associated with pronounced hyperpolarization of CA3 pyramidal cells. This suggests that broad inhibition in CA3 may be a prerequisite for ripple initiation. Furthermore, DG and CA1 pre-ripple responses suggest that ripples are not initiated as isolated events within CA3, but are the culmination of extended interplay across multiple areas. This may reflect the role of cortical inputs in influencing the neuronal patterns replayed by the hippocampus during awake ripples, consistent with their role in spatial decision-making. Finally, growing hyperpolarization in CA3 throughout the course of a ripple suggests that feedback inhibition is a key feature of ripple buildup as well as termination. This may reflect a winner-take-all mechanism, by which a few neurons that fire overcoming a background of inhibition in UP states, further suppress all other neurons via feedback inhibition, ensuring sparseness and selectivity of transient network pattern activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Head fixation surgery</title><p>The methods used were the same as those described in our previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hulse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>).

The internal solution had an osmolarity of 300 mOsm and a pH of 7.27 at room temperature. Pipettes are pulled from borosilicate capillaries (OD: 1.0 mm, ID: 0.58 mm; Sutter Instrument Company) using a Model P-2000 puller (Sutter Instrument Company) and inserted into the brain in the coronal plane with a~15° angle pointing away from the midline. Recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). The V<sub>m</sub> was not corrected for liquid junction potential. Capacitance neutralization was set prior to establishing the GΩ seal. Access resistance was estimated online by fitting the voltage response to hyperpolarizing current steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>). The input resistance was estimated by subtracting the access resistance from the ratio of the change in V<sub>m</sub> produced by the current step over the magnitude of injected current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Signal acquisition</title><p>All electrophysiological signal acquisition was performed with Labview (National Instruments). Electrophysiological signals were sampled simultaneously at 25 kHz with 24 bit resolution using AC (PXI-4498, internal gain: 30 dB, range: +/-316 mV) or DC-coupled (PXIe-4492, internal gain: 0 dB, range: +/-10 V) analog-to-digital data acquisition cards (National instruments) with built-in anti-aliasing filters for extracellular and intracellular/juxtacellular recordings, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology and imaging</title><p>To identify the recorded neurons, histology and imaging were performed, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horikawa and Armstrong, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hulse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>). Following the experiment, mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane, decapitated, and the brain extracted to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were fixed at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and transferred to 0.01 M (300 mOsm) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) the next day. Up to one week later, brains were sectioned coronally (100 μm) on a vibrating microtome (Leica), permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in PBS for 1–2 hr, and incubated overnight at room temperature in PBS containing avidin-fluorescein (1:200, Vector Laboratories), 5% (v/v) normal horse serum (NHS), and 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were rinsed in PBS between each step. The next day, sections containing biocytin stained neurons were identified on an inverted epifluorescent microscope (Olympius IX51) for further immunohistochemical processing. Sections underwent immunohistochemical staining against calbindin (CB) and parvalbumin (PV) to aid locating the recorded neurons in the hippocampus. Sections containing biocytin-stained neurons were first incubated in blocking solution containing 5% NHS, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 0.02% (wt/v) sodium azide in PBS. Next, slices were incubated in PBS containing primary antibodies against CB (Rabbit anti-Calbindin D-28k, 1:2000, Swant) and PV (Goat anti-parvalbumin, 1:2000, Swant) overnight. After thorough rinsing in PBS, slices were incubated in PBS containing secondary antibodies CF543 donkey anti-rabbit (1:500, Biotium) and CF633 donkey anti-goat (1:500, Biotium). Processed slices were rinsed and mounted in antifading mounting medium (EverBrite, Biotium). Stained slices were imaged on an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 710 &amp; LSM 880, Zeiss).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>V<sub>m</sub> decomposition</title><p>Spikes were detected by identifying local maxima in the broadband membrane potential with peak prominence of at least 15 mV and width of at most 10 ms. Cells with spike thresholds exceeding –37 mV were considered to be possibly damaged and were therefore excluded from subsequent analyses. The subthreshold membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) was computed by interpolating the membrane potential over periods with an action potential starting from 3ms before to 5ms after the spike peak. The subthreshold V<sub>m</sub> signal was then low-pass filtered (Parks-McClellan optimal equiripple FIR filter, 250–350 Hz transition band) and downsampled to 2083 Hz. The V<sub>m</sub> signal was decomposed into fast, slow, and drift components as follows. First, the slow V<sub>m</sub> component (V<sub>m,slow</sub>) was obtained by median filtering V<sub>m</sub> with a 1 s window. Next, the fast V<sub>m</sub> component (V<sub>m,fast</sub>) was obtained as the residual V<sub>m</sub> after subtraction of V<sub>m,slow</sub>. A drift component (V<sub>m,drift</sub>) was obtained by smoothing V<sub>m,slow</sub> with a 60 s boxcar kernel. Finally, V<sub>m,slow</sub> was detrended by subtracting V<sub>m,drift</sub>, which included the resting membrane potential as well as any V<sub>m</sub> changes on the timescale of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). By construction V<sub>m</sub> = V<sub>m,fast</sub> + V<sub>m,slow</sub> + V<sub>m,drift</sub> and the components contain different frequency bands of the subthreshold membrane potential.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>Ripple detection</title><p>Ripples were detected as transient increases in power in the ripple frequency band of the LFP from the probe site located in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Ripple power was estimated by band-pass filtering the LFP trace (80–250 Hz), smoothing its square with a Gaussian kernel (10 ms), and taking the square root. Candidate ripple events were identified as segments for which the ripple power was more than 3 s.d. above the mean. Segments that were less than 55ms apart were merged, and after the merging step segments of length less than 20 ms were rejected as artifacts. A reference recording site away from the CA1 cell layer that does not exhibit ripples was identified and the same procedure was applied for ripple detection on this reference channel. Events detected in both the CA1 and the reference LFP trace were rejected as artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Current source density (CSD) estimation</title><p>Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from a 32-site silicon probe with 100 µm site spacing positioned so that sites spanned all of neocortex, area CA1, the DG, and parts of the thalamus. LFPs were bandpass filtered between 1 Hz and 1 KHz and downsampled to 2083 Hz. Channels with recording artifacts were excluded from the CSD analysis. Laminar current source densities were estimated with ~17 µm resolution using a robust version of the one-dimensional inverse CSD spline method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pettersen et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, the forward matrix (relating CSDs to LFPs) was computed as usual, but the inverse matrix (relating LFPs to CSDs) was computed using ridge regression with a regularization parameter set by a cross-validation procedure. The spatial smoothness of the CSD estimate was automatically controlled by the regularization parameter and therefore no further spatial smoothing was applied. The anatomical laminae in CA1 and DG were determined using a combination of histological reconstruction of the probe track, electrophysiological markers (ripples, sharp waves, and dentate spikes), and the CSD covariance structure. DG CSD activity was computed by first averaging the rectified CSD signals from the vertical extent (~200 µm) of the suprapyramidal molecular layer of DG (giving the ‘rectified DG CSD’), then smoothing with a 1 s median filter, and finally converting to a z-score. By construction DG CSD activity only reflects the rate and magnitude of transient synaptic activity and not any slow-varying (&lt;1 Hz) transmembrane currents which are inherently difficult to capture with AC-coupled recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brankack et al., 1993</xref>). Using DG CSD activity, we identify UP states as time periods when the rate and amplitude of EC input current transients, rather than the DC level, increases, in accordance with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>). We further validated that the extracted UP/DOWN states reflect modulation of pupil radius and ripple rate, quantities that are independently measured.</p></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>Transfer model estimation</title><p>Linear transfer models were estimated after taking the z-scored DG CSD activity as model input and the slow V<sub>m</sub> component of the subthreshold membrane potential of a given cell as output. The FIR was estimated from the input-output data using a regularized nonparametric procedure (impulseest in Matlab System Identification Toolbox with tuned and correlated 'TC' kernel used for regularization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). The input-output data were first downsampled to ~20 Hz and the order of the FIR was set to 75, corresponding to 3.6 s duration. The procedure automatically estimated FIR values at negative delays (up to –0.86 s) and non-zero filter values at negative delays indicated that the slow V<sub>m</sub> component led DG CSD activity. Once the impulse responses were estimated the corresponding step responses were simulated by feeding the model with a step input. Low order autoregressive with extra input (ARX) models were also estimated in a similar manner and led to qualitatively similar results as the FIR models (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s5-5"><title>UP and DOWN state segmentation</title><p>UDS were identified from the z-scored DG molecular layer CSD activity using a HMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McFarland et al., 2011</xref>). First, a binary Gaussian mixture was fit to the distribution of DG CSD values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, the mixture components were used to initialize the emission probability distributions of a two state (UP and DOWN) HMM and then the state transition and emission probabilities were estimated from the DG CSD time series data. Finally, the most likely sequence of states given the observed DG CSD time series, downsampled to 4 Hz, were computed with the Viterbi algorithm. The resulting Viterbi path was used to assign a UDS phase to each time point based on its position relative to the nearest UDS transition times. The method was unsupervised and did not require user tuning of any model parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s5-6"><title>Significance testing of UDS modulation</title><p>To test whether UP-DOWN state had an effect on subthreshold membrane potential we sampled the V<sub>m</sub> signal every 2 s (in order to remove any serial correlation between retained samples) and grouped the retained samples according to UP-DOWN state. We then compared the means of the UP and DOWN groups using a parametric two-sample t-test with unpooled variance and also compared the medians using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, which yielded consistent results. To test whether the variance of the fast V<sub>m</sub> component in the UDS was different we used a similar procedure, but the signal was sampled every 1 s (since the fast component decorrelated faster) and the variances of the UP and DOWN groups were compared using a parametric two-sample F test, as well as a non-parametric two-sample Ansari-Bradley test, which yielded consistent results. To test whether UP-DOWN state had an effect on the firing rate of a given cell we compared the observed spike counts in the UDS against the expected counts given the observed mean firing rate using Pearson’s chi-square test of goodness of fit. Finally, to test whether UDS phase had an effect on V<sub>m</sub> we grouped the sampled signal in 20 bins according to UDS phase and checked if the mean of each group was different from 0 using a one-sample Z-test with significance level reduced by a factor of 20 to account for the multiple comparisons. Modulation by UDS phase was deemed significant if 5 or more of the 20 groups had means significantly different than 0.</p></sec><sec id="s5-7"><title>Adapting recurrent neural population model</title><p>When uncoupled, the EC and CA3 population dynamics follow the Wilson-Cowan type r-a model studied in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levenstein et al., 2019</xref>.

in awake mice to investigate the initiation of sharp wave-ripples, synchronous bursts of activity thought to support memory replay. They report a specific hyperpolarization of the pyramidal cells in the CA3 subfield while the dentate granule cells or CA1 pyramidal cells are depolarized.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Liset M de la Prida (Reviewer #1); Jerome Epzstein (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The present study addresses the question of sharp wave-ripples initiation using patch-clamp recordings of principal cells in different hippocampal subfields (CA3, CA1 and the dentate gyrus – DG) combined with extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice as well as computational modeling. CA3 pyramidal cells are depolarized and spike at the DOWN/UP transition (with some cells depolarizing even earlier) and then progressively hyperpolarize during the course of the UP state while DG cells and CA1 pyramidal cells tend to depolarize and fire throughout the UP state. Hence, the study suggests that switches between a dominant inhibitory excitable state and a disinhibited non-excitable state control the intra-hippocampal dynamics during UP/DOWN transitions. While the three reviewers are quite enthusiastic about the study, they have all raised a number of concerns regarding the presentation of the data and of the manuscript. The most critical points are summarized below:</p><p>1) More information regarding the actual recordings should be reported, including the mean resting membrane potential (true voltage, not z-scored), input resistance of the neurons, burst propensity, morphological validation of cell types, and number of neurons per area. This will help the reader to judge the quality of the dataset and to compare with previously published studies in the field.</p><p>2) The true membrane potential should be reported not only for quality criteria, but also as an explanatory factor for 'inhibitory/excitatory' responses due to different driving forces.</p><p>3) The recordings were done the same day as anaesthesia, leading to potential confounds when comparing with anaesthesia-free preparation. This should be clearly stated. Furthermore, there are discrepancies with previously reported findings using other techniques, especially regarding the firing of CA3 and CA1 neurons during ripples and the duration of UP and DOWN states. The study should discuss clearly why, and whether anaesthesia and/or the use of whole cell recording technique may explain these differences.</p><p>4) The precise location of each neuron within each hippocampal subfield is also not reported. This is quite important as this may explain part of the variability observed near UP/DOWN transitions and around ripples.</p><p>5) It is unclear why the ripple onset is used and not the more commonly used ripple peak. This will help compare the results with previously published papers in the field.</p><p>6) The CSD analysis should be improved: in its present form, an absolute phase cannot be ascertained and the relationship with entorhinal/cortical inputs and ongoing animal's behavior should be clarified. Moreover, the average CSD around times of DOWN/UP transition and ripples should be reported. It is also unclear whether the coherence of the CSD in the DG and CA3 membrane potential is specific to slow frequencies or was observed across the frequency spectrum. Finally, baseline of CSD estimated from AC-coupled LFP can be misleading. Some of these issues can be addressed by using a blind source separation instead.</p><p>7) The data regarding pupil diameter and eye blink should more thoroughly analyzed. Importantly, it should be clarified whether they were collected across animals or from a single experiment. The unit of the coherence with DG CSD amplitude is unclear (Figure 2, S1B).</p><p>8) Can the dynamics of ripple trains (which usually occur in &quot;bursts&quot;) explain the increase in DG cells up to 150ms before ripple onset?</p><p>9) The title of the manuscript is misleading. The present data don't support that CA3 inhibition is the only hallmark of ripple generation and, in general, the study focuses more on the relationship of member potentials with UP/DOWN state fluctuation than with ripples.</p><p>10) The manuscript lacks some other important details, e.g. how cells were ranked in Figures3-6 and the number of observations in each figure legend. Please see below comments from the reviewers for more detailed remarks.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting paper describing membrane potential dynamics of hippocampal principal cells during UP/DOWN transitions and sharp-wave ripples. Using whole-cell in combination with linear LFP recordings in head-fixed awake mice, the authors show striking differences of membrane potential responses in principal cells from the dentage gyrus, CA3 and CA1 sectors. They propose that switches between a dominant inhibitory excitable state and a disinhibited non-excitable state control the intra-hippocampal dynamics during UP/DOWN transitions. While data show clear trends and some of the conclusions are supported by the analysis, the authors may need to clarify some potential confounding which can actually impact interpretation.</p><p>1 – All the analysis is based in z-scored membrane potential responses but the mean resting membrane potential is never reported. For DG granule cells recorded in awake conditions, the membrane potential is usually hyperpolarized so that most of the effect may be due to reversed GABAA mediated currents. Similarly, for those cells exhibiting the non-expected polarization during UP/DOWN states there may be drifts around reversal potentials explaining their behavior. Moreover, regional trends on passive and active membrane parameters and connectivity can actually explain part of the variability. A longitudinal comparison of state Vm and spikes in Figure 5 suggests that some of the largest depolarized responses are not correlated with firing. Authors should evaluate this angle, ideally showing the distribution of membrane potential values across cells and regions and confronting this with the different membrane potential responses.</p><p>2 – While there are some trends for each hippocampal regions, there is also individual variability across cells during UP/DOWN transitions (Figure 5) and near ripples (Figure 6). What part of this variability can be explained by proximodistal and/or deep-superficial differences of cell location and identity? Can authors provide some morphological validation, even if in only a subset of cells? For CA3, proximodistal heterogeneity for intrinsic properties and entorhinal input responses are well documented in intracellular recordings both in vitro and in vivo. What is the location of CA3 cell contributing to this study? For CA1 cells, deep-superficial trends of GABAergic perisomatic inhibition and connectivity with input pathways dominate firing responses. Regarding DG cells, are all they from the upper blade?</p><p>3- AC-coupled LFP recordings cannot provide unambiguous identification of the sign of phasic CSD signals, because fluctuations accompanying UP/DOWN states alter the baseline reference. This is actually the case, given changes of membrane potential accompanying UP/DOWN transitions. I recommend reading Brankack et al., 1993 doi: 10.1016/0006-8993(93)90043-m. The authors should acknowledge this limitation and discuss how it could influence their results. One potential solution to get rid of this effect is using principal/independent component analysis for blind source separation.</p><p>Other important considerations:</p><p>4 – Following the previous comment, are all LFP signals recorded along CA1-DG? Since CSD currents should be estimated along the somatodendritic axis of cells receiving laminar input arrangements, it is possible that poor correlation with CA3 cell signals may reflect poor alignment with the corresponding input sources. Authors should try evaluating or discussing this confound.</p><p>5 – Figure 2 and the supplementary Figure 1 provide very interesting data integrating behavioral variables such as pupil diameter and eye blinks. It is unclear however whether this comes from a single experiment. It is also unclear how the pupil and eye blink dynamics was measured and evaluated. These figures establish the methods used to evaluate global variables, such as DG CSD signals, which are then correlated with single cell membrane potentials across figures, but no quantification is provided. If this is the result of a single experiment, then authors should consider replication in at least a subset of cases.</p><p>6 – There are some misconceptions regarding connectivity of different cell types. The claim that different fields receive similar inputs from entorhinal cortex may not be correct. The entorhinal inputs to DG and CA3a,b come from LII stellate cells, while excitatory inputs to CA1 are from layer II pyramidal cells (direct inputs) and layer III pyramidal cells (indirect through feedforward inhibition).</p><p>7 – One potentially controversial issue emerging from data is how could CA3 cells initiate sharp-wave ripples given they are mostly inhibited. Figure 8 provides a useful framework for discussion based on how dynamical fluctuations of modulatory influences and entorhinal inputs determine different regimes of excitability. The authors may want to consider two additional angles: that the sharp-wave ripples represent actually micro states emerging randomly from different generators. This could fit well with the idea that they reactivate several memory traces, and therefore there should not be a dominant initiator. In this context, inhibition plays major role in firing selectivity across the entire network. A second point is that state-dependent modulation in excitability could actually shift the ripple generator within a given region. While stochastic excitability fluctuations are more likely to trigger population bursts from the recurrently interconnected CA3 regions, the degree of connectivity follows a proximodistal distribution. Actually, circuit computation of proximal CA3c cells is more likely engaged in pattern separation whereas distal CA3a cells play more a pattern completion role. Similarly CA2 cells recurrently connected with CA3a cells may also trigger CA1 events. Hence, there is not such a marked difference between regions, but a biological continuum of intrinsic excitability, connectivity and computation.</p><p>Miscellaneous comments</p><p>8 – The title brings the focus to the intracellular dynamics around ripples while most of results are actually related to UP/DOWN states.</p><p>9 – Figure 2-sup.Figure 1B, is coherence expressed in absolute values? Since pupil diameter (magenta) and DG CSD magnitude are somehow anti-correlated one expect values from -1 to 1. Please, clarify.</p><p>10 – Figure 3 and 4, how are cell ranked in these two figures versus Figure 5 and 6? To ease interpretation it may be useful to use consistent ranking criteria across figures. Please, specify in captions. A side note here: cell variability within CA3 and CA1 as shown in Figure 3A3 and Fig6 may be reminiscent of proximodistal and/or deep-superficial trends reported previously. While authors may lack the ability too properly evaluate these effects (see point 2 above), it should be considered and discussed.</p><p>11 – In all figures reporting single cell data, please consider providing the N in captions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In order to fully evaluate the findings the data need to be presented in a more clear and accountable way and the analyses need to be extended.</p><p>The ripple onset is not a reliable enough marker, I would want to see all plots remade with the peak time for comparison.</p><p>The authors should show all the filled cells, intrinsic physiology, or something for each and every cell to make sure they are all the same type, healthy, etc, before claiming as such. The CA3 spiking plots around SWRs look like two types of cells. Is that the two principal types as described by Hunt et al? Or is one group interneurons, or sick principal cells?</p><p>Most of the paper is about UDS not SWRs: consider changing the title or focus.</p><p>Why aren't mice trained to be head fixed before the day of recording, as in other studies?</p><p>Why were the craniotomies not made at least 24 hours before recording so that you know there is no residual anesthesia?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Membrane potential values should be indicated for each intracellular recording in Fig. 1 and average Vm in UP and DOWN state should be reported for all recorded cell types (DGC, CA1 and CA3).</p><p>2) P8 “the behavior of the example cell in Figure 2B is surprising because CA3 receive nearly identical excitatory inputs as DG” I would downstate this statement because CA3 and DGCs are very different cell types notably DGC are electrically much more compact and inputs from EC contact them closer to the cell body and AIS. Furthermore, CA3 will receive concomitant inputs from DGCs during EC UP state which contact them through mossy fibers that have an overall inhibitory impact on CA3 pyramidal cell at low frequency because mossy fiber boutons strongly recruit feedforward inhibition through fillopoda extensions (Acsady et al., J Neurosci1998; Henze et al., Nat Neurosci 2002; Mori et al., Nature 2004).</p><p>3) The fact that Isomura et al., 2006 already reported a depolarization of CA3 pyramidal cells during EC DOWN state should be clearly acknowledged. From their paper: “In contrast to neo/paleocortical neurons, the maximum relative depolarizationof most CA3 cells coincided with the neocortical DOWN state.” and their Fig. 5A.</p><p>4) Could you report the number of recorded cells in each subfield in the main text and their passive/active electrical properties (firing threshold, input resistance, baseline Vm etc..)? Generally I think more numbers and P values should be reported throughout the manuscript.</p><p>5) P8 “ the majority of DG and CA1 cells” could you give actual numbers and proportion ? How was the positive/negative response of a neuron determined ? Did you used a specific threshold? Some correlations in CA1 (Fig 3. C3) occur with a large delay (2s) and are close to zero but yet are depicted as blue (negatively modulated) dots. How did you assess their significance? I think it is fair to acknowledge that CA1 pyramidal cells have a mixed coherence with DG CSD between that of DGCs and CA3 pyramidal cells.</p><p>6) Fig. 7A3 if average traces corresponding to small and big ripples are of different colors this should be specified in the legend. The black curves prevent seeing the curve associated to big ripple (I think) and statistical difference could be highlighted by horizontal bars at the top of the graph.</p><p>7) In the discussion “We observed pronounced modulation and spiking at the DOWN-UP transition in contrast to previous study” but Isomura et al., 2006 report an increase firing of CA3 pyramidal cells around the DOWN-UP transition under anesthesia (Fig. 5 D, E).</p><p>8) “DG activity is more similar to that in CA1 than in CA3” but the Vm profile with a sharp depolarization at the transition between DOWN-UP and then progressive hyperpolarization throughout the UP state is similar in CA3 and CA1 (Fig. 5D1).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69596.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The present study addresses the question of sharp wave-ripples initiation using patch-clamp recordings of principal cells in different hippocampal subfields (CA3, CA1 and the dentate gyrus – DG) combined with extracellular recordings in awake head-fixed mice as well as computational modeling.

Furthermore, we added Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 that includes the resting V<sub>m</sub> and proximodistal location of all cells in relation to their ripple modulation. This figure shows that the most depolarized cells tend to hyperpolarize most during ripples, consistent with the fact that these cells are furthest away from the GABAA reversal potential and experience the highest driving force. This trend was only statistically significant for CA3 neurons and no other significant trends were detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The recordings were done the same day as anaesthesia, leading to potential confounds when comparing with anaesthesia-free preparation.

Furthermore, there are discrepancies with previously reported findings using other techniques, especially regarding the firing of CA3 and CA1 neurons during ripples and the duration of UP and DOWN states. The study should discuss clearly why, and whether anaesthesia and/or the use of whole cell recording technique may explain these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The main surgery for implanting the head-fixation apparatus and marking the coordinates for multisite and pipette insertion was carried out at least two days before the experiment. On the day of the experiment animals were briefly lightly anesthetized (&lt;1 hr, at &lt;1% isoflurane at 1 lit/min) for the sole purpose of resecting the dura at the two sites for multisite probe and pipette insertion. This procedure was carried out on the same day as the experiment in order to minimize the time the brain was exposed and optimize the quality of the recordings. Experiments began at least six hours after this short procedure. Furthermore, animals were given time to get familiarized with the behavioral apparatus before recordings began and showed no signs of distress.</p><p>Previous studies show that about 95% of isoflurane is eliminated within minutes by exhalation (Holaday et al., 1975). The further elimination of isoflurane proceeds with a fast phase with half-time of about 7-9 min and a slower phase with half-time of about 100-115 min (Chen et al., 1992), with the faster phase reflecting elimination from the brain (Litt et al., 1991). Given these considerations there should be negligible residual isoflurane from the short anesthesia six hours later when recordings are initiated.</p><p>In order to further investigate whether the short and light anesthesia during the day of recordings has any effect on the results reported in the paper, we carried out additional experiments in which we performed the surgery, including dura removal, 3 days before the recording session. The animals were habituated under head-fixation on the spherical treadmill for two hour periods each of the two days following the surgery. On the third day after surgery, we carried out recordings without any surgical procedures or anesthesia. The durations of UP and DOWN states without same day anesthesia were similar to those obtained in our previous experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). The additional CA3 whole-cell recordings obtained in these new experiments have the same hyperpolarization features typical of our previous recordings. These additional experiments argue that the brief anesthesia on the day of recordings has no significant effect on the results.</p><p>The reviewers also refer to potential discrepancies in the firing of CA3 and CA1 cells during ripples and the duration of UP and DOWN states with respect to previous studies. The CA1 neurons in this study depolarize and elevate their firing around ripples, consistent with previous intracellular and extracellular recordings. Our study reveals hyperpolarization of the majority of CA3 cells while only a small fraction is depolarized around ripples. This is consistent with the sparse activation of CA3 around ripples previously reported with extracellular studies. The overall firing rate change of CA3 neurons around ripples is a balance between the firing rate elevation of the small subset of activated cells and the net decrease in firing across the rest of the population. Since the baseline firing rate of CA3 pyramidal neurons in quiet wakefulness and sleep is low, the ripple-associated inhibition may not be readily observable in the spiking of individual CA3 neurons due to a “floor effect”. The overall rate of CA3 neurons we record increases before ripple onset, consistent with previous extracellular studies (Figure 6D4). The subthreshold hyperpolarization of the majority of CA3 neurons provides novel insights into the mechanisms ensuring sparse and selective activation of the CA3 population around ripples.</p><p>During sleep and under anesthesia the transitions between UP and DOWN states are largely driven by internal brain dynamics as the role of external stimuli is minimized. The dwell times can be particularly consistent under anesthesia, although the exact values depend on the nature of the anesthetic agent and the depth of anesthesia (Torao-Angosto et al., 2021). In contrast, in quiet wakefulness the duration of UP and DOWN states will presumably be influenced also by the behavior of the animal, its attentional state, and external stimuli and therefore need not be the same as under anesthesia or sleep. Here we simply report the presence of UP-DOWN dynamics during quiet wakefulness. Whether or not the mechanisms responsible are the same or different than those operating under sleep and anesthesia remains to be seen, as the latter mechanisms themselves have not been fully identified. To provide validation that the extracted UP and DOWN states in quiet wakefulness indeed correspond to genuine brain states, we show that the pupil diameter and ripple rates, which are independently measured, are strongly modulated around the identified UP and DOWN states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The precise location of each neuron within each hippocampal subfield is also not reported. This is quite important as this may explain part of the variability observed near UP/DOWN transitions and around ripples.</p></disp-quote><p>We added figure 1 —figure supplement 3 that shows the locations of recorded neurons.</p><p>As described in point (2) above, we added Figure 5 —figure supplement 4 that includes the resting V<sub>m</sub> and proximodistal locations of all cells in relation to their UP-DOWN modulation. We did not detect any significant trends with respect to brain state modulation. Furthermore, we added Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 that includes the resting V<sub>m</sub> and proximodistal locations of all cells in relation to their ripple modulation. Again, we did not detect significant trends with regards to proximodistal location, although we would like to note that our recordings do not span the full proximodistal axis and may hence not be ideally suited to test the dependence of our results on proximodistal location.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is unclear why the ripple onset is used and not the more commonly used ripple peak. This will help compare the results with previously published papers in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a Figure 6 —figure supplement 2, which shows that the modulation around peak ripple power is the same as the modulation around ripple start, except for a small time shift due to the fact that ripple power peaks shortly after ripple start. Our focus on ripple onset facilitates characterizing the timing of pre-ripple activity, such as the V<sub>m</sub> depolarization observed before ripple onset for DG and CA1 neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The CSD analysis should be improved: in its present form, an absolute phase cannot be ascertained and the relationship with entorhinal/cortical inputs and ongoing animal's behavior should be clarified. Moreover, the average CSD around times of DOWN/UP transition and ripples should be reported. It is also unclear whether the coherence of the CSD in the DG and CA3 membrane potential is specific to slow frequencies or was observed across the frequency spectrum. Finally, baseline of CSD estimated from AC-coupled LFP can be misleading. Some of these issues can be addressed by using a blind source separation instead.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that the DC and very low frequency components of the CSD are not readily measured experimentally with silicon probes. The DC half-cell potential of metal microelectrodes is dominated by the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface and its magnitude (in the hundreds of millivolts) dwarfs normal brain signals. As the electrode-electrolyte interface is not stable, neither is the near-DC electrode potential and hence it cannot be easily filtered out or rejected even in DC-coupled recordings, although this approach has been successful for studying high-amplitude (tens of millivolts) LFP shifts associated with spreading depression (Nasretdinov et al., 2017).</p><p>With this consideration in mind, our understanding of the reviewers’ point is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. As the figure illustrates, although the low frequency component of the CSD is not directly measured with our AC-coupled recordings, the modulation of the magnitude of high-frequency transients can provide an envelope signal with arbitrarily low frequency content. Experimentally, we observe that the rate and magnitude of high frequency transients of the DG CSD is modulated by a low frequency (&lt; 1 Hz) “envelope” signal, which itself exhibits alternation between low and high levels, in accordance with previous publications (Isomura et al., 2006). Since the high frequency transients originate from postsynaptic activity due to EC input, high levels of the envelope signal indicate elevated EC activity (UP state), while low levels indicate reduced EC activity (DOWN state). In the original submission we referred to this envelope signal as “DG CSD magnitude”, which may have been confusing. In the revised manuscript we use “DG CSD activity” instead to remove any suggestion that the low frequency CSD was directly measured. We further validated that the extracted UP/DOWN states reflect modulation of pupil radius and ripple rate, quantities that are independently measured.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Deriving slow envelope signal from AC coupled recordings.</title><p>(A) In this example the true CSD signal contains both a slow component (8 Hz) and a fast component (80 Hz) that is amplitude modulated by the slow component. Such phase-amplitude coupling is well known between theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus. The true CSD shows a current sink with time-varying magnitude. (B) The power spectral density (PSD) estimate of the signal in (A) shows both the slow (8 Hz) and fast (three peaks near 80 Hz) components. (C) Assume LFP recordings are obtained with a high-pass filter that has eliminated the slow component. Consequently, the estimated CSD signal contains only fast fluctuations. Furthermore, instead of a time-varying current sink it shows quickly alternating sinks and sources (both negative and positive values). The slow component can be visualized as the amplitude envelope (interrupted red line) of the signal. (D) PSD estimate shows that the slow component is absent from the extracted CSD signal. (E) Rectifying the CSD estimate (black) and then filtering (red) approximately recovers the true slow component (red interrupted). This is how the DG CSD activity signal is obtained.

Since we patch multiple cells in each experiment it is not possible to unequivocally determine their depth within the cell layer, although it is possible to confirm that they are granule cells or pyramidal cells in experiments where all labeled cells are principal neurons (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). In addition, we added Figure 1 —figure supplement 3 that shows the proximodistal locations of recorded cells. With respect to the DG cells 20/22 are from the upper blade, with only two granule cells recorded in the lower blade (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3).</p><p>We added Figure 5 —figure supplement 4 that includes the resting V<sub>m</sub> and proximodistal location of each cell as a function of UP-DOWN modulation. We did not detect any significant trends with respect to UDS modulation.</p><p>In addition, we added Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 that includes the resting V<sub>m</sub> and proximodistal location of each cell as a function of ripple modulation. This figure shows that the most depolarized CA3 cells tend to hyperpolarize most during ripples, consistent with the fact that these cells are furthest away from the GABAA reversal potential and experience the highest driving force. No other significant trends were detected, although we would like to note that our recordings do not span the full proximodistal axis and may hence not be ideally suited to test the dependence of our results on proximodistal location.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3- AC-coupled LFP recordings cannot provide unambiguous identification of the sign of phasic CSD signals, because fluctuations accompanying UP/DOWN states alter the baseline reference. This is actually the case, given changes of membrane potential accompanying UP/DOWN transitions. I recommend reading Brankack et al., 1993 doi: 10.1016/0006-8993(93)90043-m. The authors should acknowledge this limitation and discuss how it could influence their results. One potential solution to get rid of this effect is using principal/independent component analysis for blind source separation.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the inherent limitations of AC-coupled recordings in regards to CSD analysis (Brankack et al., 1993). However, we do not believe these limitations affect our analysis or results for the reasons illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Specifically, we do not attempt to measure the low frequency (&lt; 1 Hz) CSD content directly. Instead, we extract the envelope of the rectified fast CSD transients. In the original submission we referred to this envelope signal as “DG CSD magnitude”, which may have been confusing. In the revised manuscript we use “DG CSD activity” instead to remove any suggestion that the low frequency CSD signal was directly measured. Notice that because of the rectification step the envelope signal is insensitive to the actual polarity of the fast transient CSD fluctuations. Using the envelope, we identify UP states as time periods when the rate and amplitude of EC input current transients, rather than the DC level, increases, in accordance with previous publications (Isomura et al., 2006). We further validated that the extracted UP/DOWN states reflect modulation of pupil diameter and ripple rate, quantities that are independently measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other important considerations:</p><p>4 – Following the previous comment, are all LFP signals recorded along CA1-DG? Since CSD currents should be estimated along the somatodendritic axis of cells receiving laminar input arrangements, it is possible that poor correlation with CA3 cell signals may reflect poor alignment with the corresponding input sources. Authors should try evaluating or discussing this confound.</p></disp-quote><p>All LFP signals are recorded along CA1-DG in the same way across all experiments: the location of the multisite extracellular probe is fixed across experiments, while the patch pipette target changes for experiments targeting different subfields. Hence, the resulting CSD signals are similar across experiments providing a common reference against which membrane potential changes across the subfields are evaluated. The correlations between CA3 V<sub>m</sub> and CSD signals in DG are just as strong as the correlations between CA1 and DG V<sub>m</sub> and CSD signals, but of opposite polarity (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 – Figure 2 and the supplementary Figure 1 provide very interesting data integrating behavioral variables such as pupil diameter and eye blinks. It is unclear however whether this comes from a single experiment. It is also unclear how the pupil and eye blink dynamics was measured and evaluated. These figures establish the methods used to evaluate global variables, such as DG CSD signals, which are then correlated with single cell membrane potentials across figures, but no quantification is provided. If this is the result of a single experiment, then authors should consider replication in at least a subset of cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We extended the analysis of the coherence of V<sub>m</sub> with DG CSD across the datasets (new Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we added Figure 2 —figure supplement 2, which includes analysis of the rate of occurrence of ripples and blinks as a function of UP and DOWN states across datasets. Finally, we added Figure 2 —figure supplement 3 with analysis of pupil diameter across datasets and a methods section on how pupil diameter was measured. The relationships shown in Figure 2, S1B,D of the previous submission are consistent across the datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 – There are some misconceptions regarding connectivity of different cell types. The claim that different fields receive similar inputs from entorhinal cortex may not be correct. The entorhinal inputs to DG and CA3a,b come from LII stellate cells, while excitatory inputs to CA1 are from layer II pyramidal cells (direct inputs) and layer III pyramidal cells (indirect through feedforward inhibition).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that different sets of EC cells project to DG, CA3, CA1 which need not have similar firing properties. Given these considerations we removed characterization of EC inputs to DG, CA3, and CA1 as “similar” in the text, as this was not essential for any of the scientific arguments of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7 – One potentially controversial issue emerging from data is how could CA3 cells initiate sharp-wave ripples given they are mostly inhibited. Figure 8 provides a useful framework for discussion based on how dynamical fluctuations of modulatory influences and entorhinal inputs determine different regimes of excitability. The authors may want to consider two additional angles: that the sharp-wave ripples represent actually micro states emerging randomly from different generators. This could fit well with the idea that they reactivate several memory traces, and therefore there should not be a dominant initiator. In this context, inhibition plays major role in firing selectivity across the entire network. A second point is that state-dependent modulation in excitability could actually shift the ripple generator within a given region. While stochastic excitability fluctuations are more likely to trigger population bursts from the recurrently interconnected CA3 regions, the degree of connectivity follows a proximodistal distribution. Actually, circuit computation of proximal CA3c cells is more likely engaged in pattern separation whereas distal CA3a cells play more a pattern completion role. Similarly CA2 cells recurrently connected with CA3a cells may also trigger CA1 events. Hence, there is not such a marked difference between regions, but a biological continuum of intrinsic excitability, connectivity and computation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the discussion to further describe how inhibition may play a role in enhancing firing selectivity and the reactivation of distinct memory traces. We have also added discussion of the potential effects of the proximodistal location, depth, and baseline membrane potential in the diversity of UDS and ripple modulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Miscellaneous comments</p><p>8 – The title brings the focus to the intracellular dynamics around ripples while most of results are actually related to UP/DOWN states.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title to: “Up-Down states and ripples differentially modulate membrane potential dynamics across DG, CA3, and CA1 in awake mice”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9 – Figure 2-sup.Figure 1B, is coherence expressed in absolute values?

While authors may lack the ability too properly evaluate these effects (see point 2 above), it should be considered and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figures 3, 4, 6, and 7 cells from each area are ordered the same way: by the first principal component coefficient of the ripple-triggered average (RTA) response matrices displayed in Figure 6A3,B3,C3 (RTA rank) In Figure 5 cells are ordered by the first principal component coefficient of the UP-DOWN state (UDS) mean V<sub>m</sub> matrices (UDS rank) displayed in Figure 5A1,B1,C1.

We further added Figure 1 —figure supplement 1, which provides examples of morphological information for our recordings, and Figure 1 —figure supplement 2, which shows examples of bursts from morphologically identified neurons. All the cells we patched in CA3 exhibit complex bursts with comparable levels of bursting propensity (Figure 1 —figure supplements 4). The properties of morphologically identified cells in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 are typical of all recorded cells (morphologically identified neurons from Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 are shown as diamonds in Figure 1—figure supplement 4, while the rest are shown as dots).

On the day of the experiment animals were briefly lightly anesthetized (&lt;1 hr, at &lt;1% isoflurane at 1 lit/min) for the sole purpose of resecting the dura at the two sites for multisite probe and pipette insertion. This procedure was carried out on the same day as the experiment in order to minimize the time the brain was exposed and optimize the quality of the recordings. Experiments began at least six hours after this short procedure. Furthermore, animals were given time to get familiarized with the behavioral apparatus before recordings began and showed no signs of distress.</p><p>Previous studies show that about 95% of isoflurane is eliminated within minutes by exhalation (Holaday et al., 1975). The further elimination of isoflurane proceeds with a fast phase with half-time of about 7-9 min and a slower phase with half-time of about 100-115 min (Chen et al., 1992), with the faster phase reflecting elimination from the brain (Litt et al., 1991). Given these considerations there should be negligible residual isoflurane from the short anesthesia six hours later when recordings are initiated.</p><p>In order to further investigate whether the short and light anesthesia during the day of recordings has any effect on the results reported in the paper, we carried out additional experiments in which we performed the surgery, including dura removal, 3 days before the recording session. The animals were habituated under head-fixation on the spherical treadmill for two hour periods each of the two days following the surgery. On the third day after surgery, we carried out recordings without any surgical procedures or anesthesia. The durations of UP and DOWN states without same day anesthesia were similar to those obtained in our previous experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). The additional CA3 whole-cell recordings obtained in these new experiments have the same hyperpolarization features typical of our previous recordings. These additional experiments argue that the brief anesthesia on the day of recordings has no significant effect on the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Membrane potential values should be indicated for each intracellular recording in Fig. 1 and average Vm in UP and DOWN state should be reported for all recorded cell types (DGC, CA1 and CA3).</p></disp-quote><p>We now indicate the membrane potential values in Figure 1.

Furthermore, CA3 will receive concomitant inputs from DGCs during EC UP state which contact them through mossy fibers that have an overall inhibitory impact on CA3 pyramidal cell at low frequency because mossy fiber boutons strongly recruit feedforward inhibition through fillopoda extensions (Acsady et al., J Neurosci1998; Henze et al., Nat Neurosci 2002; Mori et al., Nature 2004).</p></disp-quote><p>We removed characterizations of EC inputs to DG and CA3 as “similar” from the text, as this was not essential for any of the results.
