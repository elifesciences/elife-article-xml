Although the refractoriness of persistent cell populations has classically been attributed to growth-inactive cells generated before drug exposure, evidence is accumulating that actively growing cell fractions can also generate persister cells. However, single-cell characterization of persister cell history remains limited due to the extremely low frequencies of persisters. Here, we visualize the responses of over one million individual cells of wildtype <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to lethal doses of antibiotics, sampling cells from different growth phases and culture media into a microfluidic device. We show that when cells sampled from exponentially growing populations were treated with ampicillin or ciprofloxacin, most persisters were growing before antibiotic treatment. Growing persisters exhibited heterogeneous survival dynamics, including continuous growth and fission with L-form-like morphologies, responsive growth arrest, or post-exposure filamentation. Incubating cells under stationary phase conditions increased both the frequency and the probability of survival of non-growing cells to ampicillin. Under ciprofloxacin, however, all persisters identified were growing before the antibiotic treatment, including samples from post-stationary phase culture. These results reveal diverse persister cell dynamics that depend on antibiotic types and pre-exposure history.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibiotic persistence</kwd><kwd>single-cell analysis</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>stationary phase</kwd><kwd>phenotypic heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/jpmjcr1927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/jpmjer1902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM097356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kussell</surname><given-names>Edo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24H00552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Time-lapse analyses of millions of antibiotic-stressed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> characterize the diverse single-cell dynamics of persister cells that depend on antibiotics, culture conditions, and pre-exposure history.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibiotics are potent chemotherapeutic substances that are heavily relied upon to counter bacterial infectious diseases. Nonetheless, bacterial cells often circumvent elimination and continue to survive under antibiotic exposure by acquiring genetic changes to enhance their resistance or tolerance, or by producing less susceptible phenotypic variants. Bacterial persistence is a phenomenon in which a small subset of cells in an isogenic cell population survives for a prolonged period under exposure to lethal doses of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levin and Rozen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dhar and McKinney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jayaraman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaban, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maisonneuve and Gerdes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kester and Fortune, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van den Bergh et al., 2017</xref>). The phenomenon occurs across a wide range of combinations of bacterial species and antibiotics, including clinically important pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van den Bergh et al., 2017</xref>), such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomez and McKinney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dhar and McKinney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keren et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lechner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Levin, 2013</xref>), and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liebens et al., 2014</xref>), and consequently, it has been recognized as a global health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomez and McKinney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levin and Rozen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dhar and McKinney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jayaraman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van den Bergh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since the first elaboration of persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bigger, 1944</xref>), growth-arrested cells generated before drug exposure (often referred to as ‘dormant cells’) have been thought to be responsible for the persistence of cellular populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levin and Rozen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dhar and McKinney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jayaraman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaban, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maisonneuve and Gerdes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kester and Fortune, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van den Bergh et al., 2017</xref>). This explanation of persistence was based on the observations that most antibiotics were ineffective to bacterial cell populations under growth-inhibiting conditions, such as low temperature, low nutrients, and presence of bacteriostatic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bigger, 1944</xref>). Persistence caused by such prior exposure to stressful environments is now called <italic>triggered persistence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balaban et al., 2019</xref>). However, examining this hypothesis by directly observing individual cell lineages is challenging due to extremely low frequencies of surviving cells (typically 10<sup>−6</sup>-10<sup>−3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keren et al., 2004</xref>]). Consequently, the observation is limited to high persistence mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Svenningsen et al., 2019</xref>), to naturally high-persisting combinations of bacterial species and drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019</xref>), or to conditions that significantly increase the frequencies of surviving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bamford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakshi et al., 2021</xref>). Several studies have suggested that persistence occurs without growth-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019</xref>). For example, Wakamoto et al. conducted single-cell observation of persistence of <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> against isoniazid (INH), revealing that the surviving cells grew normally before drug exposure and also grew slowly under drug exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Using a cell-sorting assay, Orman and Brymildsen showed that even the fast-growing fraction of an exponentially growing <italic>E. coli</italic> population produced cells that survived lethal doses of ampicillin and ofloxacin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orman and Brynildsen, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen showed by single-cell observation that <italic>E. coli</italic> persisters against ofloxacin in exponential cultures were dividing normally before exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019</xref>). These results imply that bacterial persistence occurs even without growth-arrested cells generated prior to antibiotic treatment.</p><p>To investigate how different dynamics of survival to antibiotic treatment emerge at the single-cell level depending on the past growth history, culture media, and antibiotics, we visualized the response of more than 10<sup>6</sup> individual cells to antibiotics exposure utilizing a microfluidic device and analyzed the persistence of wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> (MG1655 strain), one of the best-studied model systems of bacterial persistence. We reveal that most of the surviving cells for which we could identify the single-cell history were growing actively before drug exposure when cell populations sampled from exponential phase were exposed to the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam ampicillin (Amp) or the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (CPFX). In the case of Amp treatment, these growing persister cells showed heterogeneous responses to treatment, ranging from cells that stopped growing after the first division under drug exposure to those that continued to grow and divide with L-form-like morphological changes. When cells were sampled from stationary phase, allowed to regrow in the microfluidic device with fresh medium flowing for several hours, and treated with an antibiotic drug, most persister cells that gave rise to proliferating progeny cell populations were derived from the non-growing cell fraction in the case of Amp. However, in the case of CPFX treatment, all persister cells for which we identified the single-cell history were growing before treatment. Therefore, by tracking persister cells before and after antibiotic exposure under different conditions, we reveal multiple survival dynamics underlying antibiotic persistence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MCMA device reveals single-cell dynamics of persister cells</title><p>To visualize the dynamics of low-frequency persister cells, we used a microfluidic device equipped with a membrane-covered microchamber array (MCMA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were enclosed in the 0.8-µm deep microchambers etched on a glass coverslip by covering microchambers with a cellulose semipermeable membrane via biotin-streptavidin bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoue et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> cells grow in a monolayer and form two-dimensional microcolonies in the microchambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).

We sampled cells from the second pre-culture at the pre-determined time points for each experiment (exponential phase, early stationary phase, and late stationary phase, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

RpoS is a specialized sigma factor controlling the general stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Battesti et al., 2011</xref>). We originally constructed the MF1 strain to study the correlation between the expression levels of RpoS and the persister trait at the single-cell level. However, a previous report clearly demonstrated that the fluorescent fusion of RpoS is functionally defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patange et al., 2018</xref>). We also confirmed this functional issue of RpoS of MF1; although the dependence on growth phase and culture media of RpoS-mCherry expression was similar to that characterized previously using <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lange and Hengge-Aronis, 1994</xref>), this strain was significantly more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative stress than MG1655 and as sensitive as the MG1655 Δ<italic>rpoS</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, we considered MF1 as a strain with impaired RpoS function. Despite this difference, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Amp and CPFX were almost identical between MG1655 and MF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The population killing curves of the MG1655 and MF1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) exhibit biphasic or multiphasic decay when exponentially growing cell populations are treated with 200 µg/mL of Amp (12.5×MIC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> for the growth curves of these strains) or with 1 µg/mL of CPFX (32×MIC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), confirming that these <italic>E. coli</italic> strains exhibit persistence against these antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balaban et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of Amp treatment, the frequency of surviving cells of MG1655 was higher than that of MF1 up to 3 h of treatment, but became lower in the treatment longer than 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) due to the delayed shift of the decay rate. Similarly, in the case of CPFX treatment, the frequency of surviving cells of MG1655 was slightly higher than that of MF1 up to 1 h, but then became lower at least up to 7 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results confirm that intact RpoS function is not a prerequisite for the occurrence of persistence, but may affect the frequency of surviving cells and the timing of the decay rate shift.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows examples of single-cell observation of persister cells using the MCMA device. In this observation, we monitored 110–170 microchambers with a 100× objective in each time-lapse experiment to observe individual cells of the MF1 strain sampled from exponential-phase batch cultures (‘post-exponential phase’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) with a high spatial resolution. After initial pre-culturing periods of 1.5 h without Amp in the device, we exposed cell populations to 200 µg/mL of Amp for 3.5 h. The Amp exposure lysed most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). However, we detected two persister cells that survived and regrew after the Amp exposure in the ten repeated experiments conducted with the MCMA device. Interestingly, one of the persister cells of MF1 grew and divided actively before the Amp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In response to the Amp exposure, the cell radically changed its cell morphology from a rod shape to a round shape with membrane blebbing and transitted to an L-form-like cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Errington et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The other persister cell of MF1 exhibited no growth and division before and during the Amp exposure and restarted growth after drug removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This sequence of growth behavior is consistent with the expected survival dynamics for persistence caused by pre-existing non-growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>). The expression levels of RpoS-mCherry were low in all the observed cells, including the persister cells characterized above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>).

With this change in the cell sample preparation procedure, the expected frequency of long-lagging cells at the time of Amp treatment becomes approximately 10<sup>−8</sup>, which is well below the detection limit of our single-cell measurements (see Methods).

The analysis reveals heterogeneous responses of growing persisters of MG1655 to Amp exposure. For example, the growing persister shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> suppressed growth and stopped division after the first division under the exposure to Amp.

Cell body fission also continued during Amp exposure and gradually restored normal rod shape through multiple fissions after drug removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The other persister cells exhibited intermediate behavior between these two, with growth and cell body deformation in some time periods and growth suppression in other time periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, some of the L-form-like cells crawled around like amoeba cells within the microchambers, detaching and leaving some parts of their cell bodies behind (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Furthermore, rod-shaped regrowing cell populations emerged even from the small and left-behind cell bodies (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

These cells may eventually regrow as persisters with long lags after drug removal or may not be able to regrow due to deepened dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bollen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bollen et al., 2025</xref>). In fact, it has been shown by the single-cell measurements with a mother machine microfluidic device that the time to regrowth after drug removal is heterogeneous among non-growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakshi et al., 2021</xref>). These late regrowers are detectable in the killing curve assay but not in the single-cell measurements with the MCMA microfluidic device due to the overgrowth of the early regrowers. Consequently, our single-cell measurements may underestimate the frequency of persister cells in the population sampled from late stationary phase. However, this potentially overlooked fraction of persister cells are also non-growing persisters; the predominance of non-growing persisters in the post-late stationary phase cell population is unchanged.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-79517-video15.mp4" id="video15"><label>Video 15.</label><caption><title>Viability check of the non-regrowing non-growing cells by PI staining (6-h Amp exposure).</title><p>This movie shows the time-lapse observation of the post-late stationary phase cells of MG1655/pUA66-P<sub>rpsL</sub>-<italic>gfp</italic> in LB medium.

Since the persisters in the post-early stationary phase cell populations contained growing persisters, albeit at a low frequency, and all the persisters detected in the post-exponential phase cell populations were growing persisters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the true frequencies of non-growing persisters under these conditions should be lower than the points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, especially for the post-exponential phase condition.

Our results show that the presence of growing persisters is not limited to the cell populations placed under well-controlled exponential growth conditions for prolonged periods, depending on the antibiotic type.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-79517-video18.mp4" id="video18"><label>Video 18.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse observation of 10 representative persister cells in the post-late stationary phase cell populations of MG1655 exposed to 1 µg/mL CPFX for 6 h in M9.</title><p>This movie shows 10 representative persister cells observed in one of the single-cell measurements of the post-late stationary phase cells of MG1655 exposed to 1 µg/mL CPFX for 6 h in M9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

After the removal of CPFX, the persister cells resumed growth and many of them became filamentous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Videos 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">17</xref>). The filamentous cells restarted cell divisions and produced normal-sized, and normally growing and dividing, progeny cells. The observed post-exposure filamentation dynamics of persister cells are consistent with what was reported for <italic>E. coli</italic> persisters against another fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ofloxacin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019</xref>). On the other hand, we found another type of persister cells that resumed normal growth and division without showing prominent filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, extensive filamentation after CPFX treatment is not necessarily required to restore normal growth and division in persister cells.</p><p>In addition, comparison of the pre-exposure division rate showed no significant difference between growing persisters of MG1655 (0.94±0.06 doublings/h) and non-surviving cells (0.86±0.03 doublings/h; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.12, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Thus, MG1655 persisters to CPFX grow as fast as non-surviving cells prior to drug exposure. This result is again consistent with the results observed for the persistence of post-exponential phase <italic>E. coli</italic> cell populations against ofloxacin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Like genetically mutated resistant or tolerant bacteria, phenotypic variants of bacteria that arise in isogenic cell populations and cause persistence also pose a threat to global human health by reducing the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, the survival of persister cells under prolonged antibiotic treatment provides time for bacteria to develop genetic mutations that lead to irreversible antibiotic resistance. Therefore, understanding how individual persister cells evade the deleterious effects of antibiotics is critical to counteracting persister cells. However, due to the extremely low frequency of persister cells in cellular populations, direct visualization of their dynamics is still limited to a handful of cases.</p><p>Time-lapse single-cell observations with the MCMA microfluidic device enable direct visualization of persister cells existing at extremely low frequencies in isogenic bacterial cell populations. Single-cell measurements with this device revealed that actively growing cells produced persisters predominantly when Amp was applied to post-exponential phase cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Frequencies of non-growing persisters increased in the cellular populations sampled from the early and late stationary phases in LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we detected only growing persisters when CPFX was applied to post-exponential and post-late stationary phase cell populations in M9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results show that, as previously suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zou et al., 2021</xref>, multiple survival modes are available for <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to achieve persistence not only against different antibiotics but even against the same drug. Furthermore, distinct survival modes can coexist within a single persistent cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In such cases, population-based analyses on bacterial persistence with an assumption of a single underlying mechanism would provide blurred results and bias our understanding of the phenomenon.</p><p>Despite the relatively high medium exchange rate in the MCMA device, we cannot exclude the possibility that a small amount of antibiotic may remain in the device, for example due to non-specific adsorption on the internal surface of the microchambers. The residual antibiotics may influence the physiological state of the cells and the regrowth kinetics in the post-exposure periods, even if they are present at concentrations significantly lower than the MICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davies et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Hughes, 2014</xref>). However, the frequencies of persister cells in the cell populations in our single-cell measurements are comparable to those in the batch culture measurements. Therefore, the removal of antibiotics in our device is at least as efficient as in the batch culture assay.</p><p>It is of note that the presence of growing persisters was not limited to the cell populations placed under prolonged exponential growth conditions, which are rarely found in natural contexts. In the CPFX treatment, all persister cells for which we identified their pre-exposure growth traits were also growing persisters in the post-late stationary phase conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This result contrasts with what has been reported for persistence to ofloxacin, where only non-growing persisters were detected when ofloxacin was exposed to the post-stationary phase cell populations after 7 h of pre-exposure incubation in fresh medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen, 2019</xref>). The experimental conditions such as antibiotics (ofloxacin or CPFX), culture media (MOPS medium or M9 medium), and microfluidic device types were different between these studies, which may have caused the difference in the dominant survival modes. Although the reasons for the discrepancy in observations against similar fluoroquinolone antibiotics remain elusive, our result suggests that growing persisters may be relevant to the survival of cell populations under a wide range of conditions, including natural and clinical settings.</p><p>The coexistence of multiple survival modes within a single cell population may be related to the killing curves fitting better to a triphasic exponential decay than to a biphasic exponential decay under several conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). In general, two qualitatively different scenarios can generate such multiphasic killing curves: (1) the presence of multiple types of persister cells in the cell populations and (2) the antibiotic-induced increase in refractoriness of surviving cells during treatment. The observation of killing curves with more than two killing phases is not limited to our study. Svenningsen et al<italic>.</italic> have reported multiphasic killing curves for <italic>E. coli</italic> exposed to CPFX for 7 days and have suggested the contributions of different intracellular programs to the survival in different killing phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Svenningsen et al., 2022</xref>). Although the two scenarios mentioned above are not mutually exclusive, elucidating the contribution of these qualitatively different processes would be crucial for identifying the key events underlying the persistence of cell populations against antibiotics.</p><p>Interestingly, some of the growing persisters against Amp exhibited radical morphological changes and transitioned to the cell shapes that resemble L-form or spheroplast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A–D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C and D</xref>). L-form bacteria are deficient in cell walls but can sustain growth and division under osmoprotective conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Errington et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chikada et al., 2021</xref>). L-form cells can be produced by treating bacteria with exogenous lytic enzymes or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam antibiotics under osmoprotective conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chikada et al., 2021</xref>). It is known that L-form bacteria are resistant to most antibiotics targeting cell wall synthesis, particularly <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf67"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Errington et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, if the L-form-like cells produced by the Amp exposure could manage to protect themselves from osmotic pressure, they might be able to persist for an extended period under the Amp exposure. Importantly, the coexistence of non-walled spherical persisters and non-spherical rod-shaped persisters has also been reported for <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> cells treated with a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf68"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam antibiotic, meropenem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zou et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the emergence and survival of L-form or spheroplast-like persisters may be widespread in the persistence to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf69"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam antibiotics. Since L-form cells are often found as antibiotic-resistant organisms and isolated from humans and animals in infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2009</xref>), this survival mode might be relevant to clinical settings. However, we also remark that such L-form-like cells did not appear upon CPFX exposure. Therefore, the transitions to L-form-like cells might be the general characteristics of growing persisters against Amp and other <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf70"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam antibiotics, but these would not apply to the other non-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf71"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam antibiotics.</p><p>Relatedly, Männik et al<italic>.</italic> reported the emergence of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with aberrant cell shapes when cells are forced to pass through channels whose height or width is smaller than the cell width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Männik et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to the L-form-like cells observed in our measurements, these aberrant cells are also able to grow and divide and restore the rod shape after 1–2 days. Thus, the transition to aberrant cell shapes can be induced both physically and chemically, but <italic>E. coli</italic> cells can maintain not only viability but also proliferative capacity against such various perturbations. This resilience to changes in cellular morphology may have contributed in part to the survival of growing persisters against Amp. In the MCMA device, <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were enclosed in chambers with a depth comparable to the cell width by a semipermeable cellulose membrane. Therefore, although Amp exposure would be the direct trigger of the morphological changes, the spatial confinement of the chambers may also have promoted the cell shape transition.</p><p>The result that the incubation under stationary phase conditions enhanced the survivability of non-growing cells against Amp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) indicates that the states of non-growing cells were not identical across the growth phases, as suggested previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pu et al., 2016</xref>. It is noteworthy that in our experiments, a different dominant survival mode of persister cells was observed for the post-early and post-late stationary phase cell populations than for the post-exponential phase cell populations, despite the 2 h pre-exposure cultivation in fresh LB medium. Therefore, 2 h of incubation in fresh medium is not sufficient to erase the memory of the previous stationary phase conditions. Relatedly, the dominant survival modes were different between post-exponential and post-early stationary phase conditions despite the comparable frequency of persister cells in the cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This suggests that the susceptibility of actively growing cells to Amp also depends on the previous cultivation condition; actively growing cells in the post-exponential phase cell populations are more likely to produce persister cells than those in the post-early stationary phase cell populations.</p><p>The role of RpoS, a specialized sigma factor that controls the general stress response, in antibiotic persistence has been debated and no consistent conclusion has been reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valencia et al., 2024</xref>). Comparing the results between the wildetype strain MG1655 and the RpoS-defective strain MF1 may provide insight into this issue. Our results suggest that RpoS affects the frequency of persister cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as the population dynamics in the presence of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The effect of retaining intact RpoS can be both positive and negative depending on the culture conditions and antibiotics. For example, in the post-late stationary phase cell populations in LB and post-exponential phase in M9, the RpoS-deficient MF1 strain consistently contained fewer surviving cells than the MG1655 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, under the other conditions examined in this report, the frequency of surviving cells was higher in MF1 than in MG1655 at the end of prolonged drug exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results confirm the differential importance of intact RpoS function and again suggest that multiple factors contribute to antibiotic persistence.</p><p>As demonstrated here, our MCMA device can detect the persister cells existing at frequencies of 10<sup>−5</sup> within a cellular population. This is the order at which one can detect persisters in most combinations of bacterial species and antibiotics, including clinically important ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spoering and Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Levin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomez and McKinney, 2004</xref>). Although our analysis is limited to two types of antibiotics, multiple survival modes have been characterized in <italic>E. coli</italic> persistence. Therefore, it would be crucial to unravel how individual cells of each bacterial species persist to different types of antibiotics under different conditions. Direct single-cell observations would unmask the diversity of persistence mechanisms and might enable rational designs of antibiotic treatments against bacterial infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>E. coli</italic> strains and culture conditions</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> strains MG1655 and MF1 (MG1655 <italic>rpoS-mcherry</italic>/pUA66-P<sub>rpsL</sub>-<italic>gfp</italic>) were mainly used in this study. pUA66-P<sub>rpsL</sub>-<italic>gfp</italic> is a low-copy plasmid taken from the <italic>E. coli</italic> promoter library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref>).

A small piece of an LB or M9 agarose block (2% (w/v) agarose) was placed on the cellulose membrane and incubated at 37°C for 15 min to allow the membrane to adhere to the coverslip surface tightly. After removing the agarose block, a PDMS pad was attached to the coverslip via a Frame-Seal Incubation Chamber (9 mm×9 mm, 25 µL internal volume; or 15 mm×15 mm, 65 µL internal volume, Bio-Rad).

We also flowed the liquid conditioned medium while registering the microchamber positions to maintain the growth-suppressive conditions.

In this protocol, cell populations enter stationary phase in the first pre-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This stationary phase cell culture is diluted in fresh medium to a cell density corresponding to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.005 in the case of LB condition. For the experiment with MF1, we typically incubated this cell culture for 2.5 h at 37°C with shaking for the post-exponential phase condition. We maintained growth conditions while loading cells into the MCMA device by placing LB agarose block at 37°C and while registering microchamber positions for time-lapse measurements by flowing fresh LB medium into the device at 37°C. This preparation step before the time-lapse measurements took approximately 1.5 h. The pre-exposure period in the time-lapse measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) was 1.5 h. In total, cells were placed under exponential growth conditions for approximately 5.5 h prior to Amp exposure.

This sets the upper bound for the fraction of lagging cells. In addition, not all lagging cells can produce persister cells. Therefore, the probability of finding non-growing persister cells coming from the lagging cell fraction in our experimental setup is low.</p><p>To further eliminate such long lagging cell fractions, we also performed experiments in which the second pre-culture was started from a 1000-fold diluted inoculum and the duration of the second pre-culture was extended by 3.5 h to allow the cell population to reach the same cell density in the exponential phase as in the standard post-exponential phase cell populations described above. This change in the pre-culture procedure reduces the frequency of long lagging cells by a factor of 1000 at the time of Amp treatment, and the probability of detecting non-growing persisters from long-lagging cells becomes virtually zero in our experimental setup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Image analysis</title><p>We used a custom Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) macro to analyze the time-lapse images acquired with the 40× objective or the 100× objective.

Typically, persisters are rare cells and only very few have been directly observed in non mutated strains. Therefore, the current work adds an important contribution by mapping a higher numbers of persisters and by convincingly identifying different persister phenotypes. The main conclusions are along previous reports, namely that persisters under β-lactams are mainly non-growing cells from stationary conditions, but if cultures are carefully kept away from stationary phase conditions, the few residual persisters observed in this study display different phenotypes involving growing cells and L-forms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79517.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Balaban</surname><given-names>Nathalie Q</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qxff017</institution-id><institution>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution></institution-wrap><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Julou</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02s6k3f65</institution-id><institution>University of Basel</institution></institution-wrap><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.28.466227">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.28.466227v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Julou (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers have done a thorough work in pointing out the ways to address major weaknesses, and these should be seriously addressed. In particular:</p><p>1) As the reviewers point out, it seems that important data has not been analyzed, which would shed new light on the persister's physiology: whether the non-dormant persister cells do grow during the antibiotic treatment or arrest their growth, whether there is a higher probability within a lineage to persist, etc. More generally, a more quantitative analysis of the different modes of survival is needed in order to represent more than an incremental contribution to previous observations of growing persisters.</p><p>2) The data on the problematic RpoS reporter should be either taken out or validated: is RpoS functional and how is the reporter itself affecting the growth and survival?</p><p>3) The methods should be more detailed, especially the history of the culture before the persister assays. Emphasis should be put on whether the dormant cells may be from lagging bacteria, as a few hours are not enough to get rid of all lagging bacteria.</p><p>4) Specific comments of the reviewers regarding to reference to literature that considers also non-dormant persisters.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– For example, there is no data on whether the non-dormant persister cells do grow during the antibiotic treatment or arrest their growth. Additional quantifications on the number of non-dormant persister that make L-forms, arrest their growth upon antibiotic exposure, or continue to grow may add some insight into the different mechanisms of survival.</p><p>– One main comment is that the authors claim at several instances in the text that the community attributes persistence mainly to dormant cells and their observations contradict this view. First, it has been recognized early on that not all persister cells are dormant; second, by following the type of persister bacteria that they observe along the growth curve, the authors show, in agreement with previous results, that very &quot;clean&quot; conditions are needed to obtain more not-dormant persisters than dormant ones. This means that the authors actually support the common view, which is that non-dormant persisters can be found, but in typical conditions, dormant ones will be more common.

The question is whether the fusion is functional or disrupts the activity of RpoS and makes the cells RpoS-. The authors should test whether RpoS is still functional. An easy assay is to measure the survival of the strain in the presence of 20 mM H2O2 in a minimal M9 medium with glucose. An RpoS- strain shows a decrease in survival in these conditions. The authors might also repeat some experiments with an RpoS defective strain or a RpoS+ strain (depending on the genotype of the strain used) to test whether RpoS does influence persistence in their experimental settings.</p><p>To validate the RpoS fusion, the authors should also provide some data regarding the increase of RpoS levels as a function of growth by simply measuring fluorescence at the population level. The expectation is that fluorescence will increase as a function of time.</p><p>I might have missed the details of the methods used by the authors to eliminate the carryover of the long-lagging dormant cells in exponential growing populations. This should be added or better explained. In this experiment, the authors observed spontaneous dormant cells without any apparent trigger. What is the author's hypothesis? Are these cells dead, were they growing at some point during the experiment and stopped growing, or do they show some detectable levels of RpoS? What would be the mechanism(s)?</p><p>The section 'non-dormant persisters are dominant even in minimal medium'. I'm not sure why the authors added 'even'. What were their expectations?</p><p>In the experiment in M9 minimal medium, the authors used 200 ug/mL of ampicillin and treated it for 6h. What is the reason? In Figure S4 the authors also used 200 ug/mL of ampicillin while in the experiments presented before 100 ug/mL was used as far as I understand.</p><p>In the section on the stationary phase, the authors found many dormant cells that did not PI stained. The authors conclude that they are probably viable and did not regrow during the time cells were observed under the microscope. The question here is whether those cells could be dead even if they do not PI stained? Do these cells contain high RpoS levels?</p><p>Ref 23 cited in this section is a BioRxiv manuscript, I don't know if it can be cited.</p><p>The next section starts with the measurement of dormant cells in the different conditions tested and provides an equation to predict the frequency of surviving cells after treatment. Although I'm not competent to judge the equation, the conclusion reached by the authors is that the longer in the stationary phase the better sit is for the survival of ampicillin. Some papers from the Tenson group came to this conclusion and should be cited e.g. Luidalepp et al. J. Bact 2011; Joers and Tenson, Sci Rep 2016; Joers et al. J Bact 2010. It would certainly be interesting to discuss these data in light of the present single-cell analysis.</p><p>Dormant cells from the late stationary phase express high levels of RpoS that seem to form aggregates. Although it's plausible, it would be nice to show some evidence. The authors could try the IbpA fusion that colocalizes with aggregates – recently published by the group of Aertsen (Govers et al., PLoS Biol 2018). The assumption here is that in the early or late stationary phase, the cells with the highest RpoS levels are not the persisters and that RpoS is aggregated in those cells. What is the idea? Do aggregates somehow prevent cells to regrow after the ampicillin treatment? Are these cells dead? Are the RpoS-specific aggregates somehow toxic? Or is it a general phenomenon evidenced here by the RpoS fluorescent fusion? In other words, if the authors use another fluorescent marker reporting a protein highly expressed in the stationary phase, will they observe the same phenomenon.</p><p>In any case, it would be interesting to characterize these cells further and link the data with those presented in other papers, e.g. several papers from the Michiels group that link aggregates and persistence (Dewachter et al., mBio 2021; Bollen et al., Front Mol Biosci 2021).</p><p>Figure 4F is not clear, the red dots are barely visible.</p><p>The last section deals with persistence to ciprofloxacin and parallels the data observed by Goormaghtigh and Van Melderen Ref 20.

It is important for the reader that this phase is long enough, so it should be mentioned in relevant places.</p><p>Several semantic issues:</p><p>The word dormant is used here for &quot;which has not restarted growing during the 2 h in LB before the treatment&quot;. This type of growth arrest where cells are already exposed to fresh media but not yet regrowing (hence more likely to have resumed some metabolic activity) is almost universally referred to as &quot;lag&quot; and this would be a much more appropriate wording. Dormancy is a more loosely defined term that seems to imply for most people a prolonged growth arrest.</p><p>The authors often refer to persister lineages – in general one rather likes to think of persister cells which each give rise to a lineage (where most cells are expected to be sensitive).</p><p>The article is mostly about persistence to ampicillin which does not represent all antibiotics, hence the title and writing would benefit from being toned down.</p><p>The rationale for fitting the killing curve in Figure 1A with a triple exponential is unclear.</p><p>By comparing Figure 3B and 3C, it is remarkable that the shortest lags in Late Stationary are shorter than the shortest lags in Early Stationary which is very counter-intuitive and likely to point to an experimental issue. In addition, the mode of the elongation rate for growing cells in Figure 3E is lower than in Figure 3D and 3F which is also unexpected.</p><p>In contrast to most manuscripts I review, this manuscript was exceptionally well proofread and features virtually no typos. I only spotted &quot; the same protocol as for growth curve measurements&quot; (p. 17), as well as the caption of Supp Video 11.</p><p>Coming back to the first major concern expressed in the Public Review, I explain hereafter why I believe that &quot;dormant&quot; cells are expected to possibly be in very different states in different conditions (i.e. they do not have the same state in terms of gene expression, nor of metabolic state). I also comment on what is expected following Balaban et al. 2019; note that I assume for this that the state leading to spontaneous persistence also happens after the stationary phase and that persisters in the stationary phase can hence be decomposed into spontaneous and triggered. Importantly this has not been established and another description might well be more relevant. The 4 main conditions studied here are:</p><p>Exponential (diluted):</p><p>Preculture: 6 h growth in LB after ~5e5x dilution (hence 15-16 divisions) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: 1.5 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment. This condition is designed specifically to get rid of non-growing cells which might have been carried over from the last stationary phase; hence only spontaneous persistence is expected.</p><p>Exponential:</p><p>Preculture: 2.5 h growth in LB after ~500x dilution (hence 6-7 divisions) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: same (1.5 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment). Given the relatively low dilution factor from the overnight culture, one expects a mixture of spontaneous persistence and possibly some triggered persistence carried over from the last stationary phase.</p><p>Early Stationary:</p><p>Preculture: 8 h growth in LB after ~500x dilution (hence 4 h in stationary phase) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: 2 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment. Since most cells restart growing during the 2 h in LB at the start of the assay (Figure 3E), one does not expect tolerance by lag to play a role; however since cells divide only 1 to 3 times since the last stationary phase, triggered persistence is expected to occur at a higher frequency than spontaneous persistence.</p><p>Late Stationary:</p><p>Preculture: 24 h growth in LB after ~500x dilution (hence 20 h in stationary phase) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: same (2 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment). For a quarter of the population that has not exited the lag during the 2 h in LB at the start of the assay (Figure 3F), tolerance by lag is expected to be the main mode of survival. For the other three quarters, triggered persistence is expected to happen at a higher frequency than spontaneous persistence (note that the rate is probably different from Early Stationary).</p><p>Overall non-growing cells seen in Exponential (diluted) are expected to be only due to &quot;bad luck&quot; (Levin, Concepción-Acevedo, and Udekwu 2014). For the Exponential condition, non-growing cells are expected at a similar frequency due to &quot;bad luck&quot;, as well as possibly due to carry over from the previous stationary phase (very long lag); note that such carryover doesn't seem to change the frequency of growing and non-growing persisters (Figure 1 of this review).</p><p>In the Early Stationary condition, most cells have restarted growing only recently hence some proteins/metabolites involved in persistence are expected at a higher level, which will lead to triggered persistence. Finally growing cells in the Late Stationary condition have spent longer in the stationary phase, which means that other proteins/metabolites might be present and/or at higher levels; this manifest in their longer lags before restating growing in LB (visible from the higher fraction of non-growing cells after 2 h).</p><p>Regarding Late Stationary, I anticipate that the authors may claim that it cannot correspond to tolerance since the killing curve (yellow in Figure 2B) doesn't display a decrease in the initial death rate which is the hallmark of tolerance. I indeed don't know how to reconcile this observation with Figure 3F which shows that 26% of the population is still in the lag phase after the stationary phase; however since this high fraction stands as the main difference between Early Stationary (Figure 3E) and since non-growing bacteria are notoriously less sensitive to β-lactams such as ampicillin, one can only be tempted to hypothesize that these cells are indeed tolerant. In fact, I would like to suggest that maybe the killing curve would look completely different for Late Stationary (but not for the other 2 conditions) if prolonged far beyond the lag time of this strain out of the stationary phase.</p><p>Balaban, N.Q. et al.

In particular:</p><p>1) As the reviewers point out, it seems that important data has not been analyzed, which would shed new light on the persister's physiology: whether the non-dormant persister cells do grow during the antibiotic treatment or arrest their growth, whether there is a higher probability within a lineage to persist, etc. More generally, a more quantitative analysis of the different modes of survival is needed in order to represent more than an incremental contribution to previous observations of growing persisters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the important suggestion.</p><p>To address this issue, we have included more detailed analyses of single-cell dynamics of growth and cell shape over the course of pre-exposure, exposure, and post-exposure periods (Figure 2D and H, Figure 4B and D, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 and 2, Figure 5B and D, Figure 5 —figure supplement 1, Figure 8B and D, and Figure 8 —figure supplement 1). As a result, we show not only the presence of persister cells that were growing normally prior to the antibiotic treatment, but also their heterogeneous growth response to the treatment. For example, in the case of ampicillin (Amp) treatment, some cells continue to grow and undergo multiple rounds of cell body fission with L-form-like morphologies and return to normal rod shapes after drug removal (Figure 4D); some other cells suppressed their growth significantly typically after the first divisions during the Amp treatment (Figure 4B); and the other cells exhibited the growth behaviors between these two, with intermittent growth and growth arrest (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). Furthermore, the transition to L-form-like morphologies also occurred during the process of regaining normal growth in the postexposure period. Thus, the new analysis reveals the heterogeneous growth and cell shape dynamics induced by Amp treatment among the persisters growing before the Amp treatment.</p><p>In the case of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) treatment, many persister cells became filamentous after the treatment (Figure 8A and B), as previously reported for a similar fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ofloxacin (ref. 20). However, we also identified surviving cells that resumed normal division after the treatment without becoming filamentous (Figure 8C and D). Although it is a correlated phenotype, post-treatment filamentation is not always required for persister cells to regain normal growth.</p><p>We also quantified and compared the pre-treatment division rates between the persister cells growing prior to antibiotic treatments and the non-surviving cells. Although the persister cells of MG1655 against Amp treatment tended to be slow growers in the post-exponential phase cell populations in M9 medium compared to non-survivors (Figure 5E), such a trend was not observed for the other conditions under which we detected growing persister cells (post-exponential phase in LB medium against Amp and post-exponential phase in M9 medium against CPFX) (Figure 4E and 8E). Therefore, growing persister cells of MG1655 found in these treatment conditions appear to circumvent the fitness trade-off in the antibiotic-free environments.</p><p>We believe that the additional detailed information on single-cell dynamics obtained for different strains, growth phases, and antibiotics presented in the revised manuscript would be valuable to the field and advance our understanding of antibiotic persistence. For further details, please see our point-by-point replies to the specific comments by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data on the problematic RpoS reporter should be either taken out or validated: is RpoS functional and how is the reporter itself affecting the growth and survival?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the problem with the RpoS reporter. As suggested by reviewer 2, we have tested the functionality of RpoS by evaluating its sensitivity to H2O2 oxidative stress. We found that the reporter strain MF1 is significantly more sensitive to oxidative stress than the wildtype (MG1655) and as sensitive as the ∆<italic>rpoS</italic> strain (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Although the induction of RpoS in the MF1 strain followed similar kinetics reported previously (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A and B, ref. 32), the result of the oxidative stress test suggests that the RpoS functions are impaired.</p><p>After confirming the problem with the reporter strain, we repeated almost all the experiments with the MG1655 strain. As shown, the main results and conclusions are unchanged, such as the dominance of persisters growing normally before antibiotic treatment in the post-exponential phase cell populations (Figure 3 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1), L-form-like morphological changes by Amp treatment in persisters growing normally before treatment (Figure 4C and 5C), and changes in the dominant survival modes against Amp treatment depending on the sampling growth phases (Figure 3 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>Although the functional problem of the RpoS reporter was confirmed, we decided to keep and present most of the results of the MF1 strain, except those on the correlations between RpoS expression level and survival, because the results are informative and indicate that intact RpoS function is not a prerequisite for the occurrence of antibiotic persistence against Amp and CPFX, but affects the killing kinetics of the cell population and the frequency of persister cells in the populations (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). Indeed, when the population killing curves of the post-exponential and post-early stationary phase cultures are compared between the MG1655 and MF1 strains, the number of surviving cells of MG1655 against Amp treatment is initially larger than that of MF1, but becomes smaller with prolonged exposure (&gt; 3 h) (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B). On the other hand, the number of surviving cells of MG1655 is consistently larger than that of MF1 for the postlate stationary phase cell populations (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B). These results demonstrate both positive and negative contributions of RpoS regulation to antibiotic persistence. We believe this information is of interest to the field and have decided to include the results from the MF1 strain in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The methods should be more detailed, especially the history of the culture before the persister assays. Emphasis should be put on whether the dormant cells may be from lagging bacteria, as a few hours are not enough to get rid of all lagging bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>More detailed methods have been added to the main text. In particular, to clarify the history of the culture before the persister assay with the MCMA microfluidic device, an illustration of the sample preparation and experimental procedure that was shown as a supplementary figure in the original manuscript has been moved to a main figure (Figure 1C and D). In addition, we have added an illustration of the sample preparation for the killing curve assay in batch cultures (Figure 6A).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that non-growing cells in the post-early stationary and post-late stationary phase cultures should be referred to as “lagging cells” rather than “dormant cells.” Since all cells were maintained in a non-growing state by the corresponding stationary phase conditioned medium until the start of the time-lapse measurement in the post-early stationary and post-late stationary phase conditions, non-growing cells found in these experiments are by definition lagging cells that failed to rapidly resume growth. We now explicitly state this in Results (L294-297).</p><p>In the original manuscript, we technically referred to the cells that did not grow and divide before the antibiotic treatments as “dormant cells,” but we agree that the term may be confusing because we did not distinguish truly metabolically inactive dormant cells from the other forms of non-growing cells. Therefore, we now avoid referring to these non-growing cells as “dormant cells” throughout this paper. Accordingly, we have changed the title of this paper from “Observation of non-dormant persister cells reveals diverse modes of survival in antibiotic persistence” to “Observation of persister cell histories reveals diverse modes of survival in antibiotic persistence”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Specific comments of the reviewers regarding to reference to literature that considers also non-dormant persisters.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Introduction to more appropriately place this research in the context of previous studies regarding the contribution of non-dormant cells to antibiotic persistence, based on the specific comments of reviewers 1 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– For example, there is no data on whether the non-dormant persister cells do grow during the antibiotic treatment or arrest their growth. Additional quantifications on the number of non-dormant persister that make L-forms, arrest their growth upon antibiotic exposure, or continue to grow may add some insight into the different mechanisms of survival.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion of an important analysis. To address this issue, we have analyzed the single-cell growth dynamics of both growing and non-growing persister cells in more detail and found heterogeneous dynamics of growing persisters during the exposure and post-exposure periods. In LB, some growing persisters against Amp in the post-exponential phase cell populations continued growth and cell body fission with L-form-like cell shapes, while some other growing persisters stopped growing after the first division under Amp exposure. The other growing persisters exhibited dynamics between these two, with intermittent growth and growth arrest (Figure 4A-D, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, and Video 4). Furthermore, L-form-like cell body fission (division) was also observed in these growing persister cells during the processes of regaining normal rod shape and growth pattern. The responses of growing persisters to Amp treatment in M9 were also heterogeneous, with some cells continuing to grow and divide with Lform-like cell shape and the other cells suppressing their growth to varying degrees (Figure 5, Figure 5 —figure supplement 1, and Video 8). We found that many cells exhibited L-form-like cell body fission as they regained normal cell shape and division pattern. In addition, we found growing persisters that became filamentous after drug removal (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 and Video 8), as observed in the growing persisters against CPFX. These results are now included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Due to the difficulty in clearly distinguishing these different dynamics, we have decided that it is not possible to accurately quantify the frequencies of the different patterns of growing persister cell dynamics at this time. Instead, we show all single-cell dynamics of persister cells as figure supplements to provide information on the heterogeneity of the dynamics. Investigating whether these different persister cell dynamics are underpinned by different molecular mechanisms is an interesting and important question, but we have concluded that identifying these mechanisms is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– One main comment is that the authors claim at several instances in the text that the community attributes persistence mainly to dormant cells and their observations contradict this view. First, it has been recognized early on that not all persister cells are dormant; second, by following the type of persister bacteria that they observe along the growth curve, the authors show, in agreement with previous results, that very &quot;clean&quot; conditions are needed to obtain more not-dormant persisters than dormant ones. This means that the authors actually support the common view, which is that non-dormant persisters can be found, but in typical conditions, dormant ones will be more common. Therefore, it is advised to re-phrase those claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these important comments.</p><p>Regarding the first point, we have modified the Introduction and many other sections to place our study in a more appropriate context based on the previous studies demonstrating the contributions of growing persisters.</p><p>Regarding the second point, to address whether very “clean” conditions are needed to obtain more growing persisters than non-growing ones, we performed additional experiments to expose CPFX to post-late stationary phase cell populations in M9 and found that all persisters for which we could identify their pre-exposure growth trait were growing persisters. This result suggests that the dominance of growing persisters is not necessarily limited to clean conditions and may depend on the type of antibiotics and conditions. We now present this new result in Figure 3 and Video 18 and have also added a discussion to the main text (L490-502).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors mention &quot;persister lineages&quot; while the observation is of only one bacterium each time surviving the antibiotic treatment.

However, in the newly added experiments with the MG1655 strain, we identified one such pair of persister cells to Amp in the postexponential phase cell populations in M9 medium (growing persister cell 1 in Figure 5B and growing persister cell 4 in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). Given the extremely low frequency of persister cells, the chance of observing such a surviving pair is almost negligible if the survival fate is independent for all cells. Therefore, the fact that we observed such a pair in this observation suggests that the fate of persister cells may have a lineage correlation. However, our observation is limited to one example, and verification of this speculation requires single-cell analysis at much higher throughput. We have now mentioned this result and the limitation of the current analysis in the main text (L251-261).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Umetani et al. is interesting and provides additional support to early observations showing that persister cells can arise from actively growing cells.

The question here is whether these non-growing persisters were generated in the stationary phase of the first pre-culture from the glycerol stock, or whether they resumed growth in the second pre-culture but stopped growing before the start of the time-lapse experiment (see Figure 1C and D for the sample preparation procedure).</p><p>Our sample preparation procedure for the time-lapse microscopy with the MCMA device consisted of the following pre-culture steps:</p><p>1. First pre-culture: 5 µL of the glycerol stock was inoculated into 2 mL of fresh LB medium and incubated at 37°C with shaking for 15 hours. During this first pre-culture, the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell population entered stationary phase.</p><p>2. Second pre-culture: A cell suspension from the first preculture was reinoculated into LB medium with the initial cell density adjusted to OD600 = 0.005. This second pre-culture sample was incubated at 37°C with shaking for 2.5 hours. After 2.5 hours, cell populations are in exponential phase.</p><p>3. Loading of cells into microchambers and on-device pre-culture prior to Amp treatment: Cells in the exponential phase in the second pre-culture was taken and enclosed in the microchambers. Immediately after sealing the microchambers with a semipermeable cellulose membrane, we started to flow LB medium in the microfluidic device, keeping the temperature at 37°C. We kept the LB medium flowing in the device while registering the image acquisition positions, as well as after starting the time-lapse observation of individual cells prior to Amp treatment. Typically, approximately three hours elapsed from the time cells were sampled from the second pre-culture to the start of Amp treatment.</p><p>Following this procedure, since the cell populations were placed under growing conditions in LB medium for approximately 5.5 hours prior to Amp treatment, the lagging cell fraction present at the beginning of the second pre-culture should have reduced its relative frequency in the cell population to ~2<sup>-16</sup> = ~10<sup>-5</sup>. In addition, not all lagging cells can produce persister cells. Therefore, the probability of finding non-growing persister cells coming from the lagging cell fraction in our experimental setup is low.</p><p>However, to further eliminate such long-lagging cell fraction, we modified the sample preparation step (2) and started the second pre-culture from a 1000-fold lower initial inoculum and extended the duration of the second pre-culture by ~3.5 hours so that the cell population reaches the same cell density in the exponential phase when cells are sampled in the step (3). This change in the pre-culture procedure reduces the frequency of long-lagging cells by a factor of 1000 at the time of Amp treatment, and the probability of detecting non-growing persisters from long-lagging cells becomes virtually zero in our experimental setup. Nevertheless, we still found an approximately equal fraction of non-growing persisters, suggesting that these persisters were not from the longlagging cell fraction and that they were generated during the second pre-culture, cell loading, or image acquisition position registration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section 'non-dormant persisters are dominant even in minimal medium'.

Although it's plausible, it would be nice to show some evidence. The authors could try the IbpA fusion that colocalizes with aggregates – recently published by the group of Aertsen (Govers et al., PLoS Biol 2018). The assumption here is that in the early or late stationary phase, the cells with the highest RpoS levels are not the persisters and that RpoS is aggregated in those cells. What is the idea? Do aggregates somehow prevent cells to regrow after the ampicillin treatment? Are these cells dead? Are the RpoS-specific aggregates somehow toxic? Or is it a general phenomenon evidenced here by the RpoS fluorescent fusion? In other words, if the authors use another fluorescent marker reporting a protein highly expressed in the stationary phase, will they observe the same phenomenon.</p><p>In any case, it would be interesting to characterize these cells further and link the data with those presented in other papers, e.g. several papers from the Michiels group that link aggregates and persistence (Dewachter et al., mBio 2021; Bollen et al., Front Mol Biosci 2021).</p><p>Figure 4F is not clear, the red dots are barely visible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is very interesting to test the co-localization between RpoS aggregates and IbpA aggregates in the non-growing cells in late stationary phase.

In our experiments, we observed cells after antibiotic treatments for typically 12 hours in LB and 24 hours in M9. However, we also note that when cells begin to regrow rapidly after treatment, their progeny fill the chamber by growth and eventually push up the semipermeable membrane covering the chambers. As a result, they grow into the neighboring chambers and prevent further observation of the neighboring chambers. In this case, we had to stop observing the invaded chambers earlier than the above-mentioned durations. We now clarify the duration of observation after antibiotic treatments in the corresponding sections of Results (L128-133) and Methods (L817-819 and L824-827) and mention the limitation caused by the progeny of rapidly growing cells where we first introduce the experimental procedure with the MCMA device (L128-133).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several semantic issues:</p><p>The word dormant is used here for &quot;which has not restarted growing during the 2 h in LB before the treatment&quot;.

We have corrected these typos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Coming back to the first major concern expressed in the Public Review, I explain hereafter why I believe that &quot;dormant&quot; cells are expected to possibly be in very different states in different conditions (i.e. they do not have the same state in terms of gene expression, nor of metabolic state). I also comment on what is expected following Balaban et al. 2019; note that I assume for this that the state leading to spontaneous persistence also happens after the stationary phase and that persisters in the stationary phase can hence be decomposed into spontaneous and triggered. Importantly this has not been established and another description might well be more relevant. The 4 main conditions studied here are:</p><p>Exponential (diluted):</p><p>Preculture: 6 h growth in LB after ~5e5x dilution (hence 15-16 divisions) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: 1.5 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment. This condition is designed specifically to get rid of non-growing cells which might have been carried over from the last stationary phase; hence only spontaneous persistence is expected.</p><p>Exponential:</p><p>Preculture: 2.5 h growth in LB after ~500x dilution (hence 6-7 divisions) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: same (1.5 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment). Given the relatively low dilution factor from the overnight culture, one expects a mixture of spontaneous persistence and possibly some triggered persistence carried over from the last stationary phase.</p><p>Early Stationary:</p><p>Preculture: 8 h growth in LB after ~500x dilution (hence 4 h in stationary phase) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: 2 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment.</p><p>Since most cells restart growing during the 2 h in LB at the start of the assay (Figure 3E), one does not expect tolerance by lag to play a role; however since cells divide only 1 to 3 times since the last stationary phase, triggered persistence is expected to occur at a higher frequency than spontaneous persistence.</p><p>Late Stationary:</p><p>Preculture: 24 h growth in LB after ~500x dilution (hence 20 h in stationary phase) from overnight culture (5 to 10 h in stationary phase).</p><p>Assay: same (2 h growth in LB followed by 3.5 h treatment).</p><p>For a quarter of the population that has not exited the lag during the 2 h in LB at the start of the assay (Figure 3F), tolerance by lag is expected to be the main mode of survival. For the other three quarters, triggered persistence is expected to happen at a higher frequency than spontaneous persistence (note that the rate is probably different from Early Stationary).</p><p>Overall non-growing cells seen in Exponential (diluted) are expected to be only due to &quot;bad luck&quot; (Levin, Concepción-Acevedo, and Udekwu 2014). For the Exponential condition, non-growing cells are expected at a similar frequency due to &quot;bad luck&quot;, as well as possibly due to carry over from the previous stationary phase (very long lag); note that such carryover doesn't seem to change the frequency of growing and non-growing persisters (Figure 1 of this review).</p><p>In the Early Stationary condition, most cells have restarted growing only recently hence some proteins/metabolites involved in persistence are expected at a higher level, which will lead to triggered persistence. Finally growing cells in the Late Stationary condition have spent longer in the stationary phase, which means that other proteins/metabolites might be present and/or at higher levels; this manifest in their longer lags before restating growing in LB (visible from the higher fraction of non-growing cells after 2 h).</p><p>Regarding Late Stationary, I anticipate that the authors may claim that it cannot correspond to tolerance since the killing curve (yellow in Figure 2B) doesn't display a decrease in the initial death rate which is the hallmark of tolerance. I indeed don't know how to reconcile this observation with Figure 3F which shows that 26% of the population is still in the lag phase after the stationary phase; however since this high fraction stands as the main difference between Early Stationary (Figure 3E) and since non-growing bacteria are notoriously less sensitive to β-lactams such as ampicillin, one can only be tempted to hypothesize that these cells are indeed tolerant. In fact, I would like to suggest that maybe the killing curve would look completely different for Late Stationary (but not for the other 2 conditions) if prolonged far beyond the lag time of this strain out of the stationary phase.</p><p>Balaban, N.Q. et al.

I hence believe that the authors are very well-positioned to propose a much more compelling interpretation of their experimental data. In particular, one would like to see a quantitative analysis of the different modes of survival. This probably requires measuring two additional datasets for Early Stationary and Late Stationary in order to disentangle tolerance from triggered persistence, namely the distributions of lag durations until bacteria restart growing in fresh media, as well as the killing curves (directly in Stationary Phase, not after 2h of growth in LB). By combining those, it will be possible to test whether the observed levels of survival can be interpreted as mixtures of tolerance and persistence, as well as to quantify the difference in frequency of triggered persistence for Early Stationary and Late Stationary. Such an analysis has the potential to be an important contribution to the field by shaping its conceptual framework more clearly, which will very likely require modifying it (one can for instance debate the nature of the continuum between triggered persistence and tolerance).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for summarizing the results under different conditions and explaining the reasoning behind the previous comments.</p><p>As mentioned in our response to comment (1), we agree that non-growing cells observed under different conditions in our single-cell experiments could be in different states; we did not intend to assume that they were of the same type. We also note that we were aware of the recently introduced classification of persisters into &quot;triggered&quot; and &quot;spontaneous&quot; (Balaban, et al., 2019).</p><p>Although the reviewer's reasoning described above may be correct, it is practically difficult to conclusively classify the observed persisters into triggered and spontaneous ones at the singlecell level without making assumptions. As mentioned by the reviewer above, spontaneous persister formation can also occur in stationary phase. In addition, the factors contributing to the formation of persisters may be diverse. Therefore, in general, it would be difficult to conclude whether the persisters might have been generated by some triggers or spontaneously, without additional information regarding the intracellular molecular events leading to the formation of persisters at the single-cell level. Distinguishing tolerance by lag and different survival modes of non-growing cells is also challenging at the single-cell level because of the graded nature of tolerance among lagging cells and also among persister cells. We agree with the reviewer that it is important and intriguing to uncover the deeper diversity behind the simple classification of nongrowing and growing persisters, and that we are well positioned to address this important question. However, we have concluded that this would go beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation for the next version of the manuscript:</p><p>Figure 1 would be clearer if the titles of panels F and I would be moved up to panels D and G.
