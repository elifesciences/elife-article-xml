Treatment options are limited, and patient’s 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. The ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28) has been implicated in tumourigenesis through its stabilization of the oncoproteins c-MYC, c-JUN, and Δp63. Here, we show that genetic inactivation of <italic>Usp28</italic>-induced regression of established murine LSCC lung tumours. We developed a small molecule that inhibits USP28 activity in the low nanomole range. While displaying cross-reactivity against the closest homologue USP25, this inhibitor showed a high degree of selectivity over other deubiquitinases. USP28 inhibitor treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in c-MYC, c-JUN, and Δp63 proteins levels and consequently induced substantial regression of autochthonous murine LSCC tumours and human LSCC xenografts, thereby phenocopying the effect observed by genetic deletion. Thus, USP28 may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of squamous cell lung carcinoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>squamous cell lung

death worldwide. Based on histological criteria, lung cancer can be subdivided into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the rarer small cell lung cancer. The most common NSCLCs are lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), with large cell carcinoma being less commonly observed. Progress has been made in the targeted treatment of LADC, largely due to the development of small-molecule inhibitors against EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cardarella and Johnson, 2013</xref>). However, no targeted treatment options exist for LSCC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirsch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Novello et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, despite having limited efficacy on LSCC patient survival, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of current LSCC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fennell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Isaka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scagliotti et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel druggable targets for LSCC treatment and to develop novel therapeutics.</p><p>The <italic>Fbxw7</italic> protein product F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBW7) is the substrate recognition component of an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase, which targets several well-known oncoproteins, including c-MYC, NOTCH, and c-JUN, for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). These oncoproteins accumulate in the absence of FBW7 function, and genetic analyses of human LSCC samples revealed common genomic alterations in <italic>Fbxw7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kan et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, FBW7 protein is undetectable by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 69% of LSCC patient tumour samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>). Genetically engineered mice (GEM) harbouring loss of <italic>Fbxw7</italic> concomitant with <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> activation (KF mice) develop LSCC with 100% penetrance and short latency, as well as LADC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, FBW7 is an important tumour suppressor in both human and murine lung cancer.</p><p>The deubiquitinase USP28 opposes FBW7-mediated ubiquitination of the oncoproteins c-MYC and c-JUN, thereby stabilizing these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Popov et al., 2007</xref>). In a murine model of colorectal cancer, deleting <italic>Usp28</italic> reduced size of established tumours and increased lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diefenbacher et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, targeting USP28 in order to destabilize its substrates represents an attractive strategy to inhibit the function of c-MYC and other oncogenic transcription factors that are not amenable to conventional inhibition by small molecules.</p><p>Here, we describe the characterization of a novel USP28 inhibitory compound (USP28i) and the genetic as well as chemical validation of USP28 as a promising therapeutic target for LSCC tumours. Using an Frt-Flp and Cre-LoxP dual recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schönhuber et al., 2014</xref>), we show that <italic>Usp28</italic> inactivation in established LSCC results in dramatic tumour regression. Importantly, USP28i treatment recapitulates LSCC regression in both mouse models and human LSCC xenografts. Absence or inhibition of USP28 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the protein levels of c-MYC, c-JUN, and Δp63, providing a potential mechanism of action for USP28i. Therefore, USP28 inhibition should be a strong candidate for clinical evaluation, particularly given the paucity of currently available therapy options for LSCC patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>USP28 is required to maintain protein levels of c-MYC, c-JUN, and Δp63 in LSCC</title><p>To gain insights into the molecular differences between LADC and LSCC, we investigated the expression of MYC in these common NSCLCs subtypes. MYC was transcriptionally upregulated in human LSCC compared to healthy lung tissue or LADC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis on an independent set of primary human lung biopsy samples confirmed that MYC is highly expressed in LSCC tumours compared with normal lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In addition, a positive correlation between <italic>USP28</italic> copy-number and mRNA expression was found in the same datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, qPCR and IHC analysis on human LSCC samples revealed that low <italic>USP28</italic> mRNA levels correlated with low USP28 protein levels and likewise, high/moderate mRNA levels also correlated with high USP28 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Since USP28 is involved in Δp63, c-JUN, and c-MYC stabilization and higher expression of USP28 is associated with a significantly shorter survival time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prieto-Garcia et al., 2020</xref>), we targeted its expression. <italic>Usp28</italic> downregulation by shRNA resulted in a significant reduction in c-MYC, c-JUN, and Δp63 protein levels in LSCC primary tumour cells and reduced LSCC cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Thus, targeting USP28 in order to destabilize its substrates represents a rational strategy to target tumour cells that rely on oncogenic transcription factors that are currently not druggable by small molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation of a pre-clinical dual recombinase lung cancer mouse model</title><p>Recently, <italic>Usp28</italic> was shown to be required for the initiation of lung tumours in the <italic>Rosa26-Cas9</italic> sgRNA <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>; Trp53; Lkb1</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prieto-Garcia et al., 2020</xref>). However, a meaningful pre-clinical model requires targeting the therapeutic candidate gene in existing growing lung tumours. Thus, to assess the function of <italic>Usp28</italic> in established tumours, we developed a new GEM model to temporally and spatially separate tumour development from target deletion by using two independent recombinases: FLP and CreERT. In this model, LSCC and LADC formation is initiated by <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> activation and <italic>Fbxw7</italic> deletion using FLP recombinase, and the Cre-loxP system can then be used for inactivation of <italic>Usp28<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> in established tumours.

KFCU tumour development was monitored by computed tomography (CT) scans. At 10–11 weeks post-infection with FLP recombinase-expressing recombinant adenoviruses, animals displayed lesions in their lungs. At this time point, we confirmed by histology that KFCU mice develop both LADC and LSCC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>), KFCU LADC lesions occurred in alveolar tissue and were positive for SFTPC and TTF1. KFCU LSCC tumours occurred mainly in bronchi (rarely manifesting in the alveolar compartment) and expressed CK5 and Δp63. Next, animals displaying lung tumours were exposed to tamoxifen to activate the CreERT protein and delete the conditional <italic>Usp28</italic> floxed alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Although the loss of USP28 expression decreased LADC tumour size, it did not reduce the number of LADC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). In contrast, histological examination of KFCU mice revealed a clear reduction in the numbers of LSCC lesions in <italic>Usp28</italic>-deleted lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As well as a significant reduction in tumour number, the few CK5-positive LSCC lesions that remained were substantially smaller than control tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Measurement of the size of 429 individual KFCU LSCC tumours (326 vehicle-treated and 103 tamoxifen-treated) showed an average size of 11.4 × 10<sup>4</sup> μm<sup>2</sup> in the vehicle arm versus 4.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> μm<sup>2</sup> in the tamoxifen arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

A small-molecule discovery campaign based on the ubiquitin-rhodamine cleavable assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Turnbull et al., 2017</xref>) yielded a panel of compounds sharing a thienopyridine carboxamide chemical scaffold with inhibitory selectivity for USP28 and USP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guerin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guerin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zablocki et al., 2019</xref>).

To confirm FT206 cellular target engagement, we used a Ub activity-based probe (ABP) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clancy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panyain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Turnbull et al., 2017</xref>). ABPs can assess DUB enzyme activity in a cellular context. DUB inhibition leads to displacement of the ABP, resulting in a molecular weight shift measurable by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against USP28/25. Using this approach, we found that the compound FT206 interferes with USP28/25 probe labelling (USP-ABP versus USP) in LSCC H520 cell extracts (EC<sub>50</sub> ~300–1000 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and intact cells (EC<sub>50</sub> ~1–3 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast to FT206, AZ1, a different USP28 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wrigley et al., 2017</xref>), based on a benzylic amino ethanol scaffold, appeared to exert lower potency towards USP28 (EC<sub>50</sub> &gt;30 μM) and selectivity for USP25 (EC<sub>50</sub> ~10–30 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To address compound selectivity more widely, we combined the ABP assay with quantitative mass spectrometry (activity-based probe profiling [ABPP]) to allow the analysis of the cellular active DUBome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benns et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pinto-Fernández et al., 2019</xref>).

As c-MYC is often overexpressed in late-stage cancer, targeting it for degradation is an attractive strategy in many settings. The term ‘undruggable’ was coined to describe proteins that could not be targeted pharmacologically. Many desirable targets in cancer fall into this category, including the c-MYC oncoprotein, and pharmacologically targeting these intractable proteins is a key challenge in cancer research.</p><p>The deubiquitylase family of enzymes have emerged as attractive drug targets, which can offer a means to destabilize client proteins that might otherwise be undruggable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>).

Importantly, mice lacking <italic>Usp28</italic> are healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knobel et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that USP28 is dispensable for normal physiology and homeostasis.</p><p>In the current study, we identified a requirement for USP28 for the maintenance of murine and human LSCC tumours. In agreement with the absence of major phenotypes in the <italic>Usp28</italic> knockout mice, USP28 inhibitor treatment was well tolerated by the experimental animals, while having a dramatic effect on LSCC regression. USP28 small-molecule inhibition phenocopies the effects of <italic>Usp28</italic> deletion in LSCC regression, consistent with on-target activity. However, we cannot exclude that the inhibition of USP25 and possibly additional off-targets effects may contribute to the observed phenotype. Inhibitor-treated mice kept a normal body weight, indicating no global adverse effects.</p><p>While USP28 inhibition resulted in profoundly reduced LSCC growth, the effect on LADC was modest. TP63, c-JUN, and c-MYC protein levels are increased in LSCC compared to LADC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This could indicate a greater dependence of LSCC on these oncoproteins, which consequently may result in increased sensitivity to USP28 inhibition. We previously found that <italic>Usp28</italic> deficiency corrected the accumulation of SCF (Fbw7) substrate proteins, including c-JUN and c-MYC, in <italic>Fbw7</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diefenbacher et al., 2015</xref>).

Indeed, our study suggests that those three oncoproteins are all relevant targets of USP28 in LSCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In contrast, Prieto-Garcia et al. saw no difference in c-JUN and c-MYC protein levels and suggested a different mechanism of action. Of note, our and the Prieto-Garcia et al. studies used different dual specificity inhibitors of USP28/25 that have distinct properties. FT206, the compound used in this study, preferentially inhibits USP28 compared to USP25, whereas AZ1, the compound used by Prieto-Garcia et al., showed a pronounced activity towards USP25. In addition, FT206 inhibits USP28 in the nano-molar range, while Prieto-Garcia et al. typically used AZ1 at 10–30 μM, possibly because higher compound concentrations are required for therapeutic inhibition of USP28. Therefore, differences in the selectivity and potency of the compounds used may explain some of the differences observed.</p><p>Interestingly, all human LSCC cell lines used in the xenograft experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), each of which responded well to USP28 inhibition, do not show neither gain- or loss-of-function mutations in <italic>USP28</italic> nor <italic>FBXW7</italic>, respectively.

requirement for ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28) in the survival of lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs). Using genetic knockout models and a novel small molecule inhibitor of USP28, they demonstrate loss or inhibition of USP28 impairs the growth of LSCCs to a much greater degree than lung adenocarcinomas, associated with a greater degree of loss of c-MYC, c-JUN, and Δp63. This work will be of interest to researchers seeking to better understand and treat LSCCs.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;USP28 deletion and small molecule inhibition destabilises c-Myc and elicits regression of squamous cell lung carcinoma&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wee-Wei Tee (Reviewer #3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors investigate a role for a candidate new inhibitor of USP28 in destabilizing c-MYC to reduce the growth of lung squamous carcinomas. They demonstrate that c-MYC levels are higher in lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSCC) versus lung adenocarcinomas (LADC), and depletion of c-MYC reduces LSCC cell growth. The deubiquitinase USP28 is known to stabilize c-MYC; the authors show that depletion of USP28 also decreases c-MYC protein levels. USP28 action opposes that of a ubiquitin complex targeted by the FBXW7 tumor suppressor; the authors create a new mouse model in which FLP recombinase initially causes deletion of FBXW7 and activation of KRAS to cause tumorigenesis with LSCC and LADC, followed by tamoxifen-dependent CRE recombinase deletion of USP28. Loss of USP28 in this model reduced numbers of LSCC but not LADC, and led to decreased expression of c-MYC and other short-lived proteins such as c-JUN and deltap63. A limitation of the data shown is that tumor number calculations are shown for a relatively small number of mice. Deletion of USP28 also did not restrict LADC growth in a second mouse model, with tumors forming based on activation of KRAS and loss of TP53. The authors then describe a compound, FT206, which they show is a specific inhibitor of USP28 among other ubiquitinases. They demonstrate that this compound reduces expression of c-MYC, c-JUN, and deltap63. They also show FT206 reduces growth of LSCC but not LADC in the KRAS/FBXW7 tumor model, and in human LSCC xenografts. These latter data suggest the compound FT206 may be useful as a lead compound. However, the current data are not sufficient to demonstrate FT206 binding and biological effect is specific for USP28, as the compound may also bind and regulate other non-deubiquitinase proteins.</p><p>1. Given the article focuses on c-MYC, abruptly introducing c-Jun and deltap63 as also elevated in LSCC is abrupt and seems off topic except as a way of bridging to USP28. This connects directly to a cited recent paper by Prieto-Garcia that implicates deltap63 as the critical target of a USP28 inhibitor. This makes the focus on c-MYC difficult to follow.</p><p>2. The data showing specificity for LSCC in Figure 2 appear to be based on a total of 4-5 mice/genotype for the +/- tamoxifen groups, and the number of tumors for LADC is extremely heterogeneous between animals. If you look at main figure 2C-F, and Supp Figure S3, you can see the vehicle and Tam mice are the same samples. Oddly, the statistical significance differs between the two figures. There are only 3 LSCC mice treated with Tam+FT in Supp Figure S3 – the very small number of mice could itself be a reason there isn't a significant difference with TAM, as the numbers of tumors seem to actually be trending lower. It is necessary to add additional mice to the study.</p><p>3. FT206 is a critical reagent for the study. While data shown indicates it is specific for USP28 among USPs (although with partial activity for USP25), it provides no evidence to show that it does not bind non-USP targets. Many compounds bind strongly to multiple targets. MYC expression is highly sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors; BET inhibitors, for example, also result in a rapid loss of MYC expression. It is essential to show data to establish whether this compound inhibits cell or tumor growth, and reduces MYC levels, in a USP28-/- null or USP28 depleted background, to determine whether the biological effect is related to USP28 or another potential target. It would also be important to do parallel IC50 curve determination and measurement of MYC expression in human LSCC and LADC cell lines, to supplement Figure 6 and provide support for the idea the compound acts differently in these cell models.</p><p>4. The design and findings of the study are very similar to that described by Prieto-Garcia; in that case, deltaNp63 was identified as the primary target of USP28. The discussion should explicitly discuss the relation of the present study to that published work, to emphasize points of similarity and difference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work Ruiz et al., use a couple of elegant mouse genetic models – KFCU (Fbxw7 deletion and mutant Ras over-expression) and KPCU (p53 deletion and mutant Ras over-expression) – to generate both LADC and LSCC tumors. Using this system, the authors show that deletion of USP28 resulted in less LSCC but not LADC tumor formation. However, both tumor types showed overall decrease in tumor size (in KFCU not shown in KPCU). These results are the genetic proof of concept that USP28 inhibition will be particularly detrimental in the context of LSCC tumors. They further test a compound (FT206) that was previously found to target USP28 and show that indeed this compound is specific for USP28 binding among USPs and can reduce the tumor numbers and size only in LSCC tumors and not LADC in the KF model and in three separate LSCC cell line xenograft models. Altogether making the argument that targeting LSCC tumors with chemical inhibitors of USP28 is a promising clinical strategy for LSCC cancers. Overall this paper is interesting and the results provided in vivo are very strong and nicely demonstrate an on-target effect of FT206 and its specificity in LSCC tumors. The work is very similar to a recent publication of (Prieto-Garcia EMBO Mol Med 2020) describing very similar results for USP28 dependency in LSCC tumors and previous findings regarding the chemical matter used in this paper (FT206).</p><p>The major strengths of this paper is that the authors use several very elegant mouse models to establish that Usp28 is a good candidate target for potential therapeutic development designated for LSCC patients. They also show the proof of concept using a compound that is described as a Usp28 inhibitor (FT206). It should be noted that much of the genetic data, showing the importance of Usp28 in LSCC was previously described (Prieto-Garcia EMBO Mol Med 2020) including the potential benefit of chemical inhibition of USP28. A potential weakness is that there is no rigorous characterizing of Usp28 substrate ubiquitination and degradation following FT206 treatment. This work will likely motivate the development of the USP28 inhibitor(s) for further preclinical assessment in Usp28 dependent tumors such as LSCC.</p><p>1. It is not clear in the paper as it is written now how the authors selected FT206. Is this a novel compound? Or was its function as a USP28 inhibitor already described before? There is a couple of publication cited and additional patents but even going through them it does not clarify this point. As this is a central novelty of this paper It would be informative to give a proper background on this compound, why was it selected? Was there a previous screen conducted ? is it a modification of a previously described scaffold ? etc., It makes no sense to dig through the patents to try and figure this out.</p><p>2. Despite the nice results in vivo and competition assays using ABPP there is no evidence provided to show that there is actually increased ubiquitination and degradation of the substrate proteins following FT206 treatment in cells. If this is the first demonstration of this USP28 inhibitor one would want to show at least in cell culture substrate ubiquitination and degradation. Also, there seems to be consistent decrease in Usp28 levels following FT206, this needs to be addressed in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The prevalent treatment options for LSCC are limited in efficacy. Through genetic inactivation of Usp28 in a novel lung cancer mouse model, and chemical inhibition of Usp28 in induced LSCC in mice and human LSCC xenograft tumors, the authors demonstrated the specific dependency of LSCC (but not LADC) on the protein deubiquitinase Usp28. The authors also showed that loss of Usp28 by either means leads to depletion of the oncoproteins c-Myc, p63 and c-Jun in LSCC. Finally, the authors described a novel small molecule that is specific for Usp25/28. Based on these results, the authors suggested chemically targeting USP28 as a potential therapeutic option for human LSCC patients.</p><p>Strengths: The presentation of the work is clear, concise and easily readable. The data presented largely supports the authors' conclusions on the role of USP28 in LSCC tumorigenesis and that inhibition of USP28 is a viable therapeutic option for LSCC treatment. The generation of the KFCU mice model that can give rise to both LADC and LSCC concurrently is interesting and presents a valuable tool for the wider cancer community.</p><p>Weakness: The manuscript can benefit from a deeper analysis of the relationship between FBW7 and USP28 in patient cohorts. A comparison of the activity/efficacy of FT206 to existing USP28 inhibitors will also be helpful.</p><p>1. The authors mentioned that 25% of human lung squamous cell carcinoma cases show gain of function alterations in USP28, based on TCGA data.</p><p>– What is the proportion of cases in the current study cohort (n=17) which show similar gain of function alterations at the DNA level, as well as overexpression of USP28 at the protein level (by immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting)?</p><p>– What is the correlation between DNA alterations and mRNA/protein expression? This would be clinically relevant if USP28 inhibitors are to be used in clinic, since we need a robust predictive test to select for patients who are most likely to respond to this therapy.</p><p>2. A previous study by the same first author mentioned that 69% of patients with LSCC show loss of FBW7 expression by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>– What is the FBW7 status of the cohort in the current study?</p><p>– Can USP28 overexpression/gain of function co-exists with FBW7 loss, or are they mutually exclusive?</p><p>– Apart from USP28 gain of function, FBW7 loss of function may also predict sensitivity to USP28 inhibition. Related to this, what is the status of FBW7 and USP28 in the three human LSCC cell lines used in the xenograft studies? This would clarify if the observed effect for USP28 inhibition is specific to LSCC cell lines with USP28 overexpression/FBW7 loss or to LSCC cell lines in general, regardless of USP28/FBW7 status.</p><p>3. It is interesting that LADC is not affected by the loss of Usp28. What is c-MYC and c-Jun protein expression in the LADC lesions in the KFCU mice? Are they upregulated upon KrasG12D activation and Fbw7 deletion? Although the authors showed in Figure 1 that the expression of c-MYC is lower in LADC compared to LSCC, it will be important to directly assess whether loss of USP28 (either by siRNA knockdown or FT206 treatment) in LADC cell lines can affect c-MYC protein expression.</p><p>4. As an important part of the paper is about application of the new Usp28 inhibitor FT206, the authors should have compared the efficacy with previously described Usp25/28 inhibitor (Wrigley et al; 2017, ACS Chem Biol 12,3113-3125) or at the very least, comment on potential similarities/differences/improvements etc.</p><p>5. As the authors advocate targeting USP28 in LSCC treatment, have they tested, or can they comment on, whether USP28 inhibition would be beneficial for LSCC that do not have gain-of-function alterations in USP28 (which represent 75% of LSCC)?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;USP28 deletion and small molecule inhibition destabilises c-Myc and elicits regression of squamous cell lung carcinoma&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Please address these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a revised submission of a manuscript initially deemed as of interest, but rejected due to the need for a large number of experiments to validate the author's model. In this revised submission, the authors have substantially addressed essentially every point made by the referees, providing new in vitro and in vivo data. The work now convincingly makes the point that the ubiquitin protease USP28 is specifically required to support the growth of lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs), more than lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs). The work defines critical USP28 targets as c-Myc, c-Jun, and ∆p63, and shows differential USP28-dependent stability of these proteins in LSCCs and LADCs. The authors also show that the FT206 compound inhibits USP28, and is selectively effective in reducing the growth of LSCCs versus LADCs. Overall, the data provided are much improved, as is the discussion of the context of the work; and the finding is potentially clinically important.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall the authors have addressed most of my concerns in the previous submission. I find the revised manuscript much clearer and significantly improved. I only have 4 additional points for the authors' clarification:</p><p>1) In light of the new data showing that FT206 can also inhibit USP25, albeit to a lesser extent than USP28, I think it is important to address if depletion of USP25 also results in loss of c-Myc, c-Jun and ∆p63 expressions compared to USP28 knockdown, at least in cell lines. Related to this, what is the phenotype of USP25 KO mice (if known)?</p><p>2) The authors mentioned that inhibitor treated mice kept a normal body weight, indicating no global adverse effects (Figure S5A). The numbers of mice used (n = 3) are on the low side. Do the authors have body weight and survival information for the other FT206 treated genetic mouse models (e.g Figure 2)?</p><p>3) The authors showed in Figure S2A that there is a positive correlation between USP28 copy number gain and higher mRNA expression in human LSCC patients, which may be useful for patient selection. However, they also mentioned that the 3 LSCC cell lines used for the xenograft studies do not show gain-of-function mutations in USP28 but responded well to USP28 inhibition. Do the authors have any data comparing the effects of USP28 deletion and/or inhibition in LSCC cell lines with or without USP28 alterations?</p><p>4) Related to point 3, can the authors speculate or discuss why USP28 deletion/inactivation has a less pronounced effect in LADC despite the latter also having high expression of USP28 and c-MYC ?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71596.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

To clarify the relative importance of c-Jun and ∆p63 as USP28 substrates in LSCC, we have targeted c-Jun and p63 expression by siRNAs in LSCC cells. Our new data suggest that also c-Jun and p63 are required for efficient cell proliferation in human LSCC cell lines (new Figure S1). Therefore, the inhibition of LSCC growth by USP28 inhibition appears to be due to a combination of effects on 3 independent USP28 substrates, c-Myc, c-Jun and ∆p63.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Firstly, we want to clarify that the vehicle- and Tamoxifen-treated mice indeed are the same in Figures 2 and S3. We split the data in two Figures because FT206 treatment was mentioned in the manuscript text later (Figure 5), and we only used the vehicle and USP28 KO data in Figure 2. Regarding the statistical analysis, in Figure 2, we are comparing just 2 groups, for which we used a T-test. In Figure S3 we are comparing 3 groups, thus we could not use a T-test. Instead, we used One-way ANOVA. However, to avoid misinterpretations, in the revised version of our manuscript, we show the 3 groups (vehicle- and Tamoxifen-treated and FT206-treated) in Figure 2.</p><p>As requested, we have increased the number of mice for all 3 experimental groups. We increased the number of mice in the Vehicle cohort from 5 to 8, the number of mice in the Tamoxifen-treated cohort from 4 to 7 and the number of mice in the Tamoxifen+FT206-treated cohort from 3 to 7. Consistent with our previous findings, KFCU mice exposed to tamoxifen to delete the conditional <italic>Usp28</italic> floxed alleles, showed a significant reduction in the numbers of LSCC lesions (new Figure 2F). In contrast, loss of Usp28 did not reduce the number of LADC tumors (new Figure 2C).</p><p>In addition, KFCU mice pre-exposed to tamoxifen, and therefore homozygous deleted for both <italic>usp28</italic> alleles, were treated with the USP28 inhibitor FT206. Usp28 inhibition did not result in a further reduction of LADC and LSCC lesions (new Figure 2C,D,F,G), suggesting that FT206 targets specifically Usp28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Our data showed that in a USP28-depleted background, FT206 neither affected cell growth nor reduced c-Myc protein levels (new Figure S4D). Thus, in line with our observations in the KFCU mouse model, see point 2 above, also this data strongly suggests that the effects of FT206 are mediated by Usp28 (new Figure 2C,D,F,G).</p><p>As requested, human LADC and LSCC cell lines were treated with FT206 (IC50 doses) to analyse its effect on c-Myc protein levels (new Figure S6).</p><p>Interestingly, FT206 treatment reduced c-Myc (&gt;65%) and c-Jun (&gt;80%) protein levels in the three human LSCC cell lines used in the xenograft studies (new Figure S6A).</p><p>Usp28 inhibition also decreased c-Myc levels in 2/3 LADC lines, although the reduction in cMyc protein levels appear to be significantly less pronounced than observed in LSCC (~60%) (new Figure S6B).

Thus, Usp28 inhibition acts differently in LADC and LSCC tumor cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The design and findings of the study are very similar to that described by Prieto-Garcia; in that case, deltaNp63 was identified as the primary target of USP28. The discussion should explicitly discuss the relation of the present study to that published work, to emphasize points of similarity and difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. We have addressed the differences of our work with the study of Prieto-Garcia et al. in the Discussion section. There are key differences between our study as compared to the study of Prieto-Garcia et al. We show that c-Jun, p63 and c-Myc are all relevant targets of Usp28 in LSCC and contribute to the observed effects of Usp28 inhibition/inactivation (Figure 2H), whereas Prieto-Garcia et al. see no difference in c-Jun and c-Myc protein levels (KPLU is the LSCC model with Usp28 inactivation). We would like to point out that in our view the technical quality of our Western blot experiments is higher. We also want to emphasise that both c-Jun and c-Myc are well established targets of Usp28, and that in this revision we show ubiquitylation assays clearly demonstrating increased c-Myc ubiquitylation in the presence of Usp28 inhibitor (new Figure S4B). Therefore, the proposed mechanism of action between our study and the study by</p><p>Prieto-Garcia et al. is different.</p><p>Of note, our and the Prieto-Garcia et al. studies used different dual specificity inhibitors of Usp25/Usp28 that have distinct properties. Firstly, FT206, the compound used in our study, preferentially inhibits Usp28 compared to Usp25, whereas AZ1, the compound used by PrietoGarcia et al., showed pronounced activity towards Usp25 (new Figure S4A of the revised manuscript). Secondly, whereas FT206 inhibits Usp28 in the nano-molar range (e.g see Figure 6B and new Figure S6A of the revised manuscript), Prieto-Garcia et al. typically used AZ1 at 10-30µM. We observed a clear reduction of c-Myc levels at 300nM (new Figure S6A of the revised manuscript). Therefore, differences in the selectivity and potency of the compounds used may explain some of the differences observed. We now discuss these differences in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this work Ruiz et al., use a couple of elegant mouse genetic models – KFCU (Fbxw7 deletion and mutant Ras over-expression) and KPCU (p53 deletion and mutant Ras over-expression) – to generate both LADC and LSCC tumors. Using this system, the authors show that deletion of USP28 resulted in less LSCC but not LADC tumor formation. However, both tumor types showed overall decrease in tumor size (in KFCU not shown in KPCU). These results are the genetic proof of concept that USP28 inhibition will be particularly detrimental in the context of LSCC tumors. They further test a compound (FT206) that was previously found to target USP28 and show that indeed this compound is specific for USP28 binding among USPs and can reduce the tumor numbers and size only in LSCC tumors and not LADC in the KF model and in three separate LSCC cell line xenograft models. Altogether making the argument that targeting LSCC tumors with chemical inhibitors of USP28 is a promising clinical strategy for LSCC cancers. Overall this paper is interesting and the results provided in vivo are very strong and nicely demonstrate an on-target effect of FT206 and its specificity in LSCC tumors. The work is very similar to a recent publication of (Prieto-Garcia EMBO Mol Med 2020) describing very similar results for USP28 dependency in LSCC tumors and previous findings regarding the chemical matter used in this paper (FT206).</p><p>The major strengths of this paper is that the authors use several very elegant mouse models to establish that Usp28 is a good candidate target for potential therapeutic development designated for LSCC patients. They also show the proof of concept using a compound that is described as a Usp28 inhibitor (FT206). It should be noted that much of the genetic data, showing the importance of Usp28 in LSCC was previously described (Prieto-Garcia EMBO Mol Med 2020) including the potential benefit of chemical inhibition of USP28. A potential weakness is that there is no rigorous characterizing of Usp28 substrate ubiquitination and degradation following FT206 treatment. This work will likely motivate the development of the USP28 inhibitor(s) for further preclinical assessment in Usp28 dependent tumors such as LSCC.</p><p>1. It is not clear in the paper as it is written now how the authors selected FT206. Is this a novel compound? Or was its function as a USP28 inhibitor already described before? There is a couple of publication cited and additional patents but even going through them it does not clarify this point. As this is a central novelty of this paper It would be informative to give a proper background on this compound, why was it selected? Was there a previous screen conducted ? is it a modification of a previously described scaffold ? etc., It makes no sense to dig through the patents to try and figure this out.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In fact, the small molecule compound FT206 is part of a patent on USP28 inhibitors that was filed by Forma Therapeutics WO 2020/033707 (Guerin D et al., 2020 – referenced in our manuscript), in which several hundred compound derivatives were reported with various degrees of inhibitory potency towards USP28. Amongst those, FT206, explicitly disclosed as compound example 11.1, has been specifically optimised for in vivo use with an adequate stability in serum, suitable biodistribution and pharmacodynamics (DMPK) as described in the patent. We have added a paragraph in the result section that mentions these characteristics (page 9, lines 3-7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Despite the nice results in vivo and competition assays using ABPP there is no evidence provided to show that there is actually increased ubiquitination and degradation of the substrate proteins following FT206 treatment in cells. If this is the first demonstration of this USP28 inhibitor one would want to show at least in cell culture substrate ubiquitination and degradation. Also, there seems to be consistent decrease in Usp28 levels following FT206, this needs to be addressed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed ubiquitination assays on c-Myc, c-Jun and Usp28 following FT206 treatment.</p><p>We found that the ubiquitination levels of c-Myc and c-Jun increased upon FT206 treatment, confirming that FT206 blocks USP28-mediated deubiquitination of its substrates (new Figure S4B). We also found that the ubiquitination level of USP28 increased upon FT206 treatment (new Figure S4B), which is consistent with previous observations where the enzymatic activity of DUBs is required to enhance their own stability <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/cdd.2011.16">(</ext-link>https://doi.org/10.1038/cdd.2011.16<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/cdd.2011.16">)</ext-link>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The prevalent treatment options for LSCC are limited in efficacy. Through genetic inactivation of Usp28 in a novel lung cancer mouse model, and chemical inhibition of Usp28 in induced LSCC in mice and human LSCC xenograft tumors, the authors demonstrated the specific dependency of LSCC (but not LADC) on the protein deubiquitinase Usp28. The authors also showed that loss of Usp28 by either means leads to depletion of the oncoproteins c-Myc, p63 and c-Jun in LSCC. Finally, the authors described a novel small molecule that is specific for Usp25/28. Based on these results, the authors suggested chemically targeting USP28 as a potential therapeutic option for human LSCC patients.</p><p>Strengths: The presentation of the work is clear, concise and easily readable. The data presented largely supports the authors' conclusions on the role of USP28 in LSCC tumorigenesis and that inhibition of USP28 is a viable therapeutic option for LSCC treatment. The generation of the KFCU mice model that can give rise to both LADC and LSCC concurrently is interesting and presents a valuable tool for the wider cancer community.</p><p>Weakness: The manuscript can benefit from a deeper analysis of the relationship between FBW7 and USP28 in patient cohorts. A comparison of the activity/efficacy of FT206 to existing USP28 inhibitors will also be helpful.</p><p>1. The authors mentioned that 25% of human lung squamous cell carcinoma cases show gain of function alterations in USP28, based on TCGA data.</p><p>– What is the proportion of cases in the current study cohort (n=17) which show similar gain of function alterations at the DNA level, as well as overexpression of USP28 at the protein level (by immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting)?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank also this reviewer for insightful comments. Unfortunately, we cannot evaluate DNA genetic alterations in our study cohort as we do not have any additional remaining sample left to extract DNA. However, as requested, we have performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis for USP28, and found that LSCC tumours express very high levels of USP28 protein (new Figure S2B).</p><p>However, we have mRNA from these analysed samples, and we found that in our study cohort low USP28 mRNA levels correlate with low Usp28 protein levels and likewise, high/moderate mRNA levels also correlate with high Usp28 protein levels (Figure 1G and new Figure S2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-What is the correlation between DNA alterations and mRNA/protein expression? This would be clinically relevant if USP28 inhibitors are to be used in clinic, since we need a robust predictive test to select for patients who are most likely to respond to this therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We have performed this analysis using TCGA data, which revealed that there is a positive correlation between <italic>USP28</italic> copy-number gain and higher mRNA expression in human LSCC patients (new Figure S2A).

It will be very interesting to determine if USP28 inhibitors will have higher efficacy in patients with gain-of-function alterations in USP28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Thus, in a significant fraction of LSCC patients, USP28 overexpression/gain of function co-exists with FBXW7 loss<italic>.</italic> However, ~75% of cases with FBXW7 alterations do not show USP28 gain-of-function (new Figure 1F). Thus, USP28 overexpression/gain-of-function and FBXW7 loss are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Moreover, in our cohort we found by IHC that all human LSCC samples express USP28 (mostly very strongly; new Figure S2B) concomitant with FBW7 loss (new Figure S2B). Thus, USP28 overexpression co-exists with FBW7 loss in human LSCC patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Apart from USP28 gain of function, FBW7 loss of function may also predict sensitivity to USP28 inhibition. Related to this, what is the status of FBW7 and USP28 in the three human LSCC cell lines used in the xenograft studies?

It is interesting that LADC is not affected by the loss of Usp28. What is c-MYC and c-Jun protein expression in the LADC lesions in the KFCU mice?

Although the authors showed in Figure 1 that the expression of c-MYC is lower in LADC compared to LSCC, it will be important to directly assess whether loss of USP28 (either by siRNA knockdown or FT206 treatment) in LADC cell lines can affect c-MYC protein expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Our Western blot analysis revealed that Usp28 deletion resulted in reduced c-Jun and c-Myc protein levels in KFCU LADC lesions, although the reduction in c-Myc protein levels appear to be significantly less pronounced than observed in LSCC (new Figure 2E).</p><p>The modest decrease in Usp28 substrates could explain the modest reduction in LADC tumor size.</p><p>In addition, human LADC cell lines were treated with FT206 (IC50 doses) and c-Myc/c-Jun levels determined.

As an important part of the paper is about application of the new Usp28 inhibitor FT206, the authors should have compared the efficacy with previously described Usp25/28 inhibitor (Wrigley et al; 2017, ACS Chem Biol 12,3113-3125) or at the very least, comment on potential similarities/differences/improvements etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this referee that this will be a useful addition to our study.

As suggested, we knockdown the expression of Usp25 by siRNAs and observed that Usp25 downregulation did not reduced protein levels of c-Jun, p63 and cMyc in LSCC cells (new Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A). Thus, together this data suggests that the observed effects of FT206 treatment are mainly mediated by Usp28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, what is the phenotype of USP25 KO mice (if known)?</p></disp-quote><p>USP25 KO mice are viable and do not show any abnormalities in growth or survival (Nat Immunol 2012, 13:1110) but are more susceptible to H5N1 or HSV-1 viral infection compared to their wild-type counterparts (PNAS 2015,112:11324). This is linked to USP25 association with TRAF3 and TRAF6, main components of innate immune response, and no apparent functional connections appear to exist with c-Myc, c-Jun or p63 (PNAS 2015,112:11324).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors mentioned that inhibitor treated mice kept a normal body weight, indicating no global adverse effects (Figure S5A). The numbers of mice used (n = 3) are on the low side. Do the authors have body weight and survival information for the other FT206 treated genetic mouse models (e.g Figure 2)?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now show the body weight for the genetic models displayed in Figure 2 (new Figure 2 —figure supplement 1E, n = 7-8). We observed a transient loss of body weight during Tamoxifen treatment, yet body weight recovered a few days later. This effect has been found in other studies that use Tamoxifen to delete floxed alleles (Cancer Cell 2019; 35:573), as it is well-known that Tamoxifen transiently decreases food intake, body weight and in the short-term fat mass in rodents (Am J Physiol 1993 264:R1219). Importantly, FT206 administration did not result in a further reduction of body weight (new Figure 2 —figure supplement 1E).</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have survival curves for these experiments. Mice from different groups (i.e. Vehicle, Tam and Tam+FT) were culled at the same time to quantify side-by-side the number of lung tumours. However, the decreased tumour burden seen in lung tumour in the absence of Usp28 suggested that survival will be impacted. To support the clinical significance of targeting Usp28, we examined the correlation between USP28 expression level and LSCC patient survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Lower expression of USP28 is associated with a significantly longer survival time (<italic>P</italic> = 8.4x10<sup>-3</sup>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Kaplan-Meier plot showing the association between <italic>USP28</italic> expression and patient survival.</title><p>Analysis performed using KM plotter lung cancer database.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71596-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors showed in Figure S2A that there is a positive correlation between USP28 copy number gain and higher mRNA expression in human LSCC patients, which may be useful for patient selection. However, they also mentioned that the 3 LSCC cell lines used for the xenograft studies do not show gain-of-function mutations in USP28 but responded well to USP28 inhibition. Do the authors have any data comparing the effects of USP28 deletion and/or inhibition in LSCC cell lines with or without USP28 alterations?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We believe that both situations are not mutually exclusive. Whereas those patients with gain-of-function alterations in USP28 might have a higher response to USP28 inhibitors, our xenograft data suggest that patients without USP28 alterations could also benefit from USP28 inhibition.</p><p>As requested, we compared the effects of USP28 inhibition in LSCC cell lines with or without USP28 alterations. In Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B we found that FT206 treatment resulted in a significant decrease of c-Myc and c-Jun protein levels in three human LSCC cell lines (H520, CALU-1 and LUDLU-1) that do not have USP28 genetic alterations. The LSCC cell line SKMES contains a Nonsense Mutation in USP28 (c.193G&gt;T), resulting in a nonfunctional protein product. Consequently, FT206 treatment failed to decrease c-Myc and cJun protein levels in this cell line (new Figure 6 —figure supplement 1E). This data further confirms that the effects of FT206 are mediated by USP28 and also suggests that patients with loss-of-function alterations in USP28 will not respond to USP28 inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to point 3, can the authors speculate or discuss why USP28 deletion/inactivation has a less pronounced effect in LADC despite the latter also having high expression of USP28 and c-MYC ?</p></disp-quote><p>Our Western blot analysis revealed that Usp28 deletion resulted in reduced c-Myc and c-Jun protein levels in LADC lesions, but, importantly, the reduction in c-Myc protein levels appears to be significantly more pronounced in LSCC (Figure 2E). Moreover, Usp28 ablation has a marginal effect, if any, on apoptotic cell death (cleaved caspase-3; CC3). Thus, the modest decrease in Usp28 substrates and the failure to induce cleaved caspase-3 could explain the modest effect in LADC tumours. We have added a paragraph in the Results section that mentions these characteristics (page 8, lines 2-6).</p></body></sub-article></article>
