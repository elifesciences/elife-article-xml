PAC regulates endosomal acidification and macropinosome shrinkage by releasing chloride from the organelle lumens. It is also found at the cell surface, where it is activated under pathological conditions related to acidosis and contributes to acid-induced cell death. However, the pharmacology of the PAC channel is poorly understood. Here, we report that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) potently inhibits PAC channel activity. We solved the cryo-electron microscopy structure of PAC with PIP<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.0 and identified its putative binding site, which, surprisingly, locates on the extracellular side of the transmembrane domain (TMD). While the overall conformation resembles the previously resolved PAC structure in the desensitized state, the TMD undergoes remodeling upon PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding. Structural and electrophysiological analyses suggest that PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits the PAC channel by stabilizing the channel in a desensitized-like conformation. Our findings identify PIP<sub>2</sub> as a new pharmacological tool for the PAC channel and lay the foundation for future drug discovery targeting this channel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chloride channel</kwd><kwd>PIP2</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mihaljević</surname><given-names>Ljubica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007445 Graduate Training Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mihaljević</surname><given-names>Ljubica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship grant 20POST35120556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruan</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant K99NS128258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruan</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship grant 18PRE34060025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osei-Owusu</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant R01NS112363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lü</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>McKnight Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Zhaozhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Since the recent discovery of its molecular identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ullrich et al., 2019</xref>), PAC has been implicated in important biological functions, such as endosomal trafficking and macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Osei-Owusu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zeziulia et al., 2022</xref>). In the endosome, low luminal pH activates PAC to mediate chloride efflux from the lumen. Thereby, PAC actively regulates luminal acidification by depleting the counter ion, chloride, and preventing proton accumulation in the endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Osei-Owusu et al., 2021</xref>). During macropinocytosis PAC mediates the shrinkage of macropinosomes by releasing chloride into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zeziulia et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to localizing to the intracellular organelles, PAC also traffics to the plasma membrane, where it is involved in several pathological conditions associated with acidosis. For example, upon ischemic stroke, PAC is activated by drops in tissue pH, allowing the entry of chloride into the cells. This subsequently causes cellular swelling and contributes to acid-induced brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Osei-Owusu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>PAC is a homotrimer that forms a chloride-selective pore in the membrane, and it senses changes in pH via its large extracellular domain (ECD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Osei-Owusu et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). PAC channel is closed at neutral pH and becomes activated when the pH drops below 5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The proton binding to the ECD is directly coupled with the channel opening in the transmembrane domain (TMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Osei-Owusu et al., 2022a</xref>). After prolonged exposure to pH 4.6 or below, the PAC channel slowly desensitizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osei-Owusu et al., 2022b</xref>). The desensitization of PAC is pH-dependentthat is, under more acidic conditions, desensitization is stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osei-Owusu et al., 2022b</xref>). This is regulated by several key residues localized at the ECD–TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osei-Owusu et al., 2022b</xref>). For example, the E94R mutant displays fast desensitization even at pH 5.0, when the wild-type channel does not exhibit obvious current decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osei-Owusu et al., 2022b</xref>). In addition to the resting and desensitized structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>), an open conformation of PAC was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). The transition between closed, open and desensitized PAC channel conformations involves major structural rearrangements inside the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). It is now widely accepted that the membrane shapes ion channel function and structure. Lipid composition and the thickness of the membrane can directly control or fine-tune the gating of certain ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rosenhouse-Dantsker et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether the PAC channel is regulated by lipids is unknown.</p><p>The most common and best-studied lipid regulator of ion channel function is phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). PIP<sub>2</sub> is a negatively charged phospholipid, predominantly found in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>), with few reports that a small amount can localize to the outer leaflet as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gulshan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yoneda et al., 2020</xref>). Although it accounts for less than 1% of the total phospholipids in the plasma membrane, it is a principal signaling molecule and an essential cofactor for ion channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hansen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> binds to ion channels directly and modulates their function by facilitating channel opening, preventing current rundown/desensitization, or inhibiting channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gada and Logothetis, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>). At least 10 different ion channel families are dependent on PIP<sub>2</sub> for their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gada and Logothetis, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>). A handful of ion channles are negatively regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gada and Logothetis, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>), one of which is TMEM16B− the only chloride channel that is reported to be inhibited in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> to this date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ta et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Major breakthroughs have been made in recent years to characterize the structure and function of the PAC channel in biology and disease, but its regulation by endogenous molecules remains largely unexplored. PAC recently emerged as a target of interest for acidosis-related diseases, and much progress has been made to identify natural and synthetic compounds that can inhibit PAC channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Figueroa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Okada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sato-Numata et al., 2016</xref>). DIDS (4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid), a broad-spectrum chloride channel blocker, with a half-maximal inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 2.9 µM in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Okada et al., 2021</xref>) is the most commonly used PAC inhibitor. To date, arachidonic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.9 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Okada et al., 2021</xref>) and pregnenolone sulfate (IC<sub>50</sub> of 10 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Figueroa, 2020</xref>) are the only reported potential biological inhibitors of the acid-induced chloride currents (<italic>I<sub>Cl,H</sub></italic>) mediated by PAC, yet their mechanism and binding sites are not fully characterized. Here, we show that PIP<sub>2</sub> potently inhibits PAC and present the first structure of PAC channel with an inhibitor. Furthermore, we elucidate the molecular mechanism by which PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits PAC by stabilizing a desensitized-like conformation of the channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits PAC channel activity</title><p>Considering the widespread influence of PIP<sub>2</sub> on ion channel function, we hypothesized that PIP<sub>2</sub> could potentially regulate the PAC channel. To test whether PIP<sub>2</sub> modulates PAC activity, we applied a soluble version of PIP<sub>2</sub> lipid, dioctanoyl phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (diC<sub>8</sub>-PIP<sub>2</sub>), to HEK293 cells, which endogenously express the acid-induced chloride currents.

Approximately 37% of the initial current amplitude was detectable after PIP<sub>2</sub> perfusion for 150 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

This is additionally supported by a modest inhibitory effect of PI (phosphatidylinositol) that does not have any active headgroup phosphates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate), a triple-phosphorylated inositol headgroup without an acyl chain, displayed a similarly modest inhibition on PAC as PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Phosphates on the headgroup are therefore necessary, but not sufficient for PAC inhibition, indicating that the lipid chain contributes to inhibitory properties of PIP<sub>2</sub> as well. diC<sub>8</sub>-diacyl-glycerol (DAG), the lipid chain without inositol head, had no inhibitory effect on PAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Indeed, the desensitized structure of PAC that we determined previously, a cluster of lipid-like density is present in the cytoplasmic fenestration area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). The C-terminus of TM2 has several positively charged residues, including K325, K329, K333, R335, K336, R337, K340, R341, R342, that we focused on initially and studied for their impact on PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mutating single or triple lysine and arginine residues to alanine or making a 10-residue deletion at the C-terminal domain did not affect PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated inhibition on pH 5.0-induced PAC currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, when diC<sub>8</sub>-PIP<sub>2</sub> was applied to the cells through an intracellular solution in the patch pipette, at a physiological concentration of 10 µM, there was no detectable change in the endogenous PAC current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similarly, <italic>I</italic><sub>Cl,H</sub> remained intact when endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> was depleted from the inner membrane leaflet using 100 μg/ml Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) in the patch pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results are surprising because endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> is known to be almost exclusively localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Thus, the effect we observed with the perfusion of exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> may occur via inhibition of the PAC channel through a potentially unconventional mechanism.</p><p>To reveal the mechanism underlying PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibition, we solved the cryo-EM structure of PAC in nanodiscs with 0.5 mM diC<sub>8</sub>-PIP<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.0 to an overall resolution of 2.70 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The structure adopts a conformation similar to the previously reported desensitized state at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). However, a strong branched lipid density is observed on the cryo-EM map of the PAC channel in the outer membrane leaflet, between TM1 and TM2 of adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We suspected that the density may represent a bound PIP<sub>2</sub> molecule, although we cannot rule out the possibility that this density may represent other types of lipids, such as phosphatidic acid. When trying to fit a diC<sub>8</sub>-PIP<sub>2</sub> molecule into this density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we found that the phosphatidyl group is reasonably well defined, with its phosphate group forming a salt bridge interaction with R93 and its two acyl tails interacting with a number of hydrophobic residues on both transmembrane helices, including W304 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the hydrophilic head group, such as inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Ins(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) moiety of PIP<sub>2</sub>, is not resolved and therefore not modeled. The absence of the head group may be explained by its intrinsic flexibility and/or, if it is Ins(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, its susceptibility to radiation damage due to the negative charges it carries. Nevertheless, the local biochemical environment of the site is consistent with PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, in which the hypothetical location of Ins(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is surrounded by several positively charged residues, including K97, K106, and K294 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The putative PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site is also in accordance with our observation that a higher number of negatively charged phosphates, as well as the presence of an acyl chain, contribute to stronger channel inhibition by PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, small, but notable, conformational changes are observed in the transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) upon adding PIP<sub>2</sub>, which supports the binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> to PAC. Specifically, TM1 tilts inside by 3 Å which causes a concerted rotation motion of TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The pore radius profile is similar to the desensitized state of PAC without PIP<sub>2</sub>, with the smallest radius of 0.43 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Binding of PI, and potentially PIP<sub>2</sub>, in the outer membrane leaflet has previously been observed in the structure of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHA2), mediating its activity through stabilization of dimer interface, a mechanism distinct from the one described here. Furthermore, the binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> to NHA2 is yet to be confirmed in a physiological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Matsuoka et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding pocket on the extracellular side of the PAC channel is physiologically unusual. It is therefore unlikely, albeit not impossible, that inhibition of PAC by PIP<sub>2</sub> occurs in a physiological setting. Considering the recent discovery of PAC and its wide tissue distribution, we speculate that PIP<sub>2</sub> could be negatively regulating PAC in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in specialized cells, or under certain conditions that are currently unknown to us. For example, the PAC channel localizes to endosomes and macropinosomes of macrophages. The inner membrane of these intracellular organelles is topologically equivalent to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Some pathogens enter the cells via endocytosis or macropinocytosis and escape degradation in these compartments via fusion of their membrane with the membrane of the organelle. The envelope of some pathogens is enriched in PIP<sub>2</sub>, such as in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mücksch et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that PIP<sub>2</sub> could potentially be found in the inner membrane of endosomes during fusion with pathogenic membranes, where it inhibits PAC activity and modulates lumen acidification. However, it is also possible that PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding site on PAC potentially acts as a proxy for another ligand that has yet to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, to our knowledge, PIP<sub>2</sub> is the first PAC channel modulator with a characterized binding site and mechanism of action. Although its physiological significance remains elusive, the novel extracellular PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding pocket for targeted inhibition of PAC can be exploited for the design of PAC inhibitors that do not have to be cell-permeable. Furthermore, we describe pharmacological properties necessary for PAC inhibition, which include a stable insertion into the membrane and a negative charge that interacts with the positively charged cluster of residues on the pocket. These insights provide a useful tool for the future design of potential therapeutics for acidosis-related diseases implicating the PAC channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Positive white clones were selected from a Luria Broth (LB) plate with kanamycin (50 μg/mL), tetracycline (10 μg/mL), gentamicin (7 μg/mL), Bluo-gal (100 μg/mL Bluo-gal), and IPTG (40 μg/mL). Bacmid DNA was purified from LB cultures of the white colonies using the alkaline lysis method. The bacmid was then transfected into adherent Sf9 cells grown in Sf-900 II media (Gibco) using Cellfectin II reagent by following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. After 5 days, the media of Sf9 cell culture was filtered and stored as the P1 virus. Subsequently, the P2 virus was made by infecting suspension Sf9 cells grown in Sf-900 II media with P1 virus at a 1:5000 ratio (v/v).

Good particles with clear features were pooled together and refined in relion 3.1. 3D refinement with a solvent mask and C3 symmetry, resulting in a 4.4 Å map. We noticed that the size of nanodiscs could be heterogeneous, which may negatively affect particle alignment. Therefore, we created a loose mask of the protein based on the atomic model and performed signal subtraction to remove the nanodisc signal. The process allowed us to obtain a reconstruction at 4.2 Å resolution. To sort out the conformational heterogeneity of the dataset, we performed 3D classification without image alignment in relion 3.1. The best class of the job was selected and refined to 3.6 Å resolution. We then performed several rounds of CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zivanov et al., 2019</xref>), and the map was eventually refined to 3.17 Å. We noticed an improvement in the map quality when the box size of the images was expanded from 240 pixels to 300 pixels at this stage. To further improve map reconstruction, we first split the original consensus particles after 2D and heterogeneous refinement into 6 portions. We combined each portion with the best particles that gave rise to the 3.17 Å reconstruction and performed another round of 3D classification. This procedure was effective in attracting good particles from the initial consensus map particles. After combining the best class and removing duplicates, we identified 84 k particles that could be refined to 3.07 Å in relion after iterative CTF refinement and Bayesian Polishing. We then exported the particles to cryosparc and conducted CTF refinement followed by local refinement. We also supplied a mask to get rid of nanodisc signal during the refinement. In the end, we obtained a 2.71 Å reconstruction as judged by gold-standard Fourier shell correlation. This map is deposited in the EMDB under the accession EMD-28535. We noticed that the intracellular side of TMD is very heterogeneous, which may limit the quality of the final reconstruction. As the last step of our data analysis, we refined the particles by using a mask that excludes signals of the intracellular region of PAC. This additional step allowed us to obtain a reconstruction of PAC ECD and the extracellular region of TMD at 2.70 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the nominal resolution of this map is comparable to the full protein map, we noticed improved map quality, especially the lipid density. Postprocessing of the maps, including local map sharpening and resolution estimation is performed using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Terwilliger et al., 2018</xref>). This map is deposited in the EMDB under the accession EMD-28964.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Model building, validation, and analysis</title><p>The atomic model was generated by first docking the structural model of human PAC at pH 4.5 (PDBID: 7SQH) into the cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).

The Grade Web Server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bepler et al., 2019</xref>) was used to generate a restraint file for flexible fitting of the diC<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecule. Subsequently, the model underwent real space refinement in phenix and manual adjustment to fix Ramachandran outliers, rotamer outliers, and clashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). We manually removed the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate group from the atomic model due to the limited support from the cryo-EM density. The final model was validated by the molprobity in phenix to obtain validation statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Williams et al., 2018</xref>). The cryo-EM map and atomic model were visualized using UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>).

important roles in intracellular organelles and its function in the plasma membrane is associated with human pathologies. Combining electrophysiology, site-directed mutagenesis, lipid pharmacology, and single particle cryo-electron microscopy, this valuable study provides solid evidence to identify a site on the extracellular half of the transmembrane domain of PAC channels that could be occupied by PIP2 and related lipids to promote channel desensitization. These findings are relevant because pharmacological information for this important ion channel is absent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83935.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Jara-Oseguera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj54h04</institution-id><institution>The University of Texas at Austin</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Jara-Oseguera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj54h04</institution-id><institution>The University of Texas at Austin</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kalienkova</surname><given-names>Valeria</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012p63287</institution-id><institution>University of Groningen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.06.511171">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.06.511171v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Andrés Jara-Oseguera as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Valeria Kalienkova (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. All three reviewers agreed that the findings in the manuscript are interesting and important, but they also raised a series of concerns, the two major ones concerning whether the inhibition of PAC channels by PIP2 is physiologically relevant, and whether the lipid bound to the channel in the structure is indeed PIP2. Each of the concerns discussed by the reviewers are summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Since the authors show that PIP2 rather acts on an activated/desensitized state of the channel, the authors should discuss the state of the PIP2 binding site in different states of the channel – resting, activated and desensitized. Is it unavailable to PIP2 in resting state? Related to this, do previously solved desensitized structures have any defined lipid densities in that region? If this is not the case, this might be worth mentioning to further strengthen the point that the density observed in this new structure might indeed be a specifically-bound PIP2 molecule.</p><p>2. For Figure 3C (PIP2 binding site), please include the cryo-EM density for the lipid, the fitted PIP2 molecule, and the density for the side-chains that are interacting with the lipid. The experimental evidence identifying PIP2 as the bound lipid should be discussed more extensively, and it should be clearly acknowledged in the paper if there are alternative explanations for the observations: does the density uniquely identify the lipid as PIP2, or could other lipids be fitted, including potential lipid contaminants such as phosphatidic acid? The authors need to clarify whether their experimentally resolved data supports the positioning of bound PIP2 in the PAC structure (Figure 3A-C) or does not (the main text and figure legends, Figure S4).</p><p>Please also clarify if the longer acyl chains are proposed to contribute to tighter binding of the lipid and orientation of the headgroup into the pocket. This is important because the headgroup does not seem to bind very tightly and is hence not very well resolved. Is the pocket big enough to accommodate PIP3? Does the higher number of phosphates simply help to attract the headgroup towards this pocket?

Application of PIP2 in Figure 4A-C produces an immediate drop of current that appears independent from the decay curves ascribed to desensitization. The brackets on those figures indicate that inhibition was measured 75-100 seconds after application, thus incorporating a mix of both processes. This measurement needs to be consistent across experiments and should be explained more clearly. Also, the rate of desensitization before and after PIP2 does not seem to change after the rapid current decay upon first exposure to PIP2 – this seems inconsistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition by PIP2 in which the lipid increases the rate of desensitization. Please show the fits for the one-phase decay equations. The drop of current visible after PIP2 application suggests that such a model is inappropriate. These discrepancies need to be appropriately addressed.

The authors acknowledge this fact with the following points in the Results section: &quot;it is by no means unambiguous due to the limited local map resolution&quot; and &quot;the phosphatidyl group is reasonably well defined… in contrast, the inositol 4,5-bisphosphate moiety is not resolved&quot;. Confusingly, the authors also state that the deposited model does not contain the inositol headgroup (Figure 3A) but the attached validation files indicate that it has been (Molecule 3, PIO &quot;Ligand of interest&quot;). The authors need to decide whether their experimentally resolved data supports the positioning of bound PIP2 in the PAC structure (Figure 3A-C) or does not (the main text and figure legends, Figure S4). In doing so, the authors should consider the possibility of contaminating ligands from the other lipids (e.g. phosphatidic acid) in their preparation. Furthermore, in absence of supporting data, Figure 3C should be excluded from the manuscript. While it is apparent that the modeled basic residues are important for PAC inhibition by PIP2 (Figure 3E) and the authors are careful to note that the model is used to highlight the local biochemical (electrostatic) environment, the presentation of the figure (e.g. distance lines for electrostatic interactions) suggests more certainty than is warranted. Finally, note the pKA of inositol phosphates (Kooijman et al. 2009, PMID: 19725516); they will be partially protonated at pH 4.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83935.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

If this is not the case, this might be worth mentioning to further strengthen the point that the density observed in this new structure might indeed be a specifically-bound PIP2 molecule.</p></disp-quote><p>The residues that form the PIP2 binding site are part of the structural region that shows major conformational differences between the desensitized state and the resting/activated states (Figure S5). In particular, the rotational movement of TM1 annihilates the PIP2 binding pocket in the resting and activated states of PAC (Figure S5). Therefore, it’s unlikely that PIP2 binds to PAC in these states. We thank the reviewer for raising such a good point and we now generate a new figure to further demonstrate this point (Figure S5).</p><p>Our previous structure in the desensitized state doesn't contain such a lipid density (Ruan et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2020). The recent high-resolution structure of PAC appears to contain a branched lipid density in the area in two of the subunits but not the third one. We are unsure about the reason as the map is supposed to be refined using C3 symmetry. The map deposited in the EMDB (EMD-25385) looks distorted and doesn’t appear to be a raw cryo-EM map generated directly by gold-standard 3D refinement. We are unsure how to best interpret the map (Wang et al., <italic>Sci Adv</italic>, 2022). Therefore, we decide not to discuss this part in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For Figure 3C (PIP2 binding site), please include the cryo-EM density for the lipid, the fitted PIP2 molecule, and the density for the side-chains that are interacting with the lipid. The experimental evidence identifying PIP2 as the bound lipid should be discussed more extensively, and it should be clearly acknowledged in the paper if there are alternative explanations for the observations: does the density uniquely identify the lipid as PIP2, or could other lipids be fitted, including potential lipid contaminants such as phosphatidic acid? The authors need to clarify whether their experimentally resolved data supports the positioning of bound PIP2 in the PAC structure (Figure 3A-C) or does not (the main text and figure legends, Figure S4).</p><p>Please also clarify if the longer acyl chains are proposed to contribute to tighter binding of the lipid and orientation of the headgroup into the pocket. This is important because the headgroup does not seem to bind very tightly and is hence not very well resolved. Is the pocket big enough to accommodate PIP3?

Finally, note the pKA of inositol phosphates (Kooijman et al. 2009, PMID: 19725516); they will be partially protonated at pH 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 3C to show the density of the lipid and important residues nearby. We also mentioned the possibilities of other lipids in the text. In our initial manuscript, we already acknowledged the fact that the assignment of PIP2 into the density is not unambiguous based on the cryo-EM map alone. However, the biochemical environment of the binding pocket, as well as the subsequent mutagenesis data support such a PIP2 binding site. We now re-wrote the paragraph to make this even clearer.</p><p>We propose that lipid chain of at least 8 carbons is necessary for PAC inhibition due to insertion into the membrane, which potentially makes the PIP2 headgroup accessible to the positively charged pocket on PAC. Lipid with a shorter chain, diC6-PIP2, didn’t inhibit PAC and the lipid with a chain longer than 8 carbons, diC18:0-20:4-PIP2, didn’t further increase the inhibition (when compared to diC8-PIP2), suggesting that C7 and C8 carbon of the acyl chain establish critical interactions with the protein. Additionally, our structural model showed that the acyl chain of PIP2 tightly packs against W304. The importance of the acyl chain for PIP2 binding is supported by the fact that the W304A mutant resulted in reduced PIP2 inhibition (Figure 3E).</p><p>The binding pocket is big enough to accommodate PIP3. In fact, we can place a phosphate group at the 3rd position of the inositol hydroxyl group in our current PDB model without creating any steric hindrance. Because the electrostatic environment surrounding the headgroup of PIP2 is positively charged (Figure 3C), we believe the attraction effect is a major factor that contributes to the recognition of PIP2.</p><p>We acknowledge the referenced literature (Kooijman et al. 2009, PMID: 19725516) that the phosphate group may be partially protonated at pH 4, but this study is unable to reliably estimate the pK<sub>a2</sub> of PI(4,5)P2 and the pK<sub>a1</sub> is not studied. Moreover, in Figure 7 of the paper, no major difference is observed in the charge status of PI(4,5)P2 at pH 4-5, suggesting that the ionization status of PIP<sub>2</sub> doesn’t change in the experimental condition investigated in our study. In a more recent review of PI(4,5)P2, it was suggested that at pH 4-5, both of the phosphomonoester groups are mono-protonated (Luís Borges-Araújo and Fabio Fernandes 2020, PMID: 32858905). Therefore, a net charge of -2 is present in the head group of PI(4,5)P2 under our experimental conditions, which allowed the molecule to interact favorably with the positively charged binding pocket (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We now carefully performed local anisotropic sharpening in Phenix and ensured that the output is symmetric. We also tried the deepEMhancer and local deblur.

Therefore, we deposit the Phenix map in EMDB.</p><p>We did apply C3 symmetry to obtain the initial 4.2 Å map. This is now clearly indicated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Our final data processing procedure includes a step to exclude part of the map by using a mask. This is because substantial heterogeneity is present in the intracellular side of the transmembrane domain,. As we are primarily interested in the PIP2 binding site, which is located in the ECD-TMD interface, we decide to exclude signals in the intracellular region of the transmembrane domain for final refinement. This will allow us to improve the density for the PIP2 binding site and facilitate model building. We deposited this reconstruction as well as the full PAC map without using such a mask in EMDB in this revision.</p><p>The transparent outline is a non-sharpened map at a low contour level with the aim to show the nanodisc density. This will allow the readers to distinguish different regions of the PAC structure (ECD and TMD) easily. It is not a mask for refinement. We modified the figure S3 legend to better describe this. As the reviewer suggested, we also showed the mask used in the last step of refinement in Figure S3. This mask excluded the intracellular portion of PAC TMD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We, therefore, decided to exclude the kinetics from the manuscript and revised our proposed model appropriately. Furthermore, we wanted to clarify that the inhibition has been consistently quantified at 100s point after the application of PIP2, even though the start of PIP2 application had a variable time-point due to variability in desensitization current reaching a plateau. This is now clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The authors might consider trying other sharpening tools which take into account different b-factors across the map (deepEMhancer, local deblur, sharpening tools in Phenix etc). It would also be valuable to include the reasoning for the final mask excluding part of the transport domain in data processing section of Materials and methods, and to display the mask in the processing workflow in figure S3. Regarding figure S3, please indicate what is displayed in color, and what are the transparent outlines – are those depictions of the maps at different contour? Or are the transparent outlines masks used for sharpening? If it is the latter, the final mask also includes nanodisc density, contrary to</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We now carefully performed local anisotropic sharpening in Phenix and ensured that the output is symmetric. We also tried the deepEMhancer and local deblur. Upon visual inspection of the output, we found that the map produced by Phenix showed the best features in terms of the residue side chain and lipid density. Therefore, we deposit the Phenix map in EMDB.</p><p>We did apply C3 symmetry to obtain the initial 4.2 Å map. This is now clearly indicated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Our final data processing procedure includes a step to exclude part of the map by using a mask. This is because substantial heterogeneity is present in the intracellular side of the transmembrane domain,. As we are primarily interested in the PIP2 binding site, which is located in the ECD-TMD interface., we decide to exclude signals in the intracellular region of the transmembrane domain for final refinement. This will allow us to improve the density for the PIP2 binding site and facilitate model building. We deposited this reconstruction as well as the full PAC map without using such a mask in EMDB in this revision.</p><p>The transparent outline is a non-sharpened map at a low contour level with the aim to show the nanodisc density. This will allow the readers to distinguish different regions of the PAC structure (ECD and TMD) easily. It is not a mask for refinement. We modified the figure S3 legend to better describe this. As the reviewer suggested, we also showed the mask used in the last step of refinement in Figure S3. This mask excluded the intracellular portion of PAC TMD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. While not absolutely necessary, it could be helpful to mention for those unfamiliar with this protein family that it is also referred to as ASOR.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we have mentioned that this protein family is also referred to as ASOR in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Table S1, map resolution range: is 246 A a typo? This seems unusually low.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. This is indeed a typo and we have fixed this in Table S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors need to address the subcellular localization of PI(4,5)P2 and why their findings are surprising. Although they cite previous studies that have identified PI(4,5)P2 on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, it is a minor component of total PIP2 (see Yoneda et al. 2020, Figure 1). The localization and function of cellular PIP2 has been extensively studied (reviewed in Schink et al. 2016, PMID 27576122) and few roles for extracellular/lumenal PIP2 have been described to date. It is unlikely (albeit possible) that a native regulatory mechanism for PIP2 exists in this context, and the conclusions of the paper should reflect this fact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insight, we agree that PIP2 predominantly localizes to the inner leaflets of the cell membrane. We have further clarified in the Discussion section of our paper that the physiological relevance (if any exists) of PIP2 inhibition of the PAC channel is unclear. Nevertheless, the novel lipid-binding pocket is a relevant discovery that can be exploited for targeted inhibition of the PAC channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The density of PAC with PIP2 (Figure S4) does not support the placement of the PIP2 headgroup. The authors acknowledge this fact with the following points in the Results section: &quot;it is by no means unambiguous due to the limited local map resolution&quot; and &quot;the phosphatidyl group is reasonably well defined… in contrast, the inositol 4,5-bisphosphate moiety is not resolved&quot;. Confusingly, the authors also state that the deposited model does not contain the inositol headgroup (Figure 3A) but the attached validation files indicate that it has been (Molecule 3, PIO &quot;Ligand of interest&quot;). The authors need to decide whether their experimentally resolved data supports the positioning of bound PIP2 in the PAC structure (Figure 3A-C) or does not (the main text and figure legends, Figure S4). In doing so, the authors should consider the possibility of contaminating ligands from the other lipids (e.g. phosphatidic acid) in their preparation. Furthermore, in absence of supporting data, Figure 3C should be excluded from the manuscript. While it is apparent that the modeled basic residues are important for PAC inhibition by PIP2 (Figure 3E) and the authors are careful to note that the model is used to highlight the local biochemical (electrostatic) environment, the presentation of the figure (e.g. distance lines for electrostatic interactions) suggests more certainty than is warranted. Finally, note the pKA of inositol phosphates (Kooijman et al. 2009, PMID: 19725516); they will be partially protonated at pH 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 3C to show the density of the lipid and important residues nearby. In our initial manuscript, we already acknowledged the fact that the assignment of PIP2 into the density is not unambiguous based on the cryo-EM map. However, the biochemical environment of the binding pocket, as well as the subsequent mutagenesis data support such a PIP2 binding site. We now re-wrote the paragraph to make this even clearer.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the issue of PIO in the deposited model. We used the wrong model containing the head group, which is intended to be used only for making illustrations, for validation. We have now uploaded a new validation report using the correct model.</p><p>We acknowledge the referenced literature (Kooijman et al. 2009, PMID: 19725516) that the phosphate group may be partially protonated at pH 4, but this study is unable to reliably estimate the pK<sub>a2</sub> of PI(4,5)P2 and the pK<sub>a1</sub> is not studied. Moreover, in Figure 7 of the paper, no major difference is observed in the charge status of PI(4,5)P2 at pH 4-5, suggesting that the ionization status of PIP<sub>2</sub> doesn’t change in the experimental condition investigated in our study. In a more recent review of PI(4,5)P2, it was suggested that at pH 4-5, both of the phosphomonoester groups are mono-protonated (Luís Borges-Araújo and Fabio Fernandes 2020, PMID: 32858905). Therefore, a net charge of -2 is present in the head group of PI(4,5)P2 under our experimental conditions, which allowed the molecule to interact favorably with the positively charged binding pocket (Figure 3C).</p></body></sub-article></article>
