patient selection are essential for the successful and rapid development of emerging targeted anti-cancer therapeutics. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel patient selection strategy for the p53–HDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097, currently under evaluation in clinical trials. By intersecting high-throughput cell line sensitivity data with genomic data, we have identified a gene expression signature consisting of 13 up-regulated genes that predicts for sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 in both cell lines and in patient-derived tumor xenograft models. Interestingly, these 13 genes are known p53 downstream target genes, suggesting that the identified gene signature reflects the presence of at least a partially activated p53 pathway in NVP-CGM097-sensitive tumors. Together, our findings provide evidence for the use of this newly identified predictive gene signature to refine the selection of patients with wild-type p53 tumors and increase the likelihood of response to treatment with p53–HDM2 inhibitors, such as NVP-CGM097.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06498.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06498.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06498.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stress from daily activities and exposure to chemicals or UV radiation can all damage cells. Damaged cells may develop into cancerous tumors if unchecked. Normally, a protein called p53 helps to repair or eliminate damaged cells and prevent tumors from forming. The p53 protein does this by switching on or off genes that control DNA repair, cell division, and cell death. But half of all cancerous tumors have mutations that prevent p53 from doing its job.</p><p>Another protein called HDM2 keeps p53 in check by binding to p53 and preventing it from switching on and off genes after the stress passes. In cancers that have normal p53, sometimes HDM2 is overly active and prevents p53 from suppressing tumor formation and growth. Scientists are developing anticancer drugs that work by targeting HDM2; this frees p53 and allows it to wipe out cancerous cells. However, it is not always clear which patients with cancer are the most likely to benefit from anti-HDM2 therapy.</p><p>Jeay et al. screened hundreds of cancer cells to determine which ones are sensitive to HDM2-targeting drugs. As expected, the screen revealed that cancer cells that have mutations in the gene encoding p53 are insensitive to the anti-HDM2 drug because there is no working p53 to free up. But about 60% of the cancer cells that have normal p53 proteins also did not respond to the anti-HDM2 therapy. This finding indicates that the presence of normal p53 protein is necessary but not sufficient for tumor cells to respond to anti-HDM2 therapy.</p><p>Next, Jeay et al. compared the patterns of gene expression in the cancer cells that responded to an anti-HDM2 drug with those in cells that didn't respond. The analysis showed that a group of 13 genes are expressed more in the cells that responded to the drug. All 13 genes are unexpectedly direct targets of p53, suggesting that p53 remains active in these tumor cells, even if it is not working optimally. To verify these results, Jeay et al. grew human tumors in mice and found that tumors with high expression of the 13 genes are sensitive to the anti-HDM2 drug (called NVP-CGM097). The experiments strongly suggest that this 13-gene signature can be used to determine if a patient with cancer will respond to anti-HDM2 therapy. Following on from this work, researchers have already launched an early clinical trial with the anti-HDM2 drug and will test whether this gene signature is indeed useful in a real clinical setting.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06498.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06498.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>translational oncology</kwd><kwd>predictive signature</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>HDM2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeay</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaulis</surname><given-names>Swann</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferretti</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name><name><surname>Bitter</surname><given-names>Hans</given-names></name><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>Moriko</given-names></name><name><surname>Valat</surname><given-names>Thérèse</given-names></name><name><surname>Murakami</surname><given-names>Masato</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruetz</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name><name><surname>Guthy</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rynn</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiesmann</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name><name><surname>Kallen</surname><given-names>Joerg</given-names></name><name><surname>Furet</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name><name><surname>Gessier</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><name><surname>Holzer</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name><name><surname>Masuya</surname><given-names>Keiichi</given-names></name><name><surname>Würthner</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name><name><surname>Halilovic</surname><given-names>Ensar</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofmann</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name><name><surname>Sellers</surname><given-names>William R</given-names></name><name><surname>Graus Porta</surname><given-names>Diana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>All research costs were covered by Novartis AG.

In its normal state, the p53 transcription factor acts in response to oncogenic or other stress signals to induce or repress a variety of target genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris and Levine, 2005</xref>). In normal cells, the levels of p53 protein are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 that targets p53 for ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haupt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubbutat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marine and Lozano, 2010</xref>). In addition, HDM2 binding to p53 blocks its transactivation domain preventing p53 transcriptional activation of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Momand et al., 1992</xref>). HDM2 is itself a p53 target gene and hence acts as part of a negative feedback loop which maintains low cellular concentrations of both partners under non-stressed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picksley and Lane, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freedman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michael and Oren, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bond et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Approximately, 50% of all tumors display inactivating mutations in p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hainaut and Hollstein, 2000</xref>) leading to its partial or complete loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levine and Oren, 2009</xref>). In many cancers where <italic>TP53</italic> is not mutated, the function of the p53 pathway is often compromised through other mechanisms, including HDM2 gain of function by amplification and/or overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wade et al., 2010</xref>). In these instances blocking the interaction between p53 and HDM2 is hypothesized to stabilize p53 leading to pathway activation and growth arrest and/or apoptosis in cancer. Based on this hypothesis and the structural elucidation of the p53–HDM2 interaction, several HDM2 small molecule inhibitors have been developed and are now in clinical trials. Indeed, prior work has shown that in human cancer cell lines or xenografts such inhibitors can elicit potent anti-tumor effects as a result of induction of cell cycle growth arrest and an apoptotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poyurovsky and Prives, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheok et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe a novel and highly specific p53–HDM2 inhibitor, NVP-CGM097, currently in phase I clinical testing (NCT01760525) and a close analog NVP-CFC218 that are both based on an isoquinolinone scaffold. In order to identify patients most likely to respond to inhibitors of HDM2, we sought to develop patient selection biomarkers based on large-scale cancer cell line profiling. The analysis of sensitivity profiles across 356 cell lines led to the confirmation that p53 mutant cancer cells fail to respond to HDM2 inhibitors. However, among wild-type p53 cancer cells sensitivity was heterogeneous and not solely associated with HDM2 gene amplification. Using an unbiased discovery approach, the expression of 13 genes (including HDM2) was found to have robust and superior predictive value for response compared to p53 wild-type status alone. This novel 13-gene signature was validated both in vitro and in vivo, and has the potential to improve the selection strategy of patients bearing p53 wild-type tumors who are most likely to respond to treatment with NVP-CGM097. Surprisingly, all 13 genes were p53 target genes suggesting that cells harboring at least partially activated p53 are those that are most susceptible to further p53 activation upon disruption of the p53–HDM2 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activity of NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 in biochemical and cellular assays</title><p>NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 are substituted 1,2-dihydroisoquinolinone derivatives that were designed to mimic three key hydrophobic interactions made by p53 residues Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 in the HDM2 pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kussie et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">García-Echeverría et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furet et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Both NVP-CFC218 and NVP-CGM097 displaced the p53 peptide from the surface of HDM2 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.6 ± 0.2 nM and 1.7 ± 0.1 nM, respectively. In contrast, both compounds were substantially less active against HDMX with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1300 ± 100 nM and 2000 ± 300 nM. These data show that NVP-CFC218 and NVP-CGM097 are specific inhibitors of the p53–HDM2 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>In measures of cellular viability, NVP-CFC218 and NVP-CGM097 elicited strong anti-proliferative effects in the HCT116 p53<sup>WT</sup> cell line and showed 34- and 35-fold selectivity, respectively, compared to an isogenic HCT116 cell line in which the <italic>TP53</italic> gene was deleted by homozygous recombination. Similarly, both compounds blocked proliferation of the osteosarcoma HDM2-amplified SJSA-1 cell line with 56- and 58-fold selectivity, respectively, compared to a control p53-null osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 inhibit cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner with a comparable potency and selectivity in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pharmacological activity of p53–HDM2 inhibitors in cancer cell lines</title><p>In order to investigate the activity of HDM2 inhibitors in preclinical models of cancer and to ultimately identify biomarkers predictive of response, we tested the anti-proliferative activity of NVP-CFC218 in a panel of 477 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>). After quality control and manual curation of the dose response curves, a total of 356 cell lines met the cell viability quality criteria for NVP-CFC218 and were used for subsequent analyses. Cell lines were partitioned into sensitive and insensitive groups based on compound potency (IC<sub>50</sub>). A rank-order plot of IC<sub>50</sub>s for NVP-CFC218 showed a natural cut-off of 4 μM, which was used to categorize cell lines. Forty seven cell lines were categorized as sensitive and 309 cell lines as insensitive. For the sensitive cell lines, the maximal compound effect level (Amax) was ≤ −50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). As expected, based on the mechanism of action of NVP-CFC218, most of the sensitive cell lines harbored wild-type p53 (n = 43) and this association was statistically significant by Fisher's exact test (p-value = 5.1 × 10<sup>−23</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, repeat cell proliferation assays with the four sensitive cell lines bearing mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> showed them to be insensitive (P12-ICHIKAWA, KBMC-2, and Hs 294T with IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 8 µM) or the reported mutation did not lead to complete p53 loss of function (NCI-H2122 carries both Q16L and C176F p53 mutations which are categorized as neutral and partially deleterious mutations by SIFT, respectively).</p><p>A parallel, unbiased orthogonal analysis of cell line sensitivities to over 2000 compounds, grouped by their mechanism of action (or main target), revealed that p53–HDM2 inhibitors including NVP-CFC218 were the most selectively enriched compound class in the p53 wild-type cell line set as compared to the p53 mutant set, with both a false discovery rate (FDR) and a p-value below the cut-offs of 0.25 and 0.05, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, among all p53 wild-type cell lines for which compound data were available, 57% scored insensitive to NVP-CFC218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that a patient selection strategy based only on the p53 status of the tumor will not optimally enrich for patients with a high likelihood of responding to this targeted therapy. Hence, there is a need for more sensitive and predictive biomarkers for p53–HDM2 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Establishing a predictive model for p53–HDM2 inhibitor sensitivity in cell lines</title><p>We utilized a similar approach as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>) to identify molecular correlates of compound sensitivity to NVP-CFC218. We first applied a variance filter to remove half of the genes with the lowest variance, yielding 9053 genes. The group of sensitive cell lines (n = 47) was then compared to the group of most insensitive ones for which IC<sub>50</sub> and Amax of NVP-CFC218 was ≥8 μM and ≤ −50%, respectively (n = 204). To build a predictive model, we used bootstrapping, whereby the cell lines were randomly split into training and testing sets. Within each bootstrapped data split where 2/3 of the data was used for training and 1/3 for testing, we used the Wilcoxon uni-variate test to select features that were significantly differentially expressed between sensitive and insensitive lines. Using the selected features, a naïve Bayes classifier was trained to predict sensitivity status. The number of features selected varied from 5 to 100 and for each, 20 bootstrapped data splits were conducted. We then assessed the classifier performance based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the predictions on the test data.</p><p>The classification accuracy, averaged over twenty bootstraps, was generally higher than 80% with a maximum of ∼93% when 17 genes were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, red dot). The average classification accuracy with the fewest features within 1 SEM of the maximum was when 13 genes were selected. Class-level performance metrics, such as sensitivity and specificity, also showed that the 13-gene solution performed similarly to the optimum or optimally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Sensitivity was the highest for the 13-gene solution, while the highest specificity was observed with 17 genes. However, the 13-gene solution was within 1 SEM of the best specificity. Thus, the 13-gene classifier was found to be the optimal solution, yielding the following performance statistics: 93% accuracy (±2.3%), 87% sensitivity (±10%), and 94% specificity (±2.8%).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06498.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Predictive modeling of NVP-CFC218 chemical sensitivity from CCLE expression data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Prediction accuracy estimation by bootstrapping analysis upon increasing feature set size.

The same two-class comparison as before yielded a total of 215 significant features from multiple types. The <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status was the feature most associated with response to NVP-CFC218 (p-value = 2.46 × 10<sup>−26</sup>), with an odds-ratio of 0.013.</p><p>To further evaluate the 13-gene signature model, we compared its prediction performance to that of both ‘<italic>TP53</italic> mutation status’ and a naïve Bayes classifier trained on the ‘215-feature set’. We compared ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves based on the predictions made on the test sets across 5 cross-validation runs for the models based on the 215-feature set, the 13-gene signature and the predictions given by <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status (i.e. the presence of a TP53 mutation predicts insensitivity, while a wild-type genotype predicts sensitivity). The AUC for the 13-gene signature was higher than for 215-feature set model: 0.947 vs 0.855 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and E</xref>). Furthermore, the precision–recall curves for the 13-gene signature showed that an 80% true sensitive prediction rate could be achieved while recalling more than 90% of the truly NVP-CFC218-sensitive cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and E</xref>). The class-level performance measures showed that the 13-gene signature provided a substantial improvement in predicting response to NVP-CFC218 in particular when performance was evaluated by positive predictive value (PPV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>): 76% for the ‘13-gene signature’ vs 59% for the ‘215-feature set’ vs 63% for ‘<italic>TP53</italic> mutation status’. The enrichment of response when using the 13-gene signature and associated predictive model as a sample stratification strategy was also strongly significant when compared to the baseline response rate without prior stratification, estimated from the NVP-CFC218 sensitivity data as 19%.</p><p>Additionally in a p53 wild-type background (n=68), the 13-gene signature was compared to the p53 mutation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since in this comparison, the p53 model does not predict any insensitive cell lines, no AUC or NPV can be calculated. The table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref> shows a sensitivity of 94.9%, a specificity of 79.2%, a PPV of 88.7%, and a NPV of 90% for the 13-gene signature. In comparison, p53 mutation model has a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 0%, and a PPV of 63.2%. As before, the 13-gene model outperforms the p53 mutation model in terms of PPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Thus, these results show that the 13-gene signature provides an improvement in response prediction to drug treatment over both the <italic>TP</italic>53 mutation status and the larger signature consisting of 215 significant features. Moreover, these results suggest that the 13-gene signature has utility in TP53 wild-type genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Predicting HDM2 inhibitor sensitivity in independent cell lines and primary tumors</title><p>The predictive value of the 13-gene signature was subsequently tested in a second, independent data set of cell lines representative of multiple cancer types representative of the lineages included in the first proliferation screen. Cells were assayed for their sensitivity to both p53–HDM2 inhibitors NVP-CGM097 (n = 52) and NVP-CFC218 (n = 38) in in vitro proliferation assays. Because of the manual assay format differing slightly from the high-throughput assay, the cut-off for sensitivity was fixed at IC<sub>50</sub> ≤ 3 µM for both p53–HDM2 inhibitors and predictions of sensitivity for every cell line were derived using the 13-gene signature. As expected, cells that were indeed sensitive or insensitive to NVP-CGM097 were similarly sensitive or insensitive to NVP-CFC218, except for one cell line (COLO-829) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, 36/52 and 26/38 cell lines were predicted to be sensitive to NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218, respectively, while 27/52 and 23/38 were truly sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). While we observed a slight decrease in specificity relative to the bootstrap estimate, sensitivity measures were 89% and 91% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), respectively, which is comparable to the sensitivity estimate obtained by bootstrapping the predictive model training data (87.3% ± 10.4%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Noticeably, PPV values for both drugs were higher than basal response rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together these data validate the 13-gene signature as a robust predictor for sensitivity to both NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 p53–HDM2 inhibitors in an external sample set. We also determined the performance of the 13-gene signature in pre-selected cells based upon the presence of wild-type p53. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, 35/42 and 25/30 wild-type p53 cell lines were predicted to be sensitive to NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218, respectively, while 25/35 and 21/25 were truly sensitive. PPV values were moderately higher than the basal response rate by 5 to 7%, and the relatively small number of insensitive p53<sup>WT</sup> cell lines in this external set greatly impaired the specificity and NPV values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate the 13-gene signature to be a better predictive feature than <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status in unselected cell lines.

In order to exclude this possibility, we assessed the presence of the signature in primary human tumor samples. For this purpose, we used the 13-gene signature, associated with the naïve Bayes predictive model trained on cell line data, to interrogate a collection of ∼21,300 human tumor samples for which the whole genome expression profiles are available. Here, we reasoned that the proportion of samples of any given lineage that scored positively for the signature would be a measure of the concordance between cell line expression data and primary human tumor data. The specific proportion of any given lineage among primary human tumor samples scoring positive for the presence of the 13-gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) was found to be very similar to the lineage proportions of signature positive, sensitive cell lines in the CCLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), as probed by the NVP-CFC218 chemical sensitivity experiment described above. These data suggest that the 13-gene signature is not likely an artifact of the in vitro culture. In keeping with this observation, the 13-gene signature identified a fraction of predicted sensitive human primary tumor samples within our patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) collection (n = 503) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), thus allowing the selection of models for further in vivo validation of its predictive power. In summary, these analyses provide an estimation of the prevalence of 13-gene signature positivity across various cancer indications and underscore additional cancer types with high signature positivity, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma that may have been underrepresented in the in vitro cell line profiling approach.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06498.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prevalence of the 13-gene signature in human primary tumors and patient-derived tumor xenograft models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fraction of human primary tumors predicted sensitive by the 13-gene signature.

As to compare with Nutlin 3a, NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 show differences in binding mode within the p53 binding site of HDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Valat et al., 2014</xref>, manuscript in preparation), which allows better in vitro and in vivo on-target potency, more favorable drug-like properties, and improved in vivo behavior of this compound family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferretti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeay et al., 2014</xref>). NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 were first tested in cell-free assays, where both were shown to selectively inhibit p53–HDM2 binding. In cells, consistent with their mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheok et al., 2011</xref>) and in line with their highly selective nature, both compounds showed comparable anti-proliferation effects in HCT-116 and SJSA-1 wild-type p53-expressing cell lines. The isogenic HCT-116 p53-null cells and the osteosarcoma SAOS-2 p53 null cells remained insensitive to NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 with IC<sub>50</sub>s ≥ 10 µM. Furthermore, in cell viability assays, using 356 cancer cell lines from the CCLE representative of various tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>), NVP-CFC218 was shown to inhibit proliferation of about 13.2% of the cancer cell lines tested at relevant concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, 91.5% (43/47) of NVP-CFC218-sensitive cells expressed wild-type p53, consistent with its mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Importantly, the sensitivity of 3/4 of these cells bearing mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> couldn't be reproduced (P12-ICHIKAWA, KBMC-2 and Hs 294T with IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 8 µM), while the sensitivity of the NCI-H2122 <italic>TP53</italic> mutant cell line was confirmed in repeat cell proliferation assays. Interestingly, the reported p53 mutations in NCI-H2122 cells (i.e., Q16L and C176F p53) are categorized as being only partially deleterious, suggesting the p53 pathway remains partially functional in these cells. In line with the strong association of p53 mutation with lack of sensitivity to NVP-CFC218, sensitivity response comparison to over 2000 compounds, grouped by their mechanism of action, showed that wild-type p53 cell lines in the CCLE were most sensitive to p53–HDM2 inhibitors, including NVP-CFC218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, 57% (57/100) of the p53 wild-type cell lines for which compound sensitivity data were available, scored insensitive to NVP-CFC218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). These results indicate that the selection of tumors based only on their p53 mutation status may not be optimal in order to tailor patient selection towards maximal response rate. With the aim to discover more sensitive biomarkers for patient selection, an in vitro predictive model was developed based on the integrative analysis of the genomic features of this panel of 356 cancer cell lines and their association with sensitivity to NVP-CFC218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>). A 13-gene signature was found to be the optimal solution at predicting p53–HDM2 inhibition from gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A further outcome of these studies identified p53 mutation status as being a strong predictor for insensitivity to NVP-CFC218 among about 40,000 input features containing genomic, lineage, and gene expression features, confirming in an unbiased manner the underlying hypothesis for this specific mechanism of action. In addition, a broader set of 215 newly discovered significant features were identified as being correlated to NVP-CFC218 sensitivity. Interestingly, HDM2 expression was found as the second ranked significant feature (after p53 mutation) confirming its correlation with sensitivity to p53–HDM2 inhibitors in an unbiased manner. However, HDM2 amplification was not revealed by the modeling, most likely because of the low representation of HDM2-amplified cell lines in CCLE. Surprisingly, 13/14 of the top most significant expression features corresponded to well-known p53 target genes and their up-regulated expression was found associated with increased sensitivity to NVP-CFC218 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The 14<sup>th</sup> feature, unannotated at the time of this work, was found to be RPL22L1, previously described as having a central role in αβ T lymphocytes development, together with its highly homologous paralog RPL22, by up-regulating p53 in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The positive predictive value of this 13-gene signature was found to outperform both the p53 mutation feature alone and the 215 significant feature-set (76% vs 63% and 59%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, comparable performances were found in an additional set of independent cell lines tested for their sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218, validating the predictive power of the 13-gene signature in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>This cell line-derived 13-gene signature was demonstrated to be suitable for the identification of human primary tumors predicted to be sensitive to a p53–HDM2 inhibitor across a set of about 21,300 human tumor samples and across a collection of 503 patient-derived tumor xenograft models, with available genome-wide expression data. Interestingly, the prevalence of the 13-gene signature was found to be quite variable within the multiple lineages tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, however, the lineage-specific proportion of samples scoring positive for the 13-gene signature was strikingly comparable to the proportion of sensitive cell lines to NVP-CFC218, in a given lineage. Furthermore, the application of the signature across a large set of human tumor samples revealed new indications of potential interest for the development of p53–HDM2 inhibitors, such as renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), that had been previously missed due to their under-representation in the set of CCLE cell lines tested. The ability of the 13-gene signature to differentiate signature-positive from signature-negative patient-derived tumor xenografts, allowed testing its in vivo predictive value across a set of these models. In line with the in vitro findings, the 13-gene signature was found to greatly outperform the random response rate to NVP-CGM097 in vivo, independently upon whether the xenograft models were pre-selected or not for their p53 mutation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Many research efforts have been devoted to the characterization of molecular mechanisms conferring gene-specific regulation within the p53 network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). It has been observed that in proliferating cells, minimal activity of p53 can lead to basal expression of some of its target genes, such as p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 1998</xref>), through mechanisms involving basal promoter-specific recruitment of transcription initiation components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Espinosa and Emerson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Espinosa et al., 2003</xref>). In a more recent study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al. (2014)</xref>, using Global Run-On sequencing, gene-specific regulatory mechanisms affecting a number of key survival and apoptotic genes within the p53 network were uncovered. The authors imply that some p53 target genes can be ‘primed’ to be switched on even before the p53 protein is activated, leading to a rapid transcription of these genes following p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>). Some of these p53 target genes, such as <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>HDM2</italic>, <italic>CCNG1</italic>, <italic>DDB2</italic>, <italic>FDXR</italic>, <italic>BAX</italic>, <italic>TNFRSF10B</italic>, and <italic>AEN</italic>, were found to be within the top most transcribed genes following Nutlin-3 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>) and coincidently are all included in the 13-gene signature described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Taking together, these observations strongly suggest that the p53 target gene set contained within the predictive 13-gene signature is representative of an underlying activated p53 pathway that renders cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumor xenografts sensitive to p53–HDM2 inhibitors. Thus, it is reasonable to think that the 13-gene signature discovered here is best at predicting sensitivity to p53–HDM2 inhibitors, since it not only discriminates mutant p53 from wild-type p53 tumors, but also tumors that have an intact p53 gene but a silent p53 pathway from those that are p53 wild-type and bear an activated pathway. We postulate that the latter may be more prone to quickly induce a robust p53-dependent transcriptional response upon exposure to p53–HDM2 inhibitors, thus being more sensitive to this specific anti-cancer therapy.</p><p>Altogether, this work highlights the power of a biomarker discovery approach based on large-scale data generation and unbiased data analysis, followed by robust validation using various independent samples sets. Furthermore, the finding that the 13-gene signature corresponds to a set of p53 target genes and that its positivity reflects activity of the p53 pathway, demonstrates the intimate relationship between the biomarker set and the mechanism of action of the targeted therapy, hence its potentially broad applicability to any selective p53–HDM2 inhibitor for optimal patient selection. On these bases, we are currently evaluating the 13-gene signature in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT01760525), in cancer patients bearing p53 wild-type tumors treated with NVP-CGM097.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical entities</title><p>NVP-CFC218 and NVP-CGM097 were synthesized by Global Discovery Chemistry (NIBR, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland).

(2012)</xref>. First, a selected compound sensitivity metric was log2 transformed and a selectivity score was computed by multiplying the metric Z-score by the absolute value of the metric. We then performed a Wilcoxon test opposing the two groups of cell lines and corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochberg FDR, followed by an enrichment analysis by the compound's main target. To this end, compounds were grouped into target classes, and Fisher's exact tests were performed with compounds considered as significantly differentially responsive when the FDR was below 0.25. The cut-off for the FDR is lenient as this is used for enrichment purposes. Finally, we corrected the p-values obtained from enrichment analysis for multiple testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Genomic and genetic characterization of CCLE cell lines</title><p>The genomic and genetic characterization of a panel of cancer-relevant cell lines was undertaken mostly as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>).

All calculations were done with R-3.0.2 using principally e1071 and caret R libraries.</p><p>The broader, 215-feature set, that discriminates NVP-CFC218 sensitive from insensitive cell lines, was obtained as follows: Wilcoxon signed-rank tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the genomic features of the sensitive to insensitive groups. Features having continuous values (gene expression and copy number, pathway expression features) were subjected to Wilcoxon sum rank test, while those having discrete values (genetic alteration, tumor suppressor status, and lineage features) to Fisher's exact test. Significant features passed a local (by feature type) FDR of 0.25. Irrespective of the FDR, a minimum or maximum number of features per feature type were also required. To minimize the impact of the high degree of correlation among the features on the feature selection step, the feature data were clustered before statistical testing by Affinity Propagation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey and Dueck, 2007</xref>) to only keep features representing the most variability.</p><p>To compare sensitivity prediction accuracies of the 13-gene signature to both, the 215-feature set and <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, naïve Bayes probabilistic models were then built from the respective feature sets. The performances of classifications were evaluated with 5 repeats of 5-fold cross-validations of the train data. To transform the naive Bayes probabilities into a sensitive or insensitive class-level prediction, a threshold was defined as the probability maximizing the sensitivity and specificity. The entire and nearly identical procedure is described in more details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al.

However, to account for the latest NVP-CFC218 pharmacological characterization on cell lines and to take advantage of a larger training data set, the naïve Bayes classifier was trained on a wider cell line compendium (634 cell lines, 77 and 557 of which being NVP-CFC218-sensitive and NVP-CFC218-insensitive, respectively). Moreover, the naïve Bayes-predictive model probability threshold, above which a xenograft tumor model is predicted as sensitive to p53–HDM2 inhibition, was also further set to 0.2 (optimizing for PPV/Precision at the cost of Sensitivity/Recall).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vivo studies in mice</title><p>All animal studies were conducted in accordance to procedures covered by permit number 1975 issued by the Kantonales Veterinäramt Basel-Stadt and strictly adhered to the Eidgenössisches Tierschutzgesetz and the Eidgenössische Tierschutzverordnung.

In vivo models showing a progressive disease (&gt;35% increase in tumor volume) were considered as non-responsive to NVP-CGM097 treatment.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript by Jeay et al. reports the discovery of a 13-gene signature that can predict the sensitivity of tumor cell lines and patient-derived tumor xenografts to small molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction with great accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The manuscript is conceptually simple yet of very high impact.</p><p>The current manuscript not only reports the discovery of two novel inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction, but also describes an experimental tour-de-force to identify the much-needed biomarker. These efforts lead the authors to identify a 13-gene signature that can predict the cellular response in vitro and in vivo, including patient-derived xenografts, with great accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Remarkably, the gene signature is composed of 13 known direct transcriptional targets of p53 whose expression is strongly elevated in cell lines and tumors prior to MDM2 inhibition. This indicates that the sensitive cell lines harbor a more transcriptionally active form of p53 that 'primes' a fraction of its transcriptional program in proliferating cancer cells. This finding counters the prevalent notion that sensitivity is defined by MDM2 amplification, which would result in very low levels of active p53.</p><p>Although the paper does not make great mechanistic insights into p53 biology, its broad applicability makes it of very high impact. If this biomarker works in the clinic, it is likely to profoundly change the course of the current clinical trials and future use of MDM2 inhibitors in cancer therapy. Accordingly, the reviewers agreed on recommending resubmission of a revised manuscript addressing the following major points:</p><p>1) It seems like p53<sup>WT</sup> (mutational status) is a good predictive marker for this compound, why is this information not taken into account when building the naive Bayes classifier? Can the prediction improve when p53 mutational status is taken into account as part of the gene signature? Why not try to build a gene signature based on p53 wild type that is sensitive or insensitive to this compound? It seems like the validation steps of the gene signature are built on the logic that p53 wild type could be used as a feature, as the independent in vitro validation was only performed on the p53<sup>WT</sup> cell lines, and the PDX models were enriched with p53<sup>WT</sup> models.</p><p>2) The gene selection method based on the Wilcoxon test seems to be a little bit primitive. There are better and more advanced feature selection methods (like lasso type or machine learning approaches). Have the authors tried different approaches and come to the conclusions with the same set of genes? Have the authors tested with different machine learning approaches (e.g. SVM?)</p><p>3) The fold-change of the 13 selected genes seems to be modest, some of them even less than 2 fold. Can these changes be validated by other experimental approaches like RT-PCR? It seems like the training of the classifier is based on the full <italic>~</italic>52,000 probe sets, not genes. Have the authors found multiple probe sets representing the same genes ranked high in the feature selection step? This may strengthen the inclusion of these genes.</p><p>4) How is this gene signature going to translate into a biomarker test in a clinical trial? The hardest part is the RMA normalization of a new sample. In the validation steps, both in vitro and in vivo gene expression profiles were normalized as a batch, and the expression values are normalized with the training set? This is unclear, and how will the authors envision normalizing patient samples? As in a clinical trial, patients will be tested individually, not by batch, therefore, getting the gene expression values normalized to the same scale with the training model needs careful consideration. This is not clearly described in the text.</p><p>5) Finally, in the training and testing in vitro cell lines, many of the sensitive cell lines are from the hematopoetic cell lineages, but none of this cell lineage is represented in the PDX Models.

We compared the performance of the gene signature alone and with the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation feature. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>, the performances as judged by ROC analyses were found similar whether <italic>TP53</italic> mutation was integrated into the prediction (as determined either by all exon sequencing [blue curve] or only exon 5-8 sequencing [green curve]) or not (red curve). This finding supports the hypothesis that the presence of 13-gene signature already reflects the p53 wild-type status, but also the p53 pathway functional activity and then the inclusion of p53 mutation status does not provide significant new discriminatory information.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06498.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06498.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06498.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-06498-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>Building a gene signature based on p53 wild-type was tried as well but was found to be mainly limited by the number of p53 wild-type cell lines that are available. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-E</xref>, a total of 113 p53 wild-type cells are available, of which only 43 are sensitive and 70 are insensitive to NVP-CFC218. For this reason, this approach lost a lot of power which greatly impacted the significance of the feature differences.</p><p>The gene signature and associated predictive model were built independently of the p53 mutation status, by comparing the chemical sensitivities of both p53 wild-type and mutant cell lines. As discussed above, the inclusion of p53 mutation status into the predictions did not increase its performance. Based on the mechanism of action of the molecules and on the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-E</xref>, p53 wild-type status is required for sensitivity. It was then important to test our hypothesis in already pre-selected p53 wild-type cell lines, especially because in a clinical setting, only pre-selected p53 wild-type patients are being treated with NVP-CGM097. On the contrary, the in vivo validation in PDX was primarily performed independently of the p53 mutation status. The tumor models were stratified according to the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status in a retrospective manner, which allowed us to determine the performances of the gene signature in all 55 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), as well as in the p53 wild-type models only, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The gene selection method based on the Wilcoxon test seems to be a little bit primitive. There are better and more advanced feature selection methods (like lasso type or machine learning approaches)</italic>. <italic>Have the authors tried different approaches and come to the conclusions with the same set of genes? Have the authors tested with different machine learning approaches (e.g. SVM?)</italic></p><p>The choice of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was based on several factors. First, we have performed extensive mining of the CCLE using methods such as lasso, ridge regression, elastic net, or SVMs and have generally found similar results across the classification algorithms. To this aim, we employed these methods and found that the majority of the candidate features overlapped with what was found using the Wilcoxon test. Second, the Wilcoxon test is simple and conservative, two appealing properties for our purposes. Third, the method is quite scalable to the type of analysis we wanted to perform, i.e. gradually increasing the number of gene features to set the optimal classification under the most parsimonious set of genes. This analytical approach in combination with naïve Bayes probabilistic modeling is a machine learning approach with embedded feature selection, which is in our opinion an appropriate classification strategy.</p><p><italic>3) The fold-change of the 13 selected genes seems to be modest, some of them even less than 2 fold. Can these changes be validated by other experimental approaches like RT-PCR? It seems like the training of the classifier is based on the full ~52,000 probe sets, not genes. Have the authors found multiple probe sets representing the same genes ranked high in the feature selection step? This may strengthen the inclusion of these genes</italic>.</p><p>Indeed the fold changes are modest, nonetheless highly statistically significant. A likely explanation could come from the Affymetrix GeneChip© technology together with the RMA summarization method that was used for the gene expression measurements. Such a protocol is known to compress fold changes. Even if a RT-PCR quantification of the transcript expression is expected to reach about 10-20% higher fold changes, this has not been verified on this data set. However, the nanostring quantification of the 13 genes making signature became available in the meantime for most of the cell lines. As expected, the fold changes were found to remain within the same range, even if slightly higher than those from the microarrays. The RMA summarization method is based on the Michigan alternative CDF that summarizes the CEL data at the Entrez gene level. Consequently we did not try to integrate the multi-probe set representations in the analysis to strengthen the differential expression of some genes. We have now added a paragraph in the Material and methods section entitled 'Affymetrix GeneChip© RMA normalization' to better clarify the alternate CDF summarization in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) How is this gene signature going to translate into a biomarker test in a clinical trial?

As in a clinical trial, patients will be tested individually, not by batch, therefore, getting the gene expression values normalized to the same scale with the training model needs careful consideration. This is not clearly described in the text</italic>.</p><p>We do not foresee major difficulties to the prediction of independent samples using the gene signature, provided the same expression quantification technology is used (Affymetrix GeneChip©). To specifically discuss the RMA normalization step, all samples from the training as well as those from the test sets were not normalized all together as a batch, but with respect to an independent external data set consisting of both cancerous and normal samples of various lineage origins. Thus, any independent test sample can be individually RMA normalized to this reference batch. We have now added a paragraph in the Material and methods section entitled 'Affymetrix GeneChip© RMA normalization' to better clarify the RMA normalization step in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Finally, in the training and testing in vitro cell lines, many of the sensitive cell lines are from the hematopoetic cell lineages, but none of this cell lineage is represented in the PDX Models. How would this affect the predictions of the classifier</italic>?</p><p>The cell lines were picked up randomly with regards to lineage in the training and testing sets. The hematopoietic lineage was well represented in the training set (16%) even though the hematopoietic lineage (or any other lineage) as a feature was not found to be significantly over-represented in the sensitive cell lines globally. Therefore we did not anticipate that the hematopoietic lineage composition of the sensitive cell line set would interfere with or bias the feature selection or the naïve Bayes predictions. Because of the cell line availability, the hematopoietic lineage was also well represented in the testing set (27%), and indeed, many of them proved to be sensitive to both MDM2 inhibitors. On the contrary, no PDX models of the hematopoietic lineage are available in our collection and the lineage composition of the predictive model couldn't be reproduced in the in vivo validation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
