its downstream effectors have remained unclear. Here, we combined in vitro kinase assays with mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to identify hundreds of CMK-1 substrates, including the calcineurin A subunit TAX-6, phosphorylated within its conserved regulatory domain. Genetic and pharmacological analyses reveal multiple antagonistic interactions between CMK-1 and calcineurin signaling in modulating both naive thermal responsiveness and adaptation to repeated noxious stimuli. Cell-specific manipulations indicate that CMK-1 acts in AFD and ASER thermo-sensory neurons, while TAX-6 functions in FLP thermo-sensory neurons and downstream interneurons. Since CMK-1 and TAX-6 act in distinct cell types, the phosphorylation observed in vitro might not directly underlie the behavioral phenotype. Instead, the opposing effects seem to arise from their distributed roles within the sensory circuit. Overall, our study provides (1) a resource of candidate CMK-1 targets for further dissecting CaM kinase signaling and (2) evidence of a previously unrecognized, circuit-level antagonism between CMK-1 and calcineurin pathways. These findings highlight a complex interplay of signaling modules that modulate thermal nociception and adaptation, offering new insights into potentially conserved mechanisms that shape nociceptive plasticity and pain (de)sensitization in more complex nervous systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavioral plasticity</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>kinase substrates</kwd><kwd>CaM kinase</kwd><kwd>calcineurin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BSSGI0_155764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_150681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_197607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_212187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dengjel</surname><given-names>Jörn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphoproteomics identifies diverse CaM kinase substrates, while genetic dissection reveals an unexpected antagonistic interaction with calcineurin signaling that operates in distinct neurons to regulate thermo-nociception in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals from invertebrates to mammals can detect and avoid harmful stimuli, which is essential for their survival and well-being. Noxious stimuli are detected and encoded by specialized primary sensory neurons in a process called nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</xref>). Nociceptive signals are relayed in the nervous system via synaptic connections to be further processed and trigger different responses, such as behavioral changes and the perception of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Treede, 1995</xref>). Pain sensitivity is not fixed and can be adjusted in various physiological and pathological contexts through nociceptive plasticity processes such as hyperalgesia or nociceptive desensitization/habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kidd and Urban, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sandkühler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rodriguez-Raecke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breimhorst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">May et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O’Neill et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basith et al., 2016</xref>). Prolonged or repeated exposure to noxious stimuli can lead to either sensitization or desensitization/habituation depending on the stimuli intensity, frequency, and various physiological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Treede, 1995</xref>). Because impaired nociceptive habituation is linked to various human chronic pain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Tommaso et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Tommaso et al., 2011</xref>), obtaining a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular processes at play appears highly relevant to aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies for pain management. Several molecular mechanisms have been shown to modulate nociceptive pathways from the periphery to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuner and Flor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pace et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khan et al., 2019</xref>), which involve the regulated activity of proteins such as membrane receptors or ion channels (involved in sensory transduction, cell excitability, or signal conduction). Many kinases and phosphatases, which actuate protein regulation via the control of their phosphorylation status and that were previously shown to broadly regulate neural plasticity in the nervous system, are also involved in nociceptive plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Willis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang and Zhang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isensee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pace et al., 2018</xref>). These regulatory pathways include intracellular signaling by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), which might couple cellular activity levels with pleiotropic intracellular effects via post-translational modifications over a large repertoire of potential target proteins. Identifying the phosphorylation substrates of these kinases that act in the nociceptive pathway to mediate plasticity effects could provide relevant insight for future pain management translational research.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has emerged as a powerful model to study the molecular and cellular bases of nociception and its plasticity. <italic>C. elegans</italic> produces innate avoidance behaviors in response to a variety of noxious stimuli, including irritant chemicals, harsh touch and noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wittenburg and Baumeister, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hilliard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Noxious heat stimuli targeting the animal head or the entire animal trigger a stereotyped reversal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wittenburg and Baumeister, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne Rodgers and Ryu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lia and Glauser, 2020</xref>), which involves several thermo-sensory neurons, including AFD, AWC, and FLP, proposed to work as thermo-nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatzigeorgiou and Schafer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kotera et al., 2016</xref>). The molecular components underpinning the function of the nociceptive system are well-conserved. For example, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels mediate worm thermo-nociceptive responses, like in fly and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nkambeu et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, persistent or repeated noxious heat stimuli cause a progressive reduction in the rate of heat-evoked reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lia and Glauser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan and Glauser, 2023</xref>), which we will refer to here as thermo-nociceptive adaptation. A genetic screen for human pain-associated gene orthologs revealed thermo-nociceptive adaptation alterations for many corresponding worm mutants, substantiating the interest of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan and Glauser, 2023</xref>). Among conserved molecular players, the worm CaMKI (named CMK-1) was shown to mediate thermo-nociceptive adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lia and Glauser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan and Glauser, 2023</xref>). CMK-1 is broadly expressed in the worm nervous system and, beyond thermo-nociceptive adaptation, controls multiple experience-dependent plasticity processes, such as those related to developmental trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neal et al., 2015</xref>), the encoding of preferred growth temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2014</xref>), salt aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lim et al., 2018</xref>), and habituation to repeated touch stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardiel et al., 2018</xref>). CMK-1 was shown to regulate the expression of the <italic>guanylyl cyclase-8</italic> (<italic>gcy-8</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Satterlee et al., 2004</xref>), the AMPA glutamate receptor-1 (<italic>glr-1</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moss et al., 2016</xref>), the ortholog of the human DACH1/2 Dachsund transcription factor gene (<italic>dac-1</italic>) and the PY domain transmembrane protein-1 (<italic>pyt-1</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2023</xref>). The impact of CMK-1 on gene transcription is partially mediated by the CREB homolog-1 (CRH-1) transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2023</xref>), which could be phosphorylated by CMK-1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimura et al., 2002</xref>) and in a heterologous expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eto et al., 1999</xref>). A previous study used an in silico approach to systematically predict potential CMK-1 phosphorylation substrates and revealed repeated touch habituation phenotypes in mutants for several candidate targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardiel et al., 2018</xref>). Apart from these few studies, we still know very little on the CMK-1 downstream effectors that mediate the numerous biological actions of CMK-1, including in mediating thermo-nociceptive adaptation.</p><p>Calcineurin is a well-conserved eukaryotic Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin activated serine/threonine phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klee et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rusnak and Mertz, 2000</xref>), involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway and functioning in several tissues, such as muscles, T cells, and neurons, where it regulates synaptic plasticity and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mukherjee and Soto, 2011</xref>). Calcineurin regulates the activity of numerous proteins, such as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Molkentin, 2004</xref>), receptors, mitochondrial proteins, and microtubules depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peuker et al., 2022</xref>). Overexpression of calcineurin can cause cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yuan et al., 2024</xref>), higher infarct volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dai et al., 2024</xref>), whereas lack of function can cause defects in kidney development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gooch et al., 2004</xref>), and an increase in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ke et al., 2023</xref>). Chronic inhibition of calcineurin with immunosuppressant drugs, like Cyclosporin A, was shown to cause irreversible neuropathic pain in some patients, a phenomenon referred to as calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith, 2009</xref>). Several studies in mice have highlighted that calcineurin signaling modulate thermal nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sato et al., 2007</xref>). Several pathways working downstream of calcineurin signaling have been proposed to mediate the regulation of nociception, including NFAT transcription factors, TWIK-related spinal cord potassium channels (TRESK), TRP channels, and α2δ-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, we still have a cursory understanding of how calcineurin signaling integrates with other intracellular signaling pathways at different loci in the nociceptive circuit to orchestrate nociceptive plasticity.</p><p>Calcineurin is a heterodimeric protein consisting of one calcineurin A (CnA) catalytic subunit and one calcineurin B (CnB) regulatory subunit. CnA contains catalytic and autoinhibitory domains, as well as CnB and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-binding domains. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, the autoinhibitory domain suppresses catalytic phosphatase activity. Increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CnB and to CaM. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CnB and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in turn bind to CnA to release the autoinhibition, allowing substrates to access the active site and thereby the activation of CnA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuhara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

Lack of <italic>tax-6</italic> function causes thermal hypersensitivity and increased osmosensation, as well as increased adaptation of the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuhara et al., 2002</xref>).

CMK-1 was found to phosphorylate TAX-6/CnA in a highly conserved regulatory region, suggesting cross-regulation between CaMK and calcineurin signaling in worms. We next combined genetic and pharmacological manipulations with a quantification of noxious heat reversals to assess the role of CMK-1 and TAX-6 signaling and their interactions in controlling naive animal responsiveness and the adaptation to repeated stimulation. These follow-up analyses confirmed a complex set of antagonistic signaling actions produced by the two pathways. However, the two intracellular signaling pathways appear to primarily function in separate neuron types to control thermo-nociceptive adaptation, indicating that the phosphorylation of TAX-6/CnA by CMK-1 might not be relevant in vivo for the control of thermo-nociception. Collectively, our results reveal multiple direct and indirect interactions between CaMK and calcineurin signaling and pave the way for deeper studies on the molecular control of nociceptive adaptation in a simple genetic model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CMK-1 phosphorylates multiple substrates in vitro, including TAX-6/CnA</title><p>To identify phosphorylation substrates of CMK-1, we performed in vitro kinase assays on two types of substrate libraries followed by mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In two separate experiments, we assessed the phosphorylation produced by CMK-1(1–295)T179D, first, on a library of worm peptides produced by trypsin digestion of whole protein extracts and, second, on a whole protein library produced in non-denaturing conditions. As expected given the strong structural and functional conservation within the CaM kinase family, the consensus substrate motifs obtained with each substrate library matched the ΦXRXX(S/T)XXXΦ consensus previously characterized for mammalian CaMK (where Φ represents hydrophobic residues, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">White et al., 1998</xref>).

As more extensively discussed later in the text (see Discussion section), these datasets are expected to include both phosphosites that are relevant CMK-1 targets in vivo and ‘false positive’ phosphosites which are not relevant targets in vivo.

Outside of these categories and among the phosphosites common to our two datasets, we were intrigued by the presence of a CMK-1 target phosphosite on serine 443 of TAX-6/CnA. This phosphosite is located in a highly conserved region of TAX-6/CnA regulatory domain, just on the C-terminal side of the CaM-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Abundant phosphorylation of S443 was observed upon treatment with the constitutively active CMK-1 form, whereas this phosphorylation remained undetected with kinase-dead control treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Furthermore, the model considers that the inhibitory effect of TAX-6 on the CMK-1 anti-adaptation branch and the inhibitory effect of TAX-6 on the CMK-1 pro-adaptation branch are not of the same magnitude. Likewise, the two antagonistic direct effects of CMK-1 on adaptation are not of the same magnitude: upon CMK-1 overactivation (<italic>cmk-1(gf)</italic>) the direct pro-adaptation effect of CMK-1 signaling is larger than the anti-adaptation effect.

These findings suggest that (1) the vast majority of our hits are direct CMK-1 substrates in vitro and (2) the substrate specificity is conserved from worm to mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Large-scale empirical identification of CMK-1 phospho-targets</title><p>We have identified several hundred substrates that can be directly phosphorylated by CMK-1 in vitro. Our hit list is expected to include both substrates that are relevant in vivo and substrates that are not. Indeed, both the peptide library and the whole protein library datasets could include phosphosites coming from proteins that never encounter CMK-1 in vivo: for example, non-neuronal proteins, secreted proteins, or proteins residing in specific organelles. Furthermore, both datasets are expected to be biased toward abundant proteins, which are more likely to be detected. Accordingly, the strongest GO term enrichments in both datasets related to abundant and ubiquitous cellular components, involved in the translation process and cytoskeleton. Even if we cannot rule out an actual inclination of the CaM kinase pathway to regulate these processes, we suspect that these GO term enrichments rather reflect an analytical bias toward abundant proteins.</p><p>The relatively low overlap between the peptide and the protein library datasets can be explained by multiple effects. First, the peptide library dataset is expected to include phosphosites in protein regions that are usually inaccessible to CMK-1 because of protein folding or protein complex formation (increasing the false positive rate in the peptide library). Second, the trypsin-based cleavage prior to CMK-1 exposure in the peptide library protocol might impair proper substrate recognition by the kinase (increasing the false negative rate in the peptide library). Third, we have chosen quite strict criteria and applied them separately to define each hit list. For theoretical reasons, because substrates were presented to the kinase in a more native condition, we tend to give more trust to the protein library dataset, with the subset of targets also found in the peptide library as top hits.</p><p>A previous study reported a list of 533 CMK-1 candidate substrates based on in silico predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardiel et al., 2018</xref>). We found very little overlap between those predictions and our empirical datasets, with only five phosphosites shared with our peptide library list and one with our protein library list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This limited overlap could be explained either by a limited exhaustiveness across the three datasets (high false negative rate) or come from limitations affecting in silico predictions. In support of the second explanation, we note that the previously predicted phosphosite list only very partially matches the empirically determined CMK-1 substrate consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because we lack a solid reference point, it is nevertheless hard to estimate the false positive and false negative rates in our analyses at this stage. Additional experiments will be required to determine if the phosphorylation of these substrates is relevant in vivo, potentially on a case-by-case basis. Eventually, and keeping these limitations in mind, we believe that our large-scale dataset on the substrates which can by phosphorylated by CMK-1 in vitro will represent a useful resource in the search for CMK-1/CaMKI substrates mediating its numerous biological functions in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The phosphorylation of TAX-6/CnA by CMK-1/CaMKI</title><p>Previous in vitro studies have found that CnA can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, casein kinase I, casein kinase II, and by CaM kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hashimoto et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hashimoto and Soderling, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calalb et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rusnak and Mertz, 2000</xref>). We are not aware of any study having shown that CnA is a substrate of CaM kinase I. Here, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> CaMKI CMK-1 can phosphorylate TAX-6/CnA on S443. This specific phosphorylation event was confirmed in three different types of kinase assays: one using a peptide library, one using a protein library, and one using purified recombinant TAX-6/CnA as substrate. Ser 443 is located just downstream of the CaM-binding domain in a highly conserved region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>) that was previously found to be phosphorylated by mammalian CaMKII in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hashimoto et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hashimoto and Soderling, 1989</xref>). Because TAX-6/CnA and CMK-1 seem to mostly work in distinct neuronal cell-type to control nociceptive adaptation, it remains unclear whether TAX-6/CnA phosphorylation by CMK-1 is directly relevant for the control of this process in vivo. Nevertheless, since the expression patterns of CMK-1 and TAX-6/CnA largely overlap and since they are both activated by calcium signaling, we speculate that this phosphorylation event might be relevant to other neuronal regulatory signaling and we suggest it should be considered in future studies addressing the potential cross-talks between the two pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Complex interaction network and distributed cellular locus of actions for CMK-1 and calcineurin signaling</title><p>Our systematic analysis of CMK-1 and calcineurin signaling cross-talks has revealed a relatively complex regulatory network in which the two pathways mostly antagonize each other to regulate adaptation. As mentioned above, adaptation still takes place when CMK-1 and TAX-6/CnA are concomitantly inhibited, which led us to model their action as regulatory events controlling a separate adaptation process (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). While relatively complex, this model is the simplest we could articulate to explain all the empirically measured interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for a case-by-case illustration of the proposed regulatory network functioning in our different experimental conditions). In this model network, CMK-1 can regulate thermal nociception via three pathways: in the first pathway CMK-1 promotes adaptation by inhibiting TAX-6/CnA, which in turn inhibits adaptation. In the second and third pathways, CMK-1 works independently of TAX-6/CnA to inhibit and promote adaptation, respectively. These two latter pathways can each be gated by TAX-6/CnA. Therefore, both CMK-1 and calcineurin signaling activities may promote or inhibit adaptation and shifting their activity balance could represent a way to achieve nuanced yet robust modulation, integrating past activity with potentially additional cues. This complex regulation scheme would be hard to achieve if the two signaling pathways were working in a single neuronal cell type and it is therefore not surprising that our cell-specific approaches revealed multiple cellular loci of action in the circuit controlling temperature sensation and reversal execution.</p><p>In a previous study, CMK-1 was shown to work cell-autonomously in FLP to modulate thermo-nociceptive responses following persistent noxious heat stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schild et al., 2014</xref>). FLPs are ‘tonic’ thermo-sensory neurons, whose activity continuously reflects the current temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saro et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we show that AFDs, but not FLPs, constitute the main cellular locus of action of CMK-1-dependent plasticity in the case of repeated short-lasting stimulations. Interestingly, AFD are mostly ‘phasic’ thermo-sensory neurons producing activity peaks in response to thermal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kimura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hawk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glauser, 2022</xref>). They are thus ideally suited to encode repeated thermal pulses and modulate the heat-evoked reversal circuit. Laser ablation of AFD was previously shown to reduce reversal in response to head-targeted infra-red laser beams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we used thermal stimuli that were diffuse (whole animal exposure) and found that neither the genetic ablation of AFD, nor the cell-specific inhibition of neurotransmission affected the animal’s ability to produce heat-evoked reversals. Instead, AFD was essential to favor an experience-dependent reduction in heat-evoked reversal response. CMK-1 was previously shown to mediate both short-term (minute timescale) and long-term (hour timescale) adaptation in AFD intracellular calcium activity that resulted from thermal changes within the 15–25°C innocuous temperature range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Long-term changes involved gene expression changes, whereas the processes mediating short-term adaptation remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). At this stage, we do not know exactly how CMK-1 works in AFD to orchestrate thermo-nociceptive adaptation, but we can envision many possible mechanisms, including qualitative or quantitative modulation of AFD thermo-sensitivity, neuronal excitability, calcium dynamics, neurotransmitter or neuro-modulator release, or even developmental effect affecting AFD synaptic connectivity. Likewise, we do not know the downstream circuit involved. Among different possibilities, the CMK-1 signaling taking place in AFD could affect reversal via AFD’s direct interneuron partners AIZ and/or AIY, or engage extra-synaptic communication with neuropeptides. Additional studies will thus be needed to address the downstream processes that are engaged within and downstream of AFD to modulate animal responsiveness to noxious heat stimuli.</p><p>We found that calcineurin signaling works at multiple cellular loci to control thermo-nociceptive response. On the one hand, overactive TAX-6 activity in FLP is sufficient to increase reversal response in naive animals. Since FLP activity is known to favor reversal response, we might hypothesize that calcineurin activity could promote FLP activity. On the other hand, overactive TAX-6 activity in RIM or, to a lesser extent, in AVA/AVD/AVE neuron is sufficient to increase reversal response in naive animals, but conversely enhances reversal response upon repeated stimulation. This suggests that the impact that calcineurin signaling has in these neurons depends on past experience. AVA/AVD/AVE are thought to mostly promote reversal response, whereas RIM neuron activity might either up- or down-regulate reversal responses based on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkema et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Piggott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Sternberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2023</xref>). One particularly interesting observation is that cell-autonomous TAX-6 overactivation in interneurons acts as a major gate blocking adaptation irrespective of any CMK-1 activity manipulation. One hypothetical mechanism could be that TAX-6/CnA activity in worm would work in post-synaptic region of interneuron to adjust synaptic strength, for example, via its action on ion channels or on inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, as shown in various models of synaptic plasticity in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groth et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study reports the empirical identification of many potential CMK-1 targets in vitro, among which the catalytic subunit of Calcineurin TAX-6/CnA.

Alterations in habituation to noxious stimuli are associated with chronic pain in humans, however the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are not clear. This study uses the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> to study genes and mechanisms that underlie adaptation to a form of noxious stimuli based on heat, termed thermo-noxious stimuli. The authors previously showed that the Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CMK-1) regulates thermo-nociceptive adaptation in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Although CMK-1 is a kinase with many known substrates, the downstream targets relevant for thermo-nociceptive adaptation are not known. In this study, the authors use two different kinase screens to identify phosphorylation targets of CMK-1. One of the targets they identify is Calcineurin (TAX-6). The authors show that CMK-1 phosphorylates a regulatory domain of Calcineurin at a highly conserved site (S443). In a series of elegant experiments, the authors use genetic and pharmacological approaches to increase or decrease CMK-1 and Calcineurin signaling to study their effects on thermo-nociceptive adaptation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They also combine these various approaches to study the interactions between these two signaling proteins. The authors use specific promoters to determine in which neurons CMK-1 and Calcineurin function to regulate thermo-nociceptive adaptation. The authors propose a model based on their findings, illustrating that CMK-1 and Calcineurin act mostly in different neurons to antagonistically regulate adaptation to thermo-nociceptive stimuli in a complex manner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Given the conservation of adaptation across phylogeny, identifying genes and mechanisms that underlie nociceptive adaptation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may be relevant for understanding chronic pain in humans.</p><p>- The identification of canonical CaM Kinase phosphorylation motifs in the substrates identified in the CMK-1 substrate screen validates the screen.</p><p>- The use of loss and gain of function approaches to study the effects of CMK-1 and Calcineurin on thermo-nociceptive responses and adaptation is elegant.</p><p>- The ability to determine the cellular place of action of CMK-1 and Calcineurin using neuron specific promoters in the nematode is a clear strength of the genetic model system.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The manuscript begins by identifying Calcineurin as a direct substrate of CMK-1 but ends by showing that CMK-1 and Calcineurin mostly act in different neurons to regulate nociceptive adaptation, thus the physiological relevance of CMK-1 phosphorylation of Calcineurin is not clear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103497.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rudgalvyte</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Fribourg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zehan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Fribourg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kressler</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Fribourg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dengjel</surname><given-names>Jörn</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Fribourg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Friborug</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Fribourg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Goal: Find downstream targets of cmk-1 phosphorylation, identify one that also seems to act in thermosensory habituation, test for genetic interactions between cmk-1 and this gene, and assess where these genes are acting in the thermosensory circuit during thermosensory habituation.</p><p>Methods: Two in vitro analyses of cmk-1 phosphorylation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins.

As this reviewer points out, “adaptation” and “habituation” are often conflated. Many scientists (maybe not the majority though) use a less stringent definition for the word habituation, than the one presented by this reviewer. More particularly, the term habituation is used in human pain research to refer solely to the reduction of response to repeated stimuli, in the absence of a detailed assessment of the more stringent criteria mentioned here (see, e.g., PMID: 22337205 ; PMID: 18947923 ; PMID: 17258858; PMID: 20685171 ; PMID: 15978487). In addition to the practice in pain research, the main reason why we steered toward ‘habituation’ from our previous publication is because it immediately conveys the idea of a response reduction, whereas ‘adaptation’ could in principle be either an up-regulation or a downregulation of the response (again, based on various definitions). But we agree that using the word “habituation” came at the cost of triggering a confusion about the exact nature of the process, for those considering the stricter definition of the word “habituation” and those not in the narrower field of pain research. In the revised manuscript, we have thus changed this terminology to “adaptation”. Also following suggestions from Reviewer 2, we have strengthened the description of the protocol in the Result section and clarified, why the adaptation phenomenon is not a ‘thermal damage’ effect or ‘fatigue’ effect in the neuro-muscular circuit controlling reversal. One of the most convincing piece of evidence it cannot be solely explained by “damages” or “exhaustion” is simply the existence of non-adapting mutants (like <italic>cmk-1(lf)</italic>) or pharmacological treatments (Cyclosporin A) blocking the adaptation effect and enabling worm to continuously reverse for hours without any problems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the discrepancy between the in vitro phosphorylation experiments and the in silico predictions was discussed, the substantial discrepancy (over 85% of the substrates in the smaller in vitro dataset were not identified in the larger dataset) between the two different in vitro datasets was not discussed. This is surprising, as these approaches were quite similar, and it may indicate a measure of unreliability in the in vitro datasets (or high false negative rates).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. This is an important aspect which we now more extensively cover in the Discussion section.</p><p>The strong consistency of the CMK-1 recognition consensus sequences across the two in vitro dataset speaks against the unreliability of the analyses. Instead, there are a few points to highlight that explain the somewhat low degree of overlap between the two datasets, which indeed relate to the false negative rates as this reviewer suggests.</p><p>(1) In the peptide library analysis, Trypsin cleavage prior to kinase treatment will leave a charged N-term or C- terminus and in addition remove part of the protein context required for efficient kinase recognition. This will have a variable effect across the different substrates in the peptide library, depending on the distance between the cleavage site and the phosphosite, but will not affect the native protein library. This effect increases the false negative rate in the peptide library.</p><p>(2) The number and distribution of “available substrate phosphosites” diverge in the two libraries. Indeed, the peptide library is expected to contain a markedly larger diversity of potential CMK-1 substrate sites than the protein library (because the Trypsin digestion will reveal substrates that are normally buried in a native protein), but the depth of MS analysis is the same for the two libraries. In somewhat simplistic terms, the peptide-library analysis is prone to be saturated with abundant phosphorylated peptides, which prevent detecting all phosphosites. If the peptide analysis could have been made deeper, we would probably have increased the overlap (at the cost of increasing the number of false positive too).</p><p>(3) We have chosen quite strict criteria and applied them separately to define each hit list; therefore, we know we have many false negatives in each list, which will naturally reduce the expected overlap.</p><p>We now extended the discussion of the limited overlap of the two dataset in a dedicated paragraph in the discussion. We also clarify that we tend to give more trust to the protein-library dataset (since substrates are in a configuration closer to that in vivo), with those hits also present in the peptide dataset (like TAX-6 was) as the most convincing hits, as they could be validated in a second type of experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the rationale for, and distinction between, the two separate in vitro experiments is not made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We reasoned that both substrate types have their own benefits and limitations (as discussed in the manuscript), so it was an added value to run both. We proposed that the subset of targets present in both datasets to be the most solid list of candidates. We have reinforced this point in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 207: After reporting that both tax-6 and cnb-1 mutants have high spontaneous reversals, it is not made clear why cnb-1 is not further explored in the paper. Additionally, this spontaneous reversal data should be in a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We kept the focus of the article primarily on TAX-6, because it was identified as CMK-1 target in vitro; CNB-1 was not. Moreover, we didn’t have <italic>cnb-1(gf)</italic> mutants to pursue the analysis with, and we were stuck by the <italic>cnb-1(lf)</italic> constitutive high reversal rate for any further follow up. We have added a supplementary file to present the spontaneous reversals rates.</p><p>Figure 3 -S1: This model doesn't explain why the cmk-1(gf) group and the cmk-1(gf) +cyclo A group cause enhanced response decrement (presumably by reducing the inhibition by tax-6) but the +cyclo A group (inhibited tax-6) showed weaker response decrement, as here there is even further weakened inhibition of tax-6 on this process. Also, the cmk-1(lf) +cyclo A group is labeled as constitutive habituation, however, this doesn't appear to be the case in Figure 3 (seems like a similar initial level and response decrement phenotype to wildtype).</p><p>Thanks a lot for the comment. We are glad that the presentation of our complex dataset was clear enough to bring the reader to that level of detailed reflection and interpretation on the proposed model. To address the two points raised in this reviewer comment, we made modifications to the model presentation and provide additional clarifications below, where we use the term adaptation instead of habituation (as in the revised Figure):</p><p>Regarding the first point, “why the cmk-1(gf) group and the cmk-1(gf) +cyclo A group cause enhanced response decrement … but the +cyclo A group showed weaker response decrement”. This is really a very good point, that cannot be easily explained if all the branches (arrows) in the model have the same weight or work as ON/OFF switches. We tried to convey the relative importance of the regulation effect via the thickness of the arrow lines (which we have now clarified in the legend in the revised ms). The main ‘quantitative’ nuances to take into consideration here originate from 2 assumptions of the model (which we have clarified in the revised ms):</p><p>Assumption 1: the inhibitory effect of TAX-6 on the CMK-1 antiadaptation branch and the inhibitory effect of TAX-6 on the CMK-1 pro-adaptation branch are not of the same magnitude (we have further enhanced the line thickness differences in the revised model, top left panel for wild type).</p><p>Assumption 2: the two antagonistic direct effects of CMK-1 on adaptation are not of the same magnitude, most strikingly in the context of CMK-1(gf) mutants.</p><p>In our model, the cyclosporin A treatment alone (bottom left panel) causes a strong boost on the CMK-1 inhibitory branch and a less marked boost on the CMK-1 activator branch (following assumption 1). This causes an imbalance between the two antagonist direct CMK-1-dependent drives, which reduces (but doesn’t fully block) adaptation. Indeed, we don’t observe a total block of adaptation with cyclosporin A in wild type, the effect being significantly milder than the totally nonadapting phenotypes seen, e.g., in TAX-6(gf) mutants. From there, the question is what happen in CMK-1(gf) background that would mask the anti-adaptation effect of Cyclosporin A? Here assumption 2 is relevant, and the CMK-1(gf) pro-adaptation direct branch is always prevalent and imbalances the regulation toward faster adaptation (the role of TAX-6 becoming negligible in the CMK-1(gf) background and <italic>ipso facto</italic> that of Cyclosporin A).</p><p>Regarding the second point, “the cmk-1(lf) +cyclo A group is labeled as constitutive habituation”. We regret a confusing word choice in the first version of the manuscript; we intended to mean “normal habituation phenotype” but in the joint absence of antagonistic CMK-1 and TAX-6 regulatory signaling (so the regulation is not like in wild-type, but the phenotype ends up like in wild type). We have modified the label to “normal adaptation” and left a note in the legend that an apparently normal adaptation phenotype seems to be the default situation when the two antagonistic regulatory pathways are shut off.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More discussion of the significance of the sites of cmk-1 and tax-6 function in the neural circuit should take place. Additionally, incorporating the suspected loci of cmk-1 and tax-6 in the neural circuit into the model would be interesting (using proper hypothetical language). For example, as it seems like AFD is not required for the naïve reversal response but just its reduction, cmk-1 activity in AFD might be generating inhibition of the reversal response by AFD. It certainly would be understandable if this isn't workable, given extrasynaptic signaling and other unknowns, but it potentially could also be helpful in generating a working model for these complex interactions. For example, cmk1 induces AIZ inhibition of AVA (AIZ is electrically coupled to AFD), and tax-6 reduces RIM activation of AVA (these neurons are also electrically coupled according to the diagram). RIM is also a neuropeptide-rich neuron, so this could allow it to interact with the cmk-1-related process(es) in AFD. Some discussion of possibilities like this could be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. These hypothetical inter-cellular communication pathways are indeed nice possibilities. On the other hand, we could envision several additional pathways. While RIM is indeed a neuropeptide-rich neurons, all these neurons actually express neuropeptides. Following this helpful suggestion, we have slightly expanded the discussion of hypothetical cellular pathways that can be modulated downstream of CMK-1 in AFD. We also slightly lengthened the discussion to mention hypothetical post-synaptic target of TAX-6 within interneurons based on the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Provide an explanation for why some of the experiments in Figure 4 have such a high N, compared to other experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The conditions with the highest n correspond to conditions which we have also used as ‘control’ condition for other type of experiments in the lab and as part of side projects, but which could be gathered for the present article. We have been working with <italic>cmk-1(lf)</italic> and <italic>tax-6(gf)</italic> mutants for many years… and the robust non-adapting phenotype was a reference point and a quality control when analyzing other nonadapting mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because the loss of function and gain of function mutations in cmk-1 have a similar effect, it is likely that this thermosensory plasticity phenotype is sensitive to levels of cmk-1 activity. Therefore, it is not surprising that the cmk-1 promoter failed to rescue very well as these plasmid-driven rescues often result in overexpression. Given this and that the cmk-1p rescue itself was so modest, these rescue experiments are not entirely convincing (and very hard to interpret; for example, is the AFD rescue or the ASER rescue more complete? The ASER one is actually closer to the cmk-1p rescue). Given the sensitivity to cmk-1 activity levels, a degradation strategy would be more likely to deliver clear results (or perhaps even the overactivation approach used for tax-6).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We respectfully disagree with this reviewer’s statement “<italic>the loss of function and gain of function mutations in cmk-1 have a similar effect</italic>”. We suspect a confusion here, because our data clearly show that these two mutant types have an opposite phenotype. That being said, we interpret the weak rescue effect with <italic>cmk-1p</italic> as a probable result of overexpression or incomplete/imbalanced expression across neurons (as the promoter used might not include all the relevant regulatory regions). We dedicated considerable efforts to establish an endogenous CMK-1::degron knock in, for tissue-specific auxin-induced degradation (AID), but we were unfortunately not able to obtain consistent results. Unfortunately, the only useful data regarding CMK-1 place-of-action are the cell-specific rescue data already included in the report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reduction in a response to a specific stimulus after repeated exposures is called habituation.

For the T60 acquisition, there is a lag of about 50 s between the last ‘habituation’ stimuli and the recording stimuli (time needed to move the plate between the habituation device and the recording device + 40 s of baseline reversal recording in the absence of heat stimuli).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) There appears to be little to no connection between the phosphorylation site discovered in Calcineurin (S443) and the behavioral phenotypes being studied. What is the thermo-nociceptive response if phosphorylation of S443 in Calcineurin is blocked (using a S443A mutation) and/or combined with CMK-1 gain of function?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. The suggested analysis is complicated by several factors. First, the <italic>tax-6(lf)</italic> is not directly suitable for rescue analysis (until we would have identified a way to restore baseline reversal), so we cannot use a S443A-carrying rescue transgene. Second, the truncated TAX-6(GF) mutant lacks the C-terminal part, including S443, so we cannot introduce a S443A in this context. The left approach would be to modify the endogenous locus. This again is complicated by the fact that S443 exists in two different isoforms (with conserved RxxS motifs in two different alternative exons). It will be very difficult to perform these experiments until we know more about the expression pattern and function of the respective isoforms. This is work in progress, but this analysis will need to await a future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should state clearly if Calcineurin is a novel substrate of CaM Kinase or if this is already known in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We have complemented the text mentioning we are not aware of Calcineurin having so far been reported to be a CaM kinase I substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The logical flow of the manuscript could be improved given that CMK-1 and Calcineurin appear to act in different cells to regulate nociceptive habituation.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed above, we have considered this point carefully and modified the introduction and the abstract.
