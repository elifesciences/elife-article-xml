This generates a landmark code by modulating the properties of each membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] specifically accumulates at the plasma membrane in yeast, animal, and plant cells, where it regulates a wide range of cellular processes including endocytic trafficking. However, the functional consequences of mispatterning PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plants are unknown. Here, we functionally characterized the putative phosphoinositide phosphatase <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9</italic> (SAC9) in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>). We found that SAC9 depletion led to the ectopic localization of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on cortical intracellular compartments, which depends on PI4P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production at the plasma membrane. SAC9 localizes to a subpopulation of <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi Network/early endosomes that are enriched in a region close to the cell cortex and that are coated with clathrin. Furthermore, it interacts and colocalizes with Src Homology 3 Domain Protein 2 (SH3P2), a protein involved in endocytic trafficking. In the absence of SAC9, SH3P2 localization is altered and the clathrin-mediated endocytosis rate is reduced. Together, our results highlight the importance of restricting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane and illustrate that one of the consequences of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> misspatterning in plants is to impact the endocytic trafficking.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE13-0021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caillaud</surname><given-names>Marie-Cécile</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3363360-APPL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaillais</surname><given-names>Yvon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UE188/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Üstün</surname><given-names>Suayib</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SAC9 prevents the accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in intracellular compartments, thereby contributing to clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane and regulating the cortical localization of its protein partner SH3P2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphoinositides constitute a family of low abundance lipids differentially enriched in the membranes of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Platre and Jaillais, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balla, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Noack and Jaillais, 2020a</xref>). These versatile lipids can be interconverted into one another. For example, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is synthetized from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) by PI4P-5 kinases and is dephosphorylated into PI4P by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> 5-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noack and Jaillais, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI4P are hydrolyzed by phospholipases C (PLC) into diacylglycerol and soluble phosphorylated inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balla, 2013</xref>). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> strictly localizes at the plasma membrane in plants and animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Leeuwen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Del Signore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Simon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben El Kadhi et al., 2011</xref>) despite the plasma membrane being constantly turned-over by endocytosis and exocytosis. Throughout this paper, we define endocytosis in its broader sense, including the internalization step <italic>sensus stricto</italic> (i.e. recruitment of cargo and coat components of the ‘clathrin-mediated endocytosis’ machinery, formation of clathrin-coated pits, scission of the clathrin-coated vesicles and uncoating) followed by the subsequent transport of lipid and proteins through the endosomal system. As such, the endocytosis, or here after the endocytic trafficking, is the process that allows (1) cells to transport particles and molecules across the plasma membrane and (2) the termination of signaling through transport toward the vacuole for degradation. At the plasma membrane, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interacts with a variety of extrinsic membrane proteins such as endocytic protein adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and actin-regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paez Valencia et al., 2016</xref>), which are recruited and/or activated by the binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> subcellular patterning is likely critical to regulate the recruitment of proteins that act at the plasma membrane, and the cellular processes they mediate, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>Consistent with a critical role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the recruitment of early clathrin-mediated endocytosis factors, a <italic>pip5k1 pip5k2</italic> double mutant in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) lacking two ubiquitously expressed PI4P-5 kinases, has abnormal auxin distribution and defective endocytic trafficking of the transmembrane auxin efflux carriers PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) and PIN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tejos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ischebeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mei et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>pip5k1 pip5k2</italic> double mutant has an altered dynamic of CLATRHIN LIGHT CHAIN2 (CLC2), with the density of CLC2 foci at the plasma membrane being reduced in the mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ischebeck et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PI4P-5 kinase 6 in tip-growing pollen tubes induced massive aggregation of the plasma membrane in pollen tube tips due to excessive clathrin-dependent membrane invagination, supporting a role for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in promoting early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). The inducible overexpression of a highly active human PI4P-5 kinase leads to an increased PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production, very strong developmental phenotypes, and heightened endocytic trafficking toward the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gujas et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we recently showed that inducible depletion of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from the plasma membrane using the iDePP system leads to a decrease in the fraction of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2-µ and the Src Homology (SH3)-domain containing protein 2 (SH3P2) at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doumane et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, FM4-64 uptake experiments confirmed an impact of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion from the plasma membrane on bulk endocytic flow.</p><p>In animal cells, several PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatases are required for the late stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pirruccello et al., 2014</xref>). Many PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatases belong to the 5-phosphatase enzyme family, including OCRL and synaptojanins (Syn1/2) in animals, and synaptojanin-like proteins (Inp51p/Snjl1p, Inp52p/Sjl2p, and Inp53p/Sjl3p) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains 15 genes encoding 5-phosphatases, but only a few are characterized. Mutation in the 5-phosphatase nine leads to osmotic stress tolerance, with reduced reactive oxygen species production and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Golani et al., 2013</xref>). The 5-phosphatase 6/COTYLEDON VASCULAR PATTERN2 (CVP2) and 5-phosphatase 7/CVP2 LIKE 1 (CVL1) are specifically required for vascular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodriguez-Villalon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carland and Nelson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carland and Nelson, 2004</xref>). Finally, the <italic>5-phosphatase 15/FRAGILE FIBER 3 (FRA3</italic>) is expressed in developing fibers and vascular cells, which is consistent with the defective fiber and vessel phenotypes seen in the loss-of-function <italic>fra3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Proteins containing SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN (or Sac1-like) domains constitute another family of phosphoinositide phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhong and Ye, 2003</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are nine SAC proteins, forming three clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhong and Ye, 2003</xref>). The first clade is composed of SAC1, a PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> 5-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>), and its relatives SAC2 to 5, putative PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> 5-phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nováková et al., 2014</xref>). The second clade corresponds to SAC7/RHD4 a PI4P 4-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thole et al., 2008</xref>) and its relatives SAC6 and SAC8 putative PI4P 4-phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Song et al., 2021</xref>). The third clade is composed of a single member, a plant-specific protein called SAC9. SAC9 has a unique structure, with a SAC phosphoinositide phosphatase domain at its N-terminus, immediately followed by a putative protein/protein interaction domain (WW domain), and a long C-terminal region of 1104 amino acids where a putative coil-coiled domain is predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhong and Ye, 2003</xref>). The <italic>sac9</italic> mutant is dwarf, it constitutively accumulates anthocyanins and it expresses genes from stress response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2005</xref>). Loss-of-function alleles of <italic>SAC9</italic> display a threefold increase in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> content, together with a decrease in PI4P level, suggesting that it acts as a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> 5-phosphatase in planta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure-function analysis of SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9 (SAC9).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of SAC9 protein.

Loss of SAC9 results into PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> mis-patterning at the subcellular level, leading to the accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in subcortical compartments associated with TGN/EEs. Similar cellular and developmental phenotypes were observed when SAC9 was mutated on its putative catalytic cysteine, suggesting that the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of SAC9 is required for function. SAC9 interacts and colocalizes with the endocytic component SH3P2. In the absence of SAC9, and therefore when the patterning of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is compromised, SH3P2 localization is affected and the clathrin-mediated endocytosis is significantly reduced. Thus, SAC9 is required to maintain efficient endocytic uptake, highlighting the importance of restricting the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> pool to the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The cysteine 459 in the catalytic domain of SAC9 is required for SAC9 function</title><p>We investigated the root phenotype in the already described mutant alleles of SAC9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vollmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2005</xref>).

In the absence of SAC9, and therefore when the patterning of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane and at its close vicinity is affected, SH3P2 localization at the plasma membrane is decreased and the rate of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is significantly reduced. Together, these findings underlie the importance of strictly restricting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to the plasma membrane during the endocytic process.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SAC9 and phosphoinositide interconversion along the endocytic pathway</title><p>In animal cells, a phosphoinositide conversion cascade has been described through the successive action of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases.

Briefly, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is dephosphorylated at the plasma membrane or during the endocytic process by 5-phosphatase enzymes such as OCRL and synaptojanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Matteis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cauvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben El Kadhi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Posor et al., 2013</xref>).

Because both PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI3P are essential regulators of endocytic trafficking, this conversion cascade, and in particular the precise recruitment of dedicated enzymes at the right place and at the right time during endocytic trafficking, is of critical importance for clathrin-mediated endocytosis to proceed normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noack and Jaillais, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmid and Mettlen, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The plants TGN collects endocytic vesicles and redirects cargo proteins either to the plasma membrane for recycling or to late endosomes/vacuole for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dettmer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Narasimhan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodriguez-Furlan et al., 2019</xref>).

Together, we propose that SAC9 represents the long sought-after enzyme that performs the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-to-PI4P conversion during the plant endocytic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

SAC9 interacts with SH3P2 close to the plasma membrane. The defects in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> patterning in absence of SAC9 leads to decreasing in the endocytic rate and the formation of membrane protuberances in contact with the plasma membrane.

However, transgenic lines that express SAC9 under the expression of the <italic>UBQ10</italic> promoter did not show any obvious phenotypes, and instead complemented the <italic>sac9</italic> loss-of-function phenotype like the endogenous promoter. This absence of overexpression phenotypes may be explained by several hypotheses. First, it is possible that SAC9 is not sufficiently overexpressed when under the control of the <italic>UBQ10</italic> promoter compared to the endogenous SAC9 promoter. Second, it is possible that SAC9 overexpressing lines compensate for the excess SAC9 activity by adjusting their PI4P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> balance. However, our data point toward a third possibility. Most lipid phosphatase studied to date require membrane association to dephosphorylate their cognate phosphoinositide, while they do not act on their target lipid when they are in the cytosol. We found that SAC9 strongly accumulates in the cytoplasm when it is expressed under the control of either promoter and in particular when it is overexpressed. Thus, SAC9 membrane association, rather than its expression level, is likely to be the limiting factor preventing SAC9 gain-of-function phenotype in over-expression lines.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing vesicles in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant</title><p>In the absence of SAC9, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulates inside the cell in what appears to be abnormal compartments that are associated with but independent from TGN/EEs. We can speculate that the prolonged accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on clathrin-coated compartments, and perhaps the lack of PI4P production on these structures, impairs the function of these vesicles. We also observed that PI4P biosensors accumulate in TGNs in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutants. We previously found that PI4P biosensors relocalize to PI4P-containing TGNs upon specific depletion of PI4P at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Platre et al., 2018</xref>). PI4P being the putative product of SAC9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2005</xref>), it is possible that there is a reduced amount of PI4P at the plasma membrane in this mutant. In that case, the balance of PI4P between the plasma membrane and the TGN would be affected between these two compartments, which could explain the relocalization of the PI4P sensors to TGN compartments.</p><p>Ultrastructural analyses previously revealed that <italic>sac9</italic> massively accumulates vesicles, presumably containing cell wall precursors, in close proximity to the irregular cell wall deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vollmer et al., 2011</xref>). The finding of these unknown subcortical compartments in <italic>sac9</italic> resonates with our confocal microscopy observations of ectopic PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing vesicles in this mutant. Importantly, we found that these vesicles are not extensively labeled after a short-term FM4-64 treatment. This suggests that these vesicles are accumulating slowly over time in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutants and are not actively exchanging membrane materials with the TGN/EEs or the plasma membrane, at least not in the 30 min time frame of the FM4-64 pulse labeling experiment. Moreover, recent proteomic characterization of isolated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> clathrin-coated vesicles identified SAC9 as one of the most abundant clathrin-coated vesicles proteome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahhan et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, in that study, no other 5-phosphatase was identified to be associated with clathrin-coated vesicles. Together, we propose that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulation on endocytic vesicles after scission could lead to an altered dynamics of these vesicles, which may be unable to fuse correctly with TGN/EEs, ultimately leading to their accumulation in the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We observed that the endocytic pathway is partially impaired in the absence of SAC9, and that <italic>sac9</italic> was oversensitive to ES9-17-mediated inhibition of endocytosis. In animal cells, membrane protuberances have been reported in cultured cells knocked-out or knock-down for enzymes of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gurung et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Terebiznik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mochizuki and Takenawa, 1999</xref>). These protuberances could therefore be a conserved process affected by disturbed PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> homeostasis in both plant and animal cells leading to such plasma membrane distortion. It is not the first observation of plasma membrane protuberances in cells where PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> homeostasis is affected: upon PIP5K6 over-expression in pollen tubes, which increases PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, plasma membrane invaginations also occurs. The authors elegantly demonstrated that these plasma membrane distortions are due to clathrin-mediated endocytosis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). These structures were also reported when inducible depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane of root cells was performed using the iDePP system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doumane et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that the tight regulation of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism is important for the integrity of the plasma membrane. Previous study on the cellular organization of the primary roots of <italic>sac9-1</italic> seedlings at ultrastructural level reported the excessive membrane material either in direct contacts or close to the wall forming the protuberances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vollmer et al., 2011</xref>). The irregular cell wall deposition in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant leads to cell wall ingrowths, coined ‘whorl-like structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vollmer et al., 2011</xref>). We propose that such protuberances could be a readout of long-term endocytic defects, for instance, caused by an excess of plasma membrane due to unbalanced exocytosis. If so, the appearance of plasma membrane protuberances upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism perturbation could be an additional indication of disturbed endocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How could SAC9 regulate endocytosis?</title><p>We observed that the endocytic pathway is partially impaired in the absence of SAC9. We envision several scenarios to explain these endocytic defects. They are not mutually exclusive and ultimately, it would not be surprising if the <italic>sac9</italic> endocytic phenotype results from a combination of altered cellular pathways relying, directly or indirectly, on the precise spatio-temporal regulation of anionic lipid homeostasis. First, as mentioned in the paragraph above, the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant likely accumulates ectopic vesicle following endocytosis. These vesicles trap membrane components inside the cell, which may overall impact the endocytic process. In addition, it is possible that the localization or dynamics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding proteins, which regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis, could be impacted, as we observed for SH3P2 and TPLATE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhuang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yperman et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yperman et al., 2021a</xref>). Other proteins from the TPLATE complex also interact with anionic lipids, including PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and could be affected in <italic>sac9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yperman et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yperman et al., 2021a</xref>). Furthermore, the dynamics of dynamin-related proteins, which contain a lipid-binding plekstrin homology domain, and the AP2 adaptor complex, which relies on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for localization in planta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doumane et al., 2021</xref>), could also be altered in <italic>sac9</italic>. It was also recently reported that perturbation of clathrin-containing vesicles at the TGN/EEs also impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis (and conversely) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). It is thus possible that perturbing phosphoinositides metabolism after the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane impacts the dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the cell surface in an indirect way, for example, because of slowed recycling of the clathrin pool or other endocytic components at the surface of TGN/EEs.</p><p>It is also important to note that bulk endocytosis in general and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in particular are still going-on in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant, albeit at a reduced rate. Thus, while PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> strict exclusion from intracellular membranes is important for the endocytic process, the plant membrane trafficking system appears to be extremely resilient, as it manages to operate despite the accumulation of these membranes of mixed identity inside the cell. Here, we can speculate that SAC9 may not be the only 5-phosphatase enzyme that can control PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> homeostasis during endocytosis. In addition, while PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is the main phosphoinositide regulating the recruitment of endocytic regulators in animals, it is likely not the case in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marković and Jaillais, 2022</xref>). Indeed, PI4P, not PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, is the major anionic lipids that powers the plasma membrane electrostatic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon et al., 2016</xref>), and is very likely key to recruit endocytic proteins in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yperman et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yperman et al., 2021a</xref>). In addition, phosphatidic acid (PA) is also important to drive the electrostatic field of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Platre et al., 2018</xref>) and PA could be involved in the localization of AtEH1/Pan1, a component of the TPLATE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yperman et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dragwidge et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>SAC9 was previously proposed to act as a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> 5-phosphatase in planta, mainly because the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant accumulates PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2005</xref>). We found an accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> sensors inside the cells in <italic>sac9</italic>, which is fully consistent for a 5-phosphatase enzyme. However, we could not confirm this activity in vitro. This is mainly due to problems in purifying SAC9 catalytic domain in sufficient quantity. Yet, it represents a weakness of our study that we should keep in mind. Indeed, although this is not the most parsimonious explanation, it is possible that SAC9 is not a 5-phosphatase and that instead, it controls the localization or activity of another enzyme bearing this catalytic activity. Nonetheless, the fact that the putative catalytically inactive mCIT-SAC9<sup>C459A</sup> fusion protein does not rescue <italic>sac9</italic> macroscopic phenotype and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> localization suggests that SAC9 phosphatase activity is required for its function. We showed that the number of BFA bodies labeled with FM4-64 in <italic>sac9-3</italic> vs wild-type is reduced. Such reduction may be due to (i) a lower amount of BFA bodies formed per cell (i.e. the number per cell area or volume), (ii) reduced FM4-64 internalization from the cell surface, (iii) defects in the balance between endocytic and exocytic trafficking which alter TGN/EE function, and (iv) a combination of those. In either case, such decrease suggests that membrane trafficking flux through the endosomal system is impacted in <italic>sac9</italic>.</p><p>To explain the endocytic defects observed in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant, we mainly focused on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> mis-patterning. However, biochemical measurements also showed that the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant accumulates less PI4P than its wild-type counterpart. Given the importance of PI4P for plant cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marković and Jaillais, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Noack et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Noack et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that PI4P rather than (or in combination with) PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> defects are involved in the <italic>sac9</italic> phenotypes. Given that phosphoinositide metabolism is highly intricate, we recognize that it is difficult to fully untangle the specific involvement of each lipid in the observed phenotypes. In addition, the SAC9 protein may carry specific functions outside of its catalytic activity. For example, SAC9 directly interacts with SH3P2, yet the physiological relevance of this interaction for both SAC9 and SH3P2 function remains unclear. Structure-function analyses aiming at dissecting this interaction will be instrumental to clarify this point. Based on confocal imaging, we concluded that the level of plasma membrane-associated SH3P2-sGFP is reduced in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant. In addition, the overall levels of SH3P2 are not affected in the mutant. Subcellular fractionations and quantitative colocalization analyses between SH3P2-GFP and compartment markers in the <italic>sac9</italic> mutant background will be needed to fully understand how SAC9 impacts SH3P2 localization. In addition, the exact function of SH3P2 in endocytosis is also elusive and it will be important to analyze it in detail in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamowski et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, one of the clear limitations in interpreting the <italic>sac9</italic> phenotype, which is common to most genetic approaches, is the accumulation of defects over a long-time period in the mutant. As such, it is impossible to pin-point toward direct or indirect effects of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> mis-patterning on the cellular and developmental phenotypes of this mutant. Future studies, aiming at rapidly manipulating SAC9 function and localization in an inducible manner will be instrumental in disentangling the direct and indirect effects of SAC9 on lipid dynamics and endocytosis regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p><italic>SAC9</italic> promoter (<italic>SAC9pro</italic>; 800 bp) was amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA using <italic>SAC9prom_fwd_gb</italic> <named-content content-type="sequence">ttgtatagaaaagttgctattgaaaaaagatagaggcgcgtg</named-content> and <italic>SAC9prom_rev_gb</italic> <named-content content-type="sequence">TTTTTTGTACAAACTTGCCTGAGCTCAGGACCAAGCGG</named-content> primers and the corresponding PCR product was recombined into <italic>pDONR-P1RP4</italic> (Life Technologies <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/in/en/home.html">https://www.thermofisher.com/in/en/home.html</ext-link>) vector by BP reaction to give <italic>SAC9pro/pDONR-P1RP4</italic>.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Arabidopsis SAC9 Enzyme defines a cortical population of early endosomes and restricts PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to the Plasma Membrane&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sebastian Y. Bednarek (Reviewer #2); Clara Sanchez-Rodriguez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim that SAC9 is indeed a 5-phosphatase could be supported by imaging PI(4,5)P2 markers sac9 mutants carrying CIT-SAC9(C459A) to document similar changes to π distribution in the &quot;catalytically dead&quot; version as in the sac9 loss of function mutant. Please also revise the text surrounding the claims that SAC9 is a phosphatase, for example by referring to the C459A mutant &quot;putative catalytically inactive&quot;</p><p>2) Additional imaging data need to be presented to document that SAC9 is localized to a &quot;cortical subpopulation&quot; of early endosomes. To support this claim, the authors would need to carefully compare the distribution of SAC9 relative to other TGN/EE markers (e.g internalized FM4-64, SPY61, VHAa1 etc.) throughout the entire volume of cells. Alternatively, the authors may remove these claims from the manuscript. In either case, it will be important to clearly indicate which focal plane is being presented in each image, as noted by Reviewer 3.</p><p>3) At least one additional method is required to verify the interaction between SAC9 and SH3P2: CoIP, BiFC FRET, proximity labelling are all appropriate, assuming rigorous controls are also presented.</p><p>4) For the colocalization experiments, there seems to be a disconnect between the images and the quantification. Additional information in the methods could help clarify this. Reviewer 2 has suggested a control colocalization experiment between a soluble protein (e.g. untagged mCIT) and several markers. This is feasible within the timeline for revisions since imaging could be conducted within the F1 generation.</p><p>5) For the claims that SAC9 is involved in endocytosis, it is essential to eliminate the trivial explanation that endocytosis-related proteins are downregulated in sac9, rather than specifically depleted from the PM (e.g. via western blot of TPLATE and SH3P2, as Reviewer 3 suggests). This claim could be further supported by investigating the possibility that other SH3P2-related processes (MBV formation, autophagy, cell plate formation) are affected (e.g. marker line imaging in the sac9 mutant), as suggested by Reviewer 1 or testing whether loss of sac9 might generally affect intracellular trafficking by assessing TGN/EE function (e.g. PIN2 localization/recycling, secGFP imaging), as suggested by Reviewer 2.</p><p>6) The authors must present evidence of analyzing multiple independent transgenic lines for complementation experiments, as raised by Reviewer 1.</p><p>7) The FM4-64 uptake experiments need to be re-analyzed (or perhaps re-performed) on samples that show comparable PM staining between wild type and sac9 mutants. This is essential to eliminate the trivial explanation for reduced FM4-64 uptake into cells, since it is possible FM4-46 integration into the plasma membrane is affected in sac9 mutants due to changes in PM composition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors repeatedly claim that &quot;In this study, we show that the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of SAC9 is required for its function.&quot; (line 75, line 100, line 282, etc) but they have not documented any biochemical activity of SAC9. They say that these experiments were unsuccessful; attempts to purify SAC9 and determine its activity should be presented in the supplemental data to support these claims. As a proxy, the authors rely on the mCIT-SAC9(C459A) mutant, which they assume is catalytically inactive. They provide a reasonable discussion of the caveats to their data, but this paper is weakened without any evidence of SAC9 activity. It would support their claims that mCIT-SAC9(C459A) is catalytically inactive to document similar changes to PI(4,5)P2 distribution in sac9 mutants carrying CIT-SAC9(C459A). It's also not appropriate to call C459 the &quot;catalytic cystine&quot; (line 94) without documenting activity.</p><p>2. Furthermore, only one independent transgenic line is presented for complementation experiments and the C459A line clearly expresses much less protein than wild type SAC9 complementation line (Supplemental Figure 1A), so it is quite possible that the lack of sac9 rescue by mCIT-SAC9(C459A) is simply due to less (but potentially fully functional) SAC9 protein in this line. Please present complementation data from at least three independent transgenic lines for each construct and document SAC9 protein levels in each line, especially the CIT-SAC9(C459A) lines.</p><p>3. The authors make statements about the localization of SAC9 such as &quot;fluorescent SAC9 protein fusions localize…in a subpopulation of endosomes close to the plasma membrane&quot; (line 149, 284, 311, 312). There are clearly SAC9-labelled puncta not at the cell cortex (for example, Figure 2D, the lefthand cell is an endoplasmic plane of section through the vacuole and many bright SAC9 puncta are visible quite far from the PM). The authors could remove these unsupported claims; however, this would substantially dimmish their central claim that SAC9 is somehow specific to endocytosis and specifically labelling new endocytic vesicles.</p><p>4. The only data presented to support the interaction between SAC9 and SH3P2 is Y2H results from truncated versions of both proteins. This unverified interaction must be supported by at least one other method to document protein-protein interactions.</p><p>5. The authors claim that SAC9 function is specific to endocytosis (line 331). However, they have not tested any other processes in sac9 mutants, including SH3P2-mediated processes such as multivesicular body formation (Nagel et al., 2017 PNAS), cell plate formation (Ahn et al., 2017 Plant Cell), autophagy (Zhuang et al., 2013 Plant Cell), so it is inappropriate to claim that SAC9 has such a specific function. The authors could either assess MVB formation, autophagy, and cell plate formation in sac9 mutants or they could remove these claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors show that the number of BFA bodies labeled with FM4-64 in sac9-3 vs wild-type is reduced, consistent with a decrease in endocytosis of the tracer dye. However, this assumes that the formation of BFA bodies (i.e. the number per cell area or volume) in sac9-3 mutants is similar to that of wild-type. Quantitation of BFA body formation, using markers of the TGN/EE in wild-type and mutant cells should thus be presented to rule out that formation of BFA bodies is not altered in the sac9 mutant cells.</p><p>2. The authors should explain their rationale for using the enzymatically inactive SAC9 variant in co-localization experiments with SH3P2 (Figure 7) rather than wild-type SAC9. Based on the representative images shown in Figure 3H (which do not necessarily correspond with the quantitative data shown in Figure 3G; see comment above) SAC9C459A appears to be associated with the TGN/EE, Golgi and late endosomal compartments raising questions as to which compartment(s) wild-type SAC9 and SH3P2 colocalize with.</p><p>3. In lines 157-158, the authors state, &quot;As expected, both PI(4,5)P2 biosensors strictly labeled the plasma membrane in wild-type cells (Figures 4A and 4C).&quot; However, while this appears to be the case for 2xPHPLC probe, the TUBBYc probe shows significant labeling in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 4A, Col-0 background). Please modify the statement and/or explain the observed pattern.</p><p>4. It is interesting that the intracellular levels of PI(4)P appear to increase in the sac9 mutant. This is particularly evident in sac9 cells expressing the PHFAPP1 probe (Figure 4B). Is the enhanced intracellular labeling associated with changes in the districution of membrane associated ARF GTPase? Please discuss as the model presented in Figure 9 does not address the increased levels of PI(4)P in the sac9 mutant.</p><p>5. The authors should describe their rationale for using the ARF protein binding defective mutant form of the PI(4)P probe, FAPP-E50A in Figure 5, as opposed to the WT variant of FAPP1 marker used elsewhere in this study.</p><p>6. The authors should describe whether the image shown at higher magnification in Figure 4F is from the Zi or Zii plan of focus.</p><p>7. The authors need to provide more information in the manuscript text or methods section to explain how they calculated/quantitated the 'density' of intracellular puncta in the various backgrounds. Does density refer to the number of endosomes labeled by FM4-64, e.g. per cell? Or, does it refer to the number of intracellular puncta relative to the area of the cell imaged? Similarly, how were the number of BFA bodies quantitated (Figure 6)?</p><p>8. The authors should discuss their assignment of RabD1 as a post-Golgi endosomal marker (Figure 3). Based on the findings of Pinheiro et al., 2009 J Cell Sci., YFP-RabD1 colocalizes with internalized FM4-64 and VHA-a1 markers of the TGN/EE. However, while SAC9 appears to colocalize with FM4-64 it does colocalize significantly with RabD1. Please discuss or explain this apparent discrepancy.</p><p>9. Based on confocal imaging, the authors conclude that the level of plasma membrane associated SH3P2-sGFP is partially reduced in the sac9 mutant. Additional experiments including quantitative analysis of the total levels and distribution of SH3P2 in sac9 mutant and wild type subcellular fractionations (e.g. enriched plasma membrane, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions) would address whether loss of SAC9 affects the levels of SH3P2 and provide complementary data supporting the authors' conclusions.</p><p>10. The authors use TIRF microscopy to quantitate TPLATE abundance at the plasma membrane and describe a decreased density of puncta labeled by TPLATE in sac9 backgrounds. Is it biologically significant to show the data beyond 100 seconds in panel 8D? This exceeds the typical lifetime of the clathrin coated vesicle at the plasma membrane. Here, I would also ask the authors to demonstrate by immunoblotting that the total protein level of TPLATE does not change in sac9 backgrounds, to ensure that the decrease in the levels of plasma membrane-associated TPLATE is not due to a decrease in the total abundance of TPLATE.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Important aspects of image acquisition and data analysis, among others, need to be clarified and extended:</p><p>1) Figure 1B-D. How the authors can explain that the overexpression of SAC9 under the pUBQ10 promoter is not translated in a plant phenotype considering its function? Did the authors check whether in the pUBQ10::TdTOM-SAC9 line there is an increase of the SAC9 gene expression or protein level (is not included in the WB analysis of Supp Figure 1A)?</p><p>2) Figures 2, and 3: Images shown present cells imaged in different focal planes (for example, cells C1 and C2 in Fig2G, where C1 image is not at the subcortical focal plane indicated by the blue line in Figure 2A). We recognize the difficulty of imaging cells in the same focal plane and the need of recording and analyzing different z-stacks to quantify the structures in the same focal plane in different cells. Please clarify how these images were analyzed. If required, show only cells imaged in the required focal plane.</p><p>3) Figure 2F. The co-expression of the WT version of SAC9 and the mutated SAC9C459A. It is expected by the authors that the mutation in SAC9 affects mainly the function but not the localization of SAC9. In that case, expressing (overexpressing?) SAC9, would not prevent SAC9C459A to localize in the vesicular structures since WT SAC9 would allow proper endocytic trafficking? Please discuss.</p><p>4) Figure 2G: The localization of the native SAC9 at the PM by co-localization with a PM reported, as done for SAC9C459A is required.</p><p>5) Line 112-113: &quot;mCIT-SAC9 and TdTOM-SAC9 were mainly soluble and excluded from the nucleus&quot;; and Line 114-115: &quot;We observed that mCIT-SAC9C459A was less soluble with a three-fold increase in the number of mCIT-SAC9C459A labeled dotty structures&quot;. To employ soluble to describe the localization of a protein does not seem to be the most appropriate term. SAC9 seems to be localized mainly diffused in the cytosol, but the mutated version accumulates in vesicular compartments.</p><p>6) Figure 3A. For the FM4-64 staining, there is a clear difference in the portion of the plasma membrane (PM) stained by FM4-64 in SAC9 WT compared to mutated SAC9. Please, discuss: are they performed using the same conditions? Could the absence of SAC9 (mutant) or the expression of the non-functional SAC9 alter the PM composition (as a complementary information of the Figure 4)?</p><p>7) Figure 3C-H: The authors quantified the colocalization of SAC9 and its mutant version with different organelles markers, suggesting that SAC9 colocalized mainly with EE/TGN structures. However, in the presented pictures seems obvious that SAC9 also colocalizes with LE/MVB structures, although in the quantification it is scored with low colocalization numbers. It is not very clearly explained in the Material and Methods section how the colocalization quantification was performed, manually counting or mediating other methods, i.e., Pearson coefficient? How the z-stack was selected? Always to the same distance to the PM? Are the vesicles that are transported to the vacuole excluded from the PI(4,5)P2 to PI4P conversion (it is explained in the text that they are richer in PI3P)? Please include RabF2a in the quantification in Figure 3G.</p><p>8) Figure 3C-D: The CLC2-RFP labeled structures look significantly different in the SAC9 C459A compared to the SAC9 WT version. Please, discuss.</p><p>9) Figure 4: In the text it is described an increase of the number of intracellular compartments label by the PI4P biosensor in the sac9-3 mutant (Figure 4B-C), suggesting that it happens due to a depletion of the PI4P pool at the PM and a relocation to the vesicles. How can the authors explain that this can happen? How could you demonstrate that this increase of the PI4P in the intracellular compartments is from the PM? And why is not happening in the mCIT-PHOSB sensor? Also, in the figure is not clear that there is any increase in the intracellular compartments using the mCIT-P4MSidM sensor. In the cited paper was quantified the number of intracellular compartments labeled with the mCIT-P4MSidM and mCIT-PHOSB, which was practically 0, being very surprising the quantification of the intracellular particles in both cases in the present paper. In these sensors, there is not an obvious decrease (is not quantified) of the PM signal that could explain the increase of the intracellular compartments signal.</p><p>10) Line 174-177: &quot;When co-imaging 2xmCH-2xPHFAPP1 together mCIT-TUBBYc in sac9-3-/- (Figure 4D), the dotty structures decorated by the PI(4,5)P2 biosensor -but not with the PI4P biosensor- were observed at the cortex of the cell, at the close vicinity with the plasma membrane (Figure 4D upper panel and 4E), whereas those structures were rarely observed in the internal part of the cell&quot;. In that case, what are the structures decorated with PI4P? Co-expression with the different organelle markers or/and SAC9C459A could be explanatory.</p><p>11) Are the intracellular compartments labeled by the PI(4,5)P2 sensors the same where SAC9C459A is accumulating (or where WT SAC9 can be also found)?</p><p>12) Line 186-188: in vivo time-lapse imaging of PI(4,5)P2 biosensor mCITTUBBYc and mCIT-2xPHPLC in sac9-3-/- mutant revealed that those intracellular structures were mobile in the cortex of root epidermal cells, hence, behaving like intracellular compartments (Supplemental Figure 3D, Supplemental video 2). Are they more or less mobile than in WT? This parameter could already point to the alteration of the endocytic dynamics.</p><p>13) Figure 6: The FM4-64 staining of PM is not homogenous even in the same plant. Same for the amount of a certain protein, like PIN2. Therefore, the endocytosis should be quantified using the ratio of internal signal/PM signal.</p><p>14) Figure 6A. There is a decrease in the number of FM4-64 labeled endosomes in the sac9-3 mutant (Figure 6A). Could that be explained due to a possible alteration of the PM density in the sac9-3 mutant? Is that a direct effect or a consequence of an increase of non-labeled FM4-64 vesicles (observed for the PI4,5P2 and PI4P biosensors)? In the case that PM is affected in the sac9-3 mutant, in order to calculate the density of intracellular compartments would be convenient to normalize it with the signal of &quot;available lipids&quot; at the PM to avoid indirect effects.</p><p>15) Figure 6G: It is already published (Vollmer et al., 2011) that sac9-3 mutant has wall protuberances that are randomly distributed and can be extended as a consequence of the PM accumulation. In that case, is the appearance of these protuberances an indirect effect of the lower endocytosis rate in the sac9-3 mutant? It seems to appear even in absence of inhibitors of the endocytosis. In that case, would these PM-protuberances be enriched with PI(4,5)P2 lipids?</p><p>16) Figure 7: SH3P2-sGFP and SAC9C459A are partially co-localizing (although colocalization quantification is missing and required). Are they also colocalizing when WT SAC9 version is used? Additionally, colocalization does not always imply interaction, and Line 285-286 &quot;In planta, SAC9 interacts and colocalizes with the endocytosis component SH3P2&quot; is an overstatement since no interaction assay has been done in planta (Only yeast two-hybrid). To further confirm the interaction of both proteins, other methods like Co-immunoprecipitation (with or without crosslinker) or biotin proximity labeling (PL) (Mair et al., 2019) are recommendable.</p><p>17) Lines 312-314: &quot;Together, we propose that SAC9 represent the long-sought-after enzyme which performs the PI(4,5)P2-to-PI4P conversion during the plant endocytic process (Figure 9).&quot; How is SAC9 recruited to the PM-vesicles for performing its function? It is clear that this question could be difficult to address for this publication, but could this recruitment be through the interaction with other proteins, i.e., SH3P2? Are they mutually needing each other to localize properly? In that case, what is the localization of SAC9 in the sh3p2 mutant background?</p><p>18) Figure 8A: the representative image shown for sca19-3 TPLATE-GFP is not homogeneously in focus.</p><p>19) Figure 2D: The reduction of TPLATE-GFP dwell time at the PM in sca9-3 is not obvious based on this figure. Include average, SD, and statistics. Also indicate in methods how these data were obtained. If a significant lower TPLATE-GFP dwell time in sac19-3 is confirmed, please, discuss this result in context with the published data showing an inverse correlation between TPLATE dwell time and endocytosis (longer time&gt;less endocytosis; Wang et al., 2020, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32321842/)</p><p>20) Please, re-check the methodology to describe the experimental set-up and data analysis in the detail required to be repeated by other colleagues. Among others, indicate what is &quot;N&quot; and &quot;n&quot; in the graphs, cite the published lines used in the study, and indicate how the particles were chosen for their analysis.</p><p>21) Avoid over conclusions not supported by data like</p><p>– Lines 11-12: «it interacts (only shown by Y2H) and colocalizes (not quantified) with the endocytic component Src 11 Homology 3 Domain Protein 2 (SH3P2)»</p><p>– Lines 132-133: &quot;catalytically dead SAC9 fusion proteins localize to endosomes and are likely part of the early steps of endocytic trafficking pathway» No data at this point indicate that SAC9 can be part of the early steps of the endocytosis.</p><p>– Line 311: &quot;SAC9 localizes to clathrin-coated vesicles close to the plasma membrane» This is not shown in the results.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The Arabidopsis SAC9 Enzyme is enriched in a cortical population of early endosomes and restricts PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the Plasma Membrane&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Explain discrepancies in the quantification of cortical vs endoplasmic SAC9-labelled particles (Reviewer 1 points 1 and 2 and Reviewer 2 point 2).</p><p>2) Clarify details about the number of transgenic lines (Reviewer 1, point 3 and Reviewer 2 point 6).</p><p>3) Clarify details of statistical analysis (Reviewer 1, point 4).</p><p>4) Clarify details of the colocalization experiments (Reviewer 2 points 4 and 8 and Reviewer 3 points 1 and 2).</p><p>Please also consider the detailed comments from reviewers, but a point-by-point response to all of their comments will not be strictly necessary for a revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have substantially revised the manuscript to address many of my previous comments, including adding several new experiments. They have analyzed π biosensors in the SAC9(C459A) to provide the support that this mutation affects SCA9 enzymatic activity. The evidence documenting SAC9 interactions with SH3P2 is now much stronger with the addition of SH3P2-GFP IP-MS experiments. The localization data are now much better aligned with the authors' claims and much more clearly communicated. The authors have also provided a very detailed response to the previous reviewer comments. However, several of my previous comments have not been adequately addressed:</p><p>1. Quantification of cortical vs endoplasmic SAC9-labelled particles has been added to the manuscript in the figure on P. 45 G (the figures are not numbered in the document I was sent for review, so I refer to them by page number in the pdf). However, there is a flaw with the approach: density per cell is a misleading measurement since, in the zii plane, there are of course fewer puncta per area since there is less cytoplasm because the nucleus and vacuole take up about half of the area.

If the differences in SAC9 puncta density in cortical/endoplasmic cytoplasm do not hold when properly quantified, please revise the text and title accordingly.</p><p>2. Why is p. 45 G &quot;density of SAC9 puncta per cell&quot; in a range of 0.001-0.003, but presented as &quot;number of SCA9 puncta per cell&quot; in p 53 C in a range of 5-20? Why present two different measures? Why are there 10-fold more SAC9 puncta per cell than FM4-64 puncta in the figure on p 35 C vs D, when the authors described these markers as colocalized (line 160)?</p><p>3. The number of independent transgenic lines analyzed is still not indicated.

Please present data from at least three independent transgenic lines for each new construct.</p><p>4. It is not clear in the main figure legends or text what N and n are in the graphs. If this means seedlings and cells, please clarify how statistical analyses are being conducted (i.e. which is being used as sample size). Inappropriately identifying N drastically affects p-values, and therefore conclusions from statistical analysis. N is the number of independent biological replicates (e.g. plants), not the number of measurements taken (Lord et al., 2020 J Cell Biol). For example, it’s unlikely that &gt;1000 independent plants were analyzed in the figure on p. 48 B. Please revise accordingly.</p><p>5. Introduction line 27: why redefine endocytosis, rather than just calling this “endocytic trafficking” throughout (i.e. as you do on line 41)? This will be less confusing to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>6. The article requires careful proofreading, particularly for tense use/agreement, article use, and number agreement. As just a few examples: intro line 18 should read “abundance” not “abundant”, in intro line 31: remove “the” from “the endocytosis”, intro line 54: “FM4-64 experiment” should be plural, intro line 78: “the sac9 mutants is dwarf” should be “sac9 mutants are dwarf”</p><p>7. Timestamp and scale bars are missing in supplemental videos.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my opinion, the authors have overall satisfactorily addressed the editor's and my major comments/concerns. As detailed below I have only a few remaining issues (that do not require further experimentation) that I feel the authors should address.</p><p>Response to Editor's comments/concerns:</p><p>1. Imaging PIP2 marker in a sac9 C459A mutant background to see changes in PI distribution as in loss-of-function sac9 background</p><p>This is supported. The marker mCIT-TUBBYc is imaged in WT, sac9, and sac9C459A lines. The images of both mutant backgrounds look identical, but this is not quantitated. It should be noted that imaging of mCIT-TUBBYc in the WT was done at the zii level (4A) while in sac9 is at zii and zi (4A and 4C) but C459A is in zi (4C).</p><p>2. Confirm cortical nature of SAC9: image this relative to TGN/EE markers in multiple layers of the cell AND clarify when each image is taken in the cortex or interior of the cell</p><p>Overall the analysis is improved. Most images indicate whether the plane of focus is at the cell cortex or interior using the appreciated zi vs zii notation. The images and quantitation in Figures 2F and 2G indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in the number of endosomes labeled by SAC9 between the cortex and interior.</p><p>I remain somewhat concerned that the analysis would have been more convincing had the authors compared the distribution of wild-type SAC9 relative to intracellular FM4-64. Supplemental Figure 2 imaging comparison was conducted between mCIT-Sac9delta 999-1027 and FM4-64. This is confusing as in figure 1 the authors show that the SAC9 mutant variant lacking the coiled coil region is cytosolic. More informative would have been the comparison of wild-type SAC9 and internalized FM4-64 rather than PH domain or Lti6b reporters in Zi and Zii focal planes.</p><p>3. Verification of SH3P2 and SAC9 interaction by additional method (e.g. coIP or FRET)</p><p>I feel that the additional reciprocal co-IP data presented in Figure 6 showing that SH3P2-GFP interacts with tobacco SAC9 addresses this concern. Additionally, confocal microscopy shows that localization of SH3P2 to the plasma membrane is strongly affected by the loss of SAC9.</p><p>4. Address disconnect between images and quantitation of images and/or image mCIT (or other tags) relative to markers used.</p><p>This is somewhat supported. Harmonization of the majority of images in the manuscript is appreciated but is not totally consistent (e.g. mCIT-TUBBYc imaging in Figure 4A and 4C; imaging of SAC9 between mock and BFA treatments occurs in zi and zii, respectively). Figure 3 remains the same as in the previous manuscript draft, where the authors had included images of RabF2 colocalization with C459A SAC9 but not the corresponding quantitation and the authors had included the quantitation of VTI12 with WT SAC9 but did not show the image. In this revision, the authors have supplemented the quantitation in Figure 3F with 'representative' colocalization image of WT SAC9 and VTI12 in Figure 3-supplemental Figure 1, but it is not apparent if the image shown in the supplement is actually quantitated in the main manuscript figures. (Note: the panel in Figure 3-supplemental Figure 1 is not labeled as VTI12 but instead as W13R - is this the same? Authors need to make it clear, as the figure legend for Figure 3-supplemental Figure 1 refers to VTI12.) The authors do not address the fact that C459A SAC9 colocalization with CLC2 is quantitated but not shown by images or that RabF2 colocalization with C459A SAC9 is not quantitated (Figures 3G and 3H). I would ask that the authors confirm that the quantitation of the colocalization between VTI12 and WT SAC9 directly corresponds to the image shown or otherwise replace the quantitation in Figure 3 with that directly corresponding to Supplemental Figure 3.</p><p>In response to the suggestion from reviewer 2, there is no imaging of mCIT alone relative to the other markers used.</p><p>The additional data corresponding to the loss of the coiled-coil domain (SAC9-deltaCC) resulting in the loss of endosomal localization pattern is interesting to note. And, while the inability of this variant to rescue the sac9 mutant indeed supports that this feature is important for the function of the protein, it does not necessarily indicate that the coiled-coil region mediates membrane association. But, this is asserted only in the response to reviewers and not in the manuscript itself.</p><p>5. Confirm that loss of endocytic proteins at PM in sac9 is not due to their downregulation. Possibly also address whether sac9 affects other TGN/EE-related processes, e.g. post-Golgi trafficking.</p><p>Overall the authors have addressed this concern however the quality of the immunoblot in Supplementary data figure 6 is low and the data is not quantitated. Immunoblot analyses show that with equal loading (as assessed by Ponceau and anti-tubulin) of total protein extracts from WT and sac9 plants, the GFP signal of TPLATE-GFP or SH3P2-GFP does not change in the sac9 mutant. Curious - what are the roughly 67 kDa bands present between the columns where WT and sac9 total protein extract were loaded? The data in Figures 6F and 6G show better than the ratio of SH3P2 in the cytosol relative to the PM is increased in sac9 relative to WT and is actually more convincing in showing that downregulation contributes less to decreased abundance of SH3P2 at the PM than does the change in SH3P2 re-distribution to the cytosol.</p><p>The authors do have the tools to assess disruption of post-Golgi trafficking in sac9 backgrounds, as they already have a PIN2::PIN2-GFP in sac9 line which was used for a PIN2-GFP localization to BFA body assay in Figure 5. This assay has been used to show that endocytosis is disrupted in sac9 background because the distribution of cells with BFA bodies labeled by PIN2-GFP is decreased/shifted to the left compared to WT. Problematically, cycloheximide has not been used in this BFA assay. The internalization of FM4-64 in Figures 5A-5D is more appropriate to show that endocytosis is impaired, and perhaps the BFA/PIN2-GFP internalization assay could be moved to the supplement of the manuscript. But, ultimately, I am satisfied by the authors' statement in the Discussion that likely multiple explanations exist for why sac9 displays impaired endocytosis independently of/concomitant with PIP-related factors.</p><p>6. Analyze multiple independent transgenic rescues.</p><p>This is supported. Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B demonstrate multiple sac9 alleles, a full rescue of sac9 by two different fluorescent tag fusions of SAC9, and the inability of multiple transformants of delta CC SAC9 to rescue sac9 (but only one transformant of C459A inability to rescue sac9 is shown). The additional language regarding independent transformants is helpful.</p><p>7. Quantitate FM4-64 internalization defects of sac9 lines using images where FM4-64 staining at the PM is comparable to WT.</p><p>This is supported. Supplemental Figure 5 shows that FM4-64 staining at the PM in sac9 is comparable to WT.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #2 comments/concerns:</p><p>1. Validate the use of FM4-64 labeling of BFA bodies in sac9 by showing that formation of BFA bodies in this mutant is similar to WT (e.g. by showing that BFA body formation labeled by TGN/EE markers is unaltered in sac9).</p><p>Although the author did not directly address this concern the authors effectively argue that endocytosis is impaired in sac9 mutants due to impaired internalization of FM4-64 and altered dynamics of endocytic protein players, and they also agree with the reviewer that, as is, their experiment is insufficient to show whether a combination of impairment of endocytosis and/or post-Golgi trafficking occurs in sac9. They have included a discussion about the interpretation of the BFA results (lines 474-476). Note, the authors should consider an additional alternative that BFA body formation is affected in the sac9 mutant due to defects in endocytic/exocytic which alter TGN/EE function as shown in the study by Yan et al Plant Cell 2021</p><p>2. Explain why colocalization between SH3P2 and SAC9 was not performed using WT SAC9.</p><p>This is mostly resolved by Figures 6D and 6E which show colocalization between SH3P2 and WT SAC9 as well as between SH3P2 and SAC9 C459A variant. However, a minor concern is that the imaging experiment with WT SAC9 is performed in the zi plane while the experiment with the C459A variant has been performed in the zii plane, and both are quantitated in panel 6E where the y-axis shows SAC9/SH3P2 colocalization in the zi plane. Authors should consider addressing this.</p><p>3. Address localization of PIP2 probe, mCIT-TUBBYc, to the cytoplasm/nucleus as well as PM in comparison to 2xPH probe which localizes only to PM.</p><p>Resolved by the new language.</p><p>4. Address apparent increase in intracellular PI4P levels in sac9 and how changes in PI4P levels fit into the model (Figure 8).</p><p>The authors state that we will not be able to resolve the interplay between the effects of PI4P and PIP2 in mediating sac9 and acknowledge that the effect on ARF1 GTPase is unknown. But, they do effectively argue that the observed increase in intracellular PI4P levels as measured by probes that do not localize concomitantly to the TGN/EE due to interaction with ARF1, e.g. mCIT-P4M, provides evidence that the ARF1 effect is not critical here. But, the authors do not satisfyingly address the role of PI4P in their model in this response.</p><p>5. Validate the use of ARF protein binding defective mutant, FAPP-E50A, as opposed to WT variant used elsewhere.</p><p>Satisfactorily, addressed by moving figure to supplemental materials.</p><p>6. Indicate whether the image shown at higher magnification in Figure 4F is from the Zi or Zii plane of focus.</p><p>Resolved by removing the image.</p><p>7. The authors need to provide more information in the manuscript text or methods section to explain how they calculated/quantitated the 'density' of intracellular puncta in the various backgrounds. Does density refer to the number of endosomes labeled by FM4-64, e.g. per cell? Or, does it refer to the number of intracellular puncta relative to the area of the cell imaged? Similarly, how was the number of BFA bodies quantitated (Figure 6)?</p><p>Satisfactorily addressed by the addition of quantitation methodology to Methods</p><p>8. Validate choice of RabD1 as a post-Golgi endosomal markers. Pinheiro et al. support the role of RabD1 as a post-Golgi marker as it colocalizes with FM4-64 and VHAa1.</p><p>The authors argue that the Pinheiro paper does not quantify these interactions, and so they have used as support the Geldner et al. Plant J 2009 paper. However, in the Geldner paper, the assignment of wave25 (RabD1) as a post-Golgi/endosomal marker protein appears arbitrary. Indeed in Table 2 Remarks that Geldner and colleagues state that RabD1 (wave25) is similar to wave lines 29 and 33 (i.e. RabD2a and D2b) which are assigned as Intermediate Golgi/endosomal. This is more similar to what was reported by Pinheiro and thus I feel that the authors are not justified in relying on RabD1 as a post-Golgi/endosomal marker.</p><p>9. Support decrease in PM associated SH3P2 with data showing that total levels of SH3P2 are not changed.</p><p>Overall satisfactory</p><p>See the response to the editor's comments/concerns point #5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Doumane and colleagues have addressed most of the reviewer comments. Overall we are satisfied with the revised version of the manuscript. Most of the questions/comments have been answered and appear to support the authors' findings as written in the manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, for better clarification, and to fully support the publication of the manuscript, it will be beneficial to address some points not answered during the first revision:</p><p>1) It is not clarified yet in the material and methods how the co-localization was quantified. Please detail this point.</p><p>2) Co-localization of SAC9 and organelle markers. It was not discussed why mCit-SAC9-C459A seems to co-localize more importantly with LE-MVB markers, compared with the SAC9 wt version. Quantification is not included in Figure 3G.</p><p>3) For the PI4P biosensors (Fig 4), it would be recommendable to use pictures that are representative of the quantification of Fig4B. For instance, for mCIT-P4MSidM, 0 intracellular compartments are visible for sac9-3, but in the quantification, it is shown a clear increase of the intracellular compartments (two stars).</p><p>With regard to the clarification of the focal plane (commented in the first revision), would be recommendable to use replace the picture of sac9-3 x mCIT2xPHPLC (that is Zi) for a picture of the Zii plane, to be consistent with the rest of the pictures present in the panel (all of them in the plane Zii).</p><p>4) The manuscript would benefit from adding all the explanations included in the &quot;response to reviewers&quot;. Ex. from our comment #9, among others.</p><p>Suggestion:</p><p>The classification of C1 and C2 (Fig 2A), it is not used in the rest of the paper, so it would be recommendable to erase it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73837.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim that SAC9 is indeed a 5-phosphatase could be supported by imaging PI(4,5)P2 markers sac9 mutants carrying CIT-SAC9(C459A) to document similar changes to π distribution in the “catalytically dead” version as in the sac9 loss of function mutant. Please also revise the text surrounding the claims that SAC9 is a phosphatase, for example by referring to the C459A mutant “putative catalytically inactive”</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, to document if similar changes to phosphoinositides distribution in the C459A mutated version of SAC9 were observed (as it does in the sac9 loss-of-function mutant), we monitored the localization of the PI(4,5)P2 biosensor in sac9-3 background expressing SAC9<sup>C459A</sup>. We found that the intracellular structures igherd by mCIT-TUBBYc were still visible in sac9-3 expressing SAC9pro:tdTOM-SAC9<sup>C459A</sup>, confirming that C459A mutant is not functional both in terms of controlling normal plant growth at the whole plant levels and PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis at the cellular level. The data are now presented in Figure 4. In igherd, we carefuly reworded the manuscript and systematically refer to the C459 as the putative catalytic igherd and the C459A mutant as a putative catalytically inactive variant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional imaging data need to be presented to document that SAC9 is localized to a “cortical subpopulation” of early endosomes. To support this claim, the authors would need to carefully compare the distribution of SAC9 relative to other TGN/EE markers (e.g internalized FM4-64, SPY61, VHAa1 etc.) throughout the entire volume of cells. Alternatively, the authors may remove these claims from the manuscript. In either case, it will be important to clearly indicate which focal plane is being presented in each image, as noted by Reviewer 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We harmonized the pictures in the manuscript, systematically showing the cortical view of the cell (Zi), and for some key experiments, the localization in the median plane of the cell, (Zii, plane going through the nucleus).</p><p>We quantified the number of endosomes stained by mCIT-SAC9 in these two focal planes (Zi and Zii) and quantified that mCIT-SAC9 localization in endosomes is more visible in the cortex of the cell than in its center, and igherd then to FM4-64 labelling.

This data strongly support our observation about SAC9 subcortical localization.</p><p>We included additional quantifications, in particular between FM4-64/mCIT-SAC9 and SH3P2/SAC9. The data are presented in Figures 3, 7, and Figure 2-supplemental Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At least one additional method is required to verify the interaction between SAC9 and SH3P2: CoIP, BiFC FRET, proximity labelling are all appropriate, assuming rigorous controls are also presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We encountered difficulties working with the SAC9 protein in vitro or with western blots extracted from Arabidopsis. To confirm the interaction, we thus collaborated with Suayb Üstün (ZMBP Tübingen) and his lab. They expressed SH3P2-GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and performed IP-MS experiments in the absence (3 replicates) and presence (3 replicates) of a proteasome inhibitor (to increase SAC9 stability). SAC9 was found as a top 10 interactor in all 6 experimental replicates (never found in the GFP only controls) and as the top SH3P2 interactor after proteasome inhibition. We also now include colocalization analysis (representative pictures and quantification) between SH3P2 and wild-type SAC9. In addition, we performed new experiments showing that SH3P2 plasma membrane association is compromised in the sac9 mutant. Together, with our yeast-two hybrid data, we believe that our new IP-MS and in planta colocalization analyses strengthen our conclusion on the SH3P2/SAC9 complex. – The data are presented in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the colocalization experiments, there seems to be a disconnect between the images and the quantification. Additional information in the methods could help clarify this. Reviewer 2 has suggested a control colocalization experiment between a soluble protein (e.g. untagged mCIT) and several markers. This is feasible within the timeline for revisions since imaging could be conducted within the F1 generation.</p></disp-quote><p>We added information in the material and method explaining how the images were quantified, as well as in the legend of the figures.</p><p>We harmonized the pictures in the manuscript, systematically showing the cortical view of the cell (Zi), and for some key experiments, the localization in the median plane of the cell, (Zii, plane going through the nucleus).</p><p>We added representative images for the colocalization analysis of mCIT-SAC9 with the TGN marker VTI12 in Figure 3-supplemental Figure 1.</p><p>We are now including in the revised manuscript a mutated form of SAC9 in its predicted Coil-Coiled domain (SAC9-deltaCC, Figure 2B), which is no longer able to complement the mutant sac9-3 and is localized only in the cytoplasm.

This claim could be further supported by investigating the possibility that other SH3P2-related processes (MBV formation, autophagy, cell plate formation) are affected (e.g. marker line imaging in the sac9 mutant), as suggested by Reviewer 1 or testing whether loss of sac9 might generally affect intracellular trafficking by assessing TGN/EE function (e.g. PIN2 localization/recycling, secGFP imaging), as suggested by Reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We are now presenting in Figure S5 by immunoblotting that the total protein level of SH3P2-GFP and T-PLATE-GFP do not dramatically change in the sac9 backgrounds. We can therefore conclude that the decrease in the levels of plasma membrane-associated SH3P2-sGFP is not due to a decrease in the total abundance of SH3P2. Similarly, the decreased density of T-PLATE-GFP in plasma membrane foci, as well as its alterned dynamics cannot simply be attributed to a igherdt expression level in sac9.</p><p>The plasma membrane localization of SH3P2 is specifically affected in sac9, while it still associates in intracellular compartments in this mutant. Data are presented in Figure 6</p><p>For the interest of time and the focus of the manuscript, we did not investigate other SH3P2-related processes in sac9. We think this is outside of the scope of this manuscript. We do not claim that SAC9 is involved only in endocytosis and in fact, given the widespread function of phosphoinositides, it is likely that it has additional functions outside of endocytosis. We have added a sentence to explain this point better in the revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>“We observed that the endocytic pathway is partially impaired in the absence of SAC9. We envision several scenarios to explain these endocytic defects. They are not mutually exclusive and ultimately, it would not be surprising if the sac9 endocytic phenotype results from a combination of altered cellular pathways relying, directly or indirectly, on the precise spatio-temporal regulation of anionic lipid homeostasis.”</p><p>In addition, as pointed out, SH3P2 is a igherdtional protein involved in many cellular processes and it is still unclear whether those SH3P2-related functions are independent or interrelated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors must present evidence of analyzing multiple independent transgenic lines for complementation experiments, as raised by Reviewer 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize because it was not clearly stated in the material and methods, but all over the study, and for each construct, at least 20 primary T1 transformants were selected. Independent T2 and T3 plants were obtained for subsequent analysis. We, therefore, selected multiple independent lines for the complementation and we obtained similar results. The data are presented in supplemental figure 1A, B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The FM4-64 uptake experiments need to be re-analyzed (or perhaps re-performed) on samples that show comparable PM staining between wild type and sac9 mutants. This is essential to eliminate the trivial explanation for reduced FM4-64 uptake into cells, since it is possible FM4-46 integration into the plasma membrane is affected in sac9 mutants due to changes in PM composition.</p></disp-quote><p>FM4-64 itself is a lipid that intercalates in membrane. In addition, PI(4,5)P2 and PI4P represent less than a percent of the total phospholipids, which themselves are only about a third of total lipids. Moreover, PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 are embedded in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane while FM4-64 insert in the outer leaflet of the membrane. Altogether, we thus have no reason to believe FM4-64 labeling itself would be affected in sac9, and this is in line with our confocal observations.</p><p>Indeed, we did not observe a clear difference in between the WT and sac9-3 regarding the portion of the plasma membrane (PM) stained by FM4-64.</p><p>We added in supplemental figure 4 representative images used for the quantification with FM4-64.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors repeatedly claim that “In this study, we show that the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of SAC9 is required for its function.” (line 75, line 100, line 282, etc) but they have not documented any biochemical activity of SAC9. They say that these experiments were unsuccessful; attempts to purify SAC9 and determine its activity should be presented in the supplemental data to support these claims. As a proxy, the authors rely on the mCIT-SAC9(C459A) mutant, which they assume is catalytically inactive. They provide a reasonable discussion of the caveats to their data, but this paper is weakened without any evidence of SAC9 activity. It would support their claims that mCIT-SAC9(C459A) is catalytically inactive to document similar changes to PI(4,5)P2 distribution in sac9 mutants carrying CIT-SAC9(C459A). It’s also not appropriate to call C459 the “catalytic cystine” (line 94) without documenting activity.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to document if similar changes to phosphoinositides distribution in the sac9-3 expressing the C459A version of SAC9 was observed (as it does in the sac9 loss of function mutant), we used the PI(4,5)P2 biosensor localization in sac9-3 complemented line as a read-out for functional complementation. We showed that while the PI(4,5)P2 biosensor TUBBYc-mCIT was located in intracellular structure in sac9-3 mutants plants, the localization of the biosensor was fully restored in sac9-3 complemented with Ub10pro:tdTOM-SAC9 and SAC9pro:mCIT-SAC9. By contrast, the intracellular structures igherd by mCIT-TUBBYc were still visible in sac9-3 expressing SAC9pro:tdTOM-SAC9<sup>C459A</sup>, confirming that mutation in the putative catalytic cysteine abolished the function of the enzyme. The new data is now presented in Figure 4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Furthermore, only one independent transgenic line is presented for complementation experiments and the C459A line clearly expresses much less protein than wild type SAC9 complementation line (Supplemental Figure 1A), so it is quite possible that the lack of sac9 rescue by mCIT-SAC9(C459A) is simply due to less (but potentially fully functional) SAC9 protein in this line. Please present complementation data from at least three independent transgenic lines for each construct and document SAC9 protein levels in each line, especially the CIT-SAC9(C459A) lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize because it was not clearly stated in the material and methods: All over the study, and for each construct, at least 20 primary T1 transformants were selected.

We thus performed additional western blot in two independent lines expressing CIT-SAC9(C459A). This confirmed that CIT-SAC9(C459A) accumulates to similar extent (or perhaps slightly higher) than wild-type SAC9. Thus, SAC9(C459A) is indeed non-functional despite being expressed and stable. We have now included these new results in Figure 1-supplemental Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors make statements about the localization of SA“9 such as &quot;fluorescent SAC9 protein fusions localize…in a subpopulation of endosomes close to the plas”a membrane&quot; (line 149, 284, 311, 312). There are clearly SAC9-labelled puncta not at the cell cortex (for example, Figure 2D, the lefthand cell is an endoplasmic plane of section through the vacuole and many bright SAC9 puncta are visible quite far from the PM). The authors could remove these unsupported claims; however, this would substantially dimmish their central claim that SAC9 is somehow specific to endocytosis and specifically labelling new endocytic vesicles.</p></disp-quote><p>By comparing the signal observed at the cortex of the cell (Zi focal lane) with the signal collected at the center of the same cell (Zii focal plane, Figure 2A), we observed and quantified that mCIT-SAC9 labeled more intracellular compartments close to the plasma membrane that a distal position (Figure 2F, G). This is clearly not a all or nothing localization, and for this reason we prefer to speak about “enrichment in the cortex of the cell”. We change the title accordingly to reflect this: “The Arabidopsis SAC9 Enzyme is enriched in a cortical population of early endosomes and restricts PI(4,5)P2 at the Plasma Membrane”</p><p>We agree that the proximity of the vacuole from the PM could be misleading: However, we regularly see the vacuole close to the PM, at Zi (see panel A and B figure 3 as example).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The authors claim that SAC9 function is specific to endocytosis (line 331). However, they have not tested any other processes in sac9 mutants, including SH3P2-mediated processes such as multivesicular body formation (Nagel et al., 2017 PNAS), cell plate formation (Ahn et al., 2017 Plant Cell), autophagy (Zhuang et al., 2013 Plant Cell), so it is inappropriate to claim that SAC9 has such a specific function. The authors could either assess MVB formation, autophagy, and cell plate formation in sac9 mutants or they could remove these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We remove this claim from the discussion as we don’t think thatSAC9 play a role only in endocytosis since PI(4,5)P2 is important for a plethora of processes in plants (see our response to the editor above). We however think that SAC9 dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P2 during endocytosis to remove it from the surface of nescent endocytic vesicles and/or early endosomes. Accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 inside the cell in sac9 in turn is likely to have pleiotropic effects, one such effect being a feedback on endocytosis itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors show that the number of BFA bodies labeled with FM4-64 in sac9-3 vs wild-type is reduced, consistent with a decrease in endocytosis of the tracer dye. However, this assumes that the formation of BFA bodies (i.e. the number per cell area or volume) in sac9-3 mutants is similar to that of wild-type. Quantitation of BFA body formation, using markers of the TGN/EE in wild-type and mutant cells should thus be presented to rule out that formation of BFA bodies is not altered in the sac9 mutant cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a reduction of FM4-64 staining in BFA bodies could be due to (i) a lower amount of BFA bodies formed per cell (i.e., the number per cell area or volume), (ii) reduced FM4-64 internalization from the cell surface, or (iii) a combination of both. In either case, such decrease suggests that membrane trafficking flux through the endosomal system is impacted in sac9. Alone, such experiment would certainly not be enough to conclude on the impact of SAC9 on internalization from the plasma membrane. However, these data should be interpreted together with our additional endocytosis experiments, including: less FM4-64 internalization (no BFA), heightened sensitivity to endocytosis inhibition and the reduction in T-PLATE foci density and altered dynamics in sac9. To be more cautious, we have now included a discussion about the interpretation of the BFA result.</p><p>We also added in supplemental figure 4 representatives images used for the quantification of the BFA bodies stained with FM4-64.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Based on confocal imaging, the authors conclude that the level of plasma membrane associated SH3P2-sGFP is partially reduced in the sac9 mutant. Additional experiments including quantitative analysis of the total levels and distribution of SH3P2 in sac9 mutant and wild type subcellular fractionations (e.g. enriched plasma membrane, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions) would address whether loss of SAC9 affects the levels of SH3P2 and provide complementary data supporting the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We are now presenting in Figure S5 by immunoblotting that the total protein level of SH3P2-GFP does not dramatically change in sac9 backgrounds.

We learned using SAC9 native promoter or UBQ10pro, which both complement the sac9-3 phenotype, that the SAC9 enzyme strongly accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is presumably not active because not in contact with its lipid substrate. Therefore, the absence of phenotype due to the over expression of SAC9 might be linked to a limiting factor which is responsible for the addressing of SAC9 to the membrane to fulfill its function. Moreover the UBq10 promoter is quite mild, so maybe they are not overexpression.

The co-expression of the WT version of SAC9 and the mutated SAC9C459A. It is expected by the authors that the mutation in SAC9 affects mainly the function but not the localization of SAC9.

Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if this was not clear. We indeed expected SAC9C459A to affect function but we had no preconceived idea on localization, because both could be linked (which was indeed the case). We expected C459 to be catalytically inactive, because this residue is predicted to be the catalytic residue within the SAC domain and similar mutations in phosphoinositide phosphatases are well known to affect their catalytic activity. This assumption is consistent with our results showing that SAC9C459A is not functional (unable to rescue the sac9 mutant) and that PI(4,5)P2 misslocalization is affected when C459 is mutated (new data presented in the revised manucript). However, we agree that we haven’t shown formally that this mutant is indeed catalytically dead and we now refer to this mutant as a putative dead version throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Concerning the localization of SAC9C459A, we did find an effect of the mutation on the localization: SAC9C459A membrane association is increased compared to that of the wild type SAC9 (increased ratio of fluorescence in intracellular compartments compared to the cytosolic localization). This is likely because the mutation of the catalytic site impacts the on/off interaction between SAC9 and membranes, as seen for other lipid phosphatases in animal systems. Note that we did not find any obvious differences in the localization of SAC9C459A when expressed in a WT background (expressing wild type functional SAC9) or in a sac9 mutant (see Figure 2B and 2H). Thus, there is no direct effect of SAC9 on SAC9C459A localization. In any case, this result aligns well with the scenario listed by referee #3 (i.e. expression of SAC9 does not prevent SAC9C459A to localize in the vesicular structures). We haven’t tried the experiment in which we overexpress wild type SAC9 and analyze the localization of SAC9C459A, because this is a complicated genotype to produce and given the absence of phenotype following overexpression we believe this would not be very informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2G: The localization of the native SAC9 at the PM by co-localization with a PM reported, as done for SAC9C459A is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the colocalization of mCIT-SAC9 with the PM-labelled PI(4,5)P2 biosensor in Figure 2F.

How can the authors explain that this can happen? How could you demonstrate that this increase of the PI4P in the intracellular compartments is from the PM? And why is not happening in the mCIT-PHOSB sensor? Also, in the figure is not clear that there is any increase in the intracellular compartments using the mCIT-P4MSidM sensor. In the cited paper was quantified the number of intracellular compartments labeled with the mCIT-P4MSidM and mCIT-PHOSB, which was practically 0, being very surprising the quantification of the intracellular particles in both cases in the present paper. In these sensors, there is not an obvious decrease (is not quantified) of the PM signal that could explain the increase of the intracellular compartments signal.</p></disp-quote><p>In the present study we used an automatic spot detection as we published in Bayle et al., 2017 (bio-protocol), while we used double blind manual counting in Simon et al., 2016. This difference in quantification method explains the slight discrepancies between the two studies (i.e. few spots inside the cells are found in P4M by automatic counting, while no spots could be found when done by eye). Indeed, automatic spot detection has the advantage of being fully unbiased, but it sometimes detects few spots that would not be counted as “endosomes” by the user. This also explains why we do find some spots for the PI(4,5)P2 sensors, while in the wild type, these sensors never localize in intracellular compartments.</p><p>We now explained this better in the method section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We do observe the same tendency for PH(OSBP) than for the other two PI4P sensors, however it is true that the effect is not statistically different in that case. We don't know what cause the effect on PI4P, but that it is likely due to the fact that the absence of SAC9 impact PI4P homeostasis, which is the putative product of the enzyme. The quantity of PI4P present at the PM (using the biosensors as a rideout) is greater that at the TGN (Simon et al., Nature plant 2016). Therefore we are not expecting to see a difference in the intensity of the signal at the PM for the PI4P biosensors in sac9-3. Indeed, when depleting the PI4P from the PM using a genetic tool described in Simon et al., Nature Plant 2016, we did not observed a complete disparition of the PI4P biosensor at the PM as we did when depleting the PI(4,5)P2 from the PM using similar approach (Doumane et al., Nature Plant 2021)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Line 174-177: &quot;When co-imaging 2xmCH-2xPHFAPP1 together mCIT-TUBBYc in sac9-3-/- (Figure 4D), the dotty structures decorated by the PI(4,5)P2 biosensor -but not with the PI4P biosensor- were observed at the cortex of the cell, at the close vicinity with the plasma membrane (Figure 4D upper panel and 4E), whereas those structures were rarely observed in the internal part of the cell&quot;.

Moreover, it was recently shown, by colocalization of the mCIT-2×PH<sup>FAPP1</sup> PI4P biosensor with the SVs/TGN markers VHA-a1 fused to mRFP and ECHIDNA, that strong colocalization between mCIT-2× or mCIT-3×PH<sup>FAPP1</sup> and either VHA-a1-mRFP or ECHIDNA was observed upon Metazachlore treatment, confirming that the intracellular accumulation of PI4P sensors occurs at Secretory vesicle part of the TGN when the acyl-chain length of SLs is reduced (Ito et al., Nature comm. 2021). We assume that PI4P accumulates in those compartments in the sac9 mutant like in the wild type. This hypothesis is supported by the BFA sensitivity of the PI4P marker in sac9 mutant, showing that the intracellular compartments labeled by the PI4P sensor aggregates in the BFA bodies (and strongly suggesting a TGN localization similar to the WT situation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Are the intracellular compartments labeled by the PI(4,5)P2 sensors the same where SAC9C459A is accumulating (or where WT SAC9 can be also found)?</p></disp-quote><p>We now added data showing that in sac9-3-/- coexpressing the PI(4,5)P2 biosensor mCIT-TUBBYc together with the non-functional SAC9pro:tdTOM-SAC9C459A, mCIT-TUBBYc intracellular structure are not the same but are observed at the same focal plane than tdTOM-SAC9C459A.

To further confirm the interaction of both proteins, other methods like Co-immunoprecipitation (with or without crosslinker) or biotin proximity labeling (PL) (Mair et al., 2019) are recommendable.</p></disp-quote><p>We are now including in figure 6 the colocalization between SAC9pro-mCIT-SAC9 x</p><p>Ub10pro:TdTOM-SH3P2 and the corresponding quantification.</p><p>We encountered difficulties working with the SAC9 protein in vitro or with western blots extracted from Arabidopsis. To confirm the interaction, we thus collaborated with Suayb Üstün (ZMBP Tübingen) and his lab. They expressed SH3P2-GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and performed IP-MS experiments in the absence (3 replicates) and presence (3 replicates) of a proteasome inhibitor (to increase SAC9 stability). SAC9 was found as a top 10 interactor in all 6 experimental replicates (never found in the GFP only controls) and as the top SH3P2 interactor after proteasome inhibition. We also now include colocalization analysis (representative pictures and quantification) between SH3P2 and wild-type SAC9. In addition, we performed new experiments showing that SH3P2 plasma membrane association is compromised in the sac9 mutant. Together, with our yeast-two hybrid data, we believe that our new IP-MS and in planta colocalization analyses strengthen our conclusion on the SH3P2/SAC9 complex. – The data are presented in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Lines 312-314: &quot;Together, we propose that SAC9 represent the long-sought-after enzyme which performs the PI(4,5)P2-to-PI4P conversion during the plant endocytic process (Figure 9).&quot; How is SAC9 recruited to the PM-vesicles for performing its function? It is clear that this question could be difficult to address for this publication, but could this recruitment be through the interaction with other proteins, i.e., SH3P2? Are they mutually needing each other to localize properly? In that case, what is the localization of SAC9 in the sh3p2 mutant background?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that SAC9 is recruited to the PM-vesicles for performing its function through its putative Coiled Coiled domain, since the cytosolic SAC9-deltaCC version does not seems to interact with membranes and do not complement the sac9-3 drawf phenotype.

We could not test the localization of SAC9 in the sh3p2 mutant background since literature reports variably on the effects of SH3P2 deficiency. T-DNA alleles that are likely not full knock-outs, did not exhibit obvious phenotypic defects (Ahn et al., 2017; Nagel et al., 2017), while the RNAi line silencing SH3P2 exhibited an arrest of seedling development (Zhuang et al., 2013): We tested this published line, but the construct was silenced, so we were unable to reproduce the results.

Trajectories were reconstructed following a three-stage workflow: (i) detection of peaks potentially associated with fluorescent emitters, (ii) quality test and estimation of the subpixel position and (iii) track reconnection. To discriminate between signal and background, particular attention has been paid to the size and shape of the observable objects. Particle of minimum size 0.5 with a threshold of 50 and a contrast &gt;0.04 were filtered, to capture as many spots as possible without background. For many reasons, such as variation in fluorescent intensity, loss of focus or photobleaching, the emitter can be missing for several time points causing the premature stop of tracks. Therefore, the maximum number of frames separating two detections was set to three frames (Bayle et al., 2021). As a final verification, a visual inspection of the tracks can be performed on a reconstituted image, where all the tracks from a video are represented.</p><p>2000 tracks were selected per acquisition starting from frame 5 to avoid segmenting truncated tracks.

Indeed, at 12°C, the dwelltime of TPLATE-GFP at the plasma membrane is longer than at 25°C and in this condition endocytosis is reduced. Although such an inverse correlation between TPLATE dwell time at the plasma membrane and a reduction of the endocytic rate was observed for temperature, to our knowledge, it cannot be generalized. For example, it is possible that interaction between the TPLATE complex and the plasma membrane is less stable in the sac9 mutant, leading to shorter TPLATE dwell time and aborded endocytic events. Such scenario is also compatible with a decrease density of TPLATE-GFP foci (which itself is consistent with a decrease endocytic rate in the mutant). However, we believe the scenario highlighted above is too speculative and we prefer to err on the side of caution and not to discuss how an alterned TPLATE-GFP dynamics translates on endocytosis. We think the important message is that when PI(4,5)P2 patterning is disturbed, protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane have an altered localization (i.e., density) and dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Please, re-check the methodology to describe the experimental set-up and data analysis in the detail required to be repeated by other colleagues.

Quantification of cortical vs endoplasmic SAC9-labelled particles has been added to the manuscript in the figure on P. 45 G (the figures are not numbered in the document I was sent for review, so I refer to them by page number in the pdf). However, there is a flaw with the approach: density per cell is a misleading measurement since, in the zii plane, there are of course fewer puncta per area since there is less cytoplasm because the nucleus and vacuole take up about half of the area. Please present data as punta per area of cytoplasm. If the differences in SAC9 puncta density in cortical/endoplasmic cytoplasm do not hold when properly quantified, please revise the text and title accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 1 that the presence of the vacuole at zii could have made it difficult to compare zi and zii. Taking into account this pitfall, we quantified the number of labeled endosomes with FM4-64 in the Col-0 plant at zi and zii. The data is presented in Figure 2. We saw that even if the vacuole is present in the image at zii, the difference in the density of FM4-64 labeled endosomes at zi and zii is not significant (p = 0.098; N=7 roots, n=35 cells) while the density of labeled mCIT-SAC9 is different between zi and zii (p&lt;2.2e-16; N=7 roots, n=35 cells).</p><p>We, therefore, consider, based on these results, that the enrichment of SAC9 at zi is not due to an imaging problem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We agree that using two different measures and presenting them across a main and a supplemental figure was confusing.

This is confusing as in figure 1 the authors show that the SAC9 mutant variant lacking the coiled-coil region is cytosolic.

Indeed, we quantified the density of both wild-type mCit-SAC9 and FM4-64 in Zi and Zii. This analysis shows that SAC9-mCIT-labbeled compartment are much denser in Zi as compared to Zii, while this is not the case for FM4-64-labelled endosomes (see also our answer to referee #1 above). We apologize if this was not clearer and we have now amended the text and figure to make this point clearer. In particular, we have now:</p><p>1) included the quantification of the number of SAC9 and FM4-64-labelled compartments observed per cell at a given focal plane on the same figure (Figure 2G and H).</p><p>2) added a representative image of the double labeling of mCIT-SAC9 with FM4-64 at zi and zii in Figure 2 supplementary figure 1, next to the images showing mCIT-Sac9delta 999-1027 and FM4-64.</p><p>The data presented in Figure2-supplemental Figure 1 showing mCIT-Sac9delta 999-1027 and FM4-64 answer a different question raised during the previous round of revision on the fact that the punctuated structures observed for mCit-SAC9 could be an artifact (i.e. cytosolic densities). By this supplemental figure, we confirmed here that both in zi and zii the mutated form of SAC9, which is soluble, does not colocalize with FM4-64 and is not present in cytosolic densities that could be mistaken for endosomes. We believe that this analysis, together with our results showing that SAC9 colocalizes with TGN markers and is sensitive to BFA firmly established that SAC9 localizes in TGN compartments and not “cytosolic densities” as suggested during the review process.</p><p>The colocalization of mCIT-SAC9 with a plasma membrane marker, here PH domain of PLC, was also requested in the previous review, to confirm that SAC9 is not present at the PM but only in a subcortical population of endosomes. Moreover, this experiment confirms that mCIT-SAC9 does not colocalize with the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensor, suggesting a potential role of this phosphatase in removing the pool of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the labeling of the plasma membrane by the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> marker in the wild type provides the cell contour. We believe that it is useful to visualize the cell boundaries when comparing the localization of SAC9 in two different focal plane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarify details about the number of transgenic lines (Reviewer 1, point 3 and Reviewer 2 point 6).</p><p>Reviewer 1, point 3</p><p>3. The number of independent transgenic lines analyzed is still not indicated. The text says &quot;multiple independent lines&quot; (line 103) and evidence from only one or two lines is presented in the supplemental figures. Please present data from at least three independent transgenic lines for each new construct.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this comment from referee #1. We have never heard of a “rule” stating that at least three independent transgenic lines for each new construct need to be analyzed in depth and quantified in a paper. This is certainly not the standard in the field. The number of lines to be analyzed should be depend on the type of analyses that is carried out and not on some arbitrary numbers. Indeed, it might be required to analyzed independent when the result outcome is sensitive to the insertion site (i.e., sensitive to expression level and/or expression pattern) or when it is impossible to control for protein expression (for example absence of tag and antibodies).</p><p>As you will see from the discussion below, we have solid arguments showing that the localization results presented in our paper are fully independent from the insertion site of the transgenic line analyzed. Indeed, in this story, we focus on the localization of SAC9 (and some of its mutant variants). We show that the functionality and localization of SAC9 is not dependent upon its expression level (we obtained similar results with SAC9prom and UBQ10prom) or fluorescent tags (we obtain similar results with mCitrine and tdTomato). These results were obtained with independent constructs, which is even more powerful than independent transgenic lines. Indeed, by definition, using independent constructs implies that the resulting lines are independent and that the T-DNA are inserted in different portion of the genome. So, it appears that we get similar localization and complementation independent of (i) the insertion sites, (ii) the fluorescent tag used and (iii) the strength of the promoter (to some extent at least, we off course tested only two promoters).</p><p>Please note also that the sac9 mutant has been characterized before (Williams et al., 2005) and that in this paper, we still phenotyped two independent alleles. Furthermore, for complementation analyses (or lack of complementation), we verified that proteins are expressed (using two independent methods: western blots and confocal microscopy). This effectively shows that the absence of complementation for SAC9<sup>C459A</sup> and SAC9<sup>ΔCC</sup> is not due to the insertion site (i.e., absence of expression of the transgene due to the insertion). Moreover, for complementation analyses, we present two independent lines for each construct, which again rules out that the outcome of the experiment could be due in any way to the insertion site. Furthermore, and this has been clarified in the text and in the method section, for each complementation analyses, we analyzed 24 independent transgenic lines in T1, with none of them showing a rescue of the sac9 phenotype. We assessed the phenotype of these line qualitatively in T1, but they were not quantified at the time. However, the sac9 phenotype is very strong and fully penetrant, there is no way we could have missed it if any mCIT-SAC9<sup>C459A</sup> or mCIT-SAC9<sup>ΔCC</sup> expressing sac9 mutant would have been rescued.</p><p>We also want to point out that when we generate new transgenic lines (not only for complementation analyses but for any transgenic line that we generate in the lab), we systematically select and analyze between 20 and 24 independent lines and we spent a lot of time in T2 (and then in T3) in selecting representative transgenic lines. Indeed, after analyzing between 20 and 24 independent lines in T2, we select between 3 and 5 lines that are representative and are single insertion (i.e., segregate with a 3:1 ratio on antibiotics). In T3, we then rescreen plants from each independent lines to confirm the observations obtained in T2. At this stage, we select homozygous plants and we choose one line to carry out further quantification and crosses. This means that while we present quantified data obtained with one line, we in fact have analyzed 20-24 independent lines in T2 and 3-5 independent lines in T3. This procedure is now described in details in the method section:</p><p>“For each construct generated in this paper (UBQ10prom:tdTOM-SAC9g/pH, SAC9prom:mCIT-SAC9g/pB, pAtSAC9:mCIT-SAC9g<sup>DEAD</sup>/pB, SAC9prom:TdTOM-SAC9g<sup>DEAD</sup>/pH, pAtSAC9:mCIT-SAC9g<sup>∆CC</sup>/pB, SH3P2shortprom:SH3P2gDNA-tdTOM, pUb10:SH3P2gDNA-tdTOM), between 20 and 24 independent T1 were selected on antibiotics (Basta or hygromycin) and propagated. In T2, all lines were screened using confocal microscopy for fluorescence signal and localization. Between 3 to 5 independent lines with a mono-insertion and showing a consistent, representative expression level and localization were selected and grown to the next generation. Each selected line was reanalyzed in T3 by confocal microscopy to confirm the results obtained in T2 and to select homozygous plants. At this stage, we selected one representative line for in depth analysis of the localization and crosses and two representative lines for in depth analysis of mutant complementation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 point 6</p><p>6.

They have analyzed π biosensors in the SAC9(C459A) to provide the support that this mutation affects SCA9 enzymatic activity. The evidence documenting SAC9 interactions with SH3P2 is now much stronger with the addition of SH3P2-GFP IP-MS experiments. The localization data are now much better aligned with the authors' claims and much more clearly communicated. The authors have also provided a very detailed response to the previous reviewer comments. However, several of my previous comments have not been adequately addressed:</p><p>1. Quantification of cortical vs endoplasmic SAC9-labelled particles has been added to the manuscript in the figure on P. 45 G (the figures are not numbered in the document I was sent for review, so I refer to them by page number in the pdf). However, there is a flaw with the approach: density per cell is a misleading measurement since, in the zii plane, there are of course fewer puncta per area since there is less cytoplasm because the nucleus and vacuole take up about half of the area. Please present data as punta per area of cytoplasm. If the differences in SAC9 puncta density in cortical/endoplasmic cytoplasm do not hold when properly quantified, please revise the text and title accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>See the answer to the main points above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Why is p. 45 G &quot;density of SAC9 puncta per cell&quot; in a range of 0.001-0.003, but presented as &quot;number of SCA9 puncta per cell&quot; in p 53 C in a range of 5-20? Why present two different measures? Why are there 10-fold more SAC9 puncta per cell than FM4-64 puncta in the figure on p 35 C vs D, when the authors described these markers as colocalized (line 160)?</p></disp-quote><p>See the answer to the main points above<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The number of independent transgenic lines analyzed is still not indicated. The text says &quot;multiple independent lines&quot; (line 103) and evidence from only one or two lines is presented in the supplemental figures. Please present data from at least three independent transgenic lines for each new construct.</p></disp-quote><p>See the answer to the main points above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is not clear in the main figure legends or text what N and n are in the graphs. If this means seedlings and cells, please clarify how statistical analyses are being conducted (i.e. which is being used as sample size). Inappropriately identifying N drastically affects p-values, and therefore conclusions from statistical analysis. N is the number of independent biological replicates (e.g. plants), not the number of measurements taken (Lord et al., 2020 J Cell Biol). For example, it's unlikely that &gt;1000 independent plants were analyzed in the figure on p. 48 B. Please revise accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>See the answer to the main points above<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

As detailed below I have only a few remaining issues (that do not require further experimentation) that I feel the authors should address.</p><p>Response to Editor's comments/concerns:</p><p>1. Imaging PIP2 marker in a sac9 C459A mutant background to see changes in PI distribution as in loss-of-function sac9 background</p><p>This is supported. The marker mCIT-TUBBYc is imaged in WT, sac9, and sac9C459A lines. The images of both mutant backgrounds look identical, but this is not quantitated. It should be noted that imaging of mCIT-TUBBYc in the WT was done at the zii level (4A) while in sac9 is at zii and zi (4A and 4C) but C459A is in zi (4C).</p></disp-quote><p>Image of zii in WT and sac9-3 can be found in figure 4A; while we can find the image for zi for the WT (figure 4-supplemental figure 1G), sac9-3 and sac9-3-/- expressing mCIT-TUBBY in figure 4C. As suggested, we added an image of zi for the sac9-3 het in figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Confirm cortical nature of SAC9: image this relative to TGN/EE markers in multiple layers of the cell AND clarify when each image is taken in the cortex or interior of the cell</p><p>Overall the analysis is improved. Most images indicate whether the plane of focus is at the cell cortex or interior using the appreciated zi vs zii notation. The images and quantitation in Figures 2F and 2G indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in the number of endosomes labeled by SAC9 between the cortex and interior.</p><p>I remain somewhat concerned that the analysis would have been more convincing had the authors compared the distribution of wild-type SAC9 relative to intracellular FM4-64. Supplemental Figure 2 imaging comparison was conducted between mCIT-Sac9delta 999-1027 and FM4-64. This is confusing as in figure 1 the authors show that the SAC9 mutant variant lacking the coiled coil region is cytosolic. More informative would have been the comparison of wild-type SAC9 and internalized FM4-64 rather than PH domain or Lti6b reporters in Zi and Zii focal planes.</p></disp-quote><p>See the answer to the main points above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Verification of SH3P2 and SAC9 interaction by additional method (e.g. coIP or FRET)</p><p>I feel that the additional reciprocal co-IP data presented in Figure 6 showing that SH3P2-GFP interacts with tobacco SAC9 addresses this concern. Additionally, confocal microscopy shows that localization of SH3P2 to the plasma membrane is strongly affected by the loss of SAC9.</p><p>4. Address disconnect between images and quantitation of images and/or image mCIT (or other tags) relative to markers used.</p><p>This is somewhat supported. Harmonization of the majority of images in the manuscript is appreciated but is not totally consistent (e.g. mCIT-TUBBYc imaging in Figure 4A and 4C; imaging of SAC9 between mock and BFA treatments occurs in zi and zii, respectively). Figure 3 remains the same as in the previous manuscript draft, where the authors had included images of RabF2 colocalization with C459A SAC9 but not the corresponding quantitation and the authors had included the quantitation of VTI12 with WT SAC9 but did not show the image. In this revision, the authors have supplemented the quantitation in Figure 3F with 'representative' colocalization image of WT SAC9 and VTI12 in Figure 3-supplemental Figure 1, but it is not apparent if the image shown in the supplement is actually quantitated in the main manuscript figures. (Note: the panel in Figure 3-supplemental Figure 1 is not labeled as VTI12 but instead as W13R - is this the same? Authors need to make it clear, as the figure legend for Figure 3-supplemental Figure 1 refers to VTI12.) The authors do not address the fact that C459A SAC9 colocalization with CLC2 is quantitated but not shown by images or that RabF2 colocalization with C459A SAC9 is not quantitated (Figures 3G and 3H). I would ask that the authors confirm that the quantitation of the colocalization between VTI12 and WT SAC9 directly corresponds to the image shown or otherwise replace the quantitation in Figure 3 with that directly corresponding to Supplemental Figure 3.</p><p>In response to the suggestion from reviewer 2, there is no imaging of mCIT alone relative to the other markers used.</p><p>The additional data corresponding to the loss of the coiled-coil domain (SAC9-deltaCC) resulting in the loss of endosomal localization pattern is interesting to note. And, while the inability of this variant to rescue the sac9 mutant indeed supports that this feature is important for the function of the protein, it does not necessarily indicate that the coiled-coil region mediates membrane association. But, this is asserted only in the response to reviewers and not in the manuscript itself.</p></disp-quote><p>See the answer to the main points above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Confirm that loss of endocytic proteins at PM in sac9 is not due to their downregulation. Possibly also address whether sac9 affects other TGN/EE-related processes, e.g. post-Golgi trafficking.</p><p>Overall the authors have addressed this concern however the quality of the immunoblot in Supplementary data figure 6 is low and the data is not quantitated. Immunoblot analyses show that with equal loading (as assessed by Ponceau and anti-tubulin) of total protein extracts from WT and sac9 plants, the GFP signal of TPLATE-GFP or SH3P2-GFP does not change in the sac9 mutant. Curious - what are the roughly 67 kDa bands present between the columns where WT and sac9 total protein extract were loaded? The data in Figures 6F and 6G show better than the ratio of SH3P2 in the cytosol relative to the PM is increased in sac9 relative to WT and is actually more convincing in showing that downregulation contributes less to decreased abundance of SH3P2 at the PM than does the change in SH3P2 re-distribution to the cytosol.</p><p>The authors do have the tools to assess disruption of post-Golgi trafficking in sac9 backgrounds, as they already have a PIN2::PIN2-GFP in sac9 line which was used for a PIN2-GFP localization to BFA body assay in Figure 5. This assay has been used to show that endocytosis is disrupted in sac9 background because the distribution of cells with BFA bodies labeled by PIN2-GFP is decreased/shifted to the left compared to WT. Problematically, cycloheximide has not been used in this BFA assay. The internalization of FM4-64 in Figures 5A-5D is more appropriate to show that endocytosis is impaired, and perhaps the BFA/PIN2-GFP internalization assay could be moved to the supplement of the manuscript. But, ultimately, I am satisfied by the authors' statement in the Discussion that likely multiple explanations exist for why sac9 displays impaired endocytosis independently of/concomitant with PIP-related factors.</p><p>6. Analyze multiple independent transgenic rescues.</p><p>This is supported. Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B demonstrate multiple sac9 alleles, a full rescue of sac9 by two different fluorescent tag fusions of SAC9, and the inability of multiple transformants of delta CC SAC9 to rescue sac9 (but only one transformant of C459A inability to rescue sac9 is shown). The additional language regarding independent transformants is helpful.</p><p>7. Quantitate FM4-64 internalization defects of sac9 lines using images where FM4-64 staining at the PM is comparable to WT.</p><p>This is supported. Supplemental Figure 5 shows that FM4-64 staining at the PM in sac9 is comparable to WT.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #2 comments/concerns:</p><p>1. Validate the use of FM4-64 labeling of BFA bodies in sac9 by showing that formation of BFA bodies in this mutant is similar to WT (e.g. by showing that BFA body formation labeled by TGN/EE markers is unaltered in sac9).</p><p>Although the author did not directly address this concern the authors effectively argue that endocytosis is impaired in sac9 mutants due to impaired internalization of FM4-64 and altered dynamics of endocytic protein players, and they also agree with the reviewer that, as is, their experiment is insufficient to show whether a combination of impairment of endocytosis and/or post-Golgi trafficking occurs in sac9. They have included a discussion about the interpretation of the BFA results (lines 474-476). Note, the authors should consider an additional alternative that BFA body formation is affected in the sac9 mutant due to defects in endocytic/exocytic which alter TGN/EE function as shown in the study by Yan et al Plant Cell 2021</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased it accordingly “We showed that the number of BFA bodies labeled with FM4-64 in sac9-3 vs wild-type is reduced. Such reduction may be due to (i) a lower amount of BFA bodies formed per cell (i.e., the number per cell area or volume), (ii) reduced FM4-64 internalization from the cell surface, (iii) defects in the balance between endocytic and exocytic trafficking which alter TGN/EE function, or (iv) a combination of those. In either case, such decrease suggests that membrane trafficking flux through the endosomal system is impacted in sac9.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Explain why colocalization between SH3P2 and SAC9 was not performed using WT SAC9.</p><p>This is mostly resolved by Figures 6D and 6E which show colocalization between SH3P2 and WT SAC9 as well as between SH3P2 and SAC9 C459A variant. However, a minor concern is that the imaging experiment with WT SAC9 is performed in the zi plane while the experiment with the C459A variant has been performed in the zii plane, and both are quantitated in panel 6E where the y-axis shows SAC9/SH3P2 colocalization in the zi plane. Authors should consider addressing this.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirm here that all the colocalization analyses were done in Zi, as shown in Figure 6D. We inverted the panels in Figure 6D for clarity, and added in the legend of the graph “colocalization between SAC9 and SH3P2-tdTOM in Zi (%)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Address localization of PIP2 probe, mCIT-TUBBYc, to the cytoplasm/nucleus as well as PM in comparison to 2xPH probe which localizes only to PM.</p><p>Resolved by the new language.</p><p>4. Address apparent increase in intracellular PI4P levels in sac9 and how changes in PI4P levels fit into the model (Figure 8).</p><p>The authors state that we will not be able to resolve the interplay between the effects of PI4P and PIP2 in mediating sac9 and acknowledge that the effect on ARF1 GTPase is unknown. But, they do effectively argue that the observed increase in intracellular PI4P levels as measured by probes that do not localize concomitantly to the TGN/EE due to interaction with ARF1, e.g. mCIT-P4M, provides evidence that the ARF1 effect is not critical here. But, the authors do not satisfyingly address the role of PI4P in their model in this response.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a note on the legend of the Figure 8: “Note that in this model, the slight increase observed with PI4P sensors in intracellular compartments is not included in this model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Validate the use of ARF protein binding defective mutant, FAPP-E50A, as opposed to WT variant used elsewhere.</p><p>Satisfactorily, addressed by moving figure to supplemental materials.</p><p>6. Indicate whether the image shown at higher magnification in Figure 4F is from the Zi or Zii plane of focus.</p><p>Resolved by removing the image.</p><p>7. The authors need to provide more information in the manuscript text or methods section to explain how they calculated/quantitated the 'density' of intracellular puncta in the various backgrounds. Does density refer to the number of endosomes labeled by FM4-64, e.g. per cell? Or, does it refer to the number of intracellular puncta relative to the area of the cell imaged? Similarly, how was the number of BFA bodies quantitated (Figure 6)?</p><p>Satisfactorily addressed by the addition of quantitation methodology to Methods</p><p>8. Validate choice of RabD1 as a post-Golgi endosomal markers. Pinheiro et al. support the role of RabD1 as a post-Golgi marker as it colocalizes with FM4-64 and VHAa1.</p><p>The authors argue that the Pinheiro paper does not quantify these interactions, and so they have used as support the Geldner et al. Plant J 2009 paper. However, in the Geldner paper, the assignment of wave25 (RabD1) as a post-Golgi/endosomal marker protein appears arbitrary. Indeed in Table 2 Remarks that Geldner and colleagues state that RabD1 (wave25) is similar to wave lines 29 and 33 (i.e. RabD2a and D2b) which are assigned as Intermediate Golgi/endosomal. This is more similar to what was reported by Pinheiro and thus I feel that the authors are not justified in relying on RabD1 as a post-Golgi/endosomal marker.</p></disp-quote><p>See the answer to the main points above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
