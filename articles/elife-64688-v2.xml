subtype menaquinone-4. The prenyltransferase has emerged as a key regulator of sterol-accelerated, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids including GGpp. Sterols induce binding of UBIAD1 to reductase, inhibiting its ERAD. Geranylgeraniol (GGOH), the alcohol derivative of GGpp, disrupts this binding and thereby stimulates ERAD of reductase and translocation of UBIAD1 to Golgi. We now show that overexpression of Type 1 polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase (PDP1), which dephosphorylates GGpp and other isoprenyl pyrophosphates to corresponding isoprenols, abolishes protein geranylgeranylation as well as GGOH-induced ERAD of reductase and Golgi transport of UBIAD1. Conversely, these reactions are enhanced in the absence of PDP1. Our findings indicate PDP1-mediated hydrolysis of GGpp significantly contributes to a feedback mechanism that maintains optimal intracellular levels of the nonsterol isoprenoid.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vesicular transport</kwd><kwd>cholesterol metabolism</kwd><kwd>isoprenoids</kwd><kwd>ER-associated degradation</kwd><kwd>prenylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL-20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBose-Boyd</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-144039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBose-Boyd</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Type 1 polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase (PDP1) contributes to interconversion of isoprenols and isoprenylpyrophosphates, balancing the sterol and nonsterol branches of the mevalonate pathway by regulating ERAD of HMG CoA reductase and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mevalonate is a crucial intermediate in a branched pathway that produces cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fpp), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp), ubiquinone-10, dolichol, heme, and the vitamin K<sub>2</sub> subtype menaquinone-4 (MK-4). These end products of mevalonate metabolism play essential roles in a variety of cellular processes ranging from the maintenance of membrane structure (cholesterol), protein prenylation (Fpp and GGpp) and asparagine-linked glycosylation (dolichol) to electron transport (ubiquinone-10 and heme) and γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues in specific proteins (MK-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Casey, 2016</xref>). Dysregulation of mevalonate metabolism has been implicated in numerous diseases including certain types of cancers, Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fusaro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mullen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of mevalonate synthesis appears to elicit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory responses that influence infectious diseases caused by various pathogens (viruses, protozoa, fungi, and bacteria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parihar et al., 2019</xref>). Elucidation of mechanisms governing regulation of mevalonate metabolism is imperative for the understanding of disease pathology and development of attenuating therapies.</p><p>Synthesis of mevalonate is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, which is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through an N-terminal membrane domain that precedes a cytosolic catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liscum et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roitelman et al., 1992</xref>). The reductase is targeted by a unique feedback regulatory system that operates through multiple mechanisms to ensure cells constantly produce nonsterol isoprenoids, but avoid overaccumulation of cholesterol and/or its sterol precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown and Goldstein, 1980</xref>). One of these mechanisms involves accelerated ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of reductase from membranes. Accumulation of certain sterols within membranes of the ER initiates ERAD of reductase by causing it to bind ER membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sever et al., 2003b</xref>). Subsequent ubiquitination of reductase by Insig-associated ubiquitin ligases triggers its extraction across the ER membrane, followed by dislocation into the cytosol for degradation by 26 S proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elsabrouty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song et al., 2005</xref>). The physiological significance of sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase is highlighted by the finding that knock-in mice expressing endogenous reductase resistant to sterol-induced ubiquitination accumulate the protein in multiple tissues, despite reduced levels of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Nonsterol, mevalonate-derived products augment the ERAD of reductase, but only in the presence of sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Correll and Edwards, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakanishi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roitelman and Simoni, 1992</xref>). The addition to cells of geranylgeraniol (GGOH), but not farnesol (FOH), reproduces the augmentation of sterol-accelerated reductase ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>). FOH and GGOH are alcohol derivatives of Fpp and GGpp, respectively. Subsequent studies revealed that GGOH synergizes with sterols to accelerate ERAD of reductase by enhancing extraction of the ubiquitinated enzyme across ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). Important insight into GGOH-enhanced ERAD of reductase has been provided by the emergence of a new player in the pathway. This new player, UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1 (UBIAD1), produces MK-4 by using GGpp to prenylate the naphthoquinone menadione (vitamin K<sub>3</sub>) that is derived from dietary phylloquinone (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakagawa et al., 2010</xref>). Current evidence indicates that sterols also stimulate binding of UBIAD1 to a subset of reductase molecules, inhibiting a post-ubiquitination step in their ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibition of reductase ERAD permits continuous synthesis of mevalonate for incorporation into GGpp and other nonsterol isoprenoids, even when sterols are abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>). The addition to cells of GGOH causes release of UBIAD1 from reductase; this release relieves inhibition of ERAD and triggers translocation of UBIAD1 from the ER to Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>). Missense mutations in the <italic>UBIAD1</italic> gene cause Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD), an autosomal dominant eye disease in humans characterized by the corneal accumulation of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Orr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiss et al., 2007</xref>). SCD-associated UBIAD1 resists GGOH-induced release from HMGCR and is sequestered in membranes of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>). ERAD of reductase becomes inhibited by the ER sequestered, SCD-associated UBIAD1, which leads to enhanced synthesis and intracellular accumulation of cholesterol in both cultured cells and tissues of knock-in mice that express SCD-associated UBIAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Metabolic labeling studies revealed that FOH and GGOH can become converted to their phosphorylated derivatives (Fpp and GGpp) and utilized for the synthesis of sterols and protein prenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crick et al., 1997</xref>). Kinases that phosphorylate these isoprenols have been reported in plants and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohnuma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thai et al., 1999</xref>); however, mammalian counterparts of these enzyme remain to be identified and characterized. In contrast, activities that dephosphorylate isoprenyl pyrophosphates in mammalian cells have been identified. Type 1 polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase (PDP1) is an integral ER membrane protein with a cytosolic active site that preferentially hydrolyzes isoprenyl pyrophosphates such as Fpp and GGpp to generate FOH and GGOH, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukunaga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miriyala et al., 2010</xref>). Overexpression of PDP1 reduces intracellular levels of isoprenyl pyrophosphates and inhibits protein prenylation. In the current study, we explore a role for PDP1 in the geranylgeranyl-regulated ERAD of reductase and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. The results of these studies indicate that PDP1 contributes to a pathway for interconversion of isoprenols and their phosphorylated derivatives that helps to balance sterol and nonsterol branches of the mevalonate pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDP1 overexpression modulates ERAD of HMG CoA reductase and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1</title><p>We began the exploration into a role for PDP1 in sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase by generating a line of cells designated SV-589/PDP1-Myc-FLAG that stably express tetracycline-inducible PDP1 tagged at the C-terminus with Myc and FLAG epitopes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, SV-589/PDP1-Myc-FLAG cells were metabolically labeled with azido-GGOH, which is converted into a pyrophosphate derivative that can be utilized for protein geranylgeranylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palsuledesai et al., 2016</xref>). The cells were then harvested, lysed, and precipitated, after which azido-geranylgeranylated proteins were labeled with biotin-alkyne through a click reaction. Analysis of samples through streptavidin-HRP blotting revealed the presence of azido-geranygeranylated proteins in the 20–25 kDa range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes b and c). Protein azido-geranylgeranylation was abolished by tetracycline-mediated induction of PDP1-Myc-FLAG (lanes e and f), suggesting the modification was inhibited by PDP1-catalyzed hydrolysis of azido-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miriyala et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of PDP1 inhibits protein geranylgeranylation and GGOH-enhanced ERAD of HMG CoA reductase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SV-589/PDP1-Myc-FLAG cells were set up on day 0 at 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per 60 mm dish in medium A supplemented with 5 % FCS.

Some of the cells were also treated with tetracycline to induce expression of PDP1-Myc-FLAG. After 16 hr, cells were treated with various concentrations of GGOH and subsequently harvested for subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis. The results show that GGOH enhanced ERAD of reductase, which was indicated by its disappearance from membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lane a with lanes b-e). This GGOH-enhanced ERAD of reductase was blunted when overexpression of PDP1-Myc-FLAG was induced by tetracycline (compare lane f with lanes g-j). Serine-212 of PDP1 lies within the phosphatase catalytic motif; its mutation to threonine (S212T) abolishes enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miriyala et al., 2010</xref>). In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, SV-589/TR cells that stably express the tetracycline repressor (TR) were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the membrane domain of reductase, which is both necessary and sufficient for ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sever et al., 2003b</xref>), and cultured in FCS. Following transfection, cells were treated with tetracycline in the absence or presence of GGOH. As expected, GGOH enhanced the ERAD of the membrane domain of reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, lanes 1 and 2); this ERAD was enhanced upon co-expression of catalytically inactive PDP1 (S212T)-FLAG (lanes 3 and 4). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows results of an experiment in which SV-589/PDP1-Myc-FLAG cells were first depleted of both sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids through incubation in medium containing lipoprotein deficient serum (LPDS) and compactin. Subsequent treatment of the cells with the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) stimulated reductase ERAD as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes a and b). The oxysterol also blocked proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory binding-protein-2 (SREBP-2), which was indicated by the disappearance of proteolytically released fragments of SREBP-2 from nuclei and concurrent accumulation of its membrane-bound precursor (compare lanes a and b). Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>), GGOH enhanced ERAD of reductase that was stimulated by 25-HC (lanes d and e). The oxysterol continued to accelerate reductase ERAD upon inducible overexpression of PDP1-Myc-FLAG; however, the effect of GGOH on this ERAD was diminished (compare lanes b-e with g-j).</p><p>We next used immunofluorescence microscopy to assess the subcellular localization of endogenous UBIAD1 in SV-589/PDP1-Myc-FLAG cells. As we previously established in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>), UBIAD1 exhibited a reticular localization indicative of the ER when cells were depleted of nonsterol isoprenoids through incubation in compactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panel 1). The addition to the cells of GGOH triggered the translocation of UBIAD1 from the ER to the Golgi as expected (panels 2–4). GGOH-induced translocation of UBIAD1 from ER to Golgi was impeded by tetracycline (compare panels 1–4 with 5–8), which induced overexpression of PDP1-Myc-FLAG (compare panels 9–12 with 13–16). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows an experiment in which SV-589/TR cells were transfected with UBIAD1-Myc in the absence or presence of PDP1 (S212T)-FLAG and cultured in FCS-containing medium supplemented with tetracycline.

The results of these studies reveal that indeed, overexpression of PDP1 abrogated both the ERAD of reductase and translocation of UBIAD1 from the ER to Golgi that was stimulated by the addition to cells of GGOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). Overexpression of catalytically inactive PDP1 (S212T) accelerated ERAD of reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and prevented the statin-induced translocation of UBIAD1 from the Golgi to ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that PDP1 (S212T) blocks the activity of endogenous PDP1 in a dominant-negative fashion, causing GGpp to accumulate. These findings infer that overexpressed PDP1 hydrolyzes pools of GGpp required for protein geranylgeranylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and membrane-embedded pools of the isoprenyl pyrophosphate that promote ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1 and stimulate the ERAD of reductase. This notion is further supported by results showing that SCD-associated UBIAD1 resisted to GGpp-induced incorporation into ER-derived transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Notably, the structural analysis of archaeal UbiA prenyltransferases indicate that SCD-associated mutations in UBIAD1 (such as N102S) surround the enzyme’s membrane-encased active site and some directly interact with the pyrophosphate group of GGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheng and Li, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it would be expected that many SCD-associated mutations disrupt binding of UBIAD1 to GGpp, explaining ER sequestration and reduced MK-4 synthetic activity of SCD-associated variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jun et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We found previously that treatment of isoprenoid-replete cells with compactin for as little as 1 hr caused UBIAD1 to redistribute from the Golgi to ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating pools of GGpp that are embedded within membranes of the ER turnover rapidly. The first line of evidence that PDP1 mediates this rapid turnover is provided by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, which shows that the RNAi-mediated knockdown of PDP1 augmented ERAD of reductase in cells replete with sterols. PDP1 knockdown also enhanced GGOH-induced ERAD of reductase in sterol-replete cells treated with compactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> provides additional evidence for a prominent role of PDP1 in governing levels of ER membrane-embedded GGpp. These studies not only confirmed that compactin caused the redistribution of UBIAD1 from the Golgi to the ER, but they also revealed that this redistribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) as well as the compactin-induced stabilization of reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) were abolished by knockdown of PDP1. Together, these results indicate that levels of GGpp embedded within ER membranes are maintained by the combined actions of ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1, ERAD of reductase, and PDP1-mediated hydrolysis.</p><p>Our studies also provide evidence that PDP1 not only hydrolyzes regulatory pools of GGpp within ER membranes, but it also modulates total pools of the isoprenyl pyrophosphate. Some geranylgeranylated small GTPases such as RhoA and Cdc42 become stabilized in the presence of compactin, owing to depletion of GGpp and reduced geranylgeranylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This statin-induced stabilization was blunted in PDP1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating the phosphatase mediates turnover of pools of GGpp that are required for protein geranylgeranylation. This conclusion is further supported by studies that employed azido-GGOH labeling, which shows the total level of protein geranylgeranylation was enhanced in PDP1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Although not examined in this study, PDP1 likely plays a key role in the interconversion of other isoprenols and isoprenyl pyrophosphates such as FOH and Fpp. A final piece of evidence that PDP1 modulates interconversion of total pools of GGOH and GGpp is provided by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, which shows that PDP1 knockdown enhanced the UBIAD1-mediated, GGpp-dependent synthesis of MK-4.</p><p>Results of the current study considered together with those previously obtained in cultured cells and genetically-manipulated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jo et al., 2020</xref>), designate the reductase ERAD pathway as a focal point in feedback control of intracellular levels of GGpp and other nonsterol isoprenoids. Sequestration of UBIAD1 in the ER of GGpp-deprived cells leads to the inhibition of reductase ERAD, which causes the protein to accumulate (indicated by green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The accumulation of reductase enhances synthesis of mevalonate for replenishment of GGpp and other nonsterol isoprenoids. The restoration of GGpp to optimal levels within ER membranes triggers release of UBIAD1 from reductase; GGpp-induced release inhibits reductase (indicated by red bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) by accelerating its ERAD and stimulates translocation of UBIAD1 to the Golgi. This novel feedback regulatory system helps to ensure the constant production GGpp and other essential nonsterol isoprenoids, while avoiding their overaccumulation. GGpp and Fpp are utilized in the prenylation of RhoA and other small GTPases, which target the enzymes to intracellular membranes. The membrane association of small GTPases is essential for modulation of downstream effectors that control cellular growth and proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, energy metabolism, and vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Casey, 2016</xref>). Thus, dysregulation of isoprenyl pyrophosphate metabolism may be detrimental to cells as indicated by our failure to generate PDP1-deficient cells using CRISPR/Cas9 methods, which should overaccumulate these molecules and accelerate reductase ERAD. The rapid, PDP1-mediated turnover of GGpp (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and other isoprenyl pyrophosphates represents an additional protective mechanism that guards against overaccumulation of mevalonate-derived end-products. It will be important in future studies to identify the kinase(s) that phosphorylate isoprenols to isoprenyl pyrophosphates and determine their role in regulation of UBIAD1 and reductase.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Contribution of PDP1 and UBIAD1 to the feedback regulatory system that targets HMG CoA reductase ERAD to control synthesis of GGpp.</title><p>The synthesis and hydrolysis of GGpp are key focal points in the feedback regulation of the nonsterol branch of the mevalonate pathway (see text for details).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64688-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Statin-mediated inhibition of reductase is a routinely prescribed approach to lower circulating levels of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldstein and Brown, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stossel, 2008</xref>). However, statins block production of mevalonate-derived products that mediate feedback regulation of reductase, causing its marked accumulation that limits the efficacy of the drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engelking et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schonewille et al., 2016</xref>). We showed previously that accumulation of reductase in livers of statin-treated mice corresponded with sequestration of UBIAD1 in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jo et al., 2019</xref>), indicating the response results from depletion of GGpp from ER membranes. This implies that drugs mimicking GGpp in stimulating ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1 would relieve inhibition of ERAD and avoid the overaccumulation of reductase that limits statin therapy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that knockdown of PDP1 prevents both the statin-induced redistribution of UBIAD1 from the Golgi to ER and accumulation of reductase. These results denote PDP1-mediated hydrolysis of GGpp as a target for strategies that improve the effectiveness of statins in lowering cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Proteins in the remaining material were precipitated with methanol/chloroform/water; an appropriate amount of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 was used to solubilize precipitated material to achieve a final protein concentration of no more than 4 µg/ml. No more than 200 µg of solubilized protein in a total volume of 50 µl was labeled with biotin alkyne as described in the protocol for the Click-iT Protein Reaction Buffer Kit. Labeled samples were precipitated with methanol/chloroform/water, resolubilized in SDS-lysis buffer, and a small aliquot was removed for determination of protein concentration. The remaining sample was mixed with 5 X SDS loading buffer to achieve a final concentration of 1 X and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond C-Extra nitrocellulose filters (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Filters were blocked with PBS-Tween containing 1 % BSA, after which they were incubated with horseradish-conjugated streptavidin. Bound streptavidin was visualized using the SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Filters were exposed to film at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>in vitro vesicle-formation assay</title><p>SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells were set up for experiments as described in the figure legends. Transient transfection of the cells with expression plasmids encoding Myc-tagged wild type and SCD-associated variants of UBIAD1 was carried out using FuGENE6 transfection reagent as described above. Following incubations described in figure legends, the cells were harvested, pooled, and subjected to subcellular fractionation; the in vitro vesicle-formation assay was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2016</xref>). In a volume of 100 µl, each reaction contained 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 250 mM sorbitol, 70 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM potassium EGTA, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate, 1.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM GTP, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 4 units/ml creatine kinase, protease inhibitors, 80–100 µg protein of microsomes obtained from transfected SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells, and 10 µg cytosol obtained from isoprenoid-depleted, reductase-deficient UT-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mosley et al., 1983</xref>). Reactions were carried out in siliconized 1.5 ml microfuge tubes for 20 min at 37 °C, after which they were terminated and subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 g for 3 min at 4 °C to obtain P16 pellet and S16 supernatant fractions. The S16 fraction was next subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 g; the pellet of this spin was designated P100. The P16 and P100 fractions were resuspended in SDS-lysis buffer, mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of P16 and P100 fractions, referred to membrane and vesicles, respectively, were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon filters, and analyzed by immunoblot using IgG-9E10 against Myc to detect transfected UBIAD1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Synthesis of [<sup>3</sup>H]menaquinone-4 (MK4) in control and PDP1 knockdown cells</title><p>In studies measuring incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]menadione into MK-4, cells were set up on day 0 and transfected with siRNA duplexes against GFP and PDP1 as described in figure legends. Following siRNA transfection, cells were refed medium A containing 5 % FCS and 2.5 μCi/ml [<sup>3</sup>H]menadione (cold menadione was added to achieve a final concentration of 50 nM). After 16 hr at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS + 2 % BSA, followed by an additional wash with PBS. The cells were then lysed with 0.1 N NaOH; the resulting lysates were mixed with recovery solution containing 16 μg/ml MK-4, 0.025 μCi/ml [<sup>14</sup>C]cholesterol, and 16 μg/ml unlabeled cholesterol and extracted with dicholoromethane:methanol (2:1). The lipids were dried down, resuspended in dicholoromethane, and spotted on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates that were developed in chloroform. The lipids were visualized by staining in iodine vapor and incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]menadione into MK-4 was determined by scintillation counting. The values were corrected for recovery as judged by the percent of [<sup>14</sup>C]cholesterol recovered in each sample. An aliquot of each sample was taken for protein determination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Reproducibility of data</title><p>All results were confirmed in at least two independent experiments conducted on different days using different batches of cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64688-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64688-supp1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

In the revised manuscript we provide two experiments. Figure 1 shows that overexpression of PDP1 blocked GGOH-induced ERAD of HMGCR, indicating the phosphatase hydrolyzes pools of GGOH-derived GGpp that control HMGCR ERAD. We now show in Figure Supplement-1 that overexpression of catalytically inactive PDP1 (S212T) enhanced ERAD of the membrane domain of HMGCR, which is necessary and sufficient for the reaction. Figure 2 shows that overexpression of PDP1 prevents the GGOH-induced translocation of UBIAD1 from the ER to the Golgi, suggesting that the phosphatase hydrolyzes pools of GGOH-derived GGpp that modulate ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. We now show in Figure 2—figure supplement-1 that UBIAD1-Myc localizes to the Golgi of isoprenoid replete cells. The HMGCR inhibitor compactin, which depletes cells of nonsterol isoprenoids, triggers the relocation of UBIAD1 from the Golgi to ER as we previously reported. UBIAD1-Myc continued to localize to the Golgi of isoprenoid-replete cells upon overexpression of catalytically inactive PDP1 (S212T); however, the protein remains in the Golgi when cells are subjected to compactin treatment. Together, these findings rule out an enzymatic-independent function of PDP1 in modulation of UBIAD1 transport and HMGCR ERAD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The results are similar to those observed in Figure 3B; knockdown of PDP1 enhanced GGOH-induced ERAD of HMGCR. We also provide another experiment in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B that shows GGOH-induced ERAD of HMGCR is blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Considering results from Figure 3A, which shows the disappearance of HMGCR upon PDP1 knockdown, Figure 4C, 4E, and 6A showing that PDP1 knockdown blunts compactin-induced stabilization of HMGCR, we feel confident in our conclusion that PDP1 governs pools of GGpp that augment the ERAD of HMGCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by the DeBose-Boyd group investigates the regulation of the mevalonate pathway by geranylgeraniol (GGOH), which is generated by the phosphatase PDP1.</p><p>In a series of elegant and convincing experiments, the authors show that modulating the expression levels of PDP1 alters ERAD of HMGCoA reductase though UBAID1, and controls localization of UBIAD.
