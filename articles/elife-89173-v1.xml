For example, high levels of cysteine activate cysteine dioxygenase, a key enzyme in cysteine catabolism in most animal and many fungal species. The mechanism by which cysteine dioxygenase is regulated is largely unknown. In an unbiased genetic screen for mutations that activate cysteine dioxygenase (<italic>cdo-1</italic>) in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> we isolated loss-of-function mutations in <italic>rhy-1</italic> and <italic>egl-9,</italic> which encode proteins that negatively regulate the stability or activity of the oxygen-sensing hypoxia inducible transcription factor (<italic>hif-1</italic>). EGL-9 and HIF-1 are core members of the conserved eukaryotic hypoxia response. However, we demonstrate that the mechanism of HIF-1-mediated induction of <italic>cdo-1</italic> is largely independent of EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase activity and the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase, the classical hypoxia signaling pathway components. We demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans cdo-1</italic> is transcriptionally activated by high levels of cysteine and <italic>hif-1. hif-1-</italic>dependent activation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> occurs downstream of an H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway that includes <italic>rhy-1, cysl-1,</italic> and <italic>egl-9. cdo-1</italic> transcription is primarily activated in the hypodermis where it is also sufficient to drive sulfur amino acid metabolism. Thus, the regulation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> by <italic>hif-1</italic> reveals a negative feedback loop that maintains cysteine homeostasis. High levels of cysteine stimulate the production of an H<sub>2</sub>S signal. H<sub>2</sub>S then acts through the <italic>rhy-1/cysl-1/egl-9</italic> signaling pathway to increase HIF-1-mediated transcription of <italic>cdo-1,</italic> promoting degradation of cysteine via CDO-1.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are large molecules in our cells that perform various roles, from acting as channels through which nutrients can enter the cell, to forming structural assemblies that help the cell keep its shape. Proteins are formed of chains of building blocks called amino acids. There are 20 common amino acids, each with a different ‘side chain’ that confers it with specific features.</p><p>Cysteine is one of these 20 amino acids. Its side chain has a ‘thiol’ group, made up of a sulfur atom and a hydrogen atom. This thiol group is very reactive, and it is an essential building block of enzymes (proteins that speed up chemical reactions within the cell), structural proteins and signaling molecules. While cysteine is an essential amino acid for the cell to function, excess cysteine can be toxic. The concentration of cysteine in animal cells is tightly regulated by an enzyme called cysteine dioxygenase.</p><p>This enzyme is implicated in two rare conditions that affect metabolism, where the product of cysteine dioxygenase is a key driver of disease severity. Additionally, cysteine dioxygenase acts as a tumor suppressor gene, and its activity becomes blocked in diverse cancers. Understanding how cysteine dioxygenase is regulated may be important for research into these conditions.</p><p>While it has been shown that excess cysteine drives the production and activity of cysteine dioxygenase, how the cell detects high levels of cysteine remained unknown. Warnhoff et al. sought to resolve this question using the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. First, the scientists demonstrated that, like in mammals, high levels of cysteine drive the production of cysteine dioxygenase in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Next, the researchers used an approach called an unbiased genetic screening to find genes that induce cysteine dioxygenase production when they are mutated. These experiments revealed that the protein HIF-1 can drive the production of cysteine dioxygenase when it is activated by a pathway that senses hydrogen sulfide gas.</p><p>Based on these results, Warnhoff et al. propose that high levels of cysteine lead to the production of hydrogen sulfide gas that in turn drives the production of cysteine dioxygenase via HIF-1 activation of gene expression.</p><p>The results reported by Warnhoff et al. suggest that modulating HIF-1 signaling could control the activity of cysteine dioxygenase. This information could be used in the future to develop therapies for molybdenum cofactor deficiency, isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency and several types of cancer. However, first it will be necessary to demonstrate that the same signaling pathway is active in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cysteine</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM146871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warnhoff</surname><given-names>Kurt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM044619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruvkun</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cysteine dioxygenase, a conserved and critical enzyme in sulfur amino acid metabolism, is activated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that mediates many oxidation/reduction reactions of proteins, is the redox center of the abundant antioxidant tripeptide glutathione which also serves as a major cysteine reserve, and is essential for iron-sulfur cluster assembly in the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 1993</xref>).

Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is an essential 520 Dalton prosthetic group synthesized from GTP by a conserved multistep biosynthetic pathway that is present in about 2/3 of bacterial genomes and nearly all eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schwarz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang and Gladyshev, 2008</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> can either retrieve Moco synthesized by the bacteria it consumes or can synthesize Moco de novo using its own Moco biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warnhoff and Ruvkun, 2019</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains carrying mutations in genes encoding Moco biosynthetic enzymes (<italic>moc</italic>) and feeding on wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> develop normally.

The toxic sulfites produced downstream of CDO-1 are normally oxidized to more benign sulfate by Moco-requiring sulfite oxidase (SUOX-1 in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> SUOX in mammals) an essential enzyme in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mudd et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warnhoff and Ruvkun, 2019</xref>).

Thus, understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern the levels and activity of CDO-1 is critical to generating new therapeutic hypotheses to treat these diseases.</p><p>To define genes that regulate <italic>cdo-1</italic> levels and activity, we performed an unbiased genetic screen in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> to identify mutations that increase the expression or abundance of a <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> reporter transgene. We identified multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in two genes, <italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>rhy-1</italic>, that dramatically increase expression of this P<italic>cdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> transgene.

The potential physiological relevance of the connection between HIF-1 signaling and cysteine metabolism is discussed below.</p><p>It was initially surprising that the canonical hypoxia-sensing transcription factor, that is activated by relatively low O<sub>2</sub> tensions, induces transcription of <italic>cdo-1,</italic> which encodes an oxidase that requires dissolved O<sub>2</sub> to oxidize cysteine. Both EGL-9 and CDO-1 are dioxygenases, requiring O<sub>2</sub> as a substrate to catalyze their chemical reactions. EGL-9 functions as an O<sub>2</sub> sensor, using its O<sub>2</sub> substrate to hydroxylate HIF-1 at relatively high O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures, targeting it for degradation. EGL-9 is uniquely poised to sense deviations from the normally high physiological O<sub>2</sub> concentrations given its high K<sub>m</sub> for O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirsilä et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ehrismann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Losman et al., 2020</xref>). While it is not known if mammalian CDO1 or <italic>C. elegans</italic> CDO-1 dioxygenases are active at lower O<sub>2</sub> tensions than EGL-9, it is possible, even probable, that the set point for activation of HIF-1 by the failure of EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylation, is at a higher O<sub>2</sub> tension than the K<sub>m</sub> of CDO-1 for oxidation of cysteine. In this way, CDO-1 could still coordinate cysteine catabolism while the cell is experiencing hypoxia and EGL-9 is unable to hydroxylate HIF-1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evidence for distinct pathways of HIF-1 activation by hypoxia and cysteine/H<sub>2</sub>S</title><p>The hypoxia-signaling pathway is defined by EGL-9-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1.

However, multiple lines of evidence, reinforced by our work, demonstrate VHL-1- and prolyl hydroxylase-independent activity of EGL-9. <italic>egl-9(-</italic>) null mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> accumulate HIF-1 protein and display increased transcription of many genes, including <italic>nhr-57,</italic> an established target of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2006</xref>).

However, rescue experiments with a prolyl hydroxylase domain-inactive <italic>egl-9(H487A</italic>) transgene do not correct the accumulation of HIF-1 protein and only partially reduce the HIF-1 transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shao et al., 2009</xref>). Through our studies of <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, we demonstrate that an <italic>egl-9(H487A</italic>) mutant incompletely activates HIF-1 transcription when compared to an <italic>egl-9(-</italic>) null mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Taken together, we conclude EGL-9 has activity independent of its prolyl hydroxylase domain, mirroring and supporting previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shao et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In studies of the HIF-1-dependent P<italic>nhr-57::GFP</italic> transcriptional reporter, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2006</xref>) observed that <italic>egl-9(-</italic>) null mutants promote HIF-1 transcription more than a <italic>vhl-1(-</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2006</xref>).

This observation suggests that EGL-9 represses both HIF-1 levels and activity. This study also notes that <italic>vhl-1</italic> represses HIF-1 transcription in the intestine while <italic>egl-9</italic> acts in a wider array of tissues including the intestine and the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budde and Roth, 2010</xref> also demonstrate that loss of <italic>vhl-1</italic> promotes HIF-1 transcription in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine while total loss of <italic>egl-9</italic> promotes HIF-1 transcription in multiple tissues including the intestine and the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budde and Roth, 2010</xref>). Our data expand upon these observations by demonstrating that loss of the EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase domain promotes <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription in the intestine alone, mirroring the loss of <italic>vhl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budde and Roth, 2010</xref> additionally demonstrate that physiologically relevant stimuli also elicit a tissue-specific transcriptional response: hypoxia promotes HIF-1 transcription in the intestine while H<sub>2</sub>S promotes HIF-1 transcription in the hypodermis.

We demonstrate that high levels of cysteine promote <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription in the hypodermis. Taken together with our data, these studies suggest two distinct pathways for activating HIF-1 transcription: (i) a hypoxia-sensing pathway that is dependent upon <italic>vhl-1</italic> and the EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase domain and promotes HIF-1 activity in the intestine and (ii) an H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway that is independent of <italic>vhl-1</italic> and the EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase domain and promotes HIF-1 activity in the hypodermis.</p><p>The focus of CDO-1 expression and regulation of sulfite production in the hypoderm may be due to the demand in sulfur metabolism as well as oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of collagens during the <italic>C. elegans</italic> molting cycle. Many collagen genes are expressed before each larval molt and many collagen prolines are hydroxylated, like particular HIF-1 prolines, and their cysteines form disulfides during collagen assembly. The large demand for the amino acid cysteine in the many collagen genes expressed at high levels during a molt may challenge cysteine homeostasis in the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meeuse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The genetic details of the H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway were solidified through studies of <italic>rhy-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2012</xref> demonstrate that <italic>hif-1</italic> repression via <italic>rhy-1</italic> requires the activity of <italic>cysl-1,</italic> a gene encoding a cysteine synthase-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). They further demonstrate that high H<sub>2</sub>S promotes a physical interaction between CYSL-1 and EGL-9, resulting in the inactivation of EGL-9 and increased HIF-1 activity. Together, these studies suggest distinct genetic regulators of EGL-9/HIF-1 signaling: <italic>rhy-1</italic> and <italic>cysl-1</italic> govern the H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway while <italic>vhl-1</italic> mediates the hypoxia-sensing pathway. These pathways are distinct in their requirement for the EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A negative feedback loop senses high cysteine/H<sub>2</sub>S, promotes CDO-1 activity, and maintains cysteine homeostasis</title><p>Why would the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9/HIF-1 H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway control the levels and activity of cysteine dioxygenase? We speculate this intersection facilitates a homeostatic pathway allowing <italic>C. elegans</italic> to sense and respond to cysteine level. We propose that H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a gaseous signaling molecule to promote cysteine catabolism. H<sub>2</sub>S activates HIF-1 in the hypodermis by promoting the CYSL-1-mediated inactivation of EGL-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). We show that high levels of cysteine similarly induce <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription in the hypodermis. Our genetic data demonstrate that <italic>cdo-1</italic> is induced by the same genetic pathway that senses H<sub>2</sub>S in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and CDO-1 acts in the hypodermis, the major site of H<sub>2</sub>S-induced transcription. Furthermore, H<sub>2</sub>S induces endogenous <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription more than threefold while <italic>cdo-1</italic> mRNA levels do not change when <italic>C. elegans</italic> are exposed to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is likely that H<sub>2</sub>S promotes <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription through RHY-1, CYSL-1, EGL-9, and HIF-1. H<sub>2</sub>S is a reasonable small molecule signal to alert cells to high levels of cysteine. Excess cysteine results in the production of H<sub>2</sub>S mediated by multiple enzymes including cystathionase (CTH), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Singh and Banerjee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jurkowska et al., 2014</xref>). For example, CTH activity within the carotid body produces H<sub>2</sub>S that modifies the mammalian response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peng et al., 2010</xref>). We speculate that excess cysteine in <italic>C. elegans</italic> promotes the enzymatic production of H<sub>2</sub>S which activates HIF-1 via the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9 signaling pathway. In our homeostatic model, H<sub>2</sub>S-activated HIF-1 would then induce <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, promoting CDO-1 activity and the catabolism of the high-cysteine trigger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Supporting this model, <italic>cysl-1(-</italic>) and <italic>hif-1(-</italic>) mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot survive in a high cysteine environment, demonstrating their central role in promoting cysteine homeostasis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the regulation of cysteine metabolism by HIF-1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proposed genetic pathway for the regulation of <italic>cdo-1. rhy-1, cysl-1,</italic> and <italic>egl-9</italic> act in a negative-regulatory cascade to control activity of the HIF-1 transcription factor, which activates transcription of <italic>cdo-1</italic>.

High CDO-1 levels promote the catabolism of cysteine leading to production of sulfites (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) that are toxic during Moco or SUOX-1 deficiency.

This study determined that HIF1α accumulates in TNBC cells even during normoxia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggs et al., 2016</xref> demonstrate that L-glutamate secretion via TNBC cells suppresses HIF1α prolyl hydroxylation, stabilizing HIF1α. L-glutamate secretion is mediated via the glutamate/cystine antiporter, xCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannai and Kitamura, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sato et al., 1999</xref>). L-glutamate secretion inhibits xCT and a concomitant decrease in intracellular cystine/cysteine was observed. The authors propose that low intracellular cystine/cysteine produces oxidizing conditions that oxidize specific EglN1 cysteine residues, inhibiting the activity of EglN1. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggs et al., 2016</xref> propose EglN1 as a cysteine sensor whose activity is promoted by cysteine.</p><p>Our work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also strongly suggests a role for EGL-9 in sensing and responding to cysteine.

Therefore, we propose that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> high levels of cysteine inhibit the activity of EGL-9, the opposite effect observed in TNBC cells.

Levels of free cysteine may fall during the massive inductions of cysteine-rich secreted proteins in development or immune defense, as well as during the synthesis of collagens in the periodic molting cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meeuse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mizuki and Kasahara, 1992</xref>). The oxidation of so many cysteines to disulfides in the endoplasmic reticulum might locally lower O<sub>2</sub> levels preventing EGL-9 hydroxylation of HIF-1.

All images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). All imaging was performed on live animals paralyzed using 20 mM sodium azide. For all fluorescence images shown within the same figure panel, images were collected using the same exposure time and processed identically. To quantify GFP expression, the average pixel intensity was determined within a set transverse section immediately anterior to the developing vulva.

Here, the authors use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to explore the relationship between sulfur metabolism and hypoxia, examining the regulation of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1 in humans, CDO-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>), which is critical to cysteine catabolism, by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1 alpha in humans, HIF-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>), which is the key terminal effector of the hypoxia response pathway that maintains oxygen homeostasis. The authors are trying to demonstrate that (1) the hypoxia response pathway is a key regulator of cysteine homeostasis, specifically through the regulation of cysteine dioxygenase, and (2) that the pathway responds to changes in cysteine homeostasis in a mechanistically distinct way from how it responds to hypoxic stress.</p><p>Briefly summarized here, the authors initiated this study by generating transgenic animals expressing a CDO-1::GFP protein chimera from the cdo-1 promoter so that they could identify regulators of CDO-1 expression through a forward genetic screen. This screen identified mutants with elevated CDO-1::GFP expression in two genes, egl-9 and rhy-1, whose wild-type products are negative regulators of HIF-1, raising the possibility that cdo-1 is a HIF-1 transcriptional target. Indeed, the authors provide data showing that cdo-1 regulation by EGL-9 and RHY-1 is dependent on HIF-1 and that regulation by RHY-1 is dependent on CYSL-1, as expected from other published findings of this pathway. The authors show that exogenous cysteine activates cdo-1 expression, reflective of what is known to occur in other systems. Moreover, they find that exogenous cysteine is toxic to worms lacking CYSL-1 or HIF-1 activity, but not CDO-1 activity, suggesting that HIF-1 mediates a survival response to toxic levels of cysteine and that this response requires more than just the regulation of CDO-1. The authors validate their expression studies using a GFP knockin at the cdo-1 locus, and they demonstrate that a key site of action for CDO-1 is the hypodermis. They present genetic epistasis analysis supporting a role for RHY-1, both as a regulator of HIF-1 and as a transcriptional target of HIF-1, in offsetting toxicity from aberrant sulfur metabolism. The authors use CRISPR/Cas9 editing to mutate a key amino acid in the prolyl hydroxylase domain of EGL-9, arguing that EGL-9 inhibits CDO-1 expression through a mechanism that is largely independent of the prolyl hydroxylase activity.</p><p>Overall, the data seem rigorous, and the conclusions drawn from the data seem appropriate. The experiments test the hypothesis using logical and clever molecular genetic tools and design. The sample size is a bit lower than is typical for <italic>C. elegans</italic> papers; however, the experiments are clearly not underpowered, so this is not an issue. The paper is likely to drive many in the field (including the authors themselves) into deeper experiments on (1) how the pathway senses hypoxia and sulfur/cysteine/H2S using these distinct mechanisms/modalities, (2) how oxygen and sulfur/cysteine/H2S homeostasis influence one another, and (3) how this single pathway evolved to sense and respond to both of these stress modalities.</p><p>My previous concerns have been addressed. The authors are commended on an excellent body of research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89173.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #4 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a revised manuscript that describes a role for cdo-1 in regulating cellular cysteine levels. The authors show that expression of cdo-1, predicted to encode a cysteine dioxygenase, is regulated by HIF-1, the conserved hypoxia-induced transcription factor. The expression of cdo-1 is controlled by the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9/HIF-1 pathway that has been demonstrated to be involved in the response to H2S.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The new finding of this study is that cdo-1, predicted to encode a cysteine dioxygenase, is expressed in the hypodermis and that hypodermal expression rescues at least one phenotype of the cdo-1(mg622) mutant (ability to survive toxic sulfite accumulation in Moco-deficient conditions). Using sulfite toxicity is an interesting reporter for cellular cysteine abundance.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors claim more than once that the H2S/Cys responsive pathway is RHY-1 - CYSL-1 - EGL-9 - HIF-1. Their data don't seem to support this claim, as they show that Pcdo-1::GFP is induced in rhy-1 mutants incubated with cysteine. It is therefore not appropriate to claim that &quot;HIF-1-induced cysteine catabolism requires the activity of rhy-1&quot; that they include in the description of the model in Fig 6. There is simply no evidence at all that RHY-1 has any role in modulating the activity of CDO-1 other than through transcriptional activation via HIF-1.</p><p>I don't find the arguments that this pathway is required for cysteine homeostasis per se (as claimed in the last sentence of the introduction). The authors expose worms to excess cysteine for 48 hours in liquid culture with bacteria. It is well known in these conditions that the bacteria will produce H2S from the cysteine in the culture. All of the cysteine exposure data shown can be explained by the effect of H2S exposure. This would explain why hif-1 and cysl-1 mutants die but cdo-1 mutants do not, for example. The authors don't provide any data to rule out the possibility that bacterial H2S production underlies these results. This explains why the pathway described in this work is the same as has been previously described. Similarly, there is no evidence at all to support their assertion that there are &quot;other pathways&quot; induced by HIF-1 to deal with sulfite produced by cysteine catabolism. However, if the main problem is H2S production (perhaps by bacteria) then cdo-1 would not be relevant and the mutants would be viable as observed.</p><p>In a couple of places, the authors seem to argue that H2S-induced expression is limited to the hypodermis and hypoxia-induced gene expression is mostly in the intestine. This is consistent with the expression of cdo-1 (this work) and nhr-57 (Budde and Roth) but it is not appropriate to generalize this. Previous work from the Ruvkun lab (Ma et al) show that the CYSL-1 regulates expression of HIF-1 targets in neurons. Moreover, HIF-1 protein accumulates in the nucleus of nearly all cells, and there is no reason to believe that there are changes in the expression of other genes in different tissues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89173.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Warnhoff</surname><given-names>Kurt</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sanford Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sioux Falls</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bhattacharya</surname><given-names>Sushila</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sanford Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sioux Falls</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Snoozy</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sanford Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Sioux Falls</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Breen</surname><given-names>Peter C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ruvkun</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Issue 1: The relevance is somewhat unclear. High cysteine levels can be achieved in the laboratory, but, is this relevant in the life of <italic>C. elegans</italic>? Or is there physiological relevance in humans, e.g. a disease? The authors state &quot;cells and animals fed excess cysteine and methionine&quot;, but is this more than a laboratory excess condition? SUOX nonfunctional conditions in humans don't appear to tie into this, since, in that context, the goal is to inactivate CDO or CTH to prevent sulfite production. The authors also mention cancer, but the link to cysteine levels is unclear. In that sense, then, the conditions studied here may not carry much physiological relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1: We set out to answer a fundamental question: what pathways regulate the function of cysteine dioxygenase, a highly conserved enzyme in sulfur amino acid metabolism? In an unbiased genetic screen that sampled millions of EMS generated mutations across all ~20,000 <italic>C. elegan</italic>s genes, we discovered loss of function/null mutations in egl-9 and rhy-1, two negative regulators of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (hif-1). Genetic ablation of the egl-9 or rhy-1 loci are likely not relevant to the life of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> animal, i.e. this is not representative of a natural state. Yet, this extreme genetic intervention has taught us a new fundamental truth about the interaction between EGL-9/RHY-1, HIF-1, and the transcriptional activation of cdo1. Similarly, the high cysteine levels used in our assays may or may not be representative of a state in nature, we do not know (nor do we make any claims about the environmental relevance of our choice of cysteine concentrations). It seems very plausible that pathological states exist where cysteine concentrations may rise to comparable levels in our experimental system. More importantly, we have started with excess to physiology to elicit a clear response that we can study in the lab. Similar strategies established the cysteine-induction phenotype of CDO1 in mammalian systems. For instance, in Kwon and Stipanuk 2001, hepatocytes are cultured in media supplemented with 2mmol/L cysteine to promote a ~4-fold increase in CDO1 mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 2: The pathway is described as important for cysteine detoxification, which is described to act via H2S (Figure 6). Much of that pathway has already been previously established by the Roth, Miller, and Horvitz labs as critical for the H2S response. While the present manuscript adds some additional insight such as the additional role of RHY-1 downstream on HIF-1 in promoting toxicity, this study therefore mainly confirms the importance of a previously described signalling pathway, essentially adding a new downstream target rhy-1 -&gt; cysl-1 -&gt; egl-9 -&gt; hif-1 -&gt; sqrd-1/cdo-1. The impact of this finding is reduced by the fact that cdo-1 itself isn't actually required for survival in high cysteine, suggesting it is merely a maker of the activity of this previously described pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 2: We agree that the primary impact of our manuscript is the establishment of a novel intersection between the H2S-sensing pathway (largely worked out by Roth, Miller, and Horvitz) and our gene of interest, cysteine dioxygenase. We believe that the connection between these two pathways is exciting as it suggests a logical homeostatic circuit. High cysteine yields enzymatically produced H2S. This H2S may then act as a signal promoting HIF-1 activity (via RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9). High HIF-1 activity increases cdo-1 transcription and activity promoting the degradation of the high-cysteine trigger. As pointed out by the reviewer, cdo-1(-) loss of function alone does not cause cysteine sensitivity at the concentrations tested. Given that cysl-1(-) and hif-1(-) mutants are exquisitely sensitive to high levels of cysteine, we propose that HIF-1 activates the transcription of additional genes that are required for high cysteine tolerance. However, our genetic data show that cdo-1 is more than simply a marker of HIF-1 transcription. Our genetic data in Table 1 demonstrate that HIF-1 activation (caused by egl-9(-)) is sufficient to cause severe sickness in a suox-1 hypomorphic mutant which cannot detoxify sulfites, a critical product of cysteine catabolism. This severe sickness can be reversed by inactivating hif-1, cth-2, or cdo-1. These data demonstrate a functional intersection between the established H2S-sensing pathway and cysteine catabolism governed by cdo-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Issue 3: First, the authors show that the supplementation of exogenous cysteine activates cdo-1p::GFP. Rather than showing data for one dose, the author may consider presenting dose-dependency results and whether cysteine activation of cdo-1 also requires HIF-1 or CYSL-1, which would be important data given the focus and major novelty of the paper in cysteine homeostasis, not the cdo-1 regulatory gene pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3: We agree with the reviewer and have performed the suggested dose-response curve for expression of Pcdo-1::GFP in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We observe substantial activation of the Pcdo-1::GFP transcriptional reporter beginning at 100µM supplemental cysteine (Figure 3C). Higher doses of cysteine do not elicit a substantially stronger induction of the Pcdo-1::GFP reporter. Thus, we find that 100µM supplemental cysteine strikes the right balance between strongly inducing the Pcdo-1::GFP reporter while not inducing any toxicity or lethality in wild-type animals (Figure 3E).</p><p>We further agree that testing for induction of the Pcdo-1::GFP reporter in a hif-1(-) or cysl-1(-) mutant background is a critical experiment. However, we have not been able to identify a cysteine concentration that induces Pcdo-1::GFP and is not 100% lethal for hif-1(-) or cysl-1(-) mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The remarkable sensitivity of hif-1(-) or cysl-1(-) mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> to supplemental cysteine demonstrates the critical role of these genes in promoting cysteine homeostasis. But because of this lethality, we could not assay the Pcdo1::GFP reporter in the hif-1(-) or cysl-1(-) mutant animals. But the lethality to excess cysteine demonstrates that this cysteine response is salient. To get at how cysteine might be interacting with the HIF-1-signaling pathway, we performed new additivity experiments by supplementing 100µM cysteine to wild type, egl-9(-), and rhy-1(-) mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing the Pcdo-1::GFP reporter. Surprisingly, we found that cysteine had no significant impact on Pcdo-1::GFP expression in an egl-9(-) mutant background but significantly increased the Pcdo-1::GFP expression in a rhy-1(-) background (Figure 3A,B). These data suggest that cysteine acts in a pathway with egl-9 and in parallel to rhy-1. These data have been incorporated into Figure 3A,B and are included in the Results section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 4: While the genetic manipulation of cdo-1 regulators yields much more striking results, the effect size of exogenous cysteine is rather small. Does this reflect a lack of extensive condition optimization or robust buffering of exogenous/dietary cysteine? Would genetic manipulation to alter intracellular cysteine or its precursors yield similar or stronger effect sizes?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 4: We agree that the induction of the Pcdo-1::GFP reporter by supplemental cysteine is not as dramatic as the induction caused by the egl-9 or rhy-1 null alleles. We believe our Response 3 and new Figure 3C demonstrate that this phenomenon is not due to lack of condition optimization, but likely reflects some biology. As pointed out by the reviewer, <italic>C. elegans</italic> likely buffers exogenous cysteine and this (perhaps) prevents the impressive Pcdo-1::GFP induction observed in the egl-9(-) and rhy-1(-) mutant animals. We have now mentioned this possible interpretation in the Results section. Furthermore, we like the idea of using genetic tricks to promote cysteine accumulation within <italic>C. elegans</italic> cells and tissues and will consider these approaches in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 5: Second, there remain several major questions regarding the interpretation of the cysteine homeostasis pathway. How much specificity is involved for the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9/HIF-1 pathway to control cysteine homeostasis? Is the pathway able to sense cysteine directly or indirectly through its metabolites or redox status in general? Given the very low and high physiological concentrations of intracellular cysteine and glutathione (GSH, a major reserve for cysteine), respectively, there is a surprising lack of mention and testing of GSH metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 5: Future studies are required to determine the specificity of the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9/HIF-1 pathway for the control of cysteine homeostasis. Our proposed mechanism, that H2S activates the HIF-1 pathway is based largely on the work of the Horvitz lab (Ma et al. 2012). They demonstrate that H2S promotes a direct inhibitory interaction between CYSL-1 and EGL-9, leading to activation of HIF-1. These findings align nicely with our genetic and pharmacological data. However, our work does not provide direct evidence as to the cysteine-derived metabolite that activates HIF-1. We propose H2S as a likely candidate.</p><p>We have added a note to the introduction regarding the role of GSH as a reservoir of excess cysteine and agree that future studies might find interesting links between CDO-1, GSH metabolism, and HIF-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 6: In addition, what are the major similarities and differences of cysteine homeostasis pathways between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other systems (HIF dependency, transcription vs post-transcriptional control)?

Our demonstration that cdo-1 regulation operates largely independent of VHL-1 and EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylation is a mechanistic detail of this regulation and not the critical new finding. Although, we believe it does suggest where pathway analyses should be directed in the future. We also believe that our homeostatic feedback model for the regulation of HIF-1 (and cdo-1) by cysteine-derived H2S is new and exciting and provides insight into the logic of why HIF-1 might respond to H2S and promote the activity of cdo-1. Our work suggests that one reason for this intersection of hif-1 and cdo-1 is to sense and maintain cysteine homeostasis when cysteine is in excess.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 9: the lack of biochemical approaches to probe the underlying mechanism of the prolyl hydroxylaseindependent activity of EGL-9.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 9: While not the primary focus of our current manuscript, we agree that this is an exciting area of future research. To uncover the prolyl hydroxylase-independent activity of EGL-9, we agree that a combination of approaches will be required including, biochemical, structure-function, and genetic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Issues We Feel the Authors Should Address:</p><p>Issue 10: One particularly glaring concern is that the authors really do not know the extent to which the prolyl hydroxylase activity is (or is not) impacted by the H487A mutation in egl-9(rae276). If there is a fair amount of enzymatic activity left in this mutant, then it complicates interpretation. The paper would be strengthened if the authors could show that the egl-9(rae276) eliminates most if not all prolyl hydroxylase activity. In addition, the authors may want to consider doing RNAi for egl-9 in the egl-9(rae276) mutant as a control, as this would support the claim that whatever non-hydroxylase activity EGL-9 may have is indeed the causative agent for the elevation of CDO-1::GFP. Without such experiments, readers are left with the nagging concern that this allele is simply a hypomorph for the single biochemical activity of EGL-9 (i.e., the prolyl hydroxylase activity) rather than the more interesting, hypothesized scenario that EGL-9 has multiple biochemical activities, only one of which is the prolyl hydroxylase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 10: We have two lines of evidence that suggest the egl-9(rae276)-encoded H487A variant eliminates prolyl hydroxylase activity. First, Pan et al. 2007 (reference 57) demonstrate that when the equivalent histidine (H313) is mutated in human protein, that protein lacks detectible prolyl hydroxylase activity. Second, the phenotypic similarities caused by egl-9(rae276) and the vhl-1 null allele, ok161. Both alleles cause nearly identical activation of the Pcdo-1::GFP reporter transgene (Fig. 5C,D), and similarly impact the growth of the suox-1(gk738847) hypomorphic mutant (Table 1). This phenotypic overlap is highly relevant as the established role of VHL-1 is to recognize the hydroxyl mark conferred by the EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase domain and promote the degradation of HIF-1. If EGL-9[H487A] had residual prolyl hydroxylase activity, we would expect the vhl-1(-) null mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> to display more dramatic phenotypes than their egl-9(rae276) counterparts. This is not the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 11: The authors observed that EGL-9 can inhibit HIF-1 and the expression of the HIF-1 target cdo-1 through a combination of activities that are (1) dependent on its prolyl hydroxylase activity (and subsequent VHL-1 activity that acts on the resulting hydroxylated prolines on HIF-1), and (2) independent of that activity. This is not a novel finding, as the authors themselves carefully note in their Discussion section, as this odd phenomenon has been observed for many HIF-1 target genes in multiple publications. While this manuscript adds to the description of this phenomenon, it does not really probe the underlying mechanism or shed light on how EGL-9 has these dual activities. This limits the overall impact and novelty of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 11: See response to Issues #8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 12: Cysteine dioxygenases like CDO-1 operate in an oxygen-dependent manner to generate sulfites from cysteine. CDO-1 activity is dependent upon availability of molecular oxygen; this is an unexpected characteristic of a HIF-1 target, as its very activation is dependent on low molecular oxygen. Authors neither address this in the text nor experimentally, and it seems a glaring omission.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 12: We agree this is an important point to raise within our manuscript. Although, despite its induction by HIF-1, there is no evidence that cdo-1 transcription is induced by hypoxia. In fact, in a genome wide transcriptomic study, cdo-1 was not found to be induced by hypoxia in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Shen et al. 2005, reference 71).</p><p>We have newly commented on the use of molecular oxygen as a substrate by both EGL-9 and CDO-1 in our Discussion section. The mammalian oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase (EGLN1) has been demonstrated to have high a Km value for O2 (high µM range). This likely allows EGLN1 to be poised to respond to small decreases in cellular oxygen from normal oxygen tensions. Clearly, CDO-1 also requires oxygen as a substrate, however the Km of CDO-1 for O2 is likely to be much lower, preventing sensitivity of the cysteine catabolism to physiological decreases in O2 availability. Although, to our knowledge, the CDO1 Km value for O2 has not been experimentally determined. We have added a new Discussion section where we address the conundrum about low oxygen inducing HIF-1 but oxygen being needed by CDO-1/CDO1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 13: The authors determined that the hypodermis is the site of the most prominent CDO-1::GFP expression, relevant to Figure 4. This claim would be strengthened if a negative control tissue, in the animal with the knockin allele, were shown. The hypodermal specific expression is a highlight of this paper, so it would make this article even stronger if they could further substantiate this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 13: Our claim that the hypodermis is the critical site of cdo-1 function is based on; (i) our hands on experience looking at Pcdo-1::GFP, Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP, CDO-1::GFP (encoded by cdo-1(rae273)) and our reporting of these expression patterns in multiple figures throughout the manuscript and (ii) the functional rescue of cdo-1(-) phenotypes by a cdo-1 rescue construct expressed by a hypodermal-specific promoter (col10). We agree that providing negative control tissues would modestly improve the manuscript. However, we do not think that adding these controls will substantially alter the conclusions of the paper. Importantly, we acknowledge this limitation of our work with the sentence, “However, we cannot exclude the possibility that CDO-1 also acts in other cells and tissues as well.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor issues to note:</p><p>Issue 14: Mutants for hif-1 and cysl-1 are sensitive to exogenous cysteine levels, yet loss of CDO-1 expression is not sufficient to explain this phenomenon, suggesting other targets of HIF-1 are involved. Given the findings the authors (and others) have had showing a role for RHY-1 in sulfur amino acid metabolism, shouldn't the authors consider testing rhy-1 mutants for sensitivity to exogenous cysteine?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 14: To test the hypothesis that rhy-1(-) <italic>C. elegans</italic> might be sensitive to supplemental cysteine, we cultured wild type and rhy-1(-) animals on 0, 100, and 1000µM supplemental cysteine. At 0 and 100µM supplemental cysteine, neither wild-type nor rhy-1(-) animals display any lethality suggesting rhy-1 is not required for survival in the face of excess cysteine (Fig. 3D,E). We also cultured these same strains on 1000µM supplemental cysteine, a concentration that is highly toxic to wild-type animals (100% lethality). rhy1(-) animals were resistant to 1000µM supplemental cysteine with a substantial fraction of the population surviving overnight exposure to this lethal dose of cysteine. Similarly, egl-9(-) mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> were also resistant to 1000µM supplemental cysteine. We propose that loss of egl-9 or rhy-1 activates HIF-1-mediated transcription which is priming these mutants to cope with the lethal dose of cysteine. These data are now presented in Figure 3D-F and presented in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 15: The cysteine exposure assay was performed by incubating nematodes overnight in liquid M9 media containing OP50 culture. The liquid culture approach adds two complications: (1) the worms are arguably starving or at least undernourished compared to animals grown on NGM plates, and (2) the worms are probably mildly hypoxic in the liquid cultures, which complicates the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 15: We agree that it is possible that animals growing overnight in liquid culture are undernourished and mildly hypoxic. However, we are confident in our data interpretation as all our experiments are appropriately controlled. Meaning, control and experimental groups were all grown under the same liquid culture conditions. Thus, these animals would all experience the same stressors that come with liquid culture. Importantly, we never make comparisons between groups that were grown under different culture conditions (i.e. solid media vs. liquid culture).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 16: An easily addressable concern is the wording of one of the main conclusions: that cdo-1 transcription is independent of the canonical prolyl hydroxylase function of EGL-9 and is instead dependent on one of EGL-9's non-canonical, non-characterized functions. There are several points in which the wording suggests that CDO-1 toxicity is independent of EGL-9. In their defense, the authors try to avoid this by saying,&quot;EGL-9 PHD,&quot; to indicate that it is the prolyl hydroxylase function of EGL-9 that is not required for CDO-1 toxicity. However, this becomes confusing because much of the field uses PHD and EGL-9/EGLN as interchangeable protein names. The authors need to be clear about when they are describing the prolyl hydroxylase activity of EGL-9 rather than other (hypothesized) activities of EGL-9 that are independent of the prolyl hydroxylase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 16: We appreciate the reviewer alerting us to this practice within the field. To avoid confusion, we have removed the “PHD” abbreviation from our manuscript and explicitly referred to the “prolyl hydroxylase domain” where relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 17: The authors state in the text, &quot;the egl-9; suox-1 double mutants are extremely sick and slow growing.&quot; We appreciate that their &quot;health&quot; assay, based on the exhaustion of food from the plate, is qualitative. We also appreciate that it is a functional measure of many factors that contribute to how fast a population of worms can grow, reproduce, and consume that lawn of food. However, unless they do a lifespan assay and/or measure developmental timing and specifically determine that the double mutant animals themselves are developing and/or growing more slowly, we do not think it is appropriate to use the words &quot;slow growing&quot; to describe the population. As they point out, the rate of consumption of food on the plate in their health assay is determined by a multitude and indeed a confluence of factors; the growth rate is one specific one that is commonly measured and has an established meaning.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 17: We see how the phrase ‘slow growing’ might imply a phenotype that we have not actually assessed with this assay. Therefore, we have removed all claims about “slow growth” of the strains presented in Table 1 and have highlighted the assay more overtly in the results section. For example; “While egl-9(-) and suox-1(gk738847) single mutant animals are healthy under standard culture conditions, the egl-9(-); suox1(gk738847) double mutant animals are extremely sick and require significantly more days to exhaust their <italic>E. coli</italic> food source under standard culture conditions (Table 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Issue 18: Relevance could be addressed further in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 18: We have added additional context for our work in the Discussion section.

Thus, I was surprised that there was no mention of the foundational Bill Kaelin paper (Briggs et al 2016) showing how the accumulation of cysteine is related to tumorigenesis, and that cysteine is a direct activator of EglN1. Puzzling that CDO1 is a tumor suppressor: you lose it, cysteine can accumulate and activate EglN1, causing HIF1 turnover. How do the authors reconcile their results with this paper?

Seems important to discuss this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 24: We have added new sections to our Discussion that consider the relationship between our work and Briggs et al. 2016 as well as mentioned the role of CTH and H2S in the mammalian carotid body.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 25: The abstract has a variety of contradictory statements. For example, the authors state that &quot;HIF-1mediated induction of cdo-1 functions largely independent of EGL-9,&quot; but then go on to conclude in the final sentence that cysteine stimulates H2S production, which then activates EGL-9 signaling, which then increases HIF-1-mediated transcription of cdo-1. A quick reading of the abstract leaves the reader uncertain whether EGL-9 is or is not involved in this regulation of cdo-1 expression. In addition, the conclusion sentence implies that activation of the EGL-9 pathway increases HIF-1-mediated transcription, yet it is well established that EGL-9 is an inhibitor of HIF-1. The abstract fails to deliver a clear summary of the paper's conclusions. Perhaps consider this alternative (changes in capital letters):</p><p>The amino acid cysteine is critical for many aspects of life, yet excess cysteine is toxic. Therefore, animals require pathways to maintain cysteine homeostasis. In mammals, high cysteine activates cysteine dioxygenase, a key enzyme in cysteine catabolism. The mechanism by which cysteine dioxygenase is regulated remains largely unknown. We discovered that <italic>C. elegans</italic> cysteine dioxygenase (cdo-1) is transcriptionally activated by high cysteine and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (hif-1). hif-1- dependent activation of cdo-1 occurs downstream of an H2S-sensing pathway that includes rhy-1, cysl-1, and egl-9. cdo-1 transcription is primarily activated in the hypodermis where it is sufficient to drive sulfur amino acid metabolism. EGL-9 and HIF-1 are core members of the cellular hypoxia response. However, we demonstrate that the mechanism of HIF-1-mediated induction of cdo-1 IS largely independent of EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylASE ACTIVITY and the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase. We propose that the REGULATION OF cdo-1 BY HIF-1 reveals a negative feedback loop for maintaining cysteine homeostasis. High cysteine stimulates the production of an H2S signal. H2S then ACTS THROUGH the rhy-1/cysl-1/egl-9 signaling pathway DISTINCTLY FROM THEIR ROLE IN HYPOXIA RESPONSE TO INCREASE HIF-1-mediated transcription of cdo-1, promoting degradation of cysteine via CDO-1.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 25: We agree that the abstract could be clearer. We believe this concern stems from the fact that we did not discuss our initial screen in the abstract. Thus, we failed to establish a role for egl-9 in the regulation of cdo-1. To remedy this, we have modified the abstract as suggested by the reviewer and added additional context. We believe that these changes improve the clarity of the Abstract substantially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 26: An easily addressable concern involves the &quot;dark&quot; microscopy controls showing lack of fluorescence from a nematode. In these dark negative control micrographs, the authors should draw dotted outlines around where the worms are or include a brightfield image next to the fluorescence image. On a computer screen, it is in fact possible to make out the worms. Yet, when printed out, the reader must assume there are worms in the dark images. Additionally, we realize that adjusting fluorescence so that wild-type CDO-1 expression can be seen will result in oversaturation of the egl-9 and rhy-1; cdo-1 doubles; however, this would be a useful figure to add into the supplement to both provide a normal reference of CDO-1 low-level expression and a demonstration of just how bright it is in the mutant backgrounds.
