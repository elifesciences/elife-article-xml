tapping task (SCT) and the macro- and microstructural properties of their superficial (SWM) and deep (DWM) white matter. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained from 32 subjects who performed the SCT with auditory or visual metronomes and five tempos ranging from 550 to 950 ms. We developed a method to determine the density of short-range fibers that run underneath the cortical mantle, interconnecting nearby cortical regions (U-fibers). Notably, individual differences in the density of U-fibers in the right audiomotor system were correlated with the degree of phase accuracy between the stimuli and taps across subjects. These correlations were specific to the synchronization epoch with auditory metronomes and tempos around 1.5 Hz. In addition, a significant association was found between phase accuracy and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum (CC), forming an interval-selective map where short and long intervals were behaviorally correlated with the anterior and posterior portions of the CC. These findings suggest that the structural properties of the SWM and DWM in the audiomotor system support the tapping synchronization abilities of subjects, as cortical U-fiber density is linked to the preferred tapping tempo and the bundle properties of the CC define an interval-selective topography.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>audiomotor system</kwd><kwd>tap

beat) is a basic and generalized human ability that can reach sophisticated levels in professional percussionists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Honing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merchant et al., 2015b</xref>). Indeed, humans are extremely sensitive to auditory regularities and can entrain to auditory beats across a wide range of tempos, as well as use timed movements of different body parts (such as finger or foot taps or body swaying) to keep the beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mendoza and Merchant, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Repp and Su, 2013</xref>). A classical task used to study rhythmic entrainment is the synchronization-continuation task (SCT), where subjects first entrain their tapping to a set of isochronous stimuli, also known as a metronome, and then continue tapping without the periodic stimulus using an internal clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Merchant et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wing, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wing and Kristofferson, 1973</xref>). In this type of task, humans show negative asynchronies, namely they tap a few milliseconds before the metronome, supporting the notion that entrainment depends on a predictive internal beat that is phase-locked to the stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lenc et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Repp and Su, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zarco et al., 2009</xref>). Neurophysiological and functional imaging studies have shown that the internal beat representation during an SCT rests in the motor system, including the basal ganglia and supplementary motor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merchant et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Merchant and Averbeck, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sánchez-Moncada et al., 2024</xref>). These areas produce a regenerating rhythmic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crowe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gámez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Merchant et al., 2015a</xref>) that dynamically interacts with the auditory areas, creating audiomotor loops where the motor prediction of the beat is flexibly compared and adjusted depending on changes in the input stream of rhythmic stimuli to phase-lock sensory and motor signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comstock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merchant and Honing, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Patel and Iversen, 2014</xref>). In addition, neurons in the supplementary motor areas (SMAs) are tuned to the tempo duration of tapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Merchant et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Merchant et al., 2013b</xref>), giving rise to interval-specific circuits that define a chronotopic map with short preferred intervals in the anterior portion and long preferred intervals in the posterior portion of the medial premotor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Protopapa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Merchant et al., 2024b</xref>).</p><p>The existence of neural circuits with preferred intervals comprising chronotopic maps is consistent with the human flexibility to tap in phase (with asynchronies close to zero) and high precision to isochronous stimuli over a wide range of interstimulus-onset intervals (ISIs), spanning from 400 to 1200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mates, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Repp, 2005</xref>). Within this window, subjects demonstrate a spontaneous rhythmic tempo, which corresponds to the interval produced naturally when asked to tap in without external cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McAuley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zamm et al., 2018</xref>). This spontaneous or preferred tempo is around 600–750 ms in human adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischl, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fraisse, 1978</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Parncutt, 1994</xref>), but is faster in early childhood and slower in late adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McAuley et al., 2006</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that the perception of rhythmic stimuli also has a preferred tempo, with an optimal sampling rate of ~1.4 Hz (ISI of 714 ms) in audition and ~0.7 Hz (ISI of 1428 ms) in vision. Furthermore, motor tapping helps to synchronize the temporal fluctuations of attention with maximal effects at ~1.7 Hz (ISI of 588 ms), but only for the auditory modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalta et al., 2020</xref>). These findings support the notion that ongoing motor activity shapes attention and beat perception, as it imposes temporal constraints on the sampling of sensory information within a narrow frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morillon et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, the audiomotor system is built to optimally work at a preferred tempo.</p><p>Although rhythmic entrainment is prevalent across all human cultures and is a natural behavior for social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nettle, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacoby et al., 2024</xref>), there are wide individual differences in the period (inter-tap interval) and phase (asynchronies) of movement synchronization. There are subjects who lack musical training, yet spontaneously synchronize to rhythmic stimuli ranging from strictly periodic metronomes to complex musical pieces, with performance comparable to that of trained musicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Scheurich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tranchant et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, there are poor synchronizers (around 10% of the population) that show low period accuracy and large asynchronies to isochronous metronomes and musical excerpts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Phillips-Silver et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sowiński and Dalla Bella, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tranchant et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, non-musicians synchronize less flexibly and less precisely across tempos than musicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Scheurich et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, both genetic and learning factors influence the beat-entrainment abilities of humans. A large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) recently demonstrated a highly polygenic architecture of the human capacity to synchronize to a musical beat. The GWAS phenotype for beat synchronization was related to performance in beat synchronization tasks and rhythm perception tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Niarchou et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, genetic influences account for only a small portion of human variation in beat synchronization, while environmental influences are the primary drivers of rhythmic accuracy. In fact, functional imaging has revealed that individual differences in beat perception depend on activation differences in the SMA and the posterior auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grahn and McAuley, 2009</xref>). In addition, the putamen, SMA, and auditory cortex show greater functional connectivity during rhythm perception, with larger modulation for musicians than non-musicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grahn and Rowe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grahn and Rowe, 2013</xref>). Consequently, the magnitude of the anatomofunctional association between the auditory and motor control areas of the cerebral cortex seems to covary with the individual difference in how humans perceive and entrain to simple regular beats. Such brain networks rely on the structural connectivity provided by white matter, which can be evaluated through diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Long-range anatomical connectivity is supported by deep white matter (DWM) bundles, while short-range connectivity is achieved through fibers that run tangentially to the cortical surface and connect adjacent and proximal cortical regions. These fibers are collectively termed U-fibers due to their shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schüz and Braitenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schmahmann et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shastin et al., 2022</xref>). In this work, we individually analyze the role of these two forms of connectivity in rhythmic entrainment abilities. We hypothesize that if the cortical connectivity of the audiomotor system is defining rhythmic entrainment abilities, then individual differences in tapping synchronization should covary with the degree of anatomical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assaneo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Steele et al., 2013</xref>). Previous evidence suggests that the audiomotor system is tuned at a limited interaction rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morillon et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we also hypothesize that the relationship between rhythmic tapping abilities and the structural connectivity of the audiomotor system should be more evident for intervals close to the preferred tempo.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we acquired DWIs from 32 subjects that had previously performed an SCT using flashing visual or auditory tones as metronomes in the range of hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). SCT rhythmic performance across durations (ISI: 550, 650, 750, 850, or 950 ms) and modalities (auditory and visual) was characterized using the absolute asynchronies, the autocorrelation of the inter-tap interval time series during the synchronization epoch, the constant error, and the temporal variability during both synchronization and continuation epochs. These parameters measure the phase accuracy, error correction, period accuracy, and period precision of the rhythmic tapping of the subjects, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used an ISI range of 550–950 ms because it contains the preferred interval and is within the optimal window for tap synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Repp, 2005</xref>). Hence, with this ISI range, we could potentially identify structural correlates for both the preferred tempo and interval selectivity. With this in mind, we evaluated DWM fascicles using a fixel-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhollander et al., 2021</xref>) and developed two metrics for superficial white matter (SWM): fiber density corresponding to fibers entering or exiting the cortex and U-fibers running tangentially to the cortex. Widespread correlations in the right audiomotor circuit were found between the tangential U-fiber density and the phase accuracy of subjects during the synchronization epoch of the auditory condition for the 650 and 750 ms intervals. The interval specificity in these associations suggests that the preferred tempo for rhythmic entrainment has its origins in the structural properties of the U-fibers running superficially across the audiomotor circuit. In addition, there was a significant association between asynchronies in the auditory condition and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum (CC), forming an interval-selective map with an anterior–posterior gradient, similar to the topography of interval-tuned clusters observed with functional imaging. Crucially, the anatomo-behavioral associations were negative, indicating that subjects with good predictive abilities and small asynchronies exhibited large superficial and deep apparent fiber densities (AFDs), while subjects with large asynchronies showed low fiber densities.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synchronization-continuation task (SCT).</title><p>Initially, the subjects placed their finger at the central-bottom target of a touchscreen to start the trial and maintained the finger in this position while observing a sequence of right–left alternating visual stimuli with a constant interstimulus interval (target duration, perception epoch). The subjects were instructed to start tapping once they got the beat from the metronome; they had two to six stimuli to start tapping. Thus, when they considered they had extracted the beat, subjects tapped the touchscreen on the left or right target in synchrony with the alternating visual metronome for six intervals (synchronization epoch). Finally, they continued tapping on the right or left targets for another six intervals without the metronome (continuation epoch). The mean produced and the target interval were displayed at the end of each trial as feedback. Subjects also performed an auditory metronome version of the SCT, where the metronome consisted of 500 Hz tones that were presented on the right or left side of a headphone. Five target durations (550, 650, 750, 850, or 950 ms) were presented pseudorandomly, with the visual and auditory conditions interleaved between subjects.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83838-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavior during the synchronization-continuation task (SCT).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parameters of rhythmic performance during the SCT.

Hence, this parameter can only be measured during the synchronization epoch of the SCT. We performed a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on absolute asynchronies with metronome modality (auditory and visual: two levels) and instructed interval duration (550, 650, 750, 850, and 950 ms: five levels) as within-subject factors.

Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc test showed significantly larger asynchronies for the visual than auditory modality across all durations (p &lt; 0.0001 for 550, 650, 750, and 850 ms; p = 0.006 for 950 ms; with the interaction effect mainly driven by the difference in the 950 ms across modalities). These results confirm the preponderance of the auditory modality over the visual modality to produce phase alignment of the taps with the metronome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comstock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gámez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Merchant et al., 2015a</xref>). In addition, we computed the intersubject correlation matrix on the absolute asynchronies across instructed intervals and found a significant correlation between 650 and 750 ms for both the auditory and visual conditions (<italic>r</italic> = 0.67, p = 0.000026; <italic>r</italic> = 0.69, p = 0.000011, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The post hoc Tukey HSD showed no significant differences for target duration in constant error during synchronization for both modalities, with accurate timing close to zero. In contrast, during continuation, the same post hoc test revealed that the significant interactions between factors were mainly due to the significant differences between distant intervals within the auditory and visual modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In fact, for the continuation epoch, the constant error followed the bias effect, with overestimation for short durations and underestimation for long durations, especially for the auditory condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pérez and Merchant, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pérez et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, the indifference interval, which corresponds to the interval associated with zero constant error, was 654 ms for the auditory condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, blue arrow) and 420 ms for the visual condition. This finding suggests that our subjects had a clear preferred interval in the auditory condition that is close to the 2 Hz reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zamm et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, temporal variability was defined as the standard deviation of the produced intervals and is a metric of timing period precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The HSD post hoc tests showed significantly greater temporal variability in the visual metronome than in the auditory metronome (for the intervals 650, 750, 850, and 950 ms: p &lt; 0.0001) during the synchronization but not the continuation epoch, confirming the high period precision for auditory metronomes, especially during synchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gámez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Repp and Penel, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>White matter analysis</title><p>Before the task performance session, participants were scanned in a 3T Philips Achieva TX MR scanner with a 32-channel head coil.

This approach allowed us to independently assess the correlation between our AFD measurements of every vertex and every variable of the SCT. Specifically, rCCA was calculated between the matrix of behavioral parameters from the synchronization phase of the SCT (i.e., absolute asynchrony, constant error, temporal variability, and lag 1 autocorrelation) for each sensory modality (auditory and visual), every target interval (550–950 ms) and the AFD metrics from all vertices across the brain surface. Separate models were built for each AFD metric (i.e., <sub>total</sub>AFD, <sub>tan</sub>AFD, and <sub>par</sub>AFD). Notably, all pairings of behavioral and AFD data rendered highly correlated canonical variates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

FC is a macroscopic metric of the fiber bundle diameter and, finally, FDC is a combination of FD and FC (see Methods). Briefly, the FBA analysis pipeline consists of five steps. First, the images of each subject are processed to obtain a white matter FOD map in native space using CSD. Second, an FOD template and a fixel mask are built. Third, the AFD map and the corresponding fixels for each voxel are computed for each subject in native space. The FD metric is obtained for each fixel computed from the total DWI signal per voxel.

Our study supports five conclusions: First, the tapping phase and period during the SCT showed precision and accuracy, as well as error corrections that were biased toward auditory rather than visual metronomes, thereby confirming previous observations. Second, the right audiomotor system exhibited individual differences in SWM and U-fiber density. These differences were correlated with the degree of phase accuracy of the tapping synchronization across subjects. Notably, the correlations were selective for the synchronization epoch of the auditory condition and were specific to the 650 and 750 ms intervals. Third, there was a significant association between the rhythmic entrainment phase and the density and bundle diameter of the CC, forming an interval-selective map with an anterior–posterior trend. This implies that the behavioral and structural associations for short and long intervals tended to be in the anterior and posterior portions of the CC, respectively. Fourth, the fiber bundle diameter of the arcuate fasciculus, CC, forceps major, and superior longitudinal fasciculus showed a significant correlation with the mean asynchronies across all tested tempos. Finally, we found no significant associations between SWM and DWM properties and temporal variability, constant error, or lag 1 autocorrelation under the visual and auditory conditions during the synchronization and continuation epochs of the SCT. These last findings suggest that connectivity within the audiomotor system is tightly linked with the ability to synchronize in phase at the preferred tempo for auditory metronomes. We speculate that the structural white matter is associated with tapping-phase control, not with period representation, as the latter depends on neural population dynamics within the timing network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gámez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betancourt et al., 2023</xref>) and the former depends on a prior ability to detect changes in phase at the preferred tempo, whose intrinsic nature is defined in the audiomotor connectivity.</p><p>Many studies have shown that performance tapping synchronized to an auditory metronome is more precise and accurate than synchronization to a flashing visual metronome with the same timing characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hove et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Merchant et al., 2008c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Patel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Repp and Penel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zarco et al., 2009</xref>). This auditory–visual asymmetry can be cancelled out by visual moving metronomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hove et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pérez et al., 2023</xref>). Since the first processing relays, the auditory system has higher temporal resolution compared to the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duysens et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sayegh et al., 2011</xref>) and plays a critical role in time perception and reproduction across many tasks, not only in tapping SCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grondin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Merchant et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Merchant and de Lafuente, 2014c</xref>). For example, when audiovisual stimuli are used in an oddball paradigm, the perceived duration is dominated by the auditory modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Yeh, 2009</xref>). In addition, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) disruption of the auditory cortex impaired time estimation for auditory and visual stimuli, while disruption in the visual cortex only produced timing impairments for visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kanai et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, a current hypothesis is that the auditory cortex is engaged in multimodal temporal processing, and the interaction between the auditory and motor systems in the frontal lobe allows not only time encoding but also time prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merchant and Honing, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Merchant and Yarrow, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Patel and Iversen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schwartze et al., 2012</xref>). Our present findings support this notion in different ways. First, the rhythmic timing performance of our subjects was biased toward the auditory condition across different behavioral measures. Second, the right audiomotor system showed widespread and significant correlations between the density of superficial U-fibers and the degree of sensorimotor phase accuracy across subjects. These anatomo-behavioral associations are selective to the intervals in the 650–750 ms range. Third, the fiber bundle diameter of the left arcuate fasciculus, a key tract connecting the parietotemporal auditory system with the frontal lobe, showed a significant correlation with the mean asynchronies across all tested tempos. Furthermore, the clear clustering of subjects as either good or bad synchronizers in a syllabic isochronous entrainment task correlates with both the difference in the activation magnitude in frontal areas and the changes in white matter pathways (i.e., left arcuate fasciculus) that connect the auditory system with the premotor cortical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assaneo et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, our results accentuate the audiomotor structural foundation for rhythmic entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Honing and Merchant, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Miyata et al., 2022</xref>). The lack of structural associations in the visual condition is probably due to the larger variability in rhythmic tapping for this modality, making it difficult to infer statistical correlations between our metrics. As described above, the null anatomo-behavioral associations for the visual condition could also be due to the slow sampling rate of visual periodic temporal attention, with a sampling interval that is longer than our tested durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalta et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The observed associations between the measured SWM and DWM properties and the accuracy in the synchronization phase were negative. This result indicates that the white matter parameter values were greater in subjects with asynchronies close to zero and an accurate tapping phase with the metronome than in subjects with large gaps in time between the stimuli and taps. These results support the theory that intersubject differences in rhythmic entrainment phase depend on micro- and macrostructural white matter properties, which could have a genetic and/or learned substrate. From a genetics perspective, we could speculate that the existence of poor and superior synchronizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blecher et al., 2016</xref>) may depend on the FD of superficial U-fibers in the right audiomotor system, as well as on the density of deep tracts such as the CC and arcuate fasciculus. From a training perspective, these SWM and DWM bundles may develop larger density and myelination during intense musical practice, distinguishing the audiomotor tracts between musicians and non-musicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Palomar-García et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Vaquero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zatorre et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The correlations between the density of tangential U-fibers in the right audiomotor circuit and the asynchronies for the auditory condition were interval-selective for the intermediate tested tempos. The observed interval specificity corroborates the existence of an spontaneous rhythmic tempo, already observed in many studies of rhythmic entrainment, and with values between 600 and 750 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drake et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drake et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McAuley et al., 2006</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalla Bella et al., 2017</xref>). The biological intrinsic periodicity may depend on a biased distribution of preferred tempos toward 1.5 Hz in the interval-tuned neurons of the motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolo and Merchant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pérez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pérez and Merchant, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalta et al., 2020</xref> showed that humans were best at following auditory rhythms at a rate of ~1.4 Hz and that overt motor activity optimizes auditory periodic temporal attention at a similar rate. This rate is close to the intervals with structural associations in the present study. Consequently, we suggest that cortico-cortical connectivity within the audiomotor system is especially designed to support the internal representation of an auditory beat at the preferred tempo, providing larger phase-locking abilities with the metronome for spontaneous motor tempos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramaniam et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalta et al., 2020</xref> also demonstrated that the best rate for visual rhythms was far slower, at ~0.7 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalta et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that we did not get effects in the visual condition because our target interval of 950 ms was not slow enough for this modality.</p><p>Ultra-high-field (7T) functional imaging revealed that the medial premotor areas (SMA and pre-SMA) of the human brain possess neural circuits that are tuned to different durations, forming a topographical arrangement during a visual discrimination task. These chronomaps show units with enhanced responses for the preferred interval and suppressed activity for the non-preferred duration, and define a topographical gradient with short preferred intervals in the anterior portion and long preferred intervals in the posterior portion of the medial premotor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Protopapa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schwartze et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Protopapa et al., 2019</xref> also showed chronomaps in the SMA during an interval reproduction task using auditory cues, which is similar to the task used in this study. Notably, chronomaps also showed an anterior–posterior gradient, but they represent relative rather than absolute time, and they presented some flexibility in the location of the preferred interval depending on the task context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bueti et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, a recent imaging study described the existence of large chronomaps covering the cortical mantle from the dorsal and ventral premotor areas to the occipital pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hendrikx et al., 2022</xref>). Our measurements of the FDA also revealed a topographical arrangement in the correlations between FD in the DWM and CC and the sensorimotor phase accuracy of subjects. We also found significant anatomo-behavioral associations in the anterior part of the CC for short intervals and in the posterior CC for long tapping tempos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schwartze et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, our interval-selective map is defined by the correlation between asynchronies and FDA, with no topographic model of the distribution of preferred intervals as shown in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. These studies have not explored individual differences. Moreover, we found a frontal CC cluster of fixels with longer interval selectivity, producing a discontinuity in the anterior–posterior gradient of preferred intervals. These findings suggest that the map for duration selectivity starts anteriorly in the CC, which is linked to the premotor system, and ends in the CC of the visual areas of the occipital lobe. The anterior selectivity for the 650 and 750 ms ISI supports the notion that the motor system functions at 1.7 Hz during beat perception and entrainment and strongly influences the auditory system but not the visual system at this tempo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zalta et al., 2020</xref>). The latter could explain why we did not find interval selectivity in the CC for the visual condition. Consequently, timing maps define a cortical processing framework for efficient timing integration that has both functional and anatomical bases, especially for the auditory modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Merchant and de Lafuente, 2024a</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown correlations between sensorimotor synchonization task performance and the microstructural characteristics of DWM. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blecher et al., 2016</xref> found a positive association between the fractional anisotropy of the left arcuate fasciculus and CC and performance in an auditory-cued finger-tapping task. The SWM immediately below the cortex has received has been less studied than DWM fasciculi, even though it accounts for 60% of the total white matter volume and is pivotal in maintaining cortico-cortical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schüz and Braitenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schmahmann et al., 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, recent studies have implicated SWM abnormalities in epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hong et al., 2019</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Phillips et al., 2016</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nazeri et al., 2013</xref>), and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Stockert et al., 2021</xref>). The SWM contains short-range association fibers that connect adjacent gyri (U-fibers) and the initial or final portions of long-range connections that traverse the DWM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schüz and Braitenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guevara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirilina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yoshino et al., 2020</xref>). The SWM is difficult to study because of its complicated geometry and abundance of fiber crossings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guevara et al., 2020</xref>). To better characterize the SWM microstructure, we separated the two components of the SWM and performed a surface- and depth-wise evaluation. Complementarily, we analyzed the DWM using FBA, which addresses many of the shortcomings of voxel-wise analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhollander et al., 2021</xref>). This two-pronged approach allowed us to evaluate the entire white matter volume and show the association between its mesoscopic characteristics (i.e., AFD) and predictive tapping synchronization.</p><p>A potential limitation of our study is the relatively small number of participants, related to the time-consuming nature of the behavioral evaluation and the long scanning time. Moreover, many statistical tests were performed, relating several behavioral metrics to various diffusion metrics across the brain at different depths. To minimize the possibility of statistical errors, we performed an rCCA to jointly model the behavioral and imaging metrics, thus accounting for the numerous statistical tests and reducing the possibility of reporting false positive findings. This reinforced the importance of superficial cortico-cortical communication through U-fibers and the SCT for intervals around the preferred tempo. While we have attempted to control for statistical errors as much as possible, a sample of 32 young adults with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria may inevitably not represent the population. We expect our current findings to be replicated and extended in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our results showed that the subjects’ accuracy in SCT performance was associated with higher FC, FDC, or FD values. This is consistent with the literature that shows that better performance in different tasks is associated with higher values of FBA metrics. For example, better performance in a bimanual coordination task was associated with higher FBA values in the CC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zivari Adab et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institution (049H-RM).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-two healthy human subjects (age = 25.37 ± 3.21 years; 19 females) without musical training volunteered to participate and gave informed consent, which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by our Institutional Review Board.

However, instead of tapping a button, the subject tapped on the right or left halves of the touch screen. The task started when three empty white circles (radius 1 degree of visual angle) on a black background were presented simultaneously, forming an inverted isosceles triangle (2 degrees of visual angle on each side). Subjects were trained to place their finger at the central-bottom target to start the trial and attend to a sequence of two to six right/left alternating stimuli with a constant interstimulus interval (perception epoch). They were instructed to tap the touchscreen on the corresponding target in synchrony with a metronome for six intervals (synchronization epoch) and continue tapping on the screen for another six intervals without the metronome (continuation epoch; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During the perception epoch, the subjects were instructed to start tapping once they got the beat from the metronome, and they had two to six stimuli to start tapping.

The constant error and temporal variability were calculated from the produced intervals during both the synchronization and continuation epochs. Absolute asynchronies were defined as the unsigned difference between stimulus onset and tap onset. Constant error was calculated as the difference between the produced interval and the target interval and is a measure of timing accuracy. Temporal variability was defined as the standard deviation of the total produced intervals and is a metric of timing precision. The autocorrelation of the six inter-tap intervals during a trial was calculated and averaged across trials. Thus, lag 1 autocorrelation is normally negative for isochronous metronomes, meaning that a longer produced interval tends to be followed by a shorter interval and vice versa, reflecting an error correction mechanism used to maintain the beat of the metronome during synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iversen et al., 2015</xref>).

A white matter mask was computed for each subject, followed by global signal intensity normalization of the DWI, which was performed across subjects by dividing all volumes by the median <italic>b</italic> = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup> intensity. Images were upsampled to 1 mm<sup>3</sup> isometric resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyrby et al., 2014</xref>). White matter FODs were estimated using the multi-shell, multi-tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jeurissen et al., 2014</xref>). Tissue-specific response functions were calculated for each subject, from which we derived group-averaged response functions that were used to estimate FODs (lmax = 8) for each subject. An FOD template was constructed through iterative non-linear registration using the FODs of all 32 subjects followed by the calculation of the intersection of masks of all subjects. Fixels were derived at each voxel by FOD segmentation and reoriented to the study template. Finally, FBA metrics (FD, FC, and FDC) were calculated for each fixel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A whole-brain probabilistic tractogram was calculated based on the FOD population template, seeded from a whole-brain white matter mask to produce a tractogram of 20 million streamlines. Next, the SIFT algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) was used to select a subset of streamlines (<italic>n</italic> = 2 million) that best fit the diffusion signal and therefore reduce tractography biases.

We computed a Laplacian potential field between the ventricles and the gray/white matter boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jones et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lerch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) using <italic>minclaplace</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lerch et al., 2008</xref>). Next, Laplacian streamlines were seeded at each vertex of the white matter surface and propagated toward the ventricles using Matlab, 2020A. Thus, one Laplacian streamline was obtained for every white matter surface vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The distance between each step of the Laplacian streamline was 100 µm, and streamlines were truncated at 5 mm. This resulted in smooth and non-overlapping pathways that respect topology and traverse the SWM. Furthermore, the first segment of these streamlines is perpendicular to the gray-white matter (GM–WM) surface, with subsequent segments gradually bending as they extend away from it. These aspects make the Laplacian streamlines behave similarly to what is expected from the anatomy of the SWM. Finally, all the white matter surfaces and synthetic streamlines were warped to their corresponding subject-specific DWI space via between-modality non-linear registration using ANTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avants et al., 2011</xref>). Data for one subject was discarded for SWM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) due to suboptimal registration between DWI metric maps and white matter surface.</p><p>We used the fixel-based information to independently evaluate the two fiber systems that coexist in the SWM: U-fibers subserving short-range cortico-cortical connectivity and long-range projection, association and commissural fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirilina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schüz and Braitenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yoshino et al., 2020</xref>). With the assumption that U-fibers run tangentially to the gray/white matter surface and long-range fibers impinge on the surface in a perpendicular fashion, we attributed the fixels oriented parallel to the segments of the Laplacian streamlines to long-range fibers, and the remaining fixels to the U-fiber system. DWI-derived metrics were sampled along each Laplacian streamline at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mm under the gray/white matter interface. The metrics sampled were <sub>total</sub>AFD (the integral of all FODs within a given voxel) and AFD attributed to either long-range fibers (<sub>par</sub>AFD; the integral of the FOD of the fixel parallel to the Laplacian streamline) or U-fibers (<sub>tan</sub>AFD; defined as <sub>total</sub>AFD − <sub>par</sub>AFD).</p><p>All metrics along the Laplacian streamlines were projected onto the gray/white matter surface of the fsaverage5 template for visualization and statistical analyses and smoothed using a two-dimensional kernel of 15 mm of full width at half maximum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Surface-based analysis of SWM</title><p>Analyses were performed by fitting a general linear model at each vertex using SurfStat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat">https://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat</ext-link>).

This approach allowed us to independently assess the correlation of the AFD measurements of every vertex with every variable of the SCT. Concretely, rCCA was calculated between the matrix of behavioral metrics from the synchronization phase of the SCT (i.e., absolute asynchrony, constant error, temporal variability, and lag 1 autocorrelation) for each sensory modality (auditory and visual), and every target interval (550–950 ms) and the AFD matrix of the whole brain. Given the orthogonality between <sub>tan</sub>AFD and <sub>par</sub>AFD, and their collinearity with <sub>total</sub>AFD individual models were built for every AFD metric.</p><p>Since the number of variables (particularly the number of vertices) is much larger than the sample size, we included two regularizing parameters for the covariance matrices in the model (rCCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mihalik et al., 2022</xref>). These parameters were optimized by a grid search algorithm that maximized the correlation of the canonical variates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Confidence intervals (at 99%) for the loadings of the variables after model fitting were estimated by building null distributions of loadings based on random permutations (<italic>n</italic> = 10,000) of the original metrics. This was useful to identify the most relevant behavioral variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) associated with the structural data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Thirty-two healthy human subjects without musical training volunteered to participate and gave informed consent, which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by our Institutional Review Board.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Barbara Shinn–Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The statistical approach will need streamlining and adequate correction for respective families of hypotheses where appropriate. As indicated by the reviews, Having multiple outcome measures also poses a potential risk of inflated type I error. See esp. comments by Rev #1 and Rev #2 in this regard! Sample size justifications and corresponding tempering statements/quantifications about statistical power are probably in order as well.</p><p>2) More background information is needed for the structural MR data and analyses, see esp. Rev # 2.</p><p>3) The reviewers' repeated calls for overall editing for clarity, in terms of structure as well as grammar, is not to be taken lightly. Thank you.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– By far, one of the most major things to note here is that there are a wide variety of statistical tests carried out across levels. That is, there are 4 behavioral measures – not to mention multiple intervals and modalities and phases, 3 fiber density measures, at 5 depths, as well as other DWI measures tested. Was there any attempt to control for these multiple comparisons? I note that this is different from the within–brain multiple comparisons (i.e. across voxels).</p><p>– The second major claim of the paper is the chronotopic organization in the corpus callosum. I find it difficult to assess whether this is true or not. From my observation, there are certainly different parts associated with different intervals, but it does not seem to go in a gradient direction (anterior–posterior, as the authors state). For example, the 750ms interval appears to cover most of the area, and the 950ms interval seems to be in a completely separate area. It's possible that there is a gradient here, but the authors have not convincingly presented it; perhaps by collapsing across dimensions this could be shown, but otherwise, any claims of &quot;chronotopy&quot; similar to what Protopapa and colleagues observed should be tempered.</p><p>– There is, of course, concern about the sample size in this study. A group of 32 subjects can certainly show associations, but only if they are quite high and potentially subject to bias. This is not meant to say that the results are certainly false, but merely that there is an exploratory aspect to the findings that should be emphasized.</p><p>– The motivation is a bit awkward and amounts to: &quot;we don't know the role of structural connectivity in rhythmic entrainment; we hypothesize that structural connectivity accounts for individual differences in rhythmic entrainment&quot;. That is, we don't know if X is involved, therefore we hypothesize that X is involved? Why? While it's true that little work has been done in this specific area, the hypothesis is quite unformed.</p><p>– The authors should likely read and cite a paper by Zalta, Petkoski, and Morillon (2018) on periodic temporal attention. Here, the authors observed that humans were best at attending to auditory rhythms at a rate of ~1.4Hz, very close to the rate observed in the present study. Moreover, for visual rhythms, the best rate was far slower, at ~0.7Hz. It is possible then that the reason for the lack of effects in the visual condition is that the authors did not test any intervals that were slow enough.</p><p>Zalta, A., Petkoski, S., and Morillon, B. (2020). Natural rhythms of periodic temporal attention. Nature communications, 11(1), 1–12.</p><p>– How was the feedback conveyed? The methods state they are the mean asynchrony, but was this an offset value? A proportion? Did subjects know if they were tapping too fast or too slow?</p><p>– There is some concern regarding the latencies for which the tapping information is collected. If the monitor was running at 60Hz, is this the same sample rate for the taps? In this case, there might be a concern that the measures being collected are not sufficiently precise to reveal individual differences, which may explain why there were so few correlations except for asynchrony.</p><p>– What if subjects tapped the monitor but missed the target? Was the tap not collected? Did all subjects remain within the target?</p><p>– More detail about the FWE correction is needed. Was this at the cluster level? Voxel level? The text describes &quot;FWE &lt;0.0.001&quot; and &quot;Cluster&lt;0.001&quot;, so what does this mean, precisely? Also, the methods state at one point that a &quot;permutation test&quot; was done, then at another point state random field theory</p><p>– For the continuation phase of the task, did the authors consider decomposing the inter–tap–interval variance using the Wing and Kristofferson (1973) model? This would provide measures of putative &quot;central&quot; and &quot;motor&quot; variance. Given that multiple intervals were tested, the authors should observe that central variance grows with the interval, whereas motor variance remains flat. Further, one might expect motor variance to relate more to connections within motor regions, whereas central variance could relate to audiomotor connections.</p><p>– For continuation performance, a commonly observed phenomenon is &quot;drift&quot; in which subjects continuously speed up or slow down their responses. Was this observed at all? A typical method for drift correction is to detrend the time series with a first–order polynomial and use the residuals for calculating measures of variance (Vorberg and Wing, 1996). Was this examined at all?</p><p>Vorberg, D., and Wing, A. (1996). Modeling variability and dependence in timing. In Handbook of perception and action (Vol. 2, pp. 181–262). Academic Press.</p><p>– Another prediction of the W–K model is the negative lag 1 autocorrelation which the authors examine here. Yet, violations of this commonly do occur. Were there violations (i.e. trials) where subjects did not show negative autocorrelations?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Interesting study, a nice simple task, and interesting white–matter metrics that I do not see often in this literature.</p><p>The selection of interval ranges needs further justification–why did the researchers choose these particular interval lengths, and did they predict differences between them? The preferred tempo range includes the 650 ms interval, as they note, but most authors would suggest that the 550 ms interval rate would be in this range for many people as well, as preferred beat rates tend to span 300–900 ms (Parncutt, 1994). Thus, was the range of intervals selected to provide evidence of structural chronomaps in the brain, or did the researchers expect to see behavioural differences across the intervals (that may be related to structural brain measures) that they felt would be meaningful (being more or less related to optimal tapping rates), and therefore they used a range of intervals to assess this?</p><p>There are 2 modalities and 5 different interval lengths, all of which appear to be analyzed independently in the brain data. The MRI methods contain very little information about multiple comparisons correction related to the number of different tests that are performed–this needs much clearer explication.</p><p>Unsigned (absolute) asynchrony is not generally used as a measure of 'prediction'–in fact, you explicitly cannot tell if the greater asynchrony is in advance of or after the intended target, therefore it specifically obscures predictive vs. reactive taps. Usually, asynchrony is given as a measure of phase accuracy, especially when unsigned. If the authors want to make conclusions about predictive ability specifically, they should report unsigned asynchronies. This leads to my next point.</p><p>I think the 4 dependent behavioural variables would benefit from relating to a phase/period framework. Asynchronies index phase accuracy (but of course tend to relate to overall period accuracy, as tapping at an incorrect period would likely lead to being out of phase, but tapping at an incorrect phase does not necessarily lead to tapping at the incorrect period). The 'constant error' measures appear to be a measure of period accuracy that is relatively agnostic to phase, and the standard deviation is measured on reproduced intervals only, therefore also only seems to be a measure of period variability, agnostic to phase.</p><p>Moreover, perhaps that could be part of the reason you only see relationships with asynchrony (i.e., that the precision of the alignment between taps and stimuli is what the auditory–motor system is judging, but this same precision relative to an internal clock (which is more what your period measures are)) is not supported by the same system? And that relationship is not embodied in visual–motor synchronization (perhaps because our visual system timing for punctate events is generally poor)? In any case, I think phase/period distinctions would make your measures easier to relate to existing literature (which does often distinguish between phase and period) and also may provide some explanation for the lack of relationship to the brain data for some measures but not others.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83838.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The statistical approach will need streamlining and adequate correction for respective families of hypotheses where appropriate.

To address this critical issue, we performed a regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) between the behavioral data of the SCT and the structural information of the SWM. This approach allowed us to assess independently the correlation of our AFD measurements of every vertex with every variable of the SCT. The paper has a new segment in the methods describing the analysis and a new section in the results describing the following findings:</p><p>“2.4 Canonical correlation between behavioural and AFD maps</p><p>In the previous section we correlated many behavioural measures with all vertices of the AFD maps, with the potential risk of inflating the type I error. To address this critical issue, we performed a regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) between the behavioural data of the SCT and the structural information of the SWM (see Methods). This approach allowed us to jointly assess the correlation of our AFD measurements of every vertex with every variable of the SCT. Specifically, rCCA was calculated between the matrix of behavioural parameters from the synchronization phase of the SCT (i.e. absolute asynchrony, constant error, temporal variability, and lag1 autocorrelation) for each sensory modality (auditory and visual), every target interval (550-950) and the AFD matrix of the whole brain. Given the orthogonality between tanAFD and parAFD, and their collinearity with totalAFD, a separate model was built for <italic>totalAFD, <sub>tan</sub>AFD</italic> and <italic><sub>par</sub>AFD</italic>. Notably, all pairings of behavioural and AFD data rendered highly correlated canonical variates. In line with the previous results, the highest correlation was found between the SCT data and the <italic><sub>tan</sub>AFD</italic>, followed by <italic><sub>total</sub>AFD</italic>, and then <italic><sub>par</sub>AFD</italic> (Figure 6). The loadings of the SCT variables were very consistent across models (Figure 6B) and, invariably, identified the asynchrony of the auditory modality for the 650-850ms intervals as the SCT conditions with larger correlation with the structural data. The correlation between all vertices and their canonical variates was negative, corroborating the hypothesis that subjects with larger predictive abilities had larger <italic><sub>tan</sub>AFD</italic> in the audiomotor circuit (Figure 6C). A novel result from the rCCA is the significant association between the temporal variability of the auditory phase in the same intervals (650-850 ms) and <italic><sub>tan</sub>AFD</italic>, although in the opposite direction than the asynchrony (Figure 6B). “</p><p>Since the spatial distribution of significant vertices is lost in the rCCA, we have opted to show the main results of our original surface-based linear models (Figures 3-5), with rCCA providing ancillary support to the main findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The second major claim of the paper is the chronotopic organization in the corpus callosum.

We did not test a model with a gradient to determine a chronotopy map similar to what Protopapa and colleagues observed with fMRI. In fact, the longer duration showed significant correlations between the asynchronies in the SCT auditory condition and FDC in the most frontal and occipital section of the CC. Consequently, in the Results section we avoided the use of the concept of chronotopic map and instead used an interval-selectivity map in the CC as follows:</p><p>“The association between rhythmic entrainment and white matter properties defined an interval-selectivity map in the CC, with FDC at different levels of CC showing significant correlations with the absolute asynchronies at specific intervals (Figure 7). This interval-selectivity map showed behavioural and structural associations for short and long intervals in the anterior and posterior portions of the CC, respectively. Thus, the FDC fixel values of the posterior midbody of CC (interconnecting motor, pre-motor cortices and M1) showed a significant negative correlation with absolute auditory asynchronies for the 650 and 750 ms intervals (Figure 7BC; FWE-corrected P-value &lt; 0.05). For the asynchronies at the intermediate interval of 850 ms, the negative correlation was observed with FDC fixel values located in the isthmus and the splenium (Figure 7C; interconnecting primary motor, temporal, and visual cortices). Finally, the asynchronies of the interval of 950 ms showed a significant negative correlation with fixels located in forceps minor (FMI) and major (FMA) (Figure 7A,D); interconnecting prefrontal and visual cortices, respectively.”</p><p>In addition, in the discussion we tone down our claims of a chronotopic topography. Now the paragraph in the discussion reads:</p><p>“Our measurements on the FBA also revealed a topographical arrangement in the correlations between the density of deep fibers and in CC and the rhythmic predictive abilities of subjects, so that significant anatomo-behavioural associations were found in the anterior part of the CC for short intervals and in the posterior CC for long tapping tempos (Schwartze et al., 2012). Nevertheless, our interval-selective map is defined by the correlation between the asynchronies and the FDC, with no topographic model of the distribution of preferred intervals as in the fMRI studies. Moreover, we found a frontal CC cluster of fixels with longer interval selectivity, producing a discontinuity in the anterior-posterior gradient of preferred intervals. These findings suggest that the map for duration selectivity starts anteriorly in the CC linked to the premotor system and ends in the CC of the visual areas of the occipital lobe. In line with our results, a recent imaging study described the existence of large chronomaps covering the cortical mantle from the dorsal and ventral premotor areas to the occipital pole (Harvey et al., 2020; Hendrikx et al., 2022).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is, of course, concern about the sample size in this study. A group of 32 subjects can certainly show associations, but only if they are quite high and potentially subject to bias. This is not meant to say that the results are certainly false, but merely that there is an exploratory aspect to the findings that should be emphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a larger sample size would lend further support to our findings. The long sessions for psychophysical evaluations and MRI would translate into a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. As the Reviewer notes the reported associations are large, particularly between the asynchronies and the AFP maps, that were specific for the auditory condition in a limited range of metronome tempos (650, 750 ms) (Figure 3- supplement 1). Similar results were obtained with the rCCA where all vertices of the AFD matrix and all the behavioral parameters were included. We included the following phrase in the discussion tempering our findings:</p><p>“A potential limitation of our study is the relatively small number of participants relative to the large number of statistical tests performed. To minimize the possibility of statistical errors, we performed a rCCA to jointly model the behavioral and imaging metrics. This provided further support to the importance of superficial cortico-cortical communication through U-fibers and the SCT. While the identified associations are large, and despite our efforts to control for statistical errors, it is inescapable that a sample of 32 subjects with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria may not represent the population. We expect our current findings to be replicated and extended in future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The motivation is a bit awkward and amounts to: &quot;we don't know the role of structural connectivity in rhythmic entrainment; we hypothesize that structural connectivity accounts for individual differences in rhythmic entrainment&quot;.

We eliminated the initial statement and now the hypothesis of the paper reads as follows:</p><p>“We hypothesize that if the cortical connectivity of the audiomotor system is defining rhythmic entrainment abilities, the individual differences in tapping synchronization should covary with the degree of connectivity of fibers running superficially to the cortical surface and the deep tracts of this system (Assaneo et al., 2019; Steele et al., 2013). In addition, we conjecture that the relationship between the rhythmic tapping abilities and the structural connectivity of the audiomotor system should be more evident for intervals close to the preferred tempo, since previous evidence suggest that this system is tuned at a limited interaction rate (Zalta et al., 2018; Morillon, B., Arnal, L. H., Schroeder, C. E. and Keitel, A. Prominence of δ oscillatory rhythms in the motor cortex and their relevance for auditory and speech perception. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 107, 136– 142 (2019)). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should likely read and cite a paper by Zalta, Petkoski, and Morillon (2018) on periodic temporal attention. Here, the authors observed that humans were best at attending to auditory rhythms at a rate of ~1.4Hz, very close to the rate observed in the present study. Moreover, for visual rhythms, the best rate was far slower, at ~0.7Hz. It is possible then that the reason for the lack of effects in the visual condition is that the authors did not test any intervals that were slow enough.</p><p>Zalta, A., Petkoski, S., and Morillon, B. (2020). Natural rhythms of periodic temporal attention. Nature communications, 11(1), 1–12.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions of the excellent paper that is really close to our findings. We rewrote the corresponding paragraph in the introduction as follows:</p><p>“The existence of neural circuits with preferred intervals conforming chronotopic maps goes in line with the human flexibility to tap in phase (with asynchronies close to zero) and high precision to isochronous stimuli with a wide range of interstimulus-onset intervals (ISI), spanning from 400 to 1200 ms (Mates et al., 1994, Repp 2005). Within this window, subjects show a spontaneous rhythmic tempo, which corresponds to the interval produced naturally when asked to tap in the absence of external cues (McAuley et al., 2006; Zamm et al., 2020). This spontaneous or preferred tempo is around 600 to 750 ms in human adults (Fraisse, 1963, 1978, but see Parncutt, 1994), being faster in early childhood and slower in elderly individuals (McAuley et al., 2006). A recent study demonstrated that the attentional capacities of humans to rhythmic stimuli also have a preferred tempo, with an optimal sampling rate of ~1.4 Hz (ISI of 714 ms) in audition and ~0.7 Hz (ISI of 1428 ms) in vision. Furthermore, motor tapping helps to synchronize the temporal fluctuations of attention with maximal effects at ~1.7 Hz (ISI of 588ms) but only to the auditory modality (Zalta et al., 2018). These findings support the notion that attention and beat perception are shaped by ongoing motor activity, which imposes temporal constraints on the sampling of sensory information within a narrow frequency range. Hence, the audiomotor system is built to optimally work at a preferred tempo.”</p><p>Finally, we added this paragraph in the discussion following the referee’s comments:</p><p>“The correlations between the density of tangential U-fibers in the right audiomotor circuit and the asynchronies for the auditory condition were interval selective for the intermediate tested tempos. This interval specificity supports the idea that the spontaneous rhythmic tempo observed in many studies of rhythmic entrainment, and with values between 600 and 750 ms, (Drake et al., 2000a,b; McAuley et al., 2006 Bella, S. D. et al. BAASTA: Battery for the assessment of auditory sensorimotor and timing abilities. Behav. Res. Methods. 1128–1145 https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0773-6 (2017).) (see Figure 2D) has its biological origins in the structural properties of the U-fibers running superficially across the audiomotor circuit. Interestingly, Zalta, et al., (2018) showed that humans were best at attending to auditory rhythms at a rate of ~1.4Hz and that overt motor activity optimizes auditory periodic temporal attention at that same rate. This rate is very close to the intervals with structural associations in the present study. Consequently, we suggest that the cortico-cortical connectivity within the audiomotor system is specially designed to support the internal representation of an auditory pulse at the preferred tempo, providing larger predictive abilities across subjects for the spontaneous motor tempi (Balasubramaniam et al., 2021). On the other hand, Zalta, et al., (2018) also demonstrated that for visual rhythms the best rate was far slower, at ~0.7Hz. Therefore, it is possible that we did not get effects in the visual condition because that we did not test target intervals that were slow enough for this modality, our largest target interval was 950 ms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How was the feedback conveyed? The methods state they are the mean asynchrony, but was this an offset value? A proportion? Did subjects know if they were tapping too fast or too slow?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the legend of Figure 1 the mean produced and the target interval were displayed at the end of each trial as feedback. Hence, the subjects could know whether their produced intervals were on average shorter or longer than the target interval. We changed the corresponding section in the Methods, since it incorrectly stated that the feedback and the criterion for rejecting incorrect trials was based on the asynchronies. Now the paragraph read as follows:</p><p>“A trial was considered correct if, for every interval, the absolute difference between the produced and the target interval was below 30% of the target interval during the synchronization and below 40% during the continuation epoch.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is some concern regarding the latencies for which the tapping information is collected. If the monitor was running at 60Hz, is this the same sample rate for the taps? In this case, there might be a concern that the measures being collected are not sufficiently precise to reveal individual differences, which may explain why there were so few correlations except for asynchrony.</p></disp-quote><p>The touch screen was sampled every 1 ms. Hence, we had enough resolution to capture individual differences across all our behavioral parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What if subjects tapped the monitor but missed the target? Was the tap not collected? Did all subjects remain within the target?</p></disp-quote><p>Only correct trials were analyzed. A trial was considered correct if, for every interval, the absolute difference between the produced and the target interval was below 30% of the target interval during the synchronization and below 40% during the continuation epoch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More detail about the FWE correction is needed. Was this at the cluster level? Voxel level? The text describes &quot;FWE &lt;0.0.001&quot; and &quot;Cluster&lt;0.001&quot;, so what does this mean, precisely? Also, the methods state at one point that a &quot;permutation test&quot; was done, then at another point state random field theory</p></disp-quote><p>Correction for multiple comparisons of surface-based analyses was performed with random field theory (RFT). This approach was chosen because data projected on a two-dimensional manifold such as the cortical surface can be spatially smoothed without cross-contamination between adjacent gyri, and therefore lends itself to cluster-wise statistical inference. The vertex-wise cluster forming threshold was p&lt;0.001 (a value recognized to reduce falta associations; Elund PNAS 2016), and a cluster was deemed significant if it had a pcluster&lt;0.001 after RFT. On the other hand, deep white matter was evaluated through fixel-based analysis (FBA) through the tools available in mrtrix 3.0, which includes FWE through permutation testing with connectivity-based fixel enhancement, as described by Raffelt (2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For the continuation phase of the task, did the authors consider decomposing the inter–tap–interval variance using the Wing and Kristofferson (1973) model? This would provide measures of putative &quot;central&quot; and &quot;motor&quot; variance. Given that multiple intervals were tested, the authors should observe that central variance grows with the interval, whereas motor variance remains flat. Further, one might expect motor variance to relate more to connections within motor regions, whereas central variance could relate to audiomotor connections.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the number of produced intervals in the continuation phase is six, which is too small to generate stable estimates of the central and motor variance using the Wing and Kristofferson (1973) model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For continuation performance, a commonly observed phenomenon is &quot;drift&quot; in which subjects continuously speed up or slow down their responses. Was this observed at all? A typical method for drift correction is to detrend the time series with a first–order polynomial and use the residuals for calculating measures of variance (Vorberg and Wing, 1996). Was this examined at all?</p></disp-quote><p>The drift that we obtained in the continuation phase was small, due to the small number of produced intervals in the epoch of the task. The detrended data showed very similar effects on modality and target duration and are not reported in the paper.</p><p>Supplementary figure 11 shows that around 20% of trials showed positive lag 1 autocorrelations across interval duration and modality conditions. As suggested by the reviewer our data show some violations to the error correction notion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another prediction of the W–K model is the negative lag 1 autocorrelation which the authors examine here. Yet, violations of this commonly do occur. Were there violations (i.e. trials) where subjects did not show negative autocorrelations?</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The selection of interval ranges needs further justification–why did the researchers choose these particular interval lengths, and did they predict differences between them? The preferred tempo range includes the 650 ms interval, as they note, but most authors would suggest that the 550 ms interval rate would be in this range for many people as well, as preferred beat rates tend to span 300–900 ms (Parncutt, 1994). Thus, was the range of intervals selected to provide evidence of structural chronomaps in the brain, or did the researchers expect to see behavioural differences across the intervals (that may be related to structural brain measures) that they felt would be meaningful (being more or less related to optimal tapping rates), and therefore they used a range of intervals to assess this?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Therefore, in the introduction we added first this paragraph:</p><p>“The existence of neural circuits with preferred intervals conforming chronotopic maps goes in line with the human flexibility to tap in phase (small asynchronies) and high precision to isochronous stimuli with a wide range of inter-stimulus onset intervals (ISI), spanning from 400 to 1200 ms (Mates et al., 1994, Repp 2005).

Rev. 107, 136– 142 (2019)).</p><p>Finally, we added the sentence in the last paragraph of the introduction:</p><p>“We used an ISI range of 550-950 ms since it contains the preferred interval and is within the optimal window for tap synchronization (Repp 2005). Hence, with this ISI range we could potentially identify structural correlates for both the preferred tempo and interval selectivity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are 2 modalities and 5 different interval lengths, all of which appear to be analyzed independently in the brain data. The MRI methods contain very little information about multiple comparisons correction related to the number of different tests that are performed–this needs much clearer explication.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point, which was also raised by Reviewer 1. To minimize the possibility of false positive findings, we performed a rCCA analysis to jointly model the behavioral metrics on one hand, and AFD metrics of all vertices throughout the surface, on the other. Further details are provided in the response to the first point by Reviewer 1, and this new analysis is described in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unsigned (absolute) asynchrony is not generally used as a measure of 'prediction'–in fact, you explicitly cannot tell if the greater asynchrony is in advance of or after the intended target, therefore it specifically obscures predictive vs. reactive taps. Usually, asynchrony is given as a measure of phase accuracy, especially when unsigned. If the authors want to make conclusions about predictive ability specifically, they should report unsigned asynchronies. This leads to my next point.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the excellent comments of the reviewer we adopted a phase/period framework for the analysis and interpretation of the behavioral parameters of the SCT task. We performed the correlations between the signed asynchronies and the superficial and white matter maps, with very limited effects. Therefore, we dropped the framework of prediction abilities and replaced it with the notion of phase accuracy, as suggested by the referee in the next comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the 4 dependent behavioural variables would benefit from relating to a phase/period framework. Asynchronies index phase accuracy (but of course tend to relate to overall period accuracy, as tapping at an incorrect period would likely lead to being out of phase, but tapping at an incorrect phase does not necessarily lead to tapping at the incorrect period). The 'constant error' measures appear to be a measure of period accuracy that is relatively agnostic to phase, and the standard deviation is measured on reproduced intervals only, therefore also only seems to be a measure of period variability, agnostic to phase.</p></disp-quote><p>Now the paper uses a phase/period framework, where the asynchronies are an index phase accuracy, the constant error is a measure of period accuracy, and the temporal variability is a measure of period variability.</p><p>In the introduction we describe this framework as follows:</p><p>“SCT rhythmic performance across durations (ISI: 550,650,750,850 or 950 ms) and modalities (auditory and visual) was characterized using the absolute asynchronies, the autocorrelation of the inter-tap interval time series during the synchronization epoch, the constant error, and the temporal variability during both synchronization and continuation epochs. These parameters measure the phase accuracy, error correction, period accuracy, and period precision of the rhythmic tapping of the subjects, respectively (Figure 2A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, perhaps that could be part of the reason you only see relationships with asynchrony (i.e., that the precision of the alignment between taps and stimuli is what the auditory–motor system is judging, but this same precision relative to an internal clock which is more what your period measures are) is not supported by the same system? And that relationship is not embodied in visual–motor synchronization (perhaps because our visual system timing for punctate events is generally poor)? In any case, I think phase/period distinctions would make your measures easier to relate to existing literature (which does often distinguish between phase and period) and also may provide some explanation for the lack of relationship to the brain data for some measures but not others.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and adopted the phase and period framework throughout the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
