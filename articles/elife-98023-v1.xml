etiology of the underlying liver disease. Current efforts to unravel etiology-specific mechanisms and pharmacological targets rely on several models of experimental fibrosis. Here, we characterize and compare dynamics of hepatic proteome remodeling during fibrosis development and spontaneous healing in experimental mouse models of hepatotoxic (carbon tetrachloride [CCl<sub>4</sub>] intoxication) and cholestatic (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine [DDC] feeding) injury. Using detergent-based tissue extraction and mass spectrometry, we identified compartment-specific changes in the liver proteome with detailed attention to ECM composition and changes in protein solubility. Our analysis revealed distinct time-resolved CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC signatures, with identified signaling pathways suggesting limited healing and a potential for carcinogenesis associated with cholestasis. Correlation of protein abundance profiles with fibrous deposits revealed extracellular chaperone clusterin with implicated role in fibrosis resolution. Dynamics of clusterin expression was validated in the context of human liver fibrosis. Atomic force microscopy of fibrotic livers complemented proteomics with profiles of disease-associated changes in local liver tissue mechanics. This study determined compartment-specific proteomic landscapes of liver fibrosis and delineated etiology-specific ECM components, providing thus a foundation for future antifibrotic therapies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alcoholism or chronic conditions like hepatitis damage the liver. Over time, scar tissue builds up in the liver, causing cirrhosis. The scaring results from the liverâs repeated attempts to repair itself by creating more structural proteins called extracellular matrix proteins. A buildup of these scaffolding proteins leads to tissue stiffening or fibrosis. Fibrosis may heal in some cases but in others, it may progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure.</p><p>Learning more about these processes may help scientists and clinicians understand why fibrosis is reversible in some cases but not others. It may also allow them to develop treatments that can treat or reverse fibrosis and prevent cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver failure. The first step is studying how fibrosis occurs in mouse models that mimic different types of liver disease. For example, repetitive ingestion of a toxic substance, such as alcohol, can cause one type of liver disease. However, slowing or stalling bile flow through the biliary system (the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts), leads to a different type of chronic liver injury.</p><p>Jirouskova et al. identify an extracellular protein called clusterin that may help heal fibrosis. The experiments used mouse models of two different types of liver disease. One mimicked liver disease caused by repetitive toxin injury, and the other modelled liver disease caused by chronic stalling of the bile flow in the liver (cholestasis). In the experiments, Jirouskova et al. looked at all the proteins made in each type of liver disease as the animals developed fibrosis or their fibrosis resolved. They also studied extracellular matrix proteins and how they affected molecular signaling in the liver tissue. The experiments revealed different patterns of protein production and healing in the different types of liver disease. The animals with liver diseases caused by chronic cholestatic injury were less likely to heal their livers and showed potential to progress to liver cancer. Production of the clusterin protein was connected with better liver recovery from toxic injuries.</p><p>Jirouskova et al. provide a comprehensive map of all the proteins produced over the course of liver fibrosis progression and healing in two different animal models of liver disease. Scientists and clinicians may use this information to study liver disease types. It may also one day help them personalize patient's therapies. The experiments show that extracellular matrix proteins are essential contributors to fibrosis and key signaling agents in liver disease. This may make them good targets for new therapies. Boosting clusterin production may be one approach to promoting liver recovery. More studies are needed to confirm this before such therapies can be developed and tested in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mass

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Liver fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis, two leading causes of liver disease-related deaths worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karlsen et al., 2022</xref>), develop as a result of chronic liver injury of multiple etiologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kisseleva and Brenner, 2021</xref>). Fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins forming fibrous scar tissue. In the liver, such pathological matrix is deposited by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and/or portal fibroblasts (PFs) in response to the inflammatory reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kisseleva and Brenner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>). Recent multi-omics studies have framed fibrosis as a dynamic multicellular process associated with the remodeling of gene expression landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>) and profound changes in liver protein abundance as well as composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klaas et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Hepatocellular injury alters parenchymal mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Georges et al., 2007</xref>), thus further facilitating activation of resident HSCs and PFs and their differentiation into myofibroblasts depositing collagen-rich ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olsen et al., 2011</xref>). Accumulation of abnormal ECM further promotes ECM-depositing myofibroblasts and fosters progressive whole-organ stiffening as a result of ongoing fibrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saneyasu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, ECM-associated changes are increasingly perceived as causative, rather than consequential, and multiple efforts have focused on the identification of extracellular niche components that drive the pathogenesis of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schiller et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ECM is a complex network of hundreds of proteins acting as a three-dimensional scaffold, supporting cells mechanically and functioning as a reservoir for secreted factors (e.g. growth factors and cytokines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hynes, 2009</xref>). This so-called âmatrisomeâ consists of âcore matrisomeâ (the structural components of the ECM, i.e. collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans) and âmatrix-associated matrisomeâ (the ECM-interacting proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Naba et al., 2012</xref>). Transitions of extracellular factors between the insoluble matrisome and the soluble pools modulate their signaling capabilities and bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schiller et al., 2015</xref>). As fibrous ECM assemblies also determine tissue mechanics, matrisome constituents provide matrix-embedded cells with spatially distinct biochemical and biomechanical context.</p><p>In terms of etiology, chronic liver injury is inflicted either by hepatotoxic or by cholestatic insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kisseleva and Brenner, 2021</xref>). In recent decades, several corresponding animal models of liver fibrosis have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Despite several translational limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trautwein et al., 2015</xref>), these experimental models mimic fundamental aspects of human liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, frequently used iterative carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) intoxication causes hepatocellular damage, HSC activation, and development of pericentral liver fibrosis that evolves into severe bridging fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding induces obstructive cholestasis, characterized by expansion of PFs and consecutive periportal fibrosis with typical portal-portal septa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fickert et al., 2007</xref>). As both human and animal studies have shown that liver fibrosis can be ameliorated by either targeting progression or promoting resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trautwein et al., 2015</xref>), experimental models have become instrumental for identifying factors and mechanisms central to blocking fibrosis progression and promoting the reversal of advanced fibrosis.</p><p>In this comparative study, we employed CCl<sub>4</sub>- and DDC-based mouse models to describe proteomic changes during liver injury, fibrosis development, and repair while focusing on matrisome remodeling and associated alterations in tissue biomechanics. Our in-depth analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) data obtained from total liver lysates and ECM-enriched insoluble fractions defines compartment- and time-resolved proteomic signatures in hepatotoxin- vs. cholestasis-induced fibrosis and healing and delineates disease-specific matrisome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proteomic analysis outlines the gradual fibrosis development and partial healing in both CCl<sub>4</sub>- and DDC-induced liver injury</title><p>To compare time-resolved, compartment-specific proteomes of CCl<sub>4</sub>- and DDC-induced models of liver fibrosis, total liver lysates (Total) together with two protein fractions obtained by one-step detergent extraction (ECM-enriched insoluble fraction [E-fraction] and soluble fraction [S-fraction]) were prepared for MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The gradual fibrogenesis was assessed at two time points (T1 and T2) corresponding to mild fibrosis with partially bridging septa (T1, 3 weeks for CCl<sub>4</sub> and 2 weeks for DDC treatment) and advanced fibrosis (T2, 6 weeks for CCl<sub>4</sub> and 4 weeks for DDC). To characterize the dynamics of spontaneous fibrosis resolution, we allowed the mice 5 (T3) or 10 days (T4) to recover.

Subsequent IF analysis showed localization of antibodies to Î±v mostly to periportal hepatocytes and with little signal found in central hepatocytes of control livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). During CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced injury, Î±v staining was enhanced at the periphery of pericentral hepatocytes adjacent to the collagen-rich scars, reflecting ongoing liver periportalization with the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghallab et al., 2019</xref>). The zonal distribution of Î±v was partially restored with fibrosis regression. In DDC-driven cholestasis, antibodies to Î±v stained strongly with reactive biliary epithelial cells (BECs), the main drivers of fibrogenesis in biliary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, our analysis reveals stage-specific induction of integrin Î±v on the surface of pericentral hepatocytes that has been unrecognized to date and suggests its potential as a marker of reactive BECs in cholestasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Analysis of solubility profile dynamics of liver proteome reveals extracellular matrix protein-1 among matrisome proteins induced by fibrogenesis</title><p>As ECM remodeling during fibrogenesis also entails changes in the solubility of its constituents and associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schiller et al., 2015</xref>), we next set out to identify proteins that become increasingly insoluble with fibrosis progression.

These models are widely used to reliably mimic either hepatotoxic (CCl<sub>4</sub>) or cholestatic (DDC) liver injuries leading to fibrosis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).

To fill this research gap, we employed detergent-based tissue extraction and analyzed both Total and insoluble fraction proteomes at multiple time points of disease progression and spontaneous healing. This approach allowed us to (1) compare time-resolved, compartment-specific proteomes of CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC models, (2) define etiology-specific elements of fibrogenesis, and (3) detect even low-abundance matrisome and matrisome-interacting proteins in the ECM-enriched insoluble fraction samples. Further, our detailed AFM-based profiling of CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated livers enabled us to relate our proteomic data to disease-associated changes in the local mechanics of liver tissue.</p><p>We and others have demonstrated that the nature of liver injury determines the set of components assembled in diseased ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klaas et al., 2016</xref>), which thus reflects unique features of the injury. For instance, the initial decline in abundance of hepatocyte- and activated BEC-expressed collagen type XVIII Î±-1 chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schuppan et al., 1998</xref>) and its consecutive increase thereafter in the hepatotoxic CCl<sub>4</sub> model corresponds to hepatocyte death followed by expansion of both collagen type XVIII Î±-1 chain-expressing cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manco et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, extensive collagen type XVIII Î±-1 chain expression in DDC-induced cholestasis was already apparent in the early fibrotic deposits due to a massive ductular reaction. A prominent group of BM-associated proteins uniquely identified in the cholestatic model can be attributed to activated BECs in proliferating bile ducts. Some of them (e.g. collagen type XVIII Î±-1 chain, collagen type IV and VI Î±-2 chains, and perlecan) are among the 14-gene signature potently predicting human patient cirrhosis progression and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Other DDC matrisome constituents (e.g. collagen type III Î±-1 chain, elastin, and laminin subunit gamma 1) have been recently linked to the deterioration of hepatocyte functions in connection with ECM stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acun et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, elastin is present in liver biopsies from patients with advanced fibrosis and adverse clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kendall et al., 2018</xref>) and is associated with the irreversibility of liver fibrosis. Further, the increased incorporation of cross-linking protein LOXL1 and TGFÎ²1-related protein LTBP4 into DDC-specific ECM underscores its resemblance to human cirrhotic liver ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mazza et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, our findings indicate that cholestasis-driven ECM deposits contain numerous proteins detected in more advanced stages of liver disease favoring hepatocarcinogenesis with a compromised ability to heal. Moreover, identified cholestasis-induced unique signaling pathways were analogous to those recently identified in a subtype of mouse cancer models mimicking human cholangiocarcinoma-like hepatocellular cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our observations are concordant with recently published studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kisseleva and Brenner, 2021</xref>) revealing that in the fibrotic liver resident and nonresident cell types wire into dynamic intercellular hubs with shifting cell populations, reflecting and shaping the disease course in an etiology-specific manner. Many of the feedback mechanisms between the cells and ECM regulating fibrosis are mediated by members of the integrin family. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nejjari et al., 2001</xref>), we observed in both models significant upregulation of all detected integrin subunits during fibrosis progression. Strong induction of integrin Î±M expression in cholestatic but not hepatotoxic injury documents the role of leukocyte-specific integrin Î±MÎ²2 in the modulation of biliary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the integrin Î±M might thus serve as a possible selective target for treatment of cholestatic liver disease. Further, a prominent transition of TGFÎ²1-activating integrin Î±v toward insoluble ECM exclusively upon hepatotoxic injury was accompanied by its localization to injured pericentral hepatocytes near collagen-rich scars and Î±SMA-positive HSCs. This finding, together with a measured increase in the stiffness of injured hepatocytes, implies an active role of integrin Î±v in the targeted activation of TGFÎ²1 in the local microenvironment during centrilobular fibrosis. Indeed, integrin Î±v located on hepatocytes in the vicinity of biliary fibrotic septa has been suggested to indicate hepatocyte biliary transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Popov et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we propose that compartment-specific induction of Î±v expression on the surface of scar-associated hepatocytes could be a general mechanism to promote fibrosis progression.</p><p>In contrast to the cholestatic DDC model, hepatotoxic injury in the CCl<sub>4</sub> model showed a substantial ability to heal 10 days after challenge withdrawal. Such healing capacity allowed us to correlate the dynamics in CCl<sub>4</sub> proteomes with the changes in fibrotic deposits not only during fibrosis progression but also in resolution. Among proteins correlating with scar tissue formation in both Total and insoluble proteomes, we identified a small molecular chaperone clusterin. Clusterin is believed to be associated with elastin fibers in cholestasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigelsreiter et al., 2009</xref>), and recently it was linked to the attenuation of mouse hepatic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seo et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we localized clusterin exclusively to injured, pathologically stiffer hepatocytes. Interestingly, the clusterin promoter comprises binding motifs for mechanosensitive transcription factors such as c-Fos and AP-1/Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin and Howe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyamoto-Sato et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that local clusterin induction can reflect the dynamic changes of microenvironmental mechanical cues. Most intriguingly, we also found clusterin to associate with collagen-rich ECM deposits in the course of mouse fibrosis regression and with pathological human matrix of various etiologies. As clusterin overexpression associates with increased activity of ECM-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shim et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesize that clusterin accumulation facilitates the remodeling and resolution of scar tissue. Although the specific molecular function of clusterin in fibrotic tissue repair processes remains to be determined, our results strongly suggest clusterin to be an attractive antifibrotic target.</p><p>Liver cell and tissue mechanics play a pivotal role in the processes that initiate and resolve fibrotic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>). Initial disruption of mechanical homeostasis prompts cytoskeletal remodeling that alters cell-generated forces and cellular biomechanics. Here, such a shift to a higher stiffness regime is illustrated by prominent changes in cytoskeleton-related signatures (actin and intermediate filaments) and signatures of mechanosensitive transcription regulators (e.g., MRTF) accompanied by a significant stiffening of parenchymal compartments devoid of apparent collagen deposits. This indicates substantial cell-driven changes in the biomechanical properties of tissue microenvironment. An unexpected decrease in the stiffness of interface hepatocytes with the initial fibrotic changes revealed by our AFM analysis suggests that the initial softening of interface hepatocytes upon injury counterbalances the stiffening of the injured hepatocytes and/or fibrous scar tissue regions. As the interface hepatocytes have been shown to undergo a phenotypic shift in response to the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Moshe et al., 2022</xref>), it will now be interesting to determine whether altered mechanical properties serve as the cue leading to the genetic fetal reprogramming or if this initial softening is due to the expression of fetal markers. Together, our AFM and proteomic data underscore the role of local tissue stiffening in fibrotic response and postulate involvement of tissue softening during resolution not only in the collagen scar tissue but also in regenerating parenchyma.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Proteins significantly differentially expressed in the Total proteome of each fibrosis model separately (analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) were defined as proteins with a minimum 1.5-fold significant change in expression in the highest fibrosis time point (T2) over the average expression in controls (t-test at a BH FDR&lt;0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses of averages of z-scored MS intensities of identified proteins were performed with Euclidean distance and complete linkage in the Perseus software with built-in cluster enrichment analysis. To extract individual cell-type dynamics from the proteomics data, we used previously published cell-type-specific signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azimifar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jojic et al., 2013</xref>). For each of this way identified proteins, average z-scored MS intensity in each time point was calculated and the signature proteins of each cell type were together plotted in each time point as box plots, with 25th and 75th percentile indicated as explained below.</p><p>All graphs and statistical tests indicated in graphs were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/">https://www.graphpad.com/</ext-link>). All results are presented as mean Â± SEM. In the box plots, the box represents the 25th and 75th percentile with the median indicated; whiskers reach the last data point; dots indicate means of independent experiments. Normally distributed parametrical data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Studentâs t-test. A comparison between multiple groups was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple comparison test. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Statistical tests used are specified in the figure legends. Statistical significance was determined at the level of *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; <sup>â </sup>, p&lt;0.001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>E-fraction analysis</title><p>Proteins identified in E-fraction samples were first filtered and imputed as described above for each model separately. All proteins detected in S-fraction were also imputed in Perseus as described above and median S-fraction MS intensity value for each protein was calculated. To identify proteins with change in solubility, which would be specifically enriched in E-fraction, we calculated a ratio of the MS intensity of each protein replicate in E-fraction to the median of MS intensity of this protein in S-fraction and selected those with a minimum threefold higher expression in E- than S-fraction in at least one time point (control, T1-T4). From these, proteins with a significant change in time identified by ANOVA with BH FDR&lt;0.05 represented insoluble fraction proteins, i.e., E-fraction proteome. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of MS intensity ratios of the abundance of these proteins in E- to S-fraction was performed in Perseus as described above to identify changes in protein solubility over time with disease progression and recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis</title><p>We used the IPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">KrÃ¤mer et al., 2014</xref>) to identify predicted upstream transcriptional regulators and growth factors and downstream canonical signaling pathways elicited by groups of proteins identified in individual analyses. Transcriptional regulators and growth factors were identified in upstream regulator analysis with protein overlap p-value&gt;3 (log 10) and activation z-score&gt;|2.5|. Canonical pathways were considered only with overlap p-value&gt;3 (log 10) and activation z-score&gt;|2|.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Correlation analysis</title><p>The MS protein temporal abundance change profile of each protein was correlated with the fibrosis area change for proteins of Total proteome and E-fraction proteome in each model. To do this, we calculated the mean value of log 2-transformed and imputed MS intensities for each protein in controls and subtracted it from the log 2-transformed MS intensity for each protein at each time point in individual mice. This way obtained temporal abundance profile ratio of each protein was then correlated to the temporal profile of fibrosis area (calculated as a percentage of sirius red positive areas in each mouse at each time point after subtracting the background calculated as the average sirius red positive area in control livers) using Pearson correlation coefficient separately for each model. We then plotted the correlation linear regression slope against the Pearson correlation coefficient in each of the proteomes for each of the identified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâD</xref>). The significance of dependency (slopeâs p-value) for each protein was corrected by BH multiple comparisons test (p = 0.05). Analysis of DDC-induced differentially expressed proteins did not result in any proteins significantly correlating with collagen deposition in either of the proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This is most likely a consequence of considerable variability in the scar tissue deposition in this model at each time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Atomic force microscopy</title><p>AFM was performed on 30-Î¼m-thick liver sections shortly fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ojha et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, glass slides containing fixed liver sections covered with PBS were placed onto a combined AFM/inverted optical microscope (JPK NanoWizard 3XP; Bruker Nano Nano Surfaces Division, Santa Barbara, CA, USA/Olympus IX81; Olympus C&amp;S, Prague, Czech Republic) equipped with a custom-made dual-polarization motorized filter allowing precise localization areas of interest: collagen-rich fibrotic areas, areas of injured, and interface hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Moshe et al., 2022</xref>). To characterize the mechanical properties of livers, we used an SD-qp-BioT-TL-10 cantilever (S/N-73750F05, Nanosensors, NanoAndMore GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) with a nominal sprint constant of 0.09 N/m modified with a 5.7 Î¼m melamine polymer bead (Microparticles GmbH, Germany). Before each experiment, the cantilever spring constant was calibrated using the thermal noise method while immersed in PBS. Using the force mapping method, we measured 30 Ã100 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> (10 Ã 36 pixels) defined areas precisely located by polarized microscopy. We analyzed seven areas (measured from two sections per mouse) obtained from three different mice for each time point (control, T1, T2, and T4). Data were further processed with open-source software âAtomicJâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermanowicz et al., 2014</xref>) using a Poisson ratio of 0.45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>). All data were further analyzed in GraphPad Prism software and are presented as frequency distribution histograms. Statistical analyses were performed on frequency distribution histograms using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunnâs multiple comparisons post-testing. To correlate the AFM data with protein MS abundance change during fibrosis development and resolution, we averaged median Youngâs moduli for each analyzed area in each measured mouse. After subtraction of mean control Youngâs moduli, the slope and p-value for the dependency of the stiffness of the area on the protein MS intensities were determined, and the p-value was corrected by BH multiple comparisons test (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Visualization, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The use of completely anonymized archived liver tissue samples for research purposes has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine and Thomayer University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.

They focussed on both the insoluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components as well as the soluble secreted factors produced by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and/or portal fibroblasts (PFs). They identified compartment- and time-resolved proteomic signatures in the two models with disease-specific factors or matrisomes. Their study also identified phenotypic differences between the models such as that while the CCl4-induced model induced profound hepatotoxicity followed by resolution, the DDC model induced more lasting liver damage and proteomic changes that resembled advanced human liver fibrosis favouring hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><p>Overall, this comprehensive and very well conducted study is rigorous and well planned. The conclusions are supported by compelling studies and analyses. One caveat is the lack of mechanistic experiments to prove causality, but this can be carried out in follow-up studies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>â¢ A major strength in the study is that the experiments are rigorous and very well conducted. For instance, the authors utilized two models of liver fibrosis to study different aspects of the pathology - hepatotoxicity vs cholestasis. In addition, 4 time points for each model were investigated - 2 for fibrosis development and 2 for fibrosis resolution. They have taken 3 components for proteomic analyses - total lysates, insoluble ECM components as well as the soluble secreted factors. Thus, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the fibrosis and resolution process in these models.</p><p>â¢ Another great strength of the study is that the methodology utilized was able to dissect unique pathways relevant for each model as well as common targets. For example, the authors identified known pathways such as mTOR signalling to be differentially regulated in the CCl4 vs DDC model. mTOR signalling was increased in the DDC model that is associated with hyperproliferation. Thus showing that the approach taken is specific enough to distinguish between the two similar (both induce fibrosis) but distinct mechanisms (hepatotoxicity vs cholestasis) is a strong point of the study.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>â¢ A caveat of the study is that the authors have not conducted mechanistic (gain of function/loss of function) studies from any of their identified targets to truly prove causality. This remains one of the limitations of this study. Thus, future studies should investigate this point in detail. For instance, it would have been intriguing to dissect if knocking out specific genes involved in one specific model or genes common to both would yield distinct phenotypic outcomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98023.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors suggest that ECM abundance and composition change depending on the aetiology of liver fibrosis.

This remains one of the limitations of this study. Thus, future studies should investigate this point in detail. For instance, it would have been intriguing to dissect if knocking out specific genes involved in one specific model or genes common to both would yield distinct phenotypic outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our study does not provide mechanistic verification of the function of identified targets with suggested role in the development and/or resolution of fibrosis. The current study was primarily conducted in order to identify these possible targets with focus on the identification of differences in extracellular matrix deposited in two selected models of liver fibrosis with different modes of action. To conduct further studies using knock-out/in models for verification of causality of proposed targets was at this point well beyond our intention. However, we are fully aware of the potential of identified molecules and further studies to disect their roles in liver diseases are part of future plans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The majority of the conclusions are derived primarily from the proteomic analyses.

The manuscript overall would benefit from some mechanistic functional insight to provide new additional modes of action relevant to fibrosis progression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our study could initially appear descriptive. However, this characteristics is inherent to most omics studies, which tend to provide hypothesis-free testing of a large number of analytes in order to find a multitude of candidate biomarkers(1). Importantly, we believe our study provides insights that go beyond the scope of previously published transcriptomic analyses.</p><p>Specifically, our work focuses on compartment-specific changes in the liver proteome, with an emphasis on the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and alterations in protein solubilityâfeatures that cannot be captured by transcriptomic studies. The matrisome is more than a structural scaffold; it functions as a reservoir for secreted factors, including growth factors and cytokines, which modulate the local cellular microenvironment. Transition dynamics between the insoluble matrisome and soluble protein pools influence the signaling capabilities and bioavailability of these factors. Moreover, fibrous ECM assemblies directly impact tissue mechanics, providing cells embedded within the matrix with spatially distinct biochemical and biomechanical contexts. The current understanding of matrisome composition in the context of specific liver disease etiologies is limited. Dr. Friedman, in his 2022 review on hepatic fibrosis, highlights the unmet need to elucidate etiology-specific protein signatures of the cirrhotic liver matrisome, which could serve as disease staging or prognostic biomarkers(2). Our study addresses this gap by characterizing the distinct matrisome profiles associated with hepatotoxic- versus cholestasis-driven liver injury. We believe our findings lay the groundwork for identifying etiology-specific biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for antifibrotic interventions, offering a novel layer of insight beyond what transcriptomic data alone can provide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Whilst there is some human data presented it is a minimal analysis without quantification that would imply relevance to disease state. Although studying disease progression in animals is a fundamental aspect of understanding the full physiological response of fibrotic disease, without more human insight makes any analysis difficult to fulfil their suggestion that these targets identified will be of use to treat human disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Our study primarily focuses on utilizing animal models to explore the fundamental physiological processes underlying the development and resolution of fibrotic liver disease. To address the translational relevance of our findings, we concentrated on clusterin, one of the key target proteins identified during our analysis of the insoluble proteome. Specifically, we investigated its localization in human liver samples, focusing on its association with collagen deposits (Figure 6F). To this end, we analyzed human liver samples of diverse etiologies and varying degrees of fibrotic damage, including samples representing four distinct stages of HCV-induced fibrosis (Figure 6F, lower panel). While this analysis highlights the presence and localization of clusterin in fibrotic deposits, we acknowledge that our study does not include extensive quantification or mechanistic insight into clusterin's role in human liver fibrosis. We believe that the data presented in this manuscript provide a valuable foundation for future investigations into clusterinâs involvement in liver fibrosis across different etiologies. Recognizing the translational importance of this work, we have already initiated a prospective study involving human patients, which aims to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of clusterin's function and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p><p>To further support our findings on clusterin's role in fibrosis development and resolution and to address the reviewer's concern, we quantified clusterin deposits in the available human samples representing four distinct stages of HCV-induced fibrotic disease. Using immunofluorescence (IF) images at a 20x field of view, we measured both clusterin and collagen deposits to illustrate changes in clusterin abundance during fibrosis progression (stages F1âF4) in relation to collagen deposition dynamics. The quantified data have been included for the reviewer's consideration (Figure 1). However, it is important to emphasize that this quantification was conducted on a single human sample per fibrotic stage, which limits the statistical robustness of the analysis. A more comprehensive evaluation involving additional patient samples would be necessary for a more definitive conclusion. For this reason, we propose to include these results solely in our rebuttal letter and to incorporate a more extensive analysis in our intended follow-up study, where larger cohorts will allow for a thorough investigation of clusterin's role in human liver fibrosis.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of clusterin abundance with the development of HCV-induced fibrotic disease in comparison to the changes in collagen deposits.</title><p>IF images of human liver sections from different stages of chronic HCV infection were immunolabeled for clusterin and collagen 1.

For example - both models are toxin-induced and I do not think these data have any support that the DDC model has a higher carcinogenic risk. An investigation into the tumour-induced risk would require significant additional models. These types of statements are incorrect and not supported by this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for drawing our attention to the incorrect use of the term &quot;toxin-induced&quot;. In two instances, where the wording was incorrect, we have corrected the term to hepatotoxin-induced as it was originally intended. While we believe that our proteomic signature data and identified signaling pathways suggest a potential carcinogenic risk associated with the cholestatic, but not the hepatotoxic model, we have toned down the statements on this issue in the article to respect the reviewer's perspective. These changes, which are highlighted in the track changes mode of the article, aim to make the conclusions of the study more precise and thus improve the clarity of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) In the Discussion, the authors could consider pointing out that one limitation of the study is a lack of mechanistic (gain of function/loss of function) studies either in vitro or in vivo from any of their identified targets to truly prove causality.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted earlier, we fully agree with both reviewers that a limitation of this study is its descriptive nature, which is an inherent characteristic of omics-based research. In our manuscript, we aimed to &quot;determine compartment-specific proteomic landscapes of liver fibrosis and delineate etiology-specific ECM components,&quot; with the overarching goal of providing a foundation for future antifibrotic therapies.</p><p>The insights gained from our study will indeed serve as a critical basis for subsequent research, where we will prioritize mechanistic investigations to elucidate the roles of the identified targets. While we acknowledge the importance of gain- or loss-of-function studies to establish causality, we believe this falls outside the primary scope of the current manuscript. Instead, we envision these mechanistic approaches as key elements of our future research efforts. For this reason, we feel it is not necessary to further expand on this limitation in the current discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The majority of the conclusions are derived primarily from the proteomic analyses. Although well conducted, it would strengthen the study to corroborate some of the major findings by other means such as IHC/IF with the corresponding quantifications and not only representative images. For example, the IF stainings for ECM1 should also be quantified - ECM1.</p></disp-quote><p>To strengthen our MS findings on ECM1 expression and to address the reviewer's concern, we have now included quantification of ECM1 using IF staining at selected time points in Figure S7E and we refer to these data in the Results section (p. 12 of the current manuscript). The IF quantification data correspond well to the MS data showing increase in ECM1 expression with fibrosis development and decline with partial fibrosis resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) S1 - it would be important to show Sirius Red images over the time course, especially for CCl4 T4 where fibrosis resolution is occurring. Proteomics data also show this group clusters more closely with control mice and seeing a representative image would add further credibility to this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Requsted Sirius Red images are now part of the Figure S1B, documenting partial fibrosis resolution and overall parenchyma healing in T4 in both models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) How comparable are the periods of the two models? 2 weeks in one model may not be the same as 2 weeks in the other depending on the severity of the pathogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment regarding the comparability of time points between the two models. Indeed, the temporal dynamics of fibrosis development differ between the models employed in our study, and we have carefully considered this aspect to ensure the validity of our comparative analysis. To address this, we started our comparisons at a stage corresponding to the onset of fibrosis in each model. Specifically, quantification of Sirius Red-positive areas, indicative of collagen deposition (Figure S1B), revealed that 2 weeks of DDC treatment produced a comparable extent of fibrosis to that observed after 3 weeks of CClâ treatment. This point was designated as the initial fibrosis time point (T1, Figure S1B), from which further treatment was applied to induce more advanced fibrosis. This approach allowed us to standardize the comparison of fibrosis progression between the two models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 4A-D - cell-type-specific signatures should be corroborated by actual IHC or IF stainings if possible.

To strengthen our analysis, we have now complemented the box plots of cell type-specific signatures derived from the MS data (Figure 4A-D) with immunofluorescence (IF) staining, which has been included in the Supplemental Data (Figure S6).
