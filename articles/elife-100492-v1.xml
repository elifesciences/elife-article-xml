This ability depends in part on the octopus cells of the auditory brainstem, which respond to multiple frequencies that change over time, as occurs in natural stimuli. Unlike the average neuron, which integrates inputs over time on the order of tens of milliseconds, octopus cells must detect momentary coincidence of excitatory inputs from the cochlea during an ongoing sound on both the millisecond and submillisecond time scale. Here, we show that octopus cells receive inhibitory inputs on their dendrites that enhance opportunities for coincidence detection in the cell body, thereby allowing for responses both to rapid onsets at the beginning of a sound and to frequency modulations during the sound. This mechanism is crucial for the fundamental process of integrating the synchronized frequencies of natural auditory signals over time.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Imagine trying to listen to a friend in a busy coffee shop. Your brain helps to focus on their voice by distinguishing between the different sounds in the environment. This ability relies on specialized neurons in the auditory system called octopus cells, which detect when sound frequencies occur and change together.</p><p>Unlike most neurons in the auditory system, octopus cells can be activated by inputs from many different frequencies. However, they only reliably release an electrical signal after receiving these excitatory inputs simultaneously. This explains why these cells can respond at the beginning of a sound stimulus but not why they can also react to frequencies that change together over time, like in speech or music. This suggests that the cells’ computations may be more complex than previously thought. Rather than relying solely on excitatory inputs, alternative signals that reduce activity, known as inhibitory inputs, may also play a role.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, Kreeger et al. studied genetically modified mice to reveal the octopus cells’ activity using molecular fluorescent labels. They created a map of the incoming signals to the octopus cells, showing inhibitory inputs to the outer branched extensions of the cells. By using light to control cell activity and measuring electrical responses, Kreeger et al. showed that inhibition helps refine how excitatory signals travel through the neuron. This gives the octopus cell more time to process excitatory inputs, meaning that one cell can make computations both about the onset of sound and about frequencies that occur together during the sound.</p><p>These results provide a fuller picture of how the brain helps distinguish between sounds in noisy environments. Understanding the fine-tuning role of inhibitory signals in octopus cells may help researchers improve hearing aids and develop treatments for auditory processing disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hearing</kwd><kwd>octopus cell</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>cochlear nucleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS118402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC009223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DC020070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreeger</surname><given-names>Lauren J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000933</institution-id><institution>William Randolph Hearst Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreeger</surname><given-names>Lauren J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013113</institution-id><institution>Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Honnuraiah</surname><given-names>Suraj</given-names></name><name><surname>Fishell</surname><given-names>Gordon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the mammalian auditory brainstem, inhibitory inputs onto octopus cell dendrites enhance coincidence detection computations and support precise yet flexible temporal processing for rapid sound onsets and frequency modulations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Perception depends on the ability of neurons to encode discrete features of the sensory environment. To generate accurate percepts of complex auditory stimuli, neurons must compute both what frequencies are present and when those frequencies occur across multiple time scales. For instance, overlapping sounds, such as two competing speakers in a noisy room, are distinguished perceptually by correctly binding frequencies with coherent onsets and synchronized temporal modulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shamma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pressnitzer et al., 2011</xref>). Such computations require coincidence detection that can encode co-occurring frequencies with submillisecond precision. Frequency information is communicated by spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), whose central axons, also called auditory nerve fibers, project through the eighth nerve, bifurcate, and spread tonotopically to fill each division of the cochlear nucleus complex (CNC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De No, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fekete et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liberman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Ledwith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leake and Snyder, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, SGNs fall into physiologically distinct subtypes that are recruited at different intensities, allowing sounds to be detected across a wide dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sachs and Abbas, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liberman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liberman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Evans and Palmer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Taberner and Liberman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Palmer and Evans, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Winter et al., 1990</xref>). Many target neurons receive SGN inputs from a limited range of frequencies, encoding only a fraction of the frequency components within a stimulus. This presents a challenge for auditory circuits which must ultimately bind co-occurring frequencies while retaining sequence information in order to locate and recognize sounds. Understanding how these first computations are made is a key step towards deciphering the basis of perception.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Excitatory and inhibitory synapses to octopus cells form two domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) central axons branching within a parasagittal section of the mouse cochlear nucleus complex (CNC).

Octopus cells are excitatory neurons that bind together co-occurring frequency information on a submillisecond timescale and send this information along one of the parallel ascending pathways in the auditory brainstem. Octopus cells are named for their large-diameter tentacle-like dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Osen, 1969a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Osen, 1969b</xref>), which are oriented unidirectionally across a tonotopic array of SGNs such that each neuron integrates inputs from a wide range of frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Godfrey et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Recio-Spinoso and Rhode, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rhode et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ritz and Brownell, 1982</xref>). SGNs provide the major excitatory inputs onto octopus cells. Biophysically, octopus cells have low input resistances near rest (~4 MΩ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bal and Oertel, 2000</xref>), fast time constants (~200 µs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bal and Oertel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bal and Oertel, 2001</xref>), and large low‐voltage‐activated potassium (~40 nS at rest; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bal and Oertel, 2001</xref>), and hyperpolarization activated (~62 nS at rest; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bal and Oertel, 2000</xref>) conductances. Together these properties give octopus cells impressively narrow windows of coincidence detection on the order of 1 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cao and Oertel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golding et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Golding and Oertel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Manis and Marx, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oertel, 1983</xref>). This combination of receiving SGN innervation from broad frequencies and their biophysical specializations establish octopus cells as spectrotemporal coincidence detectors that can reliably encode the timing of complex stimuli, such as the broadband transients found in speech and other natural sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McGinley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2012</xref>). Fittingly, in vivo recordings from octopus cells demonstrate their ability to phase lock to broadband transients at rates up to 1 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Smith et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, computational models of octopus cells demonstrate that onset responses are governed by the cell’s biophysical specializations and are, in large part, the result of temporal summation of excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kipke and Levy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Levy and Kipke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Levy and Kipke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rebhan and Leibold, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Spencer et al., 2012</xref>). The simplicity of its connectivity combined with the precision of its temporal computations makes the octopus cell an attractive model for understanding how specialized anatomical and electrophysiological properties contribute to neuronal computations.</p><p>Although the octopus cell’s integration of SGN inputs within a narrow time frame enables exceptional coincidence detection, such a model does not explain how other temporal features of sound stimuli are encoded. Indeed, octopus cells encode spectrotemporal sequences within their broadly-tuned response areas, like frequency modulated sounds, that likely require further circuit specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). Although somatic depolarization can be sufficient to activate an octopus cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 1997</xref>), the vast majority of synapses are found on dendrites. Further, SGN inputs are organized tonotopically along octopus cell dendrites, with inputs from high-frequency regions located more distal than those from low frequency regions. Dendritic morphology, passive cable properties, active resting membrane properties, and the spatial relationship between synaptic inputs can all impact excitatory post synaptic potential (EPSP) summation as excitation sweeps across the dendritic arbor and towards the soma. This raises the possibility that computations made in the dendrites influence the effective window of coincidence detection by the octopus cell. Such mechanisms could enable flexible processing that is adaptive to the dynamics of the environment without compromising high-fidelity coincidence computations.</p><p>Here, we sought to define the circuit mechanisms that allow octopus cells to act as coincidence detectors across time scales. We generated a comprehensive anatomical and physiological map of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto octopus cell somas and dendrites and examined how this circuit organization influences octopus cell activation. Through a combination of in vitro experiments and computational modeling, we show that somatic summation of excitation is shaped by dendritic inhibition. Thus, octopus cells depend on compartmentalized computations that enable preservation of timing information both at the moment of stimulus onset and within an extended window for evidence accumulation, which is fundamental for the spectrotemporal integration of natural auditory stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is different in somatic and dendritic domains</title><p>To determine the wiring pattern that drives octopus cell computations, we generated a detailed map of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, octopus cells receive abundant excitatory VGLUT1+ innervation from SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gómez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) and sparse inhibitory innervation from glycinergic neurons, as visualized using the glycinergic Cre driver <italic>Slc6a5</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and the Ai34 synaptophysin-tdTomato (syp/tdT) fusion protein reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>Slc6a5-</italic>syp/tdT inhibitory inputs nestle between SGN inputs, especially on octopus cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Quantification of the number and distribution of presynaptic puncta onto octopus cells revealed marked differences in the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the somatic and dendritic compartments. Since innervation patterns have never been systematically analyzed, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 16 octopus cells and their excitatory SGN (n=8 cells, 4 mice) and inhibitory (n=8 cells, 3 mice) inputs. Octopus cells were visualized using a <italic>Thy1</italic> reporter and presynaptic puncta were labeled with the syp/tdT reporter driven either by <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or <italic>Slc6a5</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with qualitative assessment, the density of SGN inputs was higher (10.7 ± 3.0 SGN puncta/100 µm<sup>2</sup>) than that of inhibitory inputs (4.2 ± 0.8 puncta/100 µm<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Moreover, the relative proportions of excitatory and inhibitory inputs differed in the soma and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). On somas, SGNs provided dense innervation that continued on the proximal dendrite, then gradually declined with distance from the soma. By contrast, somas received very few inhibitory inputs.

Since inhibitory synapses are located primarily on octopus cell dendrites, we posited that their voltage spread to the soma is limited given the extremely low input resistance of octopus cells. To decrease electrotonic isolation of the dendrites and increase input resistance, we pharmacologically reduced conductances from voltage-gated potassium (Kv) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels using 100 µM 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) and 50 µM ZD 7288 (ZD), respectively. This cocktail increased octopus cell membrane resistance and hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential by ~8–10 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To compensate for this change, membrane potentials were adjusted to within 3 mV of the original resting membrane potential with a holding current.

We further examined the influence of leak, Kv, and HCN conductances on the neuron’s input resistance. In a passive scenario, where leak, Kv, and HCN conductances are set to zero (<italic>g</italic><sub>leak</sub><italic>=0; g</italic><sub>Kv</sub>=0; <italic>g</italic><sub>h</sub>=0), the input resistance scaled proportionally with specific membrane resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>, grey).

Activation of large (10nS) dendritic glycinergic conductances induced negligible hyperpolarizing voltage changes in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, black). With increased input resistance and reduced electrotonic isolation after Kv and HCN block, dendritic IPSPs measured at the soma were detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, blue), consistent with our in vitro recordings.</p><p>While blocking Kv and HCN allowed us to reveal IPSPs at the soma, it is possible that reduced electrotonic isolation does not entirely explain the increase in somatically-measured IPSP amplitude. Changes in driving force could increase the magnitude of synaptic currents and therefore increase the magnitude of experimentally measured synaptic potentials. We used the model to explore if changes in driving force under Kv and HCN block contribute to larger IPSPs recorded at the soma. We simulated dendritic glycinergic conductances over a range of values and in the presence of blocked Kv and HCN channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H–K</xref>). Kv and HCN block and the resulting change in input resistance increased the magnitude of soma-measured IPSPs for all glycine conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, following the pharmacological blockade of Kv and HCN channels, we observed either a reduction in the amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at distal synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, blue) or little change in IPSC amplitude at proximal synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, orange).

For both inhibition proximal to excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>) and inhibition distal to excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), the model predicted that inhibition reduces EPSP amplitude and accelerates EPSP peak timing at the soma.

In these experiments, the octopus cell properties were not altered pharmacologically and inhibition was undetectable or only visible with averaging over many sweeps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, blue). When synaptic inhibition was evoked together with excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, green), EPSPs recorded in the soma were smaller and faster than when excitation was evoked alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, black: n=8 cells, 6 mice). ChR2-evoked inhibition decreased EPSP heights by 25.2 ± 9.0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, green) and shifted the peak of EPSPs forward 57.5 ± 26 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, green).

These findings suggest that the timing of EPSP arrival in the soma may be shaped both by tonically active glycine channels and the release of synaptic glycine onto the dendrite. Of note, many SGNs also terminate on the octopus cell soma, where inhibition is minimal. This suggests that the octopus cell’s ability to act as a coincidence detector depends on two stages of compartmentalized computations, one in the dendrite that combines excitation and inhibition to provide important information about which frequencies co-occur in a complex sound stimulus and one in the soma that is restricted by the rigid temporal summation window for coincidence detection. Together with the electrotonic properties of the octopus cell and the dominance of low threshold, low jitter Ia SGN inputs, these combined computations can enable reliable coincidence detection and cross-frequency binding needed for perception of sound.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Coincidence detection plays a critical role in many cognitive and perceptual processes, from the ability to localize sound to the binding of auditory and visual features of a common stimulus. Depending on the computation, the temporal window for integration can range widely, thereby requiring circuitry with distinct anatomical and physiological properties. Here, we describe a two-domain mechanism for detecting co-occurring frequencies with different degrees of precision. By mapping and selectively activating synaptic inputs onto octopus cells both in vitro and in a computational model, we revealed that compartmentalized dendritic nonlinearities impact the temporal integration window under which somatic coincidence detection computations are made. The arrival of many small, reliable excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) from low-threshold SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is continuous throughout an ongoing stimulus. We demonstrate that glycinergic inhibition to octopus cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) can shift the magnitude and timing of SGN EPSPs as they summate in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The narrow window for coincidence detection computations allows the octopus cell to respond with temporal precision using momentary evidence provided by SGNs at the onset of the stimulus. We propose that, as a stimulus persists, inhibition onto octopus cell dendrites can adjust EPSPs before they arrive at the soma for the final input-output computation. This allows the cell to make an additional computation with a slightly longer window for evidence accumulation without compromising the accuracy of the computation in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of flexible dendritic timing for precise somatic coincidence detection.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Spectrograms show how co-occurring frequencies in broadband onsets, shown for a clicking sound (<bold>A</bold>), and frequency modulations, shown for human squeaking (<bold>B</bold>), change in their strength (top) and total intensity (bottom) on different time scales. Despite the timing differences, both kinds of stimuli are hypothesized to result in somatic summation during the octopus cell’s spike integration window. (<bold>C</bold>) Excitation must summate at the soma of octopus cells within a narrow time window (~1ms) to achieve a depolarization rate rapid enough to trigger action potentials. Summation of excitation alone accounts for responses to sound onsets (inset, top). During stimuli that require summation over a longer time period, such as frequency modulated sweeps, synaptic inhibition can accelerate EPSPs as they travel along octopus cell dendrites towards the soma for coincidence detection computations (inset, bottom). We propose a mechanism for preferential processing of a subset of excitatory inputs where selective temporal advancement of a subset of EPSPs by local inhibition could expand the effective window for coincidence detection at the soma.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100492-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As coincidence detectors in the auditory system, octopus cells are faced with the challenge of recognizing complex sounds that include many frequencies that co-occur from the beginning to the end of the stimulus. As shown by in vivo recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Recio-Spinoso and Rhode, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu et al., 2022</xref>), octopus cells respond well to cues that include complex spectrotemporal patterns, including frequency modulations beyond the onset of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). Given that the auditory environment is filled with overlapping sound stimuli, such responses presumably allow the octopus cell to encode which frequencies modulate together. Our data thus support the role of octopus cells beyond simple onset coincidence detectors that rely solely on the temporal summation of excitation. The results suggest that, in addition to high Kv and HCN conductances at rest, the addition of dendritic inhibition transforms the magnitude and timing of SGN signals as they arrive in the cell body, which may expand the response selectivity of an octopus cell and allow them to become a slightly leakier integrator that can accumulate evidence beyond onsets. Although, this inhibition is difficult to detect because of shunting, our data demonstrate that it is both present and impactful.</p><p>As well as needing to work beyond onsets, an effective coincidence detector in the auditory system must also function reliably across a range of sound intensities. Intensity information is encoded by the number and types of SGNs that are activated in the cochlea. The Ia, Ib, and Ic molecular subtypes defined in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Petitpré et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sun et al., 2018</xref>) broadly correspond to the anatomically and physiologically defined subtypes described across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Siebald et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moser et al., 2023</xref>). We find that the majority of inputs onto octopus cells come from Ia SGNs, which most closely correspond to the low-threshold, high-spontaneous rate population. Consistent with this result, single-unit SGN recordings in cats demonstrated a bias towards low-threshold, high-spontaneous rate axon collaterals in the octopus cell area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liberman, 1993</xref>). Low-threshold SGNs are also characterized by short first spike latencies and low temporal jitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costalupes et al., 1984</xref>). A hallmark of the octopus cell is the fact that it only fires action potentials when many SGN inputs are activated within a narrow period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">McGinley and Oertel, 2006</xref>). The presence of many low-threshold and temporally precise inputs on the octopus cell may help ensure that coincidence detection still works reliably for quiet sounds. Further, Ia inputs onto octopus cells do not exhibit paired-pulse depression, similar to low levels of depression seen in Ia inputs to bushy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). The presence of SGN inputs without paired-pulse depression could be beneficial for encoding sustained auditory signals. Finally, while Ia SGNs are over-represented, Ib and Ic inputs are also present. Since precise, low-threshold SGN responses can be saturated by background noise such that responses to relevant stimuli are masked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liberman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costalupes et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huet et al., 2016</xref>), recruitment of higher threshold SGNs at higher sound intensities may compensate for this tradeoff.</p><p>The presence of inhibitory inputs onto dendrites is a fundamental feature of the nervous system and, in other systems, contributes to a neuron’s final computation.

Therefore, subthreshold dendritic integration of coincident excitation and local inhibition may be the primary computation that occurs in octopus cell dendrites before action potential generation near the soma.</p><p>Although this work uncovers a role for inhibition, a deeper understanding of octopus cell computations will require determining what information is carried by inhibitory inputs. Despite the well-established presence of presynaptic glycinergic puncta in the octopus cell area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kemmer and Vater, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kolston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juiz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Moore et al., 1996</xref>) and glycinergic receptor expression in octopus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Friauf et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schofield and Cant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thompson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Mugnaini, 1987</xref>), it is unknown where glycinergic innervation originates. Local neurons within the CNC could provide inhibition; however it remains unclear whether octopus cells receive connections from D-Stellate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oertel et al., 1990</xref>), L-Stellate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ngodup et al., 2020</xref>), or tuberculoventral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wickesberg et al., 1991</xref>). Outside of the CNC, terminal degeneration experiments in cats suggested the superior periolivary nucleus (SPON) and the ventral division of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) as potential sources of descending inhibition to the octopus cell area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kane, 1977</xref>). Octopus cells provide excitatory input to both the SPON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friauf and Ostwald, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schofield, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Thompson and Thompson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zook and Casseday, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Felix Ii et al., 2017</xref>) and the VNLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schofield and Cant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nayagam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Vater and Feng, 1990</xref>), raising the possibility of feedback inhibition from the auditory brainstem as a circuit mechanism that elongates temporal summation windows during ongoing stimuli. Such descending feedback inhibition is not rapid enough to prevent or alter the characteristic octopus cell onset response, but could change the effective coincidence detection window as the stimulus continues or limit the duration of the response. Future studies will be required to identify the source of inhibition and its organization within dendritic compartments. If inhibitory inputs tonotopically match the local, narrowly-tuned dendritic SGN inputs, it is possible that frequency-matched inhibition could influence spectral selectivity or feature extraction. On the other hand, broadly tuned inhibition could reduce depolarization block or serve as a temporal milestone that signals gaps or offsets. Further characterization of in vivo octopus cell responses in complex sound environments may clarify the effect of noise on signal detection and reveal additional features of this cell’s contributions to perception of the auditory world.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Mice were rapidly decapitated and the brain was removed and immediately submerged in ACSF. Brains were bisected and 250 μm slices were prepared in the sagittal plane with a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1200S; Leica Systems). Prepared slices were incubated for 30 min at 35 °C, then allowed to recover at room temperature for at least 30 min. ACSF was continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Whole-cell recordings were conducted at 35 °C using a Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices) in current-clamp mode with experimenter adjusted and maintained bridge balance and capacitance compensation. Data were filtered at 12 kHz, digitized at 83–100 kHz, and acquired using pClamp9 (Molecular Devices). Neurons were visualized using infrared Dodt gradient contrast (Zeiss Examiner.D1; Zeiss Axiocam 305 mono). Glass recording electrodes (3–7 MΩ) were wrapped in parafilm to reduce capacitance and filled with an intracellular solution containing 115 mM K-gluconate, 4.42 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>Phosphocreatine, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, and 0.1% biocytin, osmolality adjusted to 300 mmol/kg with sucrose, pH adjusted to 7.30 with KOH. All membrane potentials are corrected for a –11 mV junction potential.</p><p>For optogenetic activation, full-field 475 nm blue light was presented through a 20x immersion objective (Zeiss Examiner.D1). Onset, duration, and intensity of light was controlled by a Colibri5 LED Light Source (Zeiss). Light intensity at the focal plane ranged between 1.9 and 4.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to 6% and 10% intensity on the Colibri5 system. For electrical stimulation, glass stimulating electrodes were placed in the auditory nerve root and 20µs current pulses were generated with a DS3 current stimulator (Digitimer). Light or electrical stimulation intensity was adjusted during the experiment to evoke subthreshold EPSPs, not spikes. During analysis, EPSPs and spikes were distinguished by screening all events with a phase plot analysis. Only stimulation events that evoked EPSPs unambiguously were included for analysis. When presenting electrical and light stimulation together, a series of stimulation pairings with shuffled onset timings was presented to account for cell to cell variability in EPSP and IPSP timings. Data presented is for the stimulation pairings that evoked a maximal shift in EPSP timings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis and statistical tests</title><p>Cell counts and habenula measurements were performed in ImageJ/FIJI software (National Institutes of Health). Electrophysiology data were analyzed using custom scripts and NeuroMatic analysis routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rothman and Silver, 2018</xref>) in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics).</p><p>For data with equal variance (Levene’s test), one-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s HSD post hoc test were used where appropriate to determine statistical significance. For data with non-homogenous variances, one-way ANOVAs with a Welch F test were used with a Tukey’s HSD post hoc test. Errors and error bars report standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM) as noted in figure legends and throughout the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Computational modelling</title><p>Computer simulations were performed using the NEURON 8.2 simulation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</xref>), with an integration time constant of 25µs. The morphology of the octopus neuron was obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2012</xref>. The active and passive properties of the model were optimized to match the experimental recordings. We set the passive parameters as follows: internal or axial resistance (R<sub>i</sub> or R<sub>a</sub>) to 150 Ω.cm, membrane resistance (R<sub>m</sub>) to 5 KΩ.cm<sup>2</sup>, capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) to 0.9 µF/Cm<sup>2</sup> and resting membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) to –65 mV. Ion-channel kinetics, maximum conductance densities, Q10 (3), and temperature (22 °C) were obtained from and matched to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Manis and Campagnola, 2018</xref> and the maximal conductances were adjusted using a scaling factor (scl) to align qualitatively with experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>): fast Na<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub>Na</sub>=0.83), fast transient K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub>KA</sub>=0.07), high threshold K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub>KHT</sub>=0.1875), low-voltage activated K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub>KLT</sub>=0.75), hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN; <italic>ḡ</italic><sub>h</sub>=0.07) and leak K<sup>+</sup> (<italic>ḡ</italic><sub>leak</sub>=0.0017). All conductances were uniformly distributed across dendrites and soma, except for HCN conductance, which was only present in dendrites. A baseline scaling factor of 1 was applied under control conditions and 0 under Kv+HCN block conditions. AMPA conductance (<italic>G</italic><sub>AMPA</sub>) was set to 5nS to align with experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and glycine conductance (<italic>G</italic><sub>Gly</sub>) was set to 1nS to match experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Reversal potentials for HCN, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> respectively were (in mV), E<sub>h</sub>=–38, E<sub>Na</sub>=50 and E<sub>K</sub>=–70. Excitatory AMPA synaptic conductance and inhibitory glycine synaptic conductance were introduced in the proximal and distal dendrites to test the impact of dendritic inhibition on the EPSP height and peak time. The magnitudes of synaptic conductances were tuned to fall within the range seen during experimental data collection. The rise and decay time of AMPA and glycine conductances were tuned to 0.3ms and 3ms respectively, to match experimental data. The reversal potential of AMPA and glycine conductance was set to 0 mV and –80 mV, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by and conducted in accordance with Harvard Medical School's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number IS00000067-9).

The octopus cells are highly specialized neurons that, with appropriate stimuli, can fire repetitively at very high rates (&gt; 800 Hz in vivo), yield responses dominated by the onset of sound for simple stimuli, and integrate auditory nerve inputs over a wide frequency span. Previously, it was thought that octopus cells received little inhibitory input, and their integration of auditory input depended principally on temporally precise coincidence detection of excitatory auditory nerve inputs, coupled with a low input resistance established by high levels of expression of certain potassium channels and hyperpolarization-activated channels.</p><p>This study provides convincing evidence that octopus cells do in fact receive glycinergic synaptic input that can influence the efficacy of excitatory dendritic synaptic activity. By coupling selected genetic mouse models to characterize synaptic inputs and enable optogenetic stimulation of subsets of afferents, fluorescent microscopy, detailed reconstructions of the location of inhibitory synapses on the soma and dendrites of octopus cells, slice physiology, and computational modeling, they have been able to clarify the presence of functional inhibition and elucidate some of the features of the inhibitory inputs to octopus cells at a biophysical level. They also show through modeling that inhibition is predicted to both provide shunting of synaptic currents and to change the peak timing of dendritic EPSPs as they travel to the soma. Both of these effects are potentially critically important in integration in these fast, coincidence-detecting neurons, and the magnitudes of the effects could have physiological significance. Overall, this work extends thinking about the functional sensory processing roles of octopus cells beyond the pre-existing hypotheses that are focussed primarily on the coincidence detection of excitatory inputs.</p><p>The authors have addressed all of my prior concerns, including improving several aspects of the presentation. The modeling is better described, which is critical because it provides a foundation to help interpret some of the physiology and to propose specific functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100492.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kreeger</surname><given-names>Lauren J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Honnuraiah</surname><given-names>Suraj</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Maeker</surname><given-names>Sydney</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shea</surname><given-names>Siobhan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fishell</surname><given-names>Gordon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This valuable work analyzes how specialized cells in the auditory cells, known as the octopus cells, can detect coincidences in their inputs at the submillisecond time scale.

Specifically, no attempt was made to assess the actual, biological values of synaptic conductance for AMPAR and GlyR. Thus, we don't really know how potent the GlyR could be in mediating inhibition. Here are some numbered comments:</p><p>(1) &quot;EPSPs&quot; were evoked either optogenetically or with electrical stimulation. The resulting depolarizations are interpreted to be EPSPs. However previous studies from Oertel show that octopus cells have tiny spikes, and distinguishing them from EPSPs is tricky. No mention is made here about how or whether that was done. Thus, the analysis of EPSP amplitude is ambiguous.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that large EPSPs can be difficult to distinguish from an octopus cell’s short spikes during experiments. During analysis, we distinguished spikes from EPSPs by generating phase plots, which allow us to visualize the first derivative of the voltage trace on the y-axis and the value of the voltage on the x-axis at each moment in time. In the example shown below, four depolarizing events were electrically evoked in an octopus cell (panel A). The largest of these events (shown in orange in panels B-D) has an amplitude of ~9mV and could be a small spike. The first derivative of the voltage (panel C) reveals a bi-phasic response in the larger orange trace, where during the rising phase (mV/ms &gt; 0) of the EPSP there is a second, sharper rising phase for the spike. Like more traditionally sized action potentials, phase plots for octopus cell spikes also reveal a sharp change in the rate of voltage change over time (Author response image 1 panel D, ✱) after the rising action of the EPSP begins to slow. EPSPs (shown in blue in panels B-D) lack the deflection in the phase plot. Not all cases were as unambiguous as this example. Therefore, our analysis only included subthreshold stimulation that unambiguously evoked EPSPs, not spikes. A brief description of this analysis has been added to the methods text (lines 625-627) and we have noted in the results section that both ChR2-evoked and electrically-evoked stimulation can produce small action potentials, which were excluded from analysis (lines 156-158).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100492-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For this and later analysis, a voltage clamp of synaptic inputs would have been a simple alternative to avoid contaminating spikes or shunts by background or voltage-gated conductances. Yet only the current clamp was employed. I can understand that the authors might feel that the voltage clamp is 'flawed' because of the failure to clamp dendrites. But that may have been a good price to pay in this case. The authors should have at least justified their choice of method and detailed its caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that data collected using voltage-clamp would have eliminated the confound of short action potentials and avoided the influence of voltage-gated conductances. The large-diameter and comparatively simple dendritic trees of octopus cells make them good morphological candidates for reliable voltage clamp. However, as suggested, we were concerned that the abundance of channels open at the neuron’s resting potential would make it difficult to sufficiently clamp dendrites. Ultimately, given the low input resistances of octopus cells and the fast kinetics of excitatory inputs, we determined that bad voltage clamp conditions were likely to result in unclamped synaptic events with unpredicted distortions in kinetics and attenuation (To et al. 2022; PMID: 34480986; DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2021.08.024). We therefore chose to focus our efforts on current-clamp.</p><p>Beyond the limits of both current-clamp and voltage-clamp, we chose to leave all conductances that influence EPSP dendritic propagation intact because our model demonstrates that active Kv and leak conductances shape and attenuate synaptic inputs as they travel through the dendritic tree (Supp. Fig. 4F-G). The addition of voltage-clamp recordings would not impact the conclusions we make about EPSP summation at the soma. Future studies will need to focus on a dendrite-centric view of local excitatory and inhibitory summation. For dendrite-centric experiments, dendritic voltage-clamp recordings are well suited to answer that set of questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The modeling raised several concerns. First, there is little presentation of assumptions, and of course, a model is entirely about its assumptions. For example, what excitatory conductance amplitudes were used? The same for inhibitory conductance? How were these values arrived at? The authors note that EPSGs and IPSGs had peaks at 0.3 and 3 ms. On what basis were these numbers obtained? The model's conclusions entirely depend on these values, and no measurements were made here that could have provided them. Parenthetical reference is made to Figure S5 where a range of values are tested, but with little explanation or justification.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing this information. We used our octopus neuron model to fit both EPSP and IPSP parameters to match experimental data. We have expanded the methods to include final values for the conductances (lines 649-651), which were adjusted to match experimental values seen in current-clamp recordings. We have also expanded the results section to describe each of the parameters we tuned (lines 203-222). An example of these adjustments is illustrated in Fig. 4F where the magnitude of inhibitory potentials at different conductances (100nS and 1nS) was compared to experimental data over a range of octopus cell input resistance conditions. Kinetic parameters were determined by aligning modeled PSPs to the rise times and full width at half maximum (FWHM) measurements from experiments under control and Kv block conditions. The experimental data for EPSPs and IPSPs that was used to fit the model is shown in Author response image 2 below.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100492-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In experiments that combined E and I stimulation, what exactly were time courses of the conductance changes, and how 'synchronous' were they, given the different methods to evoke them?

Our conclusions in the combined E and I stimulation experiments require the resting membrane properties of octopus cells to be intact to make physiologically-relevant conclusions. Our current-clamp data includes the critical impact of leak, Kv, and HCN conductances on this computation. Reliable voltage-clamp would necessitate the removal of the Kv and HCN conductances that shape PSP magnitude, shape, and speed. Because it was not necessary to measure the conductances and kinetics of specific channels, we chose to use current-clamp.</p><p>Evoked IPSPs and EPSPs had cell-to-cell variability in their latencies to onset. Somatically-recorded optically-evoked inhibition under pharmacological conditions that changed cable properties had onset latencies between 2.5 and 4.3ms; electrically-evoked excitation under control conditions had latencies between 0.8 and 1.4ms. To overcome cell-to-cell timing variabilities, we presented a shuffled set of stimulation pairings that had a 3ms range of timings with 200µs intervals. As the evoked excitation and inhibition become more ‘synchronous’, the impact on EPSP magnitude and timing is greatest. Data presented in this paper was for the stimulation pairings that evokes a maximal shift in EPSP timing. On average, this occurred when the optical stimulation began ~1.2ms before electrical stimulation. Stimulation pairing times ranged between a 0ms offset and a 1.8ms offset at the extremes. An example of the shuffled stimulation pairings is shown in Author response image 3 below, and we have included information about the shuffled stimulus in the methods (lines 627-630)</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100492-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 4G is confusing to me. Its point, according to the text, is to show that changes in membrane properties induced by a block of Kv and HCN channels would not be expected to alter the amplitudes of EPSCs and IPSCs across the dendritic expanse. Now we are talking about currents (not shunting effects), and the presumption is that the blockers would alter the resting potential and thus the driving force for the currents. But what was the measured membrane potential change in the blockers? Surely that was documented. To me, the bigger concern (stated in the text) is whether the blockers altered exocytosis, and thus the increase in IPSP amplitude in blockers is due BOTH to loss of shunting and increase in presynaptic spike width. Added to this is that 4AP will reduce the spike threshold, thus allowing more ChR2-expressing axons to reach the threshold. Figure 4G does not address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>These are valuable points that motivated us to improve the clarity of this figure and the corresponding text. We discussed two separate points in this paragraph and were not clear. Our intention with Figure 4G was to address concerns that using pharmacological blockers changes driving forces and may confound the measured change in magnitude of postsynaptic potentials. Membrane potentials hyperpolarized by approximately 8-10 mV after application of blockers. We corrected for this effect by adding a holding current to depolarize the neuron to its baseline resting potential. Text in the results (lines 187-190) and figure legends have been changed to clarify these points.</p><p>We also removed any discussion of presynaptic effects from this portion of the text because our description was incomplete and we did not directly collect data related to these claims. We originally wrote, “While blocking Kv and HCN allowed us to reveal IPSPs at the soma, 4-AP increases the duration of the already unphysiological ChR2-evoked presynaptic action potential (Jackman et al., 2014; DOI: 10.1523/jneurosci.4694-13.2014), resulting in altered release probabilities and synaptic properties, amongst other caveats (Mathie et al., 1998; DOI: 10.1016/S0306-3623(97)00034-7)”. Ultimately, effects on exocytosis, presynaptic excitability, or release probability are only relevant for the experiments presented in Figure 4. Figure 4 serves as evidence that synaptic release of glycine elicits strychnine-sensitive inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in octopus cells. Concerns of presynaptic effects do not carry over to the data presented in Figure 5, as Kv and HCN were not blocked in these experiments. Therefore, we have removed this portion of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 5F is striking as the key piece of biological data that shows that inhibition does reduce the amplitude of &quot;EPSPs&quot; in octopus cells. Given the other uncertainties mentioned, I wondered if it makes sense as an example of shunting inhibition. Specifically, what are the relative synaptic conductances, and would you predict a 25% reduction given the actual (not modeled) values?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that both shunting and hyperpolarizing inhibition could play a role in the measured EPSP changes. Because we focused data collection on voltage changes at the soma under physiological conditions, we cannot calculate the relative synaptic conductances. Together, our experimental current-clamp results paired with estimates from the model provide compelling evidence for the change we observe in EPSPs. Regardless, the relative weights of the synaptic conductances is a very interesting question, but this information is not necessary to answer the questions posed in this study, namely the impact of dendritic inhibition on the arrival of EPSPs in the soma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Some of the supplemental figures, like 4 and 5, are hardly mentioned.

The octopus cells are specialized neurons that can fire repetitively at very high rates (&gt; 800 Hz in vivo), yield responses dominated by the onset of sound for simple stimuli, and integrate auditory nerve inputs over a wide frequency span. Previously, it was thought that octopus cells received little inhibitory input, and their integration of auditory input depended principally on temporally precise coincidence detection of excitatory auditory nerve inputs, coupled with a low input resistance established by high levels of expression of certain potassium channels and hyperpolarization-activated channels.</p><p>In this study, the authors used a combination of numerous genetic mouse models to characterize synaptic inputs and enable optogenetic stimulation of subsets of afferents, fluorescent microscopy, detailed reconstructions of the location of inhibitory synapses on the soma and dendrites of octopus cells, and computational modeling, to explore the importance of inhibitory inputs to the cells. They determined through assessment of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic densities that spiral ganglion neuron synapses are densest on the soma and proximal dendrite, while glycinergic inhibitory synaptic density is greater on the dendrites compared to the soma of octopus cells. Using different genetic lines, the authors further elucidated that the majority of excitatory synapses on the octopus cells are from type 1a spiral ganglion neurons, which have low response thresholds and high rates of spontaneous activity. In the second half of the paper, the authors employed electrophysiology to uncover the physiological response of octopus cells to excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Using a combination of pharmacological blockers in vitro cellular and computational modeling, the authors conclude that glycine in fact evokes IPSPs in octopus cells; these IPSPs are largely shunted by the high membrane conductance of the cells under normal conditions and thus were not clearly evident in prior studies. Pharmacological experiments point towards a specific glycine receptor subunit composition. Lastly, Kreeger et. al demonstrated with in vitro recordings and computational modeling that octopus cell inhibition modulates the amplitude and timing of dendritic spiral ganglion inputs to octopus cells, allowing for flexible coincidence detection.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work combines a number of approaches and complementary observations to characterize the spatial patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input, and the type of auditory nerve input to the octopus cells. The combination of multiple mouse lines enables a better understanding of and helps to define, the pattern of synaptic convergence onto these cells. The electrophysiology provides excellent functional evidence for the presence of the inhibitory inputs, and the modeling helps to interpret the likely functional role of inhibition. The work is technically well done and adds an interesting dimension related to the processing of sound by these neurons. The paper is overall well written, the experimental tests are well-motivated and easy to follow. The discussion is reasonable and touches on both the potential implications of the work as well as some caveats.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the conclusions presented by the authors are solid, a prominent question remains regarding the source of the glycinergic input onto octopus cells. In the discussion, the authors claim that there is no evidence for D-stellate, L-stellate, and tuberculoventral cell (all local inhibitory neurons of the ventral and dorsal cochlear nucleus) connections to octopus cells, and cite the relevant literature. An experimental approach will be necessary to properly rule out (or rule in) these cell types and others that may arise from other auditory brainstem nuclei. Understanding which cells provide the inhibitory input will be an essential step in clarifying its roles in the processing of sound by octopus cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer agrees with the conclusions we have made and is interested in learning more about how these findings impact sound processing. We agree that defining the source of inhibition will dramatically shape our understanding of the computation octopus cells are making. However, this is not an easy task, given the small size of the octopus cell area, and will involve considerable additional work. Since the overall findings do not depend on knowing the source of inhibition, we have instead re-written the discussion to clarify the lack of evidence for intrinsic inhibitory inputs to octopus cells, in addition to presenting likely candidates. As genetic profiles of cochlear nucleus and other auditory brainstem neurons become available, we intend to make and utilize genetic mouse models to answer questions like this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors showed that type 1a SGNs are the most abundant inputs to octopus cells via microscopy. However, in Figure 3 they compare optical stimulation of all classes of ANFs, then compare this against stimulation of type 1b/c ANFs.

This is important with regards to the broader hypothesis regarding traveling-wave compensation (e.g., McGinley et al; but also many others); if the cells are not all in the appropriate orientation then such compensation may be problematic. Likewise, the data from Lu et al., 2022, points towards a range of sensitivity to frequency-swept stimuli, some of which work in opposition to the traveling wave compensation hypothesis. It would seem that with the Thy1 mice, you have an opportunity to clarify the orientation.

In our hands, sparsely labeled octopus cells in Thy1-YFP-H mice show consistent dendritic orientation when visualized in a 15 degree parasaggital plane, with the most diversity apparent in cells with somas located more dorsally in the octopus cell area. We hypothesize that this is due to the limited area through which the central projections of spiral ganglion neurons (i.e. ANFs) must pass through before they enter the dorsal cochlear nucleus and continue their tonotopic organization in that area.</p><p>A caveat to studies without physiological or genetic identification of octopus cells is the assumption that all neurons in the octopus cell area are octopus cells. We find, especially along the borders of the octopus cell area, that stellate cells can be seen amongst octopus cells. Because stellate cell dendrites are not oriented like octopus cell dendrites, any stellate cells misidentified as octopus cells would appear to have poorly-oriented dendrites. This may explain why some studies report this finding. In addition, it can be difficult to assess tonotopic organization because of the 3D trajectory of tightly bundled axons, which is not capturable by a single section plane. Although a parasaggital plane of sectioning captures the tonotopic axis in one part of the octopus cell area, that same plane may be perpendicular at the opposing end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L67: canonical -&gt; exceptional.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

EPSPs measured at the soma under control conditions are small amplitude and rapid. With pharmacological reduction of HCN and Kv channels, EPSPs are larger and slower (please see figure in response to a similar question posed by Reviewer #1). We expect that this change also occurs with the IPSP kinetics under pharmacological conditions. Our justification of kinetics has been expanded and justified in the methods section (lines 641-661).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L594: Technically, this is a -11 mV junction potential, but thanks for including the information.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this in the text (line 618).

We have reported these measurements in the results section (Lines 621-622).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L609: One concern about the model is that the integration time of 25 microseconds is rather close to the relative shifts in latency. While I doubt it will make a difference (except in the number), it may be worth verifying (spot checks, at least) that running the model with a 5 or 10-microsecond step yields a similar pattern of latency shifts (e.g., Supplementary Figure 5, Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>Also, it is not clear what temperature the model was executed at (I would presume 35C); this needs to be given, and channel Q10's listed.</p><p>We realize that additional information is needed to fully understand the model and have added this to the results and the methods. The synaptic mechanism (.mod) files were obtained from Manis and Campagnola, 2018. Q10 (3) and temperature (22°C) were also matched to parameters from Manis and Campagnola, 2018. Because temperature is a critical factor for channel kinetics, we verified that our primary results remain consistent under conditions using a temperature of 35°C and a time step of 5µs, depicted below. Panel A illustrates the increase in IPSP as a function of glycine conductance under Kv+HCN block conditions at 35°C. As at 22°C, an increase in IPSP magnitude is absent in the control condition at 35°C. Panels B and C provide a direct comparison between the initial (i.e. 22°C) and suggested (i.e. 35°C) simulation conditions. Again we found that temperature does not have a major impact on the amplitude of IPSPs. Thus, results at 35°C do not change the conclusions we make from the model.</p><fig id="sa3fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100492-sa3-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The nominal conductance densities should at least be provided in a table (supplemental, in addition to including them in the deposited code).
