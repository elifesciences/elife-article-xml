The mechanisms underlying this functional bias remain elusive. Previous studies have reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice harboring dendritic cell (DC)-specific deletion of IL-27p28 display an increased capacity of IFN-γ production upon TCR stimulation. Here, we demonstrated that similarly altered functionality occurred in CD4SP thymocytes, recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), as well as naive T cells from either <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice or mice deficient in the α subunit of IL-27 receptor. Therefore, DC-derived IL-27p28-triggered, IL-27Rα-mediated signal is critically involved in the establishment of functional bias against IFN-γ production during their development in the thymus. Epigenetic analyses indicated reduced DNA methylation of the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus and increased trimethylation of H3K4 at both <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci in CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. Transcriptome profiling demonstrated that <italic>Il27p28</italic> ablation resulted in the coordinated up-regulation of STAT1-activated genes. Concurrently, STAT1 was found to be constitutively activated. Moreover, we observed increased accumulation of STAT1 at the <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci and a strong correlation between STAT1 binding and H3K4me3 modification of these loci. Of note, <italic>Il27p28</italic> deficiency exacerbated the autoimmune phenotype of <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Collectively, this study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the functional bias of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the potential relevance of such a bias in autoimmunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IL-27p28</kwd><kwd>single positive thymocyte</kwd><kwd>Th2 bias</kwd><kwd>IFN-γ</kwd><kwd>autoimmune disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32230037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82394412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023YFB3507000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Life Science Academy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024600CC0080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dendritic cell (DC)-derived IL-27 establishes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell bias against IFN-γ via STAT1 and epigenetics, linking thymic development to autoimmune mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The thymus plays a crucial role in the phenotypic development and functional maturation of T cells. After positive and negative selection, T cell progenitors become CD4 or CD8 single positive (CD4SP or CD8SP) thymocytes that are self-tolerant. These SP thymocytes then emigrate to the periphery, known as recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), and 2–3 weeks later, RTEs develop into mature naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashby and Hogquist, 2024</xref>). Upon activation, CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs exhibit a reduced proliferation capacity and decreased production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) compared to mature naive T cells. However, they show increased secretion of IL-4, which is known as T helper (Th) 2 bias in immature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendricks and Fink, 2011</xref>). This Th2 bias in CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs is thought to assist newly emigrated self-reactive T cells to respond appropriately to self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fink and Hendricks, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the low level of IFN-γ production in RTEs renders them more prone to becoming regulatory T cells, which also helps to prevent the induction of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhaumik et al., 2013</xref>). The low level of DNA methylation at the <italic>Il4</italic> locus and reduced expression of <italic>Dnmts</italic> contribute to the Th2 bias in CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berkley et al., 2013</xref>). However, the mechanism behind repressed IFN-γ expression in favor of the Th2 bias in these immature T cells is elusive.</p><p>The heterodimeric cytokine IL-27 is composed of p28 (also named IL-27p28, or IL-30) and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3), which signals through the IL-27R consisting of the IL-27Rα (also named WSX-1, TCCR) and the gp130 subunits. Elevated levels of IL-27 are associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2015</xref>), Behcet’s disease (BD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), and experimental arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2008</xref>). The IL-27-regulated differentiation and function of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells subsets Th1, Th17, and Treg have been proposed as an explanation for the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mei et al., 2021</xref>), however, conflicting reports have been demonstrated in different settings. For example, it is consistent that IL-27 inhibits Th17 differentiation and function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Il27p28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ebi3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diveu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Although IL-27 inhibits Treg differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neufert et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>Ebi3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EAE models show increased numbers and suppressive functions of Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), Tregs in <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>–/–</sup> and Treg-specific <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice loss the suppressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2019b</xref>). Furthermore, IL-27 was initially found to promote Th1 differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pflanz et al., 2002</xref>). However, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from <italic>Ebi3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Il27p28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit increased production of IFN-γ. In addition, the absence of <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>-/-</sup> promotes pathological Th1 accumulation following <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamano et al., 2003</xref>). A subsequent study demonstrates that both the absence and overexpression of IL-27p28 lead to increased susceptibility to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, highlighting the role of IL-27p28 as an independent negative regulator of IFN-γ production in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Villarino et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, deficiency in gp130 does not alter IFN-γ production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a virus-infection model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harker et al., 2015</xref>). These results indicate the intricate functionality of each subunit of IL-27 and IL-27R in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which complicates the interpretation of the autoimmune phenotype in deficient mice.</p><p>The structural analysis of IL-27 has demonstrated that IL-27p28, serving as a central subunit, possesses the ability to bind with EBI3, as well as the receptor subunits IL-27Rα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caveney et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies have reported IL-27p28 as an independent antagonist of gp130-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stumhofer et al., 2010</xref>). In a ConA-induced liver damage model, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice with DC-specific deletion of <italic>IL27p28</italic> (<italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice) exhibit a propensity for rapid and robust production of IFN-γ upon activation. This observation is attributed to the absence of IL-27p28 in the thymic environment of these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). These findings raise the intriguing possibility that thymic DC-derived IL-27p28 may contribute to shaping the Th1/Th2 balance of newly generated CD4SP thymocytes.</p><p>In this paper, we have demonstrated that DC-derived IL-27p28 plays a crucial role in maintaining the Th2 bias of CD4SP thymocytes. Our findings suggest that IL-27p28 regulates the DNA methylation status and histone modifications in the transcription regulatory regions of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> genes. These epigenetic modifications were further modulated by the low level of basal and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) protein. Furthermore, we observed that the disruption of Th2 bias in CD4SP thymocytes due to IL-27p28 deficiency exacerbated autoimmune diseases in <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Th2 bias by DC-derived IL-27p28 and its potential role in autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DC-specific deletion of IL-27p28 endows the newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with inherently enhanced capacity of IFN-γ production</title><p>Although IL-27 is widely reported to promote peripheral Th1 differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice exhibit enhanced IFN-γ production, a capacity seemingly acquired in their development in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate the possibility that thymic DC-derived IL-27 shapes the functionality of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4SP thymocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs, and CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells were purified from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (cKO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates harboring a <italic>Rag2</italic>-GFP transgene, which allows easy tracking of newly generated thymocytes and RTEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashby and Hogquist, 2024</xref>). The purified cells were then compared for cytokine expression in response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation under non-polarizing conditions. As expected, CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells from cKO mice exhibited a significantly higher level of <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA expression compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Intracellular staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and ELISA assay of the culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) confirmed enhanced IFN-γ production at the protein level. Notably, this difference was already detectable at the SP thymocyte stage, indicating that it was developmentally regulated. Another prominent feature of CD4SP thymocytes is the hyperproduction of Th2 cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fink and Hendricks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Makar et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the profound impact of IL-27p28 deficiency on IFN-γ production, we observed no significant difference in IL-4 expression between cKO and WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the expression of IL-2 and TNF-α between cKO and WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that DC-specific deletion of IL-27p28 specifically enhances IFN-γ production in newly generated T cells without affecting Th2 cytokines.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Elevated IFN-γ production and T-bet expression in <italic>Cd11c-p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice initiated from CD4SP thymocytes stage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CD4SP (GFP<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup>) thymocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs (GFP<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup>) and CD4<sup>+</sup> naive (GFP<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup>) T cells were sorted from 6- to 8-week-old <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice and WT littermates, stimulated with plate coated anti-CD3 (2 µg/mL) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 µg/mL) for 12 hr. mRNA levels of <italic>Ifng, Il4,</italic> and <italic>Il2</italic> were determined by qPCR.

Therefore, we chose to treat the cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 3 days prior to the assay. Under such conditions, STAT1 was found to be markedly accumulated in the promoter and regulatory regions of both <italic>Tbx21</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> loci of cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, there were strong positive correlations between the levels of STAT1 binding and H3K4me3 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient for <italic>Ifng</italic> locus <italic>r</italic>=0.917, <italic>p</italic>=0.010 and <italic>Tbx21</italic> locus <italic>r</italic>=0.991, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating the implication of STAT1 in the epigenetic modifications of the loci. Together, these data suggest that IL-27p28-medaited signal normally imposes an inhibitory effect on STAT1 activation, which in turn helps the establishment of functional bias against the Th1 lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Augmented autoimmune phenotype of <italic>Aire</italic>-deficient mice in the absence of IL-27p28</title><p>The physiological significance remains elusive of the bias against the Th1 effector functions for CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs. One hypothesis proposes that it favors the development of peripheral tolerance by avoiding a more inflammatory and potential detrimental response to self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fink and Hendricks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendricks and Fink, 2011</xref>). The disruption of such a bias in <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice provided a good model to test this hypothesis.

But the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells recovered from the lung tissues displayed a similar cytokine secretion profile to that of WT mice except for the intrinsic augmentation of IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Histological examination revealed increased lymphocyte infiltration and more severe structural distortion in the lung and stomach in double knockout mice in comparison to mice deficient for Aire only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, the double knockout mice exhibited an elevated level of autoantibodies to double-strand DNA, although the difference did not reach a statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>=0.068) possibly due to the limited sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

However, the regulation of the opposing cytokine IFN-γ in this context remains unclear. We reported here that thymic DC-derived IL-27p28 played a key role in the establishment of the repressive status of the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus in newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. As such, the loss of IL-27p28 in DCs endowed these cells with increased capacity of IFN-γ production upon TCR engagement. Transcriptome profiling demonstrated coordinated up-regulation of STAT1-activated genes in the absence of IL-27p28. Indeed, enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 was observed in CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, which was accompanied by the accumulation of STAT1 at the promoter and enhancer regions of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic>. Epigenetic analyses indicated reduced DNA methylation at the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus and increased trimethylation of H3K4 at both <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci in the absence of IL-27p28. Moreover, the H3K4me3 modification was shown to be strongly correlated with STAT1 binding to these loci. These data support a hypothesis that the exposure of developing thymocytes to IL-27p28 induces repressive epigenetic changes at the <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci, possibly through antagonizing STAT1 activation, ultimately leading to an attenuated IFN-γ response of newly generated CD4SP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>The present study revealed a significantly elevated level of phosphorylated STAT1 and up-regulation of a variety of STAT1-regulated genes in CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. These findings collectively suggest that IL-27p28 plays an important role in the fine-tuning of STAT1 signaling pathways during thymocytes development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Twohig et al., 2019</xref>). As IL-27 is known to activate multiple STAT proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5 following engagement of the gp130/IL-27Rα receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Philips et al., 2022</xref>), the hyperactivation of STAT1 in the absence of IL-27p28 is somehow unexpected. We examined the potential impact of IL-27 deficiency on the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which has been shown to have a regulatory role in IL-27 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Owaki et al., 2006</xref>). Comparable levels of SOCS3 were detected in CD4SP thymocytes and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice and their littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also explored the possibility that the constitutive activation of STAT1 might be the secondary effect of enhanced IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singhania et al., 2019</xref>). Addition of IFN-γ antibodies to the culture of CD4SP thymocytes and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, however, showed no significant effect on phosphorylated STAT1 levels in knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Thus, STAT1 hyperactivation is unlikely due to loss of SOCS3 expression or positive feedback of IFN-γ signaling. Of note, it has been previously demonstrated that IL-27p28 on its own can act as a natural antagonist of gp130-mediated signaling triggered by IL-6, IL-11, and IL-27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stumhofer et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this finding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chong et al., 2014</xref> reported that IL-27p28 was able to inhibit IL-27-induced Th1 differentiation by reducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. Therefore, we speculate that IL-27p28 in the thymus may primarily functions to suppress STAT1 activation induced by other cytokines.</p><p>A recent study demonstrated that both recombinant murine and human IL-27 induced the expression of antiviral proteins <italic>Oas1</italic>, <italic>Oas2</italic>, <italic>Oas3</italic>, <italic>Oasl1</italic>, and <italic>Oasl2</italic> in epidermal keratinocytes. IL-27 signaling leads to OAS2 expression in a manner dependent on IL27Rα and STAT1, but independent of STAT2. Apart from their antiviral activity, OAS proteins are also involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castelli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salzberg et al., 1997</xref>). The genomic mutation and methylation of most OAS genes have been shown to alter their expression levels, which is associated with the levels of infiltrated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Secreted OAS2 has also been observed to inhibit CD3 zeta chain expression in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dar et al., 2016</xref>). In our current study, we observed an increase in the transcription of <italic>Oasl2, Oas2</italic>, and <italic>Oas3</italic> in CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, indicating that IL-27p28 signaling also involved in the fine-tuning of these OAS protein expressions. Whether these molecules play a role in thymocyte development remains to be clarified.</p><p>The biased functionality of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been proposed to be important for the induction of peripheral tolerance to self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fink and Hendricks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendricks and Fink, 2011</xref>). Despite the much enhanced capacity of IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and a significant increase of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>-</sup> activated T cells, <italic>Cd11c-p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice displayed no apparent signs of autoimmunity under steady-state conditions. This is consistent with the result of our previous study in which negative selection was found to proceed normally in <italic>Cd11c-p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice using the RIP-mOVA and OT-II models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). We further interrogated the impact of the disrupted functional bias in <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Aire induces ectopic expression of self-antigens in medullary thymic epithelial cells to mediate negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes. Its mutation causes a rare life-threatening autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Laar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>). In comparison to <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, <italic>Cd11c-p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup><italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed elevated levels of double-strand DNA autoantibodies, increased lymphocytes infiltration, and reduced anergic cells. Therefore, although disruption of the functional bias in newly generated T cells is not sufficient to drive autoimmunity, it accelerates disease development in hosts poised for autoimmunity.</p><p>In further support of a direct link between IL-27 and Aire, a recent study revealed that IL-27 production was inhibited in Aire-overexpressing murine dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). The two subunits IL-27p28 and EBI3 of human IL-27 are usually coordinately expressed in antigen-presenting cells, while mouse IL-27p28 can be secreted independently to inhibit the activities of IL-27 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pflanz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stumhofer et al., 2010</xref>). The distinct production profile of IL-27p28 between humans and mice and our finding of the critical role of IL-27p28 in the maintenance of functional bias in newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may explain the much weaker autoimmune phenotype in <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice than <italic>AIRE</italic>-mutated human subjects. In addition, recent studies have reported elevation of serum IL-27p28 (also known as IL-30) in patients with prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sorrentino et al., 2019</xref>), psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Omar et al., 2021</xref>), and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). It would be interesting to explore the involvement of altered functionality of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under these pathological conditions.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that DC-derived IL-27p28 serves as an endogenous inhibitor for STAT1 hyper-activation in developing thymocytes. By regulating DNA and H3K4 methylation levels at the promoter and transcription regulatory regions of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic>, it is critically involved in the establishment of the functional bias against IFN-γ production by newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

For all samples, 10 reads per CpG site were used to determine the average percentage of methylated CpG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><p>ChIP assays were carried out by using Pierce Agarose Chip Kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Briefly, cells were cross-linked for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde and lysed with Nuclease. 10% of the digested chromatin was preserved as input control and the rest of the digested chromatin were incubated with specific antibody or normal IgG (as a control). The purified DNA from immunoprecipitation and the input samples were analyzed by qPCR using primers specific listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Data is presented as a percent input of each IP sample relative to input chromatin. The following antibodies were used in ChIP analysis: H3K4me3 (Millipore), H3K27me3 (Millipore), H3K9me3 (Abcam), and STAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blotting</title><p>For short-term TCR stimulation, CD4SP thymocytes and mature naive T cells were incubated with 2 µg/mL anti-mouse CD3 and 1 µg/mL anti-mouse CD28 on ice for 20 min, followed by cross-linking for 10 min at 37 °C with 5 μg/mL goat-anti-hamster IgG. Cells were then washed with PBS. Freshly isolated T cells or stimulated T cells were lysed in RIPA buffer for 30 min. Whole-cell lysates (5–10 μg per sample) were separated by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to phospho-STAT-1 (Tyr701), phospho-STAT-1 (Ser727), STAT-1, phospho-STAT-3 (Tyr705), STAT-3, phospho-STAT-4 (Tyr693), STAT-4, SOCS3 and Actin. HRP-conjugated anti-Rabbit IgG was used as the detection antibody. The bands were quantified using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from approximately 2×10<sup>6</sup> CD4SP thymocytes from WT and <italic>Cd11c-p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Each sample was a mixture of equal amounts of CD4SP thymocytes from three mice. RNA underwent quality control testing using a bionalayser followed by cDNA library preparation.

This phenotype turned out to be imposed by thymic dendritic cells (DCs) during CD4SP T cell development in the thymus [PMID: 23175475]. The current study affirms these observations, first, by developmentally mapping the IFNg dysregulation to newly generated thymic CD4SP cells [PMID: 23175475], second, by demonstrating increased STAT1 activation being associated with increased T-bet expression in CD11c-Cre p28-floxed CD4 T cells [PMID: 36109504], and lastly, by confirming IL-27 as the key cytokine in this process [PMID: 27469302]. The authors further demonstrate that such dysregulated cytokine expression is specific to the Th1 cytokine IFNg, without affecting the expression of the Th2 cytokine IL-4, thus proposing a role for thymic DC-derived p28 in shaping the cytokine response of newly generated CD4 helper T cells. Mechanistically, CD4SP cells of CD11c-Cre p28-floxed mice were found to display epigenetic changes in the Ifng and Tbx21 gene loci that were consistent with increased transcriptional activities of IFNg and T-bet mRNA expression. Moreover, in autoimmune Aire-deficiency settings, CD11c-Cre p28-floxed CD4 T cells still expressed significantly increased amounts of IFNg, exacerbating the autoimmune response and disease severity. Based on these results, the investigators propose a model where thymic DC-derived IL-27 is necessary to suppress IFNg expression by CD4SP cells and thus would impose a Th2-skewed predisposition of newly generated CD4 T cells in the thymus, potentially relevant in autoimmunity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Experiments are well-designed and executed. The conclusions are convincing and supported by the experimental results.</p><p>Weaknesses from the original round of review:</p><p>The premise of the current study is confusing as it tries to use the CD11c-p28 floxed mouse model to explain the Th2-prone immune profile of newly generated CD4SP thymocytes. Instead, it would be more helpful to (1) give full credit to the original study which already described the proinflammatory IFNg+ phenotype of CD4 T cells in CD11c-p28 floxed mice to be mediated by thymic dendritic cells [PMID: 23175475], and then, (2) build on that to explain that this study is aimed to understand the molecular basis of the original finding.</p><p>In its essence, this study mostly rediscovers and reaffirms previously reported findings, but with different tools. While the mapping of epigenetic changes in the IFNg and T-bet gene loci and the STAT1 gene signature in CD4SP cells are interesting, these are expected results, and they only reaffirm what would be assumed from the literature. Thus, there is only incremental gain in new insights and information on the role of DC-derived IL-27 in driving the Th1 phenotype of CD4SP cells in CD11c-p28 floxed mice.</p><p>Altogether, the major issues of this study remain unresolved:</p><p>(1) It is still unclear why the p28-deficiency in thymic dendritic cells would result in increased STAT1 activation in CD4SP cells. Based on their in vitro experiments with blocking anti-IFNg antibodies, the authors conclude that it is unlikely that the constitutive activation of STAT1 would be a secondary effect due to autocrine IFNg production by CD4SP cells. However, this possibility should be further tested with in vivo models, such as Ifng-deficient CD11c-p28 floxed mice. Alternatively, is this an indirect effect by other IFNg producers in the thymus, such as iNKT cells? It is necessary to explain what drives the STAT1 activation in CD11c-p28 floxed CD4SP cells in the first place.</p><p>(2) It is also unclear whether CD4SP cells are the direct targets of IL-27 p28.

We appreciate your input and have carefully reviewed the concerns raised regarding the premise and novelty of our study.</p><p>Indeed, the current study is built upon the foundational work of Zhang et al. (PMID: 23175475), which first described the proinflammatory IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> phenotype of CD4 T cells in CD11c-p28 floxed mice mediated by thymic dendritic cells. We have cited this study multiple times in our manuscript to acknowledge its significance. Our goal was to expand on this original finding by exploring the functional bias of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the hyper-Th1 phenotype in the absence of thymic DC-derived IL-27, and exploring its relevance in pathogenesis of autoimmunity.</p><p>Our study revisits this phenomenon with a focus on the molecular and epigenetic changes that drive the Th1 bias in CD4SP cells. We demonstrated that the deletion of p28 in thymic dendritic cells leads to an unexpected hyperactivation of STAT1, which is associated with epigenetic modifications that favor Th1 differentiation. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular basis behind the original observation of the Th1-skewed phenotype in CD11c-p28 floxed mice.</p><p>However, as you pointed out, there is still a gap in understanding the precise link between p28 deficiency and STAT1 activation. We acknowledge that our study primarily reaffirms previously reported findings with different tools and approaches. While the mapping of epigenetic changes in the IFN-γ and T-bet gene loci and the STAT1 gene signature in CD4SP cells are interesting, they are indeed expected results based on the existing literature. This limits the novelty and incremental gain in new insights provided by our study.</p><p>To address this gap and enhance the novelty of our findings, we plan to conduct further investigations to elucidate the detailed mechanisms connecting p28 deficiency to STAT1 hyperactivation.

Additionally, this approach will help exclude the possibility of indirect effects from other IFN-γ-producing cells in the thymus, such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>As you correctly pointed out, a key unanswered question is what drives the initial STAT1 activation in CD4SP cells of CD11c-p28 floxed mice. Our current hypothesis is that p28 deficiency enhances the responsiveness of developing thymocytes to STAT1-activating cytokines. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence:</p><p>(1) Functional Antagonism: Recent studies have shown that IL-27p28 can act as an antagonist of gp130-mediated signaling. This suggests that in the absence of p28, the inhibitory effect of IL-27p28 on downstream signaling may be lost, leading to increased sensitivity to other cytokines that activate STAT1.</p><p>(2) Structural Insights: Structural studies have demonstrated that IL-27p28 is centrally positioned within the complex formed with EBI3 and the two receptor subunits IL-27Rα and gp130. This positioning implies that p28 deficiency could disrupt the balance of cytokine signaling pathways involving these components.</p><p>(3) Phenotypic Similarity: We have observed a similar hyper-Th1 phenotype in mice lacking either p28 or IL-27ra. This similarity suggests that the absence of p28 may lead to increased availability of gp130 for signaling by other cytokines, thereby enhancing STAT1 activation.</p><p>Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that the deficiency of p28 results in a greater availability of gp130 to transduce signals from other cytokines, ultimately leading to enhanced STAT1 activation in CD4SP cells. To identify the specific cytokine(s) responsible for this effect, we will focus on gp130-related cytokines, as outlined in our response to Reviewer 1. This will involve reanalysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data and further experimental validation to pinpoint the candidate cytokines driving the observed STAT1 hyperactivation.</p><p>We are confident that these additional studies will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms linking p28 deficiency in thymic dendritic cells to increased STAT1 activation in CD4SP cells.

Given the ability of IL-27 to activate STAT3, this pathway should also be addressed. It would be of interest if STAT1 signaling is selectively impaired, as suggested by the work of Twohig et al.

Why was this geneset was chosen? It is true that IL-21 can activate STAT1 but STAT3 is typically viewed as its principal signaling pathway. There are many more appropriate genesets, especially from studies where T cells are cultured with traditional STAT1 stimuli (e.g. IL-27 in Hirahara et al., Immunity 2015 or interferons in Iwata et al., Immunity 2017)doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.04.014, 10.1016/j.immuni.2017.05.005.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We appreciate your attention to the choice of the STAT1 gene set in our RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>Initially, we selected the STAT1 gene set from a study involving IL-21 stimulation (GSE63204) because IL-21 is known to activate STAT1, despite STAT3 being its principal signaling pathway. However, we acknowledge that this choice may not have been optimal given the context of our study, which focuses on the role of IL-27 and its impact on STAT1 signaling in T cells.</p><p>We agree that gene sets derived from studies using more canonical STAT1 stimuli, such as IL-27 or interferons, would be more relevant for our analysis. In response to your suggestion, we have revised our approach and adopted a gene set from GSE65621, which compares STAT1-/- and wild-type CD4 T cells following IL-27 stimulation. This gene set is more aligned with the focus of our study and provides a more appropriate reference for identifying STAT1-activated genes.</p><p>Our re-analysis revealed that 270 genes (FPKM &gt; 1, log2FC &gt; 2) were downregulated in STAT1-/- cells compared to wild-type cells, which we defined as STAT1-activated genes. Notably, approximately 50% of the upregulated differentially expressed genes (55 out of 137) in our dataset fell into the category of STAT1-activated genes, while none were classified as STAT1-suppressed genes (Figure 4B). Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated significant enrichment of STAT1-activated genes in the transcriptome of CD4 SP thymocytes from the knockout mice (NES = 1.67, nominal p-value = 10<sup>-16</sup>, Figure 4D).</p><p>These findings support our conclusion that IL-27p28 deficiency leads to enhanced STAT1 activity in CD4 SP thymocytes. We believe that using a more relevant gene set has strengthened our analysis and provided clearer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotype.</p><p>We have cited the relevant studies (Hirahara et al., Immunity 2015; Iwata et al., Immunity 2017) to provide context for our revised analysis and to acknowledge the importance of canonical STAT1 stimuli in T cell signaling. We appreciate your guidance and are confident that these revisions have improved the robustness and relevance of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Given the ability of IL-27 to activate STAT1 in T cells, it is surprising that SP, RTE, and Tn cells from Cd11c-p28-flox mice exhibit more STAT1 signaling than WT controls.

The authors rule out autocrine IFN-g production in vitro (not in vivo) but provide no further insight.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important question. We appreciate your interest in understanding the source of enhanced STAT1 signaling in SP, RTE, and Tn cells from Cd11c-p28-flox mice, especially given the role of IL-27 in activating STAT1 in T cells.

However, this does little to explain the attendant hyper-Th1 phenotype. Is there evidence that epigenetic machinery is deregulated (to account for changes in DNA. histone methylation)? Were IFN-g and Tbet among these few observed DEG? If so, then this should be highlighted. If not, then the authors must address why not. Are there clues as to why STAT1 signing is exaggerated? Also, the hyper-STAT1 effect should be better described using more rigorous STAT1- and interferon-signature genesets (see the work of Virginia Pascual, Anne O'Garra).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback and suggestions. We appreciate your interest in understanding the mechanisms underlying the hyper-Th1 phenotype observed in Cd11c-p28-flox mice. Below, we address each of your points in detail:</p><p>(1) Epigenetic Regulation:</p><p>We have conducted a thorough analysis of the global levels of key histone modifications, including H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3, as well as the mRNA expression of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing these marks. Our results indicate that there are no significant differences in these histone modifications or the expression of the associated enzymes between Cd11c-<italic>p28f/f</italic> and wildtype mice (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A-C). This suggests that the enhanced STAT1 signaling is not a consequence of broad epigenetic deregulation. Instead, we hypothesize that the observed changes may be driven by more specific molecular mechanisms, such as cytokine signaling pathways.</p><p>(2) IFN-γ and Tbx21 Expression:</p><p>Regarding the expression of Th1-associated genes, our analysis revealed a modest induction of <italic>ifng</italic> and <italic>tbx21</italic> (encoding T-bet) in the CD4SP population following TCR stimulation. However, the baseline expression levels of these genes were quite low in freshly isolated CD4SP cells. Specifically, <italic>ifng</italic> was undetectable, and <italic>tbx21</italic> had an FPKM of 0.29 in wildtype mice compared to 1.05 in <italic>Cd11c-p28f/f</italic> mice. While these findings indicate some upregulation of Th1-associated genes, the overall expression levels remain relatively low, suggesting that additional factors may contribute to the hyper-Th1 phenotype.</p><p>(3) STAT1 Signature Genesets:</p><p>We have revised our analysis to incorporate more rigorous STAT1 and interferon-signature genesets, as suggested. We have adopted gene sets from well-established studies, including those by Virginia Pascual and Anne O'Garra, to provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of STAT1 signaling. This approach has enhanced our ability to identify and characterize the genes involved in the STAT1 pathway, providing clearer insights into the exaggerated STAT1 signaling observed in our model.</p><p>We appreciate your guidance and are committed to refining our analysis to provide a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms driving the hyper-Th1 phenotype in Cd11c-p28-flox mice. We will continue to explore the potential roles of cytokines such as IL-35 and CLCF1, as well as other factors that may contribute to the observed changes in STAT1 signaling and Th1 differentiation. We look forward to sharing our updated findings and further discussing these mechanisms in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Is the hyper-Th1 phenotype of SP, RTE, and Tn cells from Cd11c-p28-flox mice unique to the CD4 compartment? Are developing CD8<sup>+</sup> cells similarly prone to increased STAT1 signaling and IFN-g production?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. Our data indeed suggests that the hyper-Th1 phenotype observed in SP, RTE, and Tn cells from <italic>Cd11c-p28f/f</italic> mice is unique to the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment. Specifically, we found that while CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells from <italic>Cd11c-p28f/f</italic> mice exhibited a significant upregulation in IL-27 receptor expression (both IL27Ra and gp130) compared to wild-type (WT) mice, CD8<sup>+</sup> SP cells from the same genotype showed markedly lower expression of these receptor subunits (Figure 1C in Sci Rep. 2016 Jul 29:6:30448. DOI: 10.1038/srep30448). This finding is further supported by our observation that the phosphorylation levels of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4, downstream targets of IL-27 signaling, were comparable between CD8 SP cells from <italic>Cd11c-p28f/f</italic> and WT mice (Author response image 1). Additionally, we observed no significant difference in IFN-γ and granzyme B production between naïve CD8 T cells isolated from the lymph nodes of the two genotypes (Author response image 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the enhanced Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ production seen in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population from <italic>Cd11c-p28f/f</italic> mice is not recapitulated in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell lineage.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intracellular staining was performed with freshly isolated thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28f/f</italic> mice and WT littermates mice using antibodies against phosphorylated STAT1 (Y701), STAT3 (Y705), and STAT4 (Y693).
