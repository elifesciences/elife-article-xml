that the pyrenoid, a component of the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM), is essential for efficient photosynthesis at low CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the signal that triggers the formation of the pyrenoid has remained elusive. Here, we show that, in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, the pyrenoid is strongly induced by hyperoxia, even at high CO<sub>2</sub> or bicarbonate levels. These results suggest that the pyrenoid can be induced by a common product of photosynthesis specific to low CO<sub>2</sub> or hyperoxia. Consistent with this view, the photorespiratory by-product, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, induced the pyrenoid, suggesting that it acts as a signal. Finally, we show evidence for linkages between genetic variations in hyperoxia tolerance, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling, and pyrenoid morphologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pyrenoid</kwd><kwd>carbon concentrating mechanism</kwd><kwd>hyperoxia</kwd><kwd>hydrogen peroxide</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>chloromonas</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-91ER20021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neofotis</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Tessmer</surname><given-names>Oliver L</given-names></name><name><surname>Bibik</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollner</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucker</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Wijetilleke</surname><given-names>Sarathi</given-names></name><name><surname>Withrow</surname><given-names>Alecia</given-names></name><name><surname>Mogos</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Temple</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006584</institution-id><institution>ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neofotis</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Tessmer</surname><given-names>Oliver L</given-names></name><name><surname>Bibik</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollner</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucker</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Wijetilleke</surname><given-names>Sarathi</given-names></name><name><surname>Withrow</surname><given-names>Alecia</given-names></name><name><surname>Mogos</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name><name><surname>Frame</surname><given-names>Melinda</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Temple</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011138</institution-id><institution>AgBioResearch, Michigan State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The algal pyrenoid is formed at high O<sub>2</sub> levels, even when CO<sub>2</sub> is high, implying that a product of photosynthesis, most likely H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts as a signal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maximal primary productivity of algae is often determined by the efficiency of photosynthesis, which is strongly impacted by environmental factors. In turn, the products of photosynthesis can also impact local environmental conditions, leading to feedback- (or self-) limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Livansky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pulz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Raso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Torzillo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Vonshak et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Weissman et al., 1988</xref>). One important, but relatively little studied feedback factor is hyperoxia, which results when O<sub>2</sub> is emitted as a by-product of photosynthesis more rapidly than it diffuses away or is consumed by respiration. Microalgae cultures are often observed with dissolved oxygen levels of up to 100–400% of air – or even higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peng et al., 2013</xref>), especially when the local supply of inorganic carbon (C<sub>i</sub>) is high but consumption or diffusion of O<sub>2</sub> slow. In some species, hyperoxia constitutes a major hurdle in achieving low cost, highly productive micro-algae farms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peng et al., 2013</xref>). Hyperoxia has been directly associated with loss of productivity in a wide range of algal and cyanobacterial species, including <italic>Nannochroposis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Raso et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kliphuis et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Neochloris oleabundans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Peng et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sousa et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Ugwu et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>Spirulina (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Vonshak et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Despite being recognized as a problem, how hyperoxia interferes with photosynthetic growth is not fully understood, and various mechanisms have been proposed, including reactive oxygen (ROS)-induced damage to the photosynthetic machinery, membrane structure, DNA, and other cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marquez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Santabarbara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Ugwu et al., 2007</xref>). Another mechanism by which high O<sub>2</sub> has been proposed to decrease productivity is photorespiration, a process initiated when the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) enzyme fixes O<sub>2</sub> rather than CO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in the production of the toxic side product phosphoglycolate, which is detoxified through the photorespiratory pathway, at the cost of lost energy and the release of fixed carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bauwe et al., 2010</xref>). Oxygenation of rubisco can also result in the formation of rubisco inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim and Portis, 2004</xref>) that can further slow photosynthesis. If rubisco becomes inactivated, then ROS accumulation can lead to chlorosis and cell death, particularly in high light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Spreitzer and Mets, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Because photorespiration depends on competition between CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> at rubisco, it can also contribute to loss of productivity under low inorganic carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The current atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is well below the saturated concentration for rubisco’s carboxylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Raven et al., 2008</xref>) and CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses through aquatic environments 10,000 times slower than in air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Moroney and Ynalvez, 2007</xref>). Thus, many aquatic phototrophs, including the chlorophyte <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, possess carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) that concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> above its K<sub>M</sub> at rubisco, which has been reported to be 29 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jordan and Ogren, 1981</xref>) to 57 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berry et al., 1976</xref>), in order to increase the relative rates of carboxylation relative to oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizawa and Miyachi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badger et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>The expression and function of green algal CCMs in eukaryotic algae is highly regulated; cells grown on or below air levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (0.04%) develop active CCMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizawa and Miyachi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badger et al., 1980</xref>), whereas those grown with high CO<sub>2</sub> levels lack them, and thus show low apparent affinities for CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells grown at high CO<sub>2</sub> and rapidly transferred to low CO<sub>2</sub> show strong inhibition of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badger et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Spalding et al., 1983</xref>) until the CCM is induced and activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizawa and Miyachi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badger et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Manuel and Moroney, 1988</xref>). Induction can then result in about 25 % of all genes being affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). It is thought that this acclimation is mediated by some mechanism in the cell to sense CO<sub>2</sub> availability, although CCM1 (also known as CIA5), the regulatory gene and protein thought to control the induction of the CCM in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, is expressed at both high and low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fukuzawa et al., 2001</xref>). Analysis of the dark-to-light transition in synchronized <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells reveals that mechanisms, independent of gene transcription of known CCM components, are likely to play a role in the CCM’s induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>). The CCM in Chlorophytes involves a large number of components, including proteins that serve enzymatic and structural functions as well as a starch sheath that surrounds the pyrenoid, forming a subcellular compartment which acts as a trap to concentrate pumped inorganic carbon near localized rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mackinder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ramazanov et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Pyrenoids are thought to have evolved multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mackinder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Meyer et al., 2020a</xref>). The vast majority of data on pyrenoid formation is based on <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, where the pyrenoid forms by liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wunder et al., 2018</xref>), and several lines of evidence suggest that across the diverse lineages liquid-liquid phase separation is an integral part of pyrenoid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett et al., 2021</xref>). Although across algal lineages it appears that rubisco catalytic properties are CCM dependent, it remains difficult to differentiate limitations in carbon uptake versus the leakiness of CO<sub>2</sub> as the selective pressure operating on rubisco; more detailed physiological experiments are needed to deduce these and other competing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goudet et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, recent studies have indicated that a correctly formed starch sheath is required for normal pyrenoid operation of the CCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Itakura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Toyokawa et al., 2020</xref>), although one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Villarejo et al., 1996</xref>) had called that into question. Besides starch, the sheath contains several proteins which appear to be distributed over or in close proximity to the starch plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mackinder et al., 2017</xref>). The functional implication of these proteins, and their distribution patterns, remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Toyokawa et al., 2020</xref>). The starch plates are penetrated by tubule-like extensions of the thylakoid membranes, which are thought to supply CO<sub>2</sub> to the trapped rubisco by dehydration of luminal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mitra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Moroney and Ynalvez, 2007</xref>). How the organelle’s subcompartments of membrane tubules, surrounding phase separated rubisco matrix, and peripheral starch sheath are all held together is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Meyer et al., 2020b</xref>). Although, it has recently been found that some pyrenoid proteins share a sequence motif that is necessary to target proteins to the pyrenoid and bind to rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Meyer et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>Extensive genetic and biochemical studies have identified a large number of components essential for CCM function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodenough and Levine, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Itakura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Spalding et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Toyokawa et al., 2020</xref>). Of particular interest to the current work are factors that contribute to the pyrenoid compartment itself, especially those that affect the localization of rubisco within its starch sheath or those that modify the structure of the starch sheath. A range of mutants in diverse genetic components fail to form pyrenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodenough and Levine, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Spreitzer et al., 1985</xref>), or have altered pyrenoid ultrastructure with disorganized or missing starch sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Itakura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Toyokawa et al., 2020</xref>). These mutants tend to require high CO<sub>2</sub> for growth, emphasizing the importance of the pyrenoid structure for the function of the CCM.

Since both low CO<sub>2</sub> and hyperoxia involve a lowering of the CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> ratio, we hypothesized that (1) the pyrenoid is induced by hyperoxia; (2) that differences in its induction and/or formation can be related to hyperoxia tolerance. Furthermore, since both low CO<sub>2</sub> and hyperoxia result in increased photorespiration, we hypothesized that (3) the signal for pyrenoid formation might be a by-product of photorespiration, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

It has also been proposed to shield rubisco from high O<sub>2</sub> levels generated by PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKay and Gibbs, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Toyokawa et al., 2020</xref>). We thus initially hypothesized that: (1) the pyrenoid could be important for responses to hyperoxia and (2) differences in pyrenoid structure or regulation may then contribute to the distinct photosynthetic responses in the two lines. Consistent with these hypotheses, under saturating CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), the pyrenoid starch sheaths are not clearly discernable, in agreement with previous research showing that the pyrenoid starch sheath is not expressed under C<sub>i</sub> replete conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borkhsenious et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ramazanov et al., 1994</xref>).

The tolerant line, CC-1009, exhibited clearly defined, continuous starch sheath rings around its pyrenoid compartment, punctuated only in places where thylakoid tubules enter the pyrenoid matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

For the rapid sparging protocol, the estimated [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] under both normoxia and hyperoxia remained between 2 and 3 mM, and for the ‘raceway’ sparging protocol, between 1.3 and 1.7 mM a few minutes after sparging and 1.0–1.4 mM just prior to the following sparge. In all cases, the pH of the medium remained below 7.4. Thus, based on the known pK<sub>a</sub> values for the CO<sub>2</sub>/bicarbonate system, we estimate the lowest CO<sub>2</sub> levels experienced by the cultures, which occurred under raceway sparging conditions, remained above 100 µM, above the K<sub>m</sub> of rubisco (~29 μM – 57 μM) in <italic>Chlamydomonas (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berry et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jordan and Ogren, 1981</xref>). This is also in excess of the concentration found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Toyokawa et al., 2020</xref> to induce the formation of the pyrenoid starch sheath (2.1–3.1 μM).

Two of the progenies, designated c1_1 and c1_2, when exposed to hyperoxia, developed completely sealed and robust rings, like CC-1009, while two others, designated c1_3 and c1_4, showed fragmented, porous structures, like CC-2343 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These differences were even more apparent after 31 hr of hyperoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Strains with fragmented pyrenoids (CC-2343, c1_3 ad c1_4) showed an abrupt inhibition of growth after one day of exposure to hyperoxia, whereas those with sealed pyrenoids (CC-1009, c1_1 and c1_2) continued to grow rapidly and produce biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Both progeny with fragmented pyrenoid sheaths grew even more slowly than the sensitive parent, CC-2343.

These results suggest that the ultrastructural differences in the pyrenoid starch sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) are related to the observed tolerances of growth to hyperoxia in both parent and progeny lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the differences among the tolerant and sensitive lines, particularly the observation that the progeny have phenotypes more extreme than those of the parent lines, imply that additional genetic factors (beyond those that control pyrenoid morphology) likely contribute to productivity under hyperoxia.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cumulative biomass productivity following switching the bioreactors over to hyperoxia at dawn on day 0.</title><p>Strains CC-1009, c1_1, and c1_2, which all showed continuous, sealed pyrenoids at 6 hours (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) all continued to accumulate biomass after three days of hyperoxia, while CC-2343, c1_3, and c1_4, which had fragmented, porous pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) structures, did not, with daily productivities hovering at zero.

As the light levels increased over 6 hr, though, the pyrenoid structures still formed under raceway sparging. Rather than a specific light level, this could be because it takes several hours to form pyrenoid structures and that photosynthesis is likely required. Under these conditions, CC-1009, c1_1, and c1_2 exhibited more tightly structured pyrenoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), although the differences were not as great as those exhibited under hyperoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borkhsenious et al., 1998</xref>), pyrenoid formation was observed in all lines when cells were grown at high light and low CO<sub>2</sub>, but with some differences in morphology among the lines.

Prior to the traces, suspensions with 5 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> were sparged with air to establish low dissolved O<sub>2</sub> levels. At time zero, sparging was stopped and changes in dissolved O<sub>2</sub> were monitored with a luminescence-based O<sub>2</sub> sensor (see Materials and methods). The initial rise in O<sub>2</sub> reflects when the rate of net assimilation was maximal, under conditions when inorganic C supply was replete (5 mM HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and O<sub>2</sub> levels were low.

After about 20 min, the rise in O<sub>2</sub> levels slowed, eventually reaching quasi-steady-state levels that represented the ‘oxygen compensation point’ where O<sub>2</sub> evolution from PSII was counterbalanced by O<sub>2</sub> uptake. Switching off the actinic light at ~57 min led to O<sub>2</sub> uptake, the initial rate of which likely represents the gross O<sub>2</sub> uptake, which is counterbalanced by O<sub>2</sub> evolution. Nearly equal during steady-state illumination, the two canceled each other out during the periods of light exposure. For control cells, the O<sub>2</sub> compensation points (the O<sub>2</sub> levels when the rate of O<sub>2</sub> uptake balanced that of evolution) for CC-2343 and CC-1009 were approximately 1,070 and 1230 μM O<sub>2</sub> (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, implying, because it reaches the compensation point at a higher O<sub>2</sub> level, that CC-1009 was able to more effectively select for CO<sub>2</sub> uptake over O<sub>2</sub> reduction. The rates of uptake of O<sub>2</sub> after illumination were slightly slower in CC-2343 (36 μM O<sub>2</sub> min<sup>–1</sup>) than CC-1009 (44 μM O<sub>2</sub> min<sup>–1</sup>) indicating that the lower compensation point was caused by a combination of decreased linear electron flow and increased O<sub>2</sub> uptake. Strikingly, pre-treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> led to significant (p &lt; 0.05) increases in the O<sub>2</sub> compensation points for both CC-2343 and CC-1009, to about 1,233 and 1356 μM O<sub>2</sub> min<sup>–1</sup> respectively, confirming that treated cells were better able to discriminate between uptakes of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. After the cells reached (essentially) steady-state levels of O<sub>2</sub>, the actinic light was switched off. The initial slopes of O<sub>2</sub> uptake were then measured (by fitting the decay to pseudo-first order decay kinetics and taking the initial rate), to give an estimate of the rates of O<sub>2</sub> evolution and uptake. CC-1009 cells showed similar O<sub>2</sub> uptake slopes in treated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated (46 μM O<sub>2</sub> min<sup>–1</sup>) and untreated (44 μM O<sub>2</sub> min<sup>–1</sup>) suspensions, likely indicating that the rates of electron flow were also similar, but that the preferential fluxes of electron into assimilation allowed for a greater accumulation of O<sub>2</sub> in the treated cells. By contrast, CC-2343 cells showed a significant increase in the initial slopes of O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the treated (42 μM O<sub>2</sub> min<sup>–1</sup>) compared to control (36 μM O<sub>2</sub> min<sup>–1</sup>) suspensions, suggesting that the high O<sub>2</sub> levels suppressed overall rates of linear electron flow (LEF) in the untreated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Oxygen evolution of strain CC-2343 (Panel <bold>A</bold>) and CC-1009 (Panel <bold>B</bold>) with and without the pre-treatment of 100 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>Shading represents 95 % confidence intervals between the three biological replicates for each treatment.

We also measured the levels to which CO<sub>2</sub> above a cell suspension can be decreased by photosynthesis. We call this parameter the C<sub>i</sub> compensation point because it reflects the competition between assimilatory CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and the sum of photorespiration and respiration, regardless of whether the uptake occurs through diffusion and direct fixation of CO<sub>2</sub>, or the active pumping of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by the CCM (see Methods for details).

Importantly, CC-5357 cells grown under low light and high CO<sub>2</sub>, but treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, also showed a low Ci compensation point (25±4.5 ppm), indicating that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced pyrenoid can act effectively in the CCM. We thus conclude that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced pyrenoid can act to exclude O<sub>2</sub> and/or trap CO<sub>2</sub> pumped by the CCM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>The induction of pyrenoid biosynthesis under hyperoxia and the role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></title><p>Photosynthesis can be inhibited by one of its major products, molecular oxygen.

Both parent lines in our study and all progeny showed low CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent pyrenoid formation. When cells were sparged with 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> for one minute every hour and under normoxia (~21%), the pyrenoid starch sheaths dissociated at night. This result was consistent with previous observations which demonstrated that starch formation around the pyrenoid is correlated with light and the state of the CCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borkhsenious et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kuchitsu et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lin and Carpenter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ramazanov et al., 1994</xref>). Also consistent with the cited previous work, low-light with mixotrophic conditions resulted in rubisco delocalization. We further show that the most complete degree of rubisco delocalization occurs when algae is grown on a TAP agar plate exposed to air, rather than aquatically in liquid TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At high light, pyrenoids were formed even when CO<sub>2</sub> or bicarbonate levels were maintained at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), agreeing with previous assertions that light plays a role in pyrenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kuchitsu et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lin and Carpenter, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, we also observed strong pyrenoid formation, with especially tight, thick and well-sealed starch sheaths in CC-1009, c1_1, and c1_2 under hyperoxia (95 % O<sub>2</sub>), despite the high CO<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One possible explanation for this observation is that an in-common by-product of photosynthesis and photorespiration under low CO<sub>2</sub> and hyperoxia acts to induce pyrenoid formation. Hydrogen peroxide is an obvious candidate for such a role because it is well-documented to act as a signal molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foyer et al., 2009</xref>) and its production is increased under high light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Roach et al., 2015</xref>), high O<sub>2</sub> as a misfired product of oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim and Portis, 2004</xref>) or low CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foyer et al., 2009</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is also a product of the light reactions, through an alternative electron acceptor pathway such as the Mehler peroxidase reaction (MPR) or the water-water cycle, which is expected to be more active under conditions when light input exceeds the capacity of assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Osmond et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mehler, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Strizh, 2008</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can also be produced as a by-product of photorespiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Janssen et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> possesses two pathways for oxidation of glycolate during photorespiration, one involving glycolate oxidase in the peroxisome, which uses O<sub>2</sub> as an electron acceptor and produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and another involving glycolate dehydrogenase (GLYDH) in the mitochondrion, which uses ubiquinone as an electron acceptor and presumably does not produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Janssen et al., 2014</xref>). A reasonable explanation is that, under conditions of high light, low CO<sub>2</sub> or high O<sub>2</sub> production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the glycolate pathway can act as a signal to induce pyrenoid formation.</p><p>We found that in autotrophically grown cells, exogenous addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of light strongly induced within approximately 6 hr the formation pyrenoid starch sheaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig23">Appendix 1—figure 23</xref>), and caused rubisco to localize into the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not induce the pyrenoid when the cells were kept in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig24">Appendix 1—figure 24</xref>). The starch sheaths formed after addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> had tight, thick structures in both parent lines, though CC-1009 seemed to still display slightly more robust starch plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These structural changes were accompanied by increased O<sub>2</sub> compensation points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), indicating an increased ability to discriminate between O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> as O<sub>2</sub> levels increased. Our working hypothesis is that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced formation of pyrenoids with tight sheaths allowed the accumulation of higher concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> at the active site of rubisco, outcompeting or shielding out higher levels of O<sub>2</sub>. Further, the formation of these pyrenoids enhance the discrimination of CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>, implying that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induction of pyrenoids could convey performance advantages under hyperoxia. Consistent with this hypothesis, the induction of the CCM has been found to be coordinated with that of genes for photorespiratory enzymes, although the specific metabolic control of this co-regulation had remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Tirumani et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, a separate RNA expression study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blaby et al., 2015</xref>) did not show strong induction of pyrenoid components by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but, importantly, was conducted on TAP-grown cells, which we found do not show H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced formation of the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig20">Appendix 1—figure 20</xref>).</p><p>Debate remains about the signal that induces the CCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spalding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Spalding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vance and Spalding, 2005</xref>), which consists not only of the pyrenoid but also the inorganic carbon transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Spalding, 2008</xref>) and carbonic anhydrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Moroney et al., 2011</xref>); some have argued that the signal is CO<sub>2</sub> itself, while others have proposed that the signal is a metabolite produced under low CO<sub>2</sub> during photosynthesis or photorespiration. The later, termed the ‘metabolic signal hypothesis,’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spalding, 2009</xref>) proposed that photorespiratory intermediates could serve as a trigger for CCM induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marcus et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Suzuki et al., 1990</xref>). The hypothesis was rooted in observations that, unlike wild type cells, various photosynthetic mutants did not exhibit CCM activity under low CO<sub>2</sub>, and that CCM induction in wild type cells required light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dionisio et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dionisio et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dionisio-Sese et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Spalding and Ogren, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Spencer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Tirumani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Villarejo et al., 1996</xref>).

Similar results have been found in several <italic>Chlorella</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Matsuda and Colman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shiraiwa and Miyachi, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Umino et al., 1991</xref>), suggesting that the induction of at least some CCM components can occur in the dark. However, it is unclear how relevant these results are, considering that the pyrenoid is not formed in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kuchitsu et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lin and Carpenter, 1997</xref>). It was also found in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> that changing O<sub>2</sub> levels (from 2% to 20%) did not affect growth, photosynthetic rate, or the induction of periplasmic carbonic anhydrase (Cah1) or glycolate dehydrogenase (Gdh) genes, over a wide range of CO<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vance and Spalding, 2005</xref>). It is worth noting, though, that none of these previous experiments were conducted under true hyperoxia (O<sub>2</sub> levels above partial pressure of 21%), where we observe strong induction of the pyrenoid, and thus they do not exclude product signaling under our observed conditions.</p><p>There remains the possibility of multiple signals for the CCM. There is differential regulation of low CO<sub>2</sub> induced polypeptides in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, with some only being induced in the light, while for others light is not necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Villarejo et al., 1996</xref>). Also, the observation that there are multiple acclimation states, with some mutants tolerant to very low CO<sub>2</sub> but not low CO<sub>2</sub>, suggests the existence of multiple types of signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Spalding et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings that a key aspect of the CCM, the pyrenoid, can be induced, even under high CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e. with hyperoxia and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) disproves, to our knowledge for the first time, that low CO<sub>2</sub> is a necessary condition for any aspect of CCM induction. Our results lead us to propose that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a by-product of photosynthesis, particularly under low CO<sub>2</sub> and high O<sub>2</sub>, may fulfill the previous proposed ‘metabolic’ signal. Hydrogen peroxide is widely known to be a signal for a variety of stress related responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blaby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zalutskaya et al., 2019</xref>), and has been found to alter the state of redox homeostasis in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pokora et al., 2018</xref>). It has also been assigned roles in regulating a range of photosynthetic and associated processes in plants and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foyer and Noctor, 2009</xref>), particularly those related to responses to CO<sub>2</sub> levels and the induction of photorespiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foyer et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, in higher plants, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been suggested to play a role in the response to varying levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foyer et al., 2009</xref>). For example, <italic>Sorghum</italic> (C<sub>4</sub>) plants grown under conditions with lower amounts of photorespiration (i.e. elevated CO<sub>2</sub>) have decreased thickening of the bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Watling et al., 2000</xref>), which, since they restrict the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> out of bundle sheath cells and thereby allow for efficient capture by rubisco, can be interpreted as structures analogous to the starch sheath of the pyrenoid.</p><p>Hydrogen peroxide has also been implicated in regulating cyclic electron flow (CEF) in vascular plants, both by inducing the expression of the thylakoid Complex I (or NDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Casano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gambarova, 2008</xref>) and by activation of existing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Strand et al., 2015</xref>). It is not known, however, if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts directly as a signaling agent, or indirectly, for example by altering the activities of assimilatory enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Strand et al., 2015</xref>) possibly through redox balancing enzymes such as the peroxiredoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Vaseghi et al., 2018</xref>). CEF is thought also to play central role in providing the energy needed to power CCMs, including that in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lucker and Kramer, 2013</xref>). Our findings indicating that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may be the signal for the synthesis of a central component of the CCM, the pyrenoid, suggests that a common molecular by-product of photorespiration can set off a coordinated response; inducing the formation of the pyrenoid and also the metabolic processes to power the pumping of bicarbonate into it.</p><p>It has been argued that mixotrophic conditions alter the relationship between the onset of photorespiration and the expression of the CCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Tirumani et al., 2019</xref>), and that photorespiration, hydrogen peroxide detoxification, and acetate assimilation (i.e. the glyoxolate cycle) are all localized in the peroxisomal microbodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lauersen et al., 2016</xref>). In this regard, it is intriguing that ROS labeling under hyperoxia was strongly localized in CC-1009 but not CC-2342 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), hinting that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced in a specific subcellular location and process may play a role in the differential development of the pyrenoid in the two parent lines, as discussed below. Taken together, these data sets are consistent with control of pyrenoid morphology at multiple levels, perhaps similar to the processes that regulate the expression of LHCSR3, involved in photoprotective nonphotochemical quenching, which is regulated by light quality and CO<sub>2</sub> availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Maruyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Semchonok et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies can also investigate how hyperoxia plays a role in the gene regulatory network for antennae size, which has been shown to be affected by low CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blifernez-Klassen et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Possible linkages between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling, pyrenoid morphology and natural variations in responses to hyperoxia</title><p>By comparing genetically distinct isolates and their progeny, one can potentially explore possible mechanistic bases for responses to hyperoxia. We present here data from a limited set of progeny, which nevertheless reveals a segregation pattern which allows us to test certain future hypotheses. A more detailed analysis of a large number of progeny will be presented elsewhere. The most striking differences we observed between the lines were in the morphology of the pyrenoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), with the hyperoxia tolerant lines (CC-1009, c1_1, c1_2) showing thick, tightly sealed starch sheaths, while the sensitive lines (CC-2343, c1_3, c1_4) tending to have pores or gaps in the starch sheaths, suggesting that structural/functional differences in these sub-organelle compartments may play a role in the distinct responses to high O<sub>2</sub>. That the miotic progeny with reduced biomass accumulation and fractured starch sheaths exhibited 2:2 segregation suggests that the phenotype variations were due to allelic differences in the nuclear genes. These differences appear to be most obvious during hyperoxia, and all lines showed disappearance of the pyrenoid structures under high CO<sub>2</sub>/low light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>). Most interestingly, exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> led to synthesis of thick, tight pyrenoids in all lines, implying that the distinct morphologies is caused at least in part from differences in signaling, rather than structural components.</p><p>Given the possibility that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts as a signal for pyrenoid biosynthesis, we tested for differences in its production under hyperoxia. Only in CC-1009 does H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increase under hyperoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, the localization of ROS production assessed by H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA fluorescence in confocal microscopy showed distinct localization patterns, with CC-1009 showing strongly localized dye fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and D</xref>), whereas CC-2343 showed diffuse staining throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and C</xref>). Because the H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA is a general ROS indicator, it is not possible to unambiguously identify the specific reactive oxygen species, but one possible interpretation is that different localization patterns reflect the mechanism of ROS formation. The localized staining in CC-1009 is consistent with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced in the peroxisome through photorespiration. By contrast, in CC-2343, the diffuse staining may reflect a range of different ROS, including but not limited to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>•<bold>–</bold></sup> produced by excitation of the light reactions and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Osmond et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>We have several hypotheses regarding why the two lines may have differences in the signaling and formation of their pyrenoid starch sheaths. One is that there might be variations in the strains’ utilization of the alternative photorespiration route that uses the glycolate dehydrogenase (GLYDH) enzyme, a route which does not result in hydrogen peroxide formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Janssen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, in the future we will investigate how the pyrenoid ameliorates the stresses of hyperoxia, with possibilities beyond photorespiration. Our rubisco assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggest that increased O<sub>2</sub> fixation or ROS production may lead to greater inhibition of rubisco in CC-2343 compared to CC-1009, possibly leading or concomitant to a general breakdown of the cell’s machinery, as evidenced by the lower autotrophic grow rates of CC-2343 at high O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and lower rates of oxygen evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Such a model is also consistent with the diffuse ROS staining observed in CC-2343, as the mismatch in light input and downstream assimilatory capacity could result in the accumulation of not just H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but also <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Peng et al., 2016b</xref>), forms of ROS that may reflect high levels of oxidative damage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Eco-physiological implications</title><p>For over a hundred years it has been known that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains show distinct pyrenoid structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pasher, 1918</xref>), although the physiological implications of these natural variations remain poorly understood. A few studies have noted structural differences in pyrenoid starch sheaths, and linked these differences to environmental CO<sub>2</sub> or organic carbon availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Morita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Morita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nozaki et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, it is well established that the pyrenoid can allow algae to overcome critical limitations of low CO<sub>2</sub> levels often encountered in aqueous environments. However, under very high CO<sub>2</sub> levels, which are also encountered in certain environments, the sequestering of rubisco into the pyrenoid may impose rate limitations, or additional energy requirements, at the level of pumping of bicarbonate. Also, when rubisco is outside of the pyrenoid, it is thought that more of its surface area is exposed and its catalytic rate increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Badger et al., 1998</xref>). A fragmented starch sheath may more easily allow migration in and out of the pyrenoid matrix. In two species of <italic>Gonium</italic>, the species with the more porous starch sheaths exhibited a higher ratio of rubisco migrating out of the pyrenoid in response to the addition of sodium acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nozaki et al., 1994</xref>).

For example, <italic>Coccomyxa</italic>, an aerial grown lichen photobiont, completely lacks pyrenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Palmqvist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Palmqvist et al., 1995</xref>). Compared to that in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> prefers CO<sub>2</sub> as a substrate over HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, similar to C<sub>3</sub> plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Palmqvist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Palmqvist et al., 1995</xref>). It is important to note, though, that exposure to air allows for rapid diffusion of O<sub>2</sub>: Even high rates of photosynthesis in <italic>Coccomyxa</italic> will not result in hyperoxia. In light of these studies, it seems fitting that CC-2343 and the progeny with porous pyrenoids grew better on a TAP plate exposed to air, and that rubisco most freely distributes through the chloroplast in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> when grown mixotrophically exposed to air, rather than aquatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, green algae can generate strongly hyperoxic conditions in the water specifically when inorganic carbon is plentiful. Our demonstration that pyrenoids are induced under these conditions suggests that they can function, in addition to overcoming slow assimilation when CO<sub>2</sub> is limiting, in preventing damage caused by high levels of the product O<sub>2</sub>. Inducing the CCM should both increase the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> above its K<sub>M</sub> at rubisco and outcompete O<sub>2</sub> at the rubisco active site. Higher O<sub>2</sub> levels (under hyperoxia) will require correspondingly higher local CO<sub>2</sub> levels, in turn requiring tighter diffusional barriers to the escape of CO<sub>2</sub> from the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yamano et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible that the tight starch sheaths will partially block O<sub>2</sub> from diffusing into the pyrenoid, and if the uptake of O<sub>2</sub> by rubisco is faster than its replacement by diffusion across the sheath, such a barrier could effectively decrease the O<sub>2</sub> levels in the matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The work presented above leads us to propose that, under combinations of light, high O<sub>2</sub> and/or low CO<sub>2</sub>, the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> becomes elevated, activating the formation of the pyrenoid and thickening of the starch sheath, leading to the classical response that allows cells to better discriminate between CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizawa and Miyachi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badger et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borkhsenious et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Manuel and Moroney, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ramazanov et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Spalding et al., 1983</xref>). We demonstrate that the pyrenoid, a key component of the algal CCM, can be induced under high CO<sub>2</sub>, by hyperoxia or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Our results strengthen the ‘metabolite signaling hypothesis,’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spalding, 2009</xref>), which can explain the regulation of pyrenoid formation by multiple photosynthetic conditions, including CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and its light dependence. Our results further suggest that differences in this signaling contribute, at least in part, to the observed natural varaition in pyrenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pasher, 1918</xref>) as well as tolerances to hyperoxia. Several open questions remain, including whether a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signal works alone or in conjunction with a CO<sub>2</sub> signal for some aspects of the CCM, the precise nature and scope of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> response, the biochemical and genetic components involved, and whether more robust pyrenoid structures, by themselves, can improve growth under hyperoxia.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Joseph Weissman is affiliated with ExxonMobil.

These images, along with those with the Olympus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicate a clear change in rubisco localization, rather the simply a change in rubisco amount. Since confocal microscopy is designed to acquire a very thin optical section through the thickness of a single cell, it can be difficult to use confocal fluorescence microscopy to accurately measure total protein content within the 3-dimensional volume of a single cell. Acquisition of several images through the thickness of the cell may actually over estimate or under estimate the total fluorescence intensity, depending on the Z-step increment. However, when comparing these images of Venus Fluorescent Protein-labeled rubisco within <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells acquired using the Nikon A1 confocal microscope, the fluorescence intensity of the pyrenoid matrix of most cells under control conditions (5 mM bicarbonate, no H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment) was similar to or dimmer than the fluorescence intensity of the pyrenoid matrix within cells treated for six hours with 100 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the Venus Fluorescent Protein-labeled rubisco located outside of the pyrenoid matrix was measurably higher in cells under control conditions compared to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. If the decrease in Venus Fluorescent Protein-labeled rubisco fluorescence located outside of the pyrenoid matrix in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells was due to an overall decrease in rubisco production within the cell and not due to delocalization of the protein from the pyrenoid to the cytoplasm of the cell, then fluorescence intensity of the pyrenoid within H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells should show a comparable decrease in fluorescence intensity, which is not seen. Fluorescence was detected using 0.5 % 514 nm diode laser intensity. Fluorescence emission was recorded through 565/70 nm band pass filter using a Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (GaASP) detector (High Voltage = 47, offset –7).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67565-app1-fig17-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig18" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 18.</label><caption><title>Localization of rubisco, control cells (Panel A), cells exposed to 0.1 μM methyl viologen (Panel B), and 8 mM metronidazole (Panel C) visualized by an Olympus FluoView 1,000 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, in strain CC-5357, containing a RBCS1-Venus tag.</title><p>Scale bar = 10 μm.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67565-app1-fig18-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig19" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 19.</label><caption><title>Strain CC-5357, containing a RbcS1-Venus, with Chlorophyll shown in red and RbcS1-Venus in yellow.</title><p>All cells were grown with 14:10 hour (light:dark) sinusoidal illumination with peak light intensity of 2000 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PAR, in HS media.

The average fluorescence intensity of the localized Venus Fluorescent Protein-labeled rubisco within the pyrenoids of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells was measured using the Nikon A1 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. Because the tagged rubisco was expressed with a PsaD (Photosystem I reaction center subunit II) promoter, the fluorescent signal may not be a conclusive proxy for rubisco amount and cannot be attributed to transcriptional responses to hyperoxia. However, the results are consistent with the fluorescent-tagged rubisco accumulating to a greater extent in the pyrenoids of cells exposed to hyperoxia, similar to what has been observed when cell are exposed to low CO<sub>2</sub>. Panel D shows the mean intensity of the Venus-tagged rubisco of the three treatments. Panels A, B, and C show representative images used to quantify this mean intensity.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agree that the presentation of the manuscript should be dramatically revised to improve readability. Generally, figures should be consistently organized, single panel figures should be combined into meaningful multipaneled figures, and the text should be refined. Please see specific suggestions made by each reviewer (particularly Reviewer #4) for detailed guidance.</p><p>2) Currently, the pyrenoid formation phenotypes under different conditions are descriptive and should be supported by quantification of multiple cells. Please add quantification of TEM images and appropriate statistical analyses. Additionally, please add further quantitative analysis of the Venus-RuBisCO line under additional conditions (see comments from Reviewer #1).</p><p>3) The finding that pyrenoid formation can be induced by hydrogen peroxide is exciting, but it remains unresolved whether CCM is also induced under these conditions, or whether, as Reviewer 1 suggests, the pyrenoid and starch sheath might act to exclude O2. This important question could be addressed by assessing the induction of CCM by measuring affinity for Ci under different conditions and for the different genotypes. If these experiments are not conducted, please revise the discussion to include the distinction between the induction of pyrenoid structure, which has been thoroughly studied in this work, and the induction of CCM, which has not yet been addressed by the experiments presented here.</p><p>4) Reviewer #3 made some excellent suggestions about using published datasets to generate hypotheses about the genetic basis of the responses documented in this paper. These analyses are not strictly necessary as part of a revised manuscript but are very constructive and pragmatic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Presentation: The homogeneity of the different TEM Figures (and their legends) made it challenging to follow the manuscript. In every Figure it required some effort to find the specific growth conditions employed in the legend, and to independently interpret the implications. The first suggestion would be to ensure the Lead sentence of the Legend summarizes the main interpretation/finding communicated by the Figure. In addition it would help greatly if every Figure (and Supplementary Figure) showing TEM or light microscopy images of cells were supplemented with a standardized visual legend (possibly including some schematic cues) that clearly allowed rapid assessment of the growth conditions used (light, minimal media, hyperoxia, high CO2 etc.. ).</p><p>Points for improvement:</p><p>Clearly the findings shown leave many questions unaddressed, as is to be expected for a significant novel discovery. There is a key question that I am surprised was not addressed however. The induction of the CO2 concentrating mechanism is generally assessed by measuring the photosynthetic affinity for Ci. High CO2 acclimated cells have a much lower affinity than CCM induced cells. Since the work only addresses the pyrenoid, it would be extremely informative to understand whether the cells acclimated to hyperoxia (or H2O2) and 5% CO2 now also possess a high affinity for Ci. If not, it could support the notion that the pyrenoid and starch sheath here then really acts to exclude O2, rather than forming part of a powered CCM. It would also have profound energetic implications.</p><p>The introduction of the strain expressing fluorescently labelled Rubisco is critical to the manuscript. It provides powerful data, as shown in Figure 11b for instance, that pyrenoid formation (or Rubisco localization) is highly homogenous among large numbers of cells. This is in contrast to the majority of pyrenoid data in the manuscript that largely relies on representative images, and does not easily permit generation of quantitative data regarding pyrenoid formation. So it is somewhat surprising that this strain was not utilized a bit more extensively to generate quantitative data regarding the effect of the H2O2, hyperoxia, the speed of the response etc. (rather than the 6h and 31h timepoints that are shown now).</p><p>If such data exists, well-presented inclusion would greatly enhance the manuscript.</p><p>Detailed points:</p><p>1. P.13L16 – here it is stated that the conditions are not hyperoxia, but the Legend to Figure 6 (p.15) states sparging with 95%O2. I assume this is a mistake? Or does this refer to the different types of sparging? This needs to be much clearer for every Figure as pointed out above.</p><p>2. P14 Figure 5 legend – specify 5% CO2 in air.</p><p>3. P18: Here additional chemicals are utilized that induce internal H2O2. In addition, H2O2 scavengers are shown to prevent pyrenoid formation. The readout is the representative light microscopy images, where pyrenoid starch can be discerned. Were these experiments also performed for the fluorescent Rubisco strain? This would strengthen the data and the conclusions.</p><p>4. P22: Figure 11 (and 13)- the scale bars are invisible in these panels</p><p>5. P23: Figure 12 – why are there units on the y axis, if what is shown is normalized values?</p><p>6. P25: On this page especially, it is very noticeable in many instances that numbers are being reported to meaningless significant figures. E.g. what does 104.28 μm O2 min-1 mean? Does your instrument permit this type of accuracy? Do your replicates suggest that the numbers after the decimal point have any scientific meaning? Reasonable numbers of significant figures should be reported in the text to enhance readability. Numbers in biology by Ron Milo (available online) provides good guidance.</p><p>7. P27L17 – Kim and Portis 2004 relates to H2O2 production by Rubisco directly (misfire product of oxygenation). Oxidation of glycolate during photorespiration in the peroxisome is a separate issue. This is currently not clear in the description.</p><p>8. P41: Supplementary Material Table 2: If immunoblotting is maintained in the manuscript, then these antibodies need to be correctly described here with catalogue number etc.</p><p>9. Regarding Supplementary Figure 4: At this point the immunoblot finding does not really play a role in the manuscript/ negative finding. I understand here an unusual capillary method is utilized, it is very difficult to understand the outcome, and validity of the experiment. I can see the authors have utilized the method previously in Du Plant Cell 2018. At this point I would advise removing this data, or carefully presenting it, permitting it to be critically scrutinized (e.g. is it possible to assess equal loading- Ponceau equivalent etc..). There is great variability shown – is there any meaning?</p><p>10. On a related note, there are a number of proteins known to change in abundance when the CCM is induced. Were any of these probed (e.g. LCIB,C)? These could have potentially given more insights?</p><p>11. P51: Legend: how many micrographs were analyzed here for the morphometric analysis?</p><p>12. P55: Legend: greatly elaborate here what the specific conditions were. Maybe mention that this experiment is to explain/is consistent with the finding of Blaby et al. 2015 (no CCM induction on TAP medium.) (also in the text on page 20, at the moment the rationale of this experiment is not quite clear until we get to the discussion)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript presents exciting novel insights into the induction of the pyrenoid in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and goes some way to probe a mechanistic explanation for this. Whilst a good job of probing the cellular response to hyperoxia is done, a genetic basis for these cellular changes is the obvious omittance that needs addressing to strengthen the manuscript. The recommendations below pertaining to this point are not necessarily requirements, but suggestions that the authors could further explore to try and identify the underlying genetic cause of the pyrenoid response to H2O2. Other recommendations refer to specific points of the existing methodologies that could be improved.</p><p>Suggestions for highlighting the genetic basis for pyrenoid response to hyperoxia:</p><p>Genomic analysis:</p><p>– Using data from the cited Jang and Ehrenreich 2012 paper, a genomic comparison between the strains used in the study could be completed to identify genetic candidates for that underpin the differences in strain response.</p><p>– If candidate genetic variants are found, simple comparisons between isolates with analogous genetic variations could provide a satisfactory starting point for the genetic explanation for the observed phenotypes.</p><p>Transcriptomic analysis:</p><p>– Transcriptomic comparison between strains upon H2O2 exposure or hyperoxia could give considerable insights into the underlying mechanism and also allow a time-course analysis of the induction process.</p><p>– A more targeted transcriptomic approach, following identification of candidate genes/pathways by other means (or based on your suggested pathways) could also provide satisfactory genetic evidence.</p><p>Mutant analysis:</p><p>– Phenotypic analysis of mutants in appropriate pathways (H202 production etc.) that show perturbed pyrenoid induction would provide convincing genetic evidence.</p><p>– Analysis of the huge dataset from Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2020 (BioRxiv), where pooled mutant collections were exposed to a wide range of chemical/growth conditions including H2O2, should allow identification of strong candidate genes in this process that could be further investigated.</p><p>Other general points:</p><p>Overall, the presentation of data in figures could be greatly improved.</p><p>– Several figures could be combined: Figures 1/2 can be combined and panelled, and should include non-treated cells as an introduction to the 'steady-state' morphology of these cells.</p><p>– Some figures should be swapped between the main text and supplementary information: Figures S3 and S11 should be incorporated in main text. Figure 4 should be moved to the supplementary information.</p><p>– Some figures are unclear: The methodology and labelling of S4 is unclear to the reader. Figure 10C labelling consistency with other figures. Light microscopy in figure S15 and S21 shows contrary evidence to in-text work.</p><p>Currently only light microscopy is used to assess pyrenoid phenotypes in a few instances, particularly where compound treatments are concerned. TEM images, and/or morphometric quantification of treatments potentially alongside quantification of pyrenoid localisation by confocal microscopy should be employed to thoroughly address the claims made in the text (pertaining to figures S12/13/14/15). The sporadic reuse of re-cropped images of the same cells (in figure S12/13), imaging of small cells (S14/15) and contradictory images (S15) should be addressed if these figures are kept also.</p><p>The authors could provide a better framing for the work in the place of significant recent literature in both the introduction and discussion. The introduction to the molecular details of pyrenoid assembly (P3, lines 1-9) fall short and should either be described in full or the reader referred to recent appropriate reviews of literature (Barrett et al., 2021; Wunder et al., 2020; Meyer, Goudet and Griffiths, 2020). Specific recent literature missing from the introduction and directly applicable to the study include Meyer et al., 2020, Sci. Adv. and Fei et al., 2021, bioRxiv. A better introduction to the current understanding of CCM/pyrenoid induction in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> could also be provided (see Fukuzawa et al., 2001, PNAS; Mitchell et al., 2014, Plant Physiology; Fang et al., 2012, Plant Cell). For the discussion, the authors should consider the physiological implications of an ROS-based signal for pyrenoid induction. The authors should also consider integrating recent literature on CCM induction upon limiting CO2 (Blifernez-Klassen et al., 2021, The Plant Cell) in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, and how this hyperoxia response may fit into this network.</p><p>To ease comprehension for readers, and related to the above, it would be hugely beneficial for the authors to schematically summarise the findings of the study in the context of what is already known about pyrenoid-induced states in differing nutrient states.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>These are comments in addition to observations and concerns expressed in my public review. The following comments and suggestions are meant to help enhance clarity, and even though I have proposed additional experimental work, I like to re-iterate that most of the experiments would exceed the scope of this work. It may be worthwhile though to use them as discussion points.</p><p>The two key findings, hypoxia induced pyrenoid formation and H2O2 signalling are very well demonstrated and represent exciting new insight into pyrenoid function. The manuscript addresses many interesting details but leaves also certain observation a little unexplained and confusing.</p><p>Since pyrenoid function is central to this research, the introduction would prepare the reader better if pyrenoid structure and function, as known mostly from studies of the CCM, was described in detail. Likewise, an overview of H2O2 signalling and ROS signalling, particularly in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, would add helpful background information. In this context, a more detailed review of the CCM and pyrenoid structure and function in particular would help in particular to follow the rationale and conclusions of the physiological analyses presented.</p><p>I suggest to modify the hypotheses and leave out reference to identifying genetic loci since gene identification is not part of the work presented.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The Induction of Pyrenoid Synthesis by Hyperoxia and its Implications for the Natural Diversity of Photosynthetic Responses in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Overall, the text has improved, but reviewer 5 found some changes that should be made to the final version to improve clarity and concision of the title and text.</p><p>2) The figures are also improved, but will still benefit from more consistent and careful preparation. The third reviewer makes some excellent suggestions in the last paragraph of their review, particularly regarding image cropping and arrangement; the choice of images (inconsistent planes of section in TEM and inconsistent white balancing in light microscopy); lettering size, position, and font; scale bar size and position; the use and appearance of statistics; and the use of different colours across different figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My comments have been satisfactorily addressed in this revision. The manuscript is now much easier to follow. Combining the EM panels into one Figure 2 is especially helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my view, the authors have addressed all of the previous reviewer's points very satisfactorily.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved with respect to data presentation. Additions to the introduction and discussion make the manuscript very easily accessible to expert and more general audiences.</p><p>I compliment the authors on their novel and, after revision, elegantly presented and impressive work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The finding that hyperoxia, possibly through the signalling compound H2O2, can elicit a low-CO2 type acclimation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, even in the presence of large excess of CO2 concentrations is, truly, a remarkable result. It forces the CO2-concentrating mechanism community to reconsider part of the prevailing paradigm (consider O2/CO2 ratio rather than just CO2). It also opens exciting research avenues to identify the elicitors and signalling pathway related to CO2 (or O2/CO2) sensing. I have little doubts that this manuscript can attract a high citation. It is also timely as H2O2 sensors for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> have now been developed, which will help further test the H2O2 hypothesis (doi:10.1093/plcell/koab176).</p><p>The authors have made an excellent effort at improving the manuscript and data presentation, but I feel there is still room for improving both text and figures. Here are a number of suggestions the authors may want to consider, but also some questions which were not raised by previous reviewers.</p><p>Figures</p><p>Figure 1.A: Is this the best, unbiased way to normalize the data? It is not clear from Material and Methods and figure caption whether the data normalized the Rubisco concentration. Do CC-1009 and CC-2343 (who differ five-fold in terms of chlorophyll concentration) accumulate similar or different amounts of the CO2-fixing enzyme? The text suggests for Figure 19 in SI that total fluorescence signal is an acceptable proxy for Rubisco concentration. It isn't. See also comment on Figure 6.</p><p>Figure 1.B: The initial/final data is redundant and could be in SI. Why not plot the activity on the same graph (as a floating dot or something more elegant), using a second-Y scale?</p><p>Figure 4: are four rather than a single representative image really needed for a main figure? You have a neat median section for all four. A, top left; B, top right; C, bottom right; D, top left. These would be sufficient and help focus attention.</p><p>Figure 6: the use of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> Culture Collection strain #5357 (RbcS1-Venus mt-) is a judicious choice but comes with limitations. Firstly, the parent strain is genetically different from CC-1009 and CC-2343, and no data is shown on its capacity to handle the high concentrations of H2O2 used in the experiment. Secondly, the tagged variant is co-expressed (under a strong promoter) with the native, untagged Rubisco (and therefore cannot serve as a quantification proxy). It is unclear whether the H2O2 treatment might affect stability of the tagged protein. Thirdly, and maybe more importantly, I would be good to augment the Supplementary Data Set with the Confocal Settings. The raw data on Github suggests that control ('Minus') signal is oversaturated, compared to the H2O2 treated cells. The laser intensity and signal collection settings should be the same for the two treatments. Also, images of the channel showing chlorophyll-autofluorescence should be shown (if available). It is difficult to gage from the images whether the treated cells are still alive. The bloated cells probably have lost their intracellular structures, except the pyrenoid who will resist proteolysis for a while should be excluded from the calculation (cells #1 and #3 for Plus<sup>-1</sup>; cell #1 for Plus-2). This would address any concerns that the near fourfold difference shown in Figure 6.C is not biased by imaging artefacts. Lastly, the bar char (Figure 6.C) would benefit from a more meaningful Y-scale, e.g. fraction of fluorescence signal outside the pyrenoid.</p><p>Figure 7 and L711-713: This data makes more sense if presented in the context of optimizing experimental conditions, building up to experiment in Figure 6, rather than on its own. Why not move this to supporting information? I would also err on the side of caution before stating &quot;this is the first study, to our knowledge, to show that the most complete degree of rubisco delocalization occurs when an alga(e) is grown on a TAP agar plate exposed to air, rather than aquatically in liquid TAP&quot;. The phenomenon is well known to anyone who has worked with <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and looked under a microscope. There are probably numerous earlier publications that used EM, where the pyrenoid is either not visible or massively reduced. I understand the authors' desire to maximize priority on any data, but this data is not relevant to the overall narrative. It distracts from the highly original and remarkable findings of your main work.</p><p>Title</p><p>&quot;Induction of Pyrenoid Synthesis&quot;, is rather broad and does not really capture the essence of your paper. In your rebuttal, you state &quot;Because the main point of the paper is that hyperoxia and hydrogen peroxide induce starch sheath formation, we focused on measurements of the starch sheath.&quot; There are numerous instances of &quot;pyrenoid induction&quot; in the text, but the dynamics or Rubisco relocation or starch deposition are not really investigated. Let alone the tubules around which the matrix/starch sheath form. Why not consider a positive statement, for example: &quot;<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> grown in hyperoxia and elevated CO2 has a pyrenoid: Implications for the natural diversity of photosynthetic acclimation&quot;.</p><p>Material and methods, Experimental design</p><p>Algal growth conditions: 2000 micromols m-2 s<sup>-1</sup> is 20x more than what Spreitzer and Mets (1981) used to assay light sensitive mutants, namely 2000 and 4000 Lux (cited in L322). Maybe add a note justifying such high intensities, to show that this was not a double stress experiment.</p><p>Experimental design (see also comment on Figure 1, above): in the opening sentence of results (L322-327), you explain the rational for choosing CC-1009 and CC-2343. It is, however, unclear to a non-specialist how wildtype like CC-1009 is, relative to (for example) the reference strain used for the genome or the widely used CLiP mutant library. Is CC-1009 particularly good at handling hyperoxia or is just as good as any of the WT used by the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> community?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67565.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agree that the presentation of the manuscript should be dramatically revised to improve readability.

Because the main point of the paper is that hyperoxia and hydrogen peroxide induce starch sheath formation, we focused on measurements of the starch sheath.</p><p>The quantification indicates that hyperoxia and H2O2 induce increased pyrenoid formation and strengthens our conclusion that the signal for pyrenoid formation is not merely low CO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 5). This result is also consistent with other data in the paper indicating that H2O2 raises the oxygen compensation point CC-1009 and CC-2343 (Figure 10), and decreases the CO<sub>2</sub> compensation points (see Appendix 1 – Figure 22).</p><p>All of the strains showed some induction of the pyrenoid under hyperoxia, but there were significant differences between the strains in the degree to which they were “porous” or “sealed.” To quantify this attribute, we measured a parameter we term “percent exposure” that measures the percentage of the projected pyrenoid surfaces that were not enclosed by (in contact with) visible starch sheath. The quantification (See Appendix 1 Figure 6) confirms the qualitatively visible phenotype that the percentage of exposure was much higher in the sensitive lines, CC-2343 and progenies c1_3 and C1_4. We also provided at least 20 additional images for each strain, in addition to the ones provided in previous version and transparent reporting (See Voluntary Reporting Image Set 12).</p><p>Also, we have also now used the fluorescent labeled rubisco strain to compare the amount of rubisco in the pyrenoid when cells are grown under high CO<sub>2</sub>, hyperoxia, and low CO<sub>2</sub>. We found clear evidence that, even when sparged with saturating CO<sub>2</sub>, hyperoxia increased the rubisco content of the pyrenoids (Appendix 1-Figure 19), which has previously been associated with the formation of functional CCM in the pyrenoid (Freeman Rosenzweig et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The finding that pyrenoid formation can be induced by hydrogen peroxide is exciting, but it remains unresolved whether CCM is also induced under these conditions, or whether, as Reviewer 1 suggests, the pyrenoid and starch sheath might act to exclude O2.

We note that, because of the interconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, the Ci compensation point could include contributions from both forms. Thus, the experiments were not trivial to perform, but we felt that the point was interesting and thus, we developed a method to estimate the degree to which the Ci in the medium is depleted by the combination of photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration. We found that H2O2 induced a decrease in Ci compensation to levels similar to those achieved by low CO<sub>2</sub>. As controls we used both cells grown at low light and high CO<sub>2</sub> and a mutant (cia5) that lacks functional CCM, both of which showed higher Ci compensation points. These results are included in the revised manuscript as Appendix 1-Figure 22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer #3 made some excellent suggestions about using published datasets to generate hypotheses about the genetic basis of the responses documented in this paper.

We are pursuing this type of approach in a separate manuscript for two reasons: (1) We found that conditions of the published works were sufficiently different to make direct comparisons difficult. For example, some were taken in TAP-grown cells where CCM is probably not induced.

We thus concluded that such results would be difficult to interpret.

P27L17 – Kim and Portis 2004 relates to H2O2 production by Rubisco directly (misfire product of oxygenation). Oxidation of glycolate during photorespiration in the peroxisome is a separate issue.

H2O2 is a product of the light reactions, through an alternative electron acceptor pathway such as the Mehler peroxidase reaction (MPR) or the water-water cycle, which is expected to be more active under conditions when light input exceeds the capacity of assimilation (Badger et al., 2000; Mehler, 1951; Strizh, 2008).

Whilst a good job of probing the cellular response to hyperoxia is done, a genetic basis for these cellular changes is the obvious omittance that needs addressing to strengthen the manuscript. The recommendations below pertaining to this point are not necessarily requirements, but suggestions that the authors could further explore to try and identify the underlying genetic cause of the pyrenoid response to H2O2. Other recommendations refer to specific points of the existing methodologies that could be improved.</p><p>Suggestions for highlighting the genetic basis for pyrenoid response to hyperoxia:</p><p>Genomic analysis:</p><p>– Using data from the cited Jang and Ehrenreich 2012 paper, a genomic comparison between the strains used in the study could be completed to identify genetic candidates for that underpin the differences in strain response.</p><p>– If candidate genetic variants are found, simple comparisons between isolates with analogous genetic variations could provide a satisfactory starting point for the genetic explanation for the observed phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>As we discussed above, we now have genomic sequences for the parent and progeny lines, but give the large numbers of polymorphisms, it will be difficult to identify the causative loci at this stage.

The mutants that we know of that have altered hydrogen peroxide/ROS can be very challenging to grow in media outside of TAP and the mutations likely have pleiotropic effects, and it is not clear to us how we would unambiguously attribute particular effect to H2O2 production in these mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Analysis of the huge dataset from Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2020 (BioRxiv), where pooled mutant collections were exposed to a wide range of chemical/growth conditions including H2O2, should allow identification of strong candidate genes in this process that could be further investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, and we agree that this will be of interest for future directions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other general points:</p><p>Overall, the presentation of data in figures could be greatly improved.</p><p>– Several figures could be combined: Figures 1/2 can be combined and panelled, and should include non-treated cells as an introduction to the 'steady-state' morphology of these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have combined Figures 1 and 2 also with Figures 6 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Some figures should be swapped between the main text and supplementary information: Figures S3 and S11 should be incorporated in main text.

The initial results looked promising, and consistent with the induction of pyrenoid by H2O2 produced in the presence of these chemicals. However, we found that exposure to the confocal laser induced severe damage to cells treated with these chemicals, most likely because they produce large amounts of ROS production during illumination with the confocal laser. We thus concluded that such results would be difficult to interpret. However, we also now included in the paper an examination of how oxygen, even in the presence of high CO<sub>2</sub>, increased rubisco content of the pyrenoid. We found that, indeed, it did, and feel that this demonstrates that a signal apart from low CO<sub>2</sub> can influence pyrenoid formation (Appendix 1-Figure 19).</p><p>We did quantify the differences in rubisco amount in response to oxygen in Appendix 1-Figure 19 (see Panel D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sporadic reuse of re-cropped images of the same cells (in figure S12/13), imaging of small cells (S14/15) and contradictory images (S15) should be addressed if these figures are kept also.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed S12/13 (now Appendix 1-Figure 13; Appendix 1-Figure 14), and with regard to the use of small cells (i.e. Appendix 1-Figure 15), the image we assume is referred to is included because it shows many cells, none of which show a pyrenoid. The microscope image includes a scale bar, and the cells are not particularly small (as indicated when comparing the scale bar to the other images).

The introduction to the molecular details of pyrenoid assembly (P3, lines 1-9) fall short and should either be described in full or the reader referred to recent appropriate reviews of literature (Barrett et al., 2021; Wunder et al., 2020; Meyer, Goudet and Griffiths, 2020). Specific recent literature missing from the introduction and directly applicable to the study include Meyer et al., 2020, Sci. Adv. and Fei et al., 2021, bioRxiv. A better introduction to the current understanding of CCM/pyrenoid induction in Chlamydomonas could also be provided (see Fukuzawa et al., 2001, PNAS; Mitchell et al., 2014, Plant Physiology; Fang et al., 2012, Plant Cell). For the discussion, the authors should consider the physiological implications of an ROS-based signal for pyrenoid induction. The authors should also consider integrating recent literature on CCM induction upon limiting CO2 (Blifernez-Klassen et al., 2021, The Plant Cell) in Chlamydomonas, and how this hyperoxia response may fit into this network.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for recommending these stimulating articles:</p><p>The introduction now reads:</p><p>“The expression and function of green algal CCMs in eukaryotic algae is highly regulated; cells grown on or below air levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (0.04%) develop active CCMs (Aizawa and Miyachi, 1986; Badger et al., 1980), whereas those grown with high CO<sub>2</sub> levels lack them, and thus show low apparent affinities for CO<sub>2</sub>. [….] Although, it has recently been found that pyrenoid proteins share a sequence motif that is necessary to target proteins to the pyrenoid and binds to rubisco (Meyer et al., 2020b).”</p><p>And in the discussion, we now write:</p><p>“In this regard, it is intriguing that ROS labeling under hyperoxia was strongly localized in CC-1009 but not CC-2342 (Figure 13), hinting that H2O2 produced in a specific subcellular location and process may play a role in the differential development of the pyrenoid in the two parent lines, as discussed below. Taken together, these data sets are consistent with control of pyrenoid morphology at multiple levels, perhaps similar to the processes that regulate the expression of LHCSR3, involved in photoprotective nonphotochemical quenching, which is regulated by light quality and CO<sub>2</sub> availability (Maruyama et al., 2014; Semchonok et al., 2017). Future studies can also investigate how hyperoxia plays a role in the gene regulatory network for antennae size, which has been shown to be affected by low CO<sub>2</sub> (Blifernez-Klassen et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To ease comprehension for readers, and related to the above, it would be hugely beneficial for the authors to schematically summarise the findings of the study in the context of what is already known about pyrenoid-induced states in differing nutrient states.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a summary with bulleted points describing what is already known about pyrenoid-induced states under different conditions, with reference how our work fits in with it.

The third reviewer makes some excellent suggestions in the last paragraph of their review, particularly regarding image cropping and arrangement; the choice of images (inconsistent planes of section in TEM and inconsistent white balancing in light microscopy); lettering size, position, and font; scale bar size and position; the use and appearance of statistics; and the use of different colours across different figures.</p><p>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The finding that hyperoxia, possibly through the signalling compound H2O2, can elicit a low-CO2 type acclimation in Chlamydomonas, even in the presence of large excess of CO2 concentrations is, truly, a remarkable result. It forces the CO2-concentrating mechanism community to reconsider part of the prevailing paradigm (consider O2/CO2 ratio rather than just CO2). It also opens exciting research avenues to identify the elicitors and signalling pathway related to CO2 (or O2/CO2) sensing. I have little doubts that this manuscript can attract a high citation. It is also timely as H2O2 sensors for Chlamydomonas have now been developed, which will help further test the H2O2 hypothesis (doi:10.1093/plcell/koab176).</p><p>The authors have made an excellent effort at improving the manuscript and data presentation, but I feel there is still room for improving both text and figures. Here are a number of suggestions the authors may want to consider, but also some questions which were not raised by previous reviewers.</p><p>Figures</p><p>Figure 1.A: Is this the best, unbiased way to normalize the data? It is not clear from Material and Methods and figure caption whether the data normalized the Rubisco concentration. Do CC-1009 and CC-2343 (who differ five-fold in terms of chlorophyll concentration) accumulate similar or different amounts of the CO2-fixing enzyme?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that our main goal was to assess if the rates of carbon fixation were determined by the fraction activation of rubisco. This was expressed as the ratio of activities of as-isolated and fully activated forms of rubisco. This value will be unitless (self-normalized fraction) and will not depend on the procedure used to normalized the activities, because the units cancel out.</p><p>Nevertheless, we are grateful that the reviewer took the time to think about the method of normalization, which we agree is important for interpreting the total activity of rubisco. In this regard, we are comfortable with the normalization by chlorophyll and note that renormalizing to other parameters will not substantially affect the interpretation, as detailed in the following:</p><p>The differences in chlorophyll contents of the cultures were also quite similar, e.g. we found that CC-2343 had only about 17% higher chlorophyll than CC-1009 (see, e.g., measurement at 31 hours).</p><p>1. As we state in the methods, our assay was based on an established protocol for plants (Li et al., 2019; Roeske and Oleary 1985; Sharkey et al., 1986), with the slight adjustments to make the protocol suitable specific for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. In plants, the normalization is usually done according to leaf area (Li et al., 2019). This makes sense because the larger the leaf, the more light it can intercept, and light (the ultimate substrate) is expressed in units of moles photons per second per area.</p><p>2. The photobioreactors differ from leaves in three important respects:</p><p>a. The exposed area was determined by the geometry of the photobioreactor and was thus constant between samples;</p><p>b. Light intensities were set to be equal between the samples;</p><p>c. The turbidostat function of the photobioreactor held the cells at approximately the same densities. The biomass density (g per unit volume) in the cultures were measured over time and were nearly identical (not significantly different) between the genotypes, with no significant difference between cultures at day 1 (31 hours hyperoxia). For transparency, we show biomass measurements (ash free dry weight) for CC1009 and CC2343 across our hyperoxia treatment. Note that the turbidostat will maintain approximately the same cell density even when growth rates differ.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Variations in biomass (ash free dry weight) measured in turbidostat cultures in ePBR units.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67565-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Overall, we note that changing the normalization to exposed area, or total biomass would not alter the overall interpretation, i.e., that “although we cannot ascribe the differences in photosynthetic phenotypes solely to rubisco deactivation, these results do suggest that the CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or metabolic environments near rubisco are different under hyperoxia in the two lines”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The text suggests for Figure 19 in SI that total fluorescence signal is an acceptable proxy for Rubisco concentration. It isn't. See also comment on Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point and agree that the total fluorescence is not a quantitative indicator of rubisco concentration, but that the results are qualitatively consistent with our interpretation. Also, though the increase in rubisco content may not be due to increase in mRNA, there remains post translational mechanisms that could be at play. We clarified this in the text by changing this section:</p><p>“Most importantly, we found very clear evidence that even when sparged with saturating CO<sub>2</sub>, hyperoxia increased the rubisco content of the pyrenoids (Appendix 1-Figure 19), asserting that there is some control of rubisco in the pyrenoid in response to oxygen.”.</p><p>To instead say:</p><p>“We also found evidence that even when sparged with saturating CO<sub>2</sub>, hyperoxia may result in an apparent increase in the aggregation of rubisco in the pyrenoids (Appendix 1-Figure 19), indicating that oxygen has some control of this aggregation.”</p><p>We have also modified the figure caption accordingly:</p><p>“Appendix 1-Figure 19: Strain CC-5357, containing a RBCS1-Venus. All cells were grown with 14:10 hour (light:dark) sinusoidal illumination with peak light intensity of 2000 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PAR, in HS media. Cells were sparged for 60 seconds every 15 minutes with either 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (Panel A), 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% Oxygen (Panel B), or ambient air (Panel C). The average fluorescence intensity of the localized Venus Fluorescent Protein-labeled rubisco within the pyrenoids of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells was measured using the Nikon A1 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. Because the tagged rubisco was expressed with a PsaD (Photosystem I reaction center subunit II) promoter, the fluorescent signal may not be a conclusive proxy for rubisco amount and cannot be attributed to transcriptional responses to hyperoxia. However, the results are consistent with the fluorescently-tagged rubisco accumulating to a greater extent in the pyrenoids of cells exposed to hyperoxia, similar to what has been observed when cell are exposed to low CO<sub>2</sub>. Panel D shows the mean intensity of the Venus-tagged rubisco of the three treatments. Significant differences (P &lt;.0001) were found between the High CO<sub>2</sub> and Hyperoxia; High CO<sub>2</sub> and Low CO<sub>2</sub> treatments. No difference was found between Hyperoxia and Low CO<sub>2</sub>. Scale bar = 2 μm.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1.B: The initial/final data is redundant and could be in SI. Why not plot the activity on the same graph (as a floating dot or something more elegant), using a second-Y scale?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried several ways to plot these results, but in the end determined that this was the least confusing, albeit perhaps less “elegant.” In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have moved this particular data to the SI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: are four rather than a single representative image really needed for a main figure? You have a neat median section for all four. A, top left; B, top right; C, bottom right; D, top left. These would be sufficient and help focus attention.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting that a single image would be sufficient. We attempted to rework this figure as suggested, but concluded that the single figure lost some of the details that we feel are important for understanding the consistencies and commonalities in the images. We thus prefer to keep the composite image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: the use of the Chlamydomonas Culture Collection strain #5357 (RbcS1-Venus mt-) is a judicious choice but comes with limitations. Firstly, the parent strain is genetically different from CC-1009 and CC-2343, and no data is shown on its capacity to handle the high concentrations of H2O2 used in the experiment. Secondly, the tagged variant is co-expressed (under a strong promoter) with the native, untagged Rubisco (and therefore cannot serve as a quantification proxy). It is unclear whether the H2O2 treatment might affect stability of the tagged protein. Thirdly, and maybe more importantly, I would be good to augment the Supplementary Data Set with the Confocal Settings. The raw data on Github suggests that control ('Minus') signal is oversaturated, compared to the H2O2 treated cells. The laser intensity and signal collection settings should be the same for the two treatments. Also, images of the channel showing chlorophyll-autofluorescence should be shown (if available). It is difficult to gage from the images whether the treated cells are still alive. The bloated cells probably have lost their intracellular structures, except the pyrenoid who will resist proteolysis for a while should be excluded from the calculation (cells #1 and #3 for Plus<sup>-1</sup>; cell #1 for Plus-2). This would address any concerns that the near fourfold difference shown in Figure 6.C is not biased by imaging artefacts. Lastly, the bar char (Figure 6.C) would benefit from a more meaningful Y-scale, e.g. fraction of fluorescence signal outside the pyrenoid.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that 100 μm of hydrogen peroxide is high, and previous studies (Blaby 2015) used as much as 1mM. More importantly, we show data indicating that CC-5357 grows well under these conditions, i.e., there is no indication that it is deleterious (SI Figure 22). Indeed, CC-5357 appears to have a greater capacity to take up CO<sub>2</sub> (a lower CO<sub>2</sub> compensation point) when treated with this hydrogen peroxide when compared to the non-treated sample. We also noticed when conducting our light microscopy of CC-5357 that the addition of 100 μm H2O2 did not appear to inhibit cell motility, though we do not present those results.</p><p>With regard to the confocal settings, we can assure the reviewer that we used the same confocal settings for both the H2O2 treated and non-treated cells (For the images acquired on Figure 6 on the Olympus FV1000, fluorescence was excited using 3% Argon gas laser intensity. Fluorescence emission was recorded through 530-630 nm band pass filter using a Photomultiplier detector with a high voltage 831). The reviewer is correct, though, in that there may be oversaturation in the images. It was partially because of the concern for oversaturation, though, that we repeated the procedure with the Nikon. The Nikon is MSU’s premier confocal instrument, with great sensitivity, and getting time on it is very difficult at the MSU’s Center for Advanced Microscopy, so we began with the Olympus. When we repeated the experiment and examined the cells with the Nikon, we got the similar results (see Appendix 1 – Figure 17). We have now also included the settings we used when we used the Nikon instrument in the figure caption Fluorescence was detected using 0.5% 514 nm diode laser intensity. Fluorescence emission was recorded through 565/70 nm band pass filter using a Gallium Arsenide Phosphide (GaASP) detector (High Voltage = 47, offset -7). Lastly, we repeated the test one more time on the Olympus and, again, observed similar results (See Transparent Reporting Figure 11). The settings we used for the images in Transparent Reporting Figure 11 were nearly the same as that what we used with Figure 6, we just raised the voltage from 831 to 850. We have added these settings to the figure caption for Transparent Reporting Figure 11. But to be clear, whenever we had a session with a confocal, we took images of both control and treated cells with the same settings!</p><p>We have redone Figure 6, as requested, excluding the bloated cells and improving the overall appearance of the figure with a box plot. The effect of hydrogen peroxide on the “fraction of fluorescence signal outside of the pyrenoid” was highly significant (P&lt;.001), and we thank the reviewer for their suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 and L711-713: This data makes more sense if presented in the context of optimizing experimental conditions, building up to experiment in Figure 6, rather than on its own. Why not move this to supporting information? I would also err on the side of caution before stating &quot;this is the first study, to our knowledge, to show that the most complete degree of rubisco delocalization occurs when an alga(e) is grown on a TAP agar plate exposed to air, rather than aquatically in liquid TAP&quot;. The phenomenon is well known to anyone who has worked with Chlamydomonas and looked under a microscope. There are probably numerous earlier publications that used EM, where the pyrenoid is either not visible or massively reduced. I understand the authors' desire to maximize priority on any data, but this data is not relevant to the overall narrative. It distracts from the highly original and remarkable findings of your main work.</p></disp-quote><p>We find the statement that “the phenomenon is well known to anyone who has worked with <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and looked under a microscope,” both comforting (in that it offers some confirmation of our observations) and perplexing, because we have not been able to find a description of the phenomenon in the literature.</p><p>Please note that we found the lack of reports of this phenomenon surprising and made some effort to track down any previous references. Further, we already used caution in stating that “to our knowledge…” the phenomenon has not been reported.</p><p>We emphasize that the phenomenon--regardless of whether is it well known to anyone withing with <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (expect perhaps us!)—is both non-trivial and important for interpreting our and others’ results. Specifically, the observation is important to our study because it suggests that factors other than simply CO<sub>2</sub> levels control the pyrenoid and CCM. We would like to keep Figure 7 in the main part of the paper, because we do feel like it is important result.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have revised the text to remove the implied novelty of the observation, so that we now write,</p><p>“Also consistent with the cited previous work, low-light with mixotrophic conditions resulted in rubisco delocalization. We further show that the most complete degree of rubisco delocalization occurs when algae is grown on a TAP agar plate exposed to air, rather than aquatically in liquid TAP (Figure 7).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title</p><p>&quot;Induction of Pyrenoid Synthesis&quot;, is rather broad and does not really capture the essence of your paper. In your rebuttal, you state &quot;Because the main point of the paper is that hyperoxia and hydrogen peroxide induce starch sheath formation, we focused on measurements of the starch sheath.&quot; There are numerous instances of &quot;pyrenoid induction&quot; in the text, but the dynamics or Rubisco relocation or starch deposition are not really investigated. Let alone the tubules around which the matrix/starch sheath form. Why not consider a positive statement, for example: &quot;Chlamydomonas grown in hyperoxia and elevated CO2 has a pyrenoid: Implications for the natural diversity of photosynthetic acclimation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We will remove the word “synthesis” from the title based on the reviewers comments, but the word induction is necessary to convey that hyperoxia (and H2O2) induces the pyrenoid. We show that hyperoxia is condition where the pyrenoid forms and that H2O2 can also induce the pyrenoid, even under high CO<sub>2</sub>. Based on the reviewer’s comments, we may change the comment to the following:</p><p>The Induction of a Pyrenoid by Hyperoxia: Implications for the Natural Diversity of Photosynthetic Responses in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Material and methods, Experimental design</p><p>Algal growth conditions: 2000 micromols m-2 s<sup>-1</sup> is 20x more than what Spreitzer and Mets (1981) used to assay light sensitive mutants, namely 2000 and 4000 Lux (cited in L322). Maybe add a note justifying such high intensities, to show that this was not a double stress experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Very good point. We have added this: “Spreitzer and Mets (1981) found that rubisco activity-deficient mutants exhibited chlorotic phenotypes similar to those observed with CC-2343 under hyperoxia. We conjectured that rubisco inhibition may be playing a role in CC-2343’s intolerance to hyperoxia. To be clear, while Spreitzer and Mets (1981) were screening for mutants that were highly sensitive to even low light (~90 μmoles m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PAR), we grew our wild type strains of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> under hyperoxia with diurnal sinusoidal light with peak light intensities of 2000 μmoles m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PAR. We found that, when sparged with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, CC-1009 and CC-2343 grow very well at such light intensities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental design (see also comment on Figure 1, above): in the opening sentence of results (L322-327), you explain the rational for choosing CC-1009 and CC-2343. It is, however, unclear to a non-specialist how wildtype like CC-1009 is, relative to (for example) the reference strain used for the genome or the widely used CLiP mutant library. Is CC-1009 particularly good at handling hyperoxia or is just as good as any of the WT used by the Chlamydomonas community?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the point. We did test a number of strains for sensitivity to hyperoxia and cite the work of Hall (Ph.D. Thesis of former student in the Kramer lab) in our results.</p><p>In an initial screen of sequenced <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> isolates (Jang and Ehrenreich, 2012), we found two with contrasting tolerances to hyperoxia, with strain CC-1009 relatively tolerant to hyperoxia, continuing to grow, albeit at a suppressed rate, when exposed to 95% oxygen and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, while CC-2343 showed severely suppressed growth and eventual chlorosis or photobleaching in our ePBRs (Hall, 2017).</p><p>This work is available online so it should be accessible. Another paper (Lucker et al.) describing these characteristics is under review, and we will cite it when accepted. We tested CC-1009 with several different non-lab strains (CC-1009 was chosen because it was closely related to the widely used lab strains).</p><p>Also, in the Methods we state that “Strain CC-1009 (mt-) is a wild type strain tracing back to the 1945 collection by G.M. Smith, collected from Amherst MA, but has been a separate line from the c137c (CC-124 and CC-125) and Sagar (CC-1690) since about 1950 (Pröschold et al., 2005).”</p><p>However, we did not clarify that c137 is the reference strain. Thus, we have modified the text as follows,</p><p>“Strain CC-1009 (mt-) is a wild type strain tracing back to the 1945 collection by G.M. Smith, collected from Amherst MA, but has been a separate line from the sequenced and widely regarded reference strain c137 (CC-124 and CC-125) and Sagar (CC-1690) since about 1950 (Pröschold et al., 2005).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
