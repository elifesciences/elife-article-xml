beyond the bounds of the prokaryotic cell cytosol must connect to membrane or cytosolic electron pools. Proteins post-translationally flavinylated by the enzyme ApbE mediate electron transfer in several characterized extracytosolic redox systems but the breadth of functions of this modification remains unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of 31,910 prokaryotic genomes that provides evidence of extracytosolic ApbEs within ~50% of bacteria and the involvement of flavinylation in numerous uncharacterized biochemical processes. By mining flavinylation-associated gene clusters, we identify five protein classes responsible for transmembrane electron transfer and two domains of unknown function (DUF2271 and DUF3570) that are flavinylated by ApbE. We observe flavinylation/iron transporter gene colocalization patterns that implicate functions in iron reduction and assimilation. We find associations with characterized and uncharacterized respiratory oxidoreductases that highlight roles of flavinylation in respiratory electron transport chains. Finally, we identify interspecies gene cluster variability consistent with flavinylation/cytochrome functional redundancies and discover a class of ‘multi-flavinylated proteins’ that may resemble multi-heme cytochromes in facilitating longer distance electron transfer. These findings provide mechanistic insight into an important facet of bacterial physiology and establish flavinylation as a functionally diverse mediator of extracytosolic electron transfer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In bacteria, certain chemical reactions required for life do not take place directly inside the cells.

The role of ApbE-flavinylated proteins was then deciphered using a ‘guilt by association’ approach. In bacteria, genes that perform similar roles are often close to each other in the genome, which helps to infer the function of a protein coded by a specific gene. This approach revealed that flavinylation is involved in processes that allow bacteria to acquire iron and to use various energy sources. A number of interesting proteins were also identified, including a group that carry multiple flavins, and could therefore, in theory, transfer electrons over long distances. This discovery could be relevant to bioelectronic applications, which are already considering another class of bacterial electron-carrying molecules as candidates to form minuscule electric wires.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>redox biochemistry</kwd><kwd>cellular respiration</kwd><kwd>extracellular microbial physiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K22 AI144031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Light</surname><given-names>Samuel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000010</institution-id><institution>Ford Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivera-Lugo</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Méheust</surname><given-names>Raphaël</given-names></name><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>Jillian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014220</institution-id><institution>Innovative Genomics Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Méheust</surname><given-names>Raphaël</given-names></name><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>Jillian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bioinformatic and biochemical studies provide evidence that covalently bound flavins are common and participate in wide-ranging extracytosolic redox activities throughout bacterial life.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Essential microbial-environmental interactions take place beyond the bounds of the cytosol. In prokaryotes, extracytosolic biochemical processes can be situated at the extracytosolic side of the inner membrane, periplasm, cell wall, or surrounding environment. Within the extracytosolic space, redox reactions represent an important class of activities with functions in respiration, the maintenance/repair of extracytosolic proteins, and the assimilation of minerals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cho and Collet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schröder et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Extracytosolic redox processes require electron transfer pathways that connect with electron pools in the cytosol or membrane. Membrane proteins transfer electrons from donors, like reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or quinols. On the extracytosolic side of the membrane, electron transfer between membrane and extracytosolic proteins is generally mediated by a redox-active protein, such as a cytochrome or thioredoxin-like protein. Cytochromes use redox-active hemes as cofactors and are often important for transferring electrons between membrane components and respiratory enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertini et al., 2006</xref>). Thioredoxin-like proteins employ pairs of cysteines that cycle between redox states and are often involved in extracytosolic protein maturation and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cho and Collet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collet and Messens, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Flavins are a group of molecules that contain a conserved redox-active isoalloxazine ring system. In a reversible manner, the oxidized state of the flavin isoalloxazine ring system can undergo a one-electron reduction to generate a semiquinone state or a two-electron reduction to generate a hydroquinone state. Many microbes synthesize the flavin-derivative riboflavin (or vitamin B2), which can be phosphorylated to yield flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and further adenylated to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). In part, because of their ability to transition between multiple redox states, FMN and FAD are well suited to act as enzyme cofactors. Proteins that bind flavins (flavoproteins) are common throughout nature and function in diverse redox activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fraaije and Mattevi, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the well-established electron transfer mediators, like cytochromes and thioredoxin-like proteins, an evolutionarily conserved FMN-binding domain has more recently been implicated in extracytosolic electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>). FMN-binding domains are post-translationally flavinylated by the ApbE enzyme, which transfers the FMN portion of a substrate FAD molecule to a conserved [S/T]GA[<bold>S/T</bold>]-like sequence motif (flavinylated amino acid in bold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertsova et al., 2013</xref>). The resulting phosphoester bond irreversibly links the FMN ribitylphosphate group to a serine/threonine hydroxyl side chain in the FMN-binding domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterized extracytosolic electron transfer systems with an ApbE-flavinylated subunit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The post-translational flavinylation reaction catalyzed by the ApbE enzyme.

In most flavinylated proteins, a covalent bond links the flavin’s isoalloxazine ring to an amino acid side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Macheroux et al., 2011</xref>). This type of linkage induces a change in the flavin’s redox potential that facilitates the protein’s activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Macheroux et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, the ApbE-catalyzed phosphoester linkage is outside the flavin’s isoalloxazine ring and unlikely to impact the cofactor’s redox potential. Since non-flavinylated FMN-binding domains have low flavin-binding affinity, the ApbE-catalyzed reaction may simply function to secure the cofactor to the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borshchevskiy et al., 2015</xref>). Once the flavin is linked to the FMN-binding domain, interactions with the folded protein stabilize the flavin’s semiquinone state in a fashion that presumably enhances electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barquera, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Backiel et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>ApbE-flavinylated FMN-binding domains have been found to be critical for five characterized extracytosolic electron transfer systems. These systems include the cation-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR) and <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> nitrogen fixation (RNF) complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), nitrous oxide and organohalide respiratory complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), and a Gram-positive extracellular electron transfer system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Backiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buttet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Light et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, ApbE-flavinylated [S/T]GA[S/T]-like sequence motifs in homologous extracytosolic fumarate and urocanate reductases facilitate transfer from respiratory electron transport chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogachev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kees et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Light et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, each of these characterized activities links AbpE flavinylation to a different aspect of microbial cellular respiration, with the NQR and RNF complexes being particularly noteworthy. These systems are widely distributed throughout microbial life and catalyze key intermediate steps in the energy metabolism of numerous microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barquera, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckel and Thauer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reyes-Prieto et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, large-scale comparative genomic analyses have emerged as a powerful tool for discovering functionally and/or mechanistically related features of prokaryotic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crits-Christoph et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doron et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we develop a ‘guilt by association’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravind, 2000</xref>) (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) that exploits genomic diversity to contextualize the significance of extracytosolic flavinylation. Our analysis of flavinylation-associated gene clusters provides evidence of widespread flavinylation throughout bacteria and uncovers new connections to respiration and iron assimilation. We further identify uncharacterized aspects of extracytosolic flavinylation, including novel ApbE substrates and a class of multi-flavinylated proteins. These findings place ApbE-flavinylated proteins alongside cytochromes and thioredoxin-like proteins as central mediators of bacterial extracytosolic electron transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evidence of widespread extracytosolic flavinylation within bacteria</title><p>As all previously characterized flavinylation systems contain genes that encode for an ApbE enzyme and a substrate that contains an FMN-binding domain, we reasoned that these features are indicative of flavinylation-mediated electron transfer. To identify flavinylation-mediated electron transfer systems, we searched for genes with ApbE (Pfam accession PF02424) or FMN-binding domains (Pfam accession PF04205) within a collection of 31,910 genomes that are representative of the genetic diversity of the prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parks et al., 2020</xref>). We found that 18,965 of bacterial genomes and 238 of archaeal genomes encode an FMN-binding domain-containing protein and/or an ApbE enzyme. To focus the search on extracytosolic electron transfer, we eliminated genes that lacked a computationally predicted signal peptide or lipidation site. This analysis provides evidence that ~50% of the bacterial (15,095) and ~4% of archaeal (63) genomes possess extracytosolic flavinylation components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The majority of NapH-like proteins identified in our analysis contain an extracytosolic N-terminal FMN-binding domain (1926 gene clusters) whereas the remaining ones (539 gene clusters) are in a genomic locus with a second gene that encodes an FMN-binding domain-containing protein.

These previously characterized NapH-like systems were identified within 1197 genomes within our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also identified NapH-like gene clusters with an extracytosolic nitrite reductase in 133 genomes or an ethanol oxidase in 172 genomes. Thus, while the reactions catalyzed by the majority of NapH-like systems remain unknown, this electron transfer apparatus seems to be modularly employed to facilitate electron transfer to reductases or from oxidases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This modularity of NapH-oxidoreductase associations is further underscored by a phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that NapH-like associations with <italic>nirS</italic> and <italic>exaA</italic> evolved independently multiple times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MsrQ-like systems</title><p>We identified 1797 flavinylation gene clusters in 1468 genomes that encode an ‘MsrQ-like’ (Pfam accession PF01794) protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These clusters are broadly conserved in Actinobacteria and are infrequently identified in other lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

At least a subset of MsrQ-like proteins thus likely use NAD(P)H as a cytosolic electron donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

First, a functional connection to MsrQ-like proteins is suggested by our observation that 108 gene clusters contain both PepSY-like and MsrQ-like genes. Second, 167 PepSY-like gene clusters contain a VIT1 (Pfam accession PF01988) ferrous iron transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Moreover, in some cases, PepSY-like proteins may be actively involved in the extraction of siderophore-bound iron, as periplasmic reduction has been shown to be important for the uptake of siderophore-bound iron and 231 PepSY-like gene clusters encode a TonB receptor (Pfam accession PF03544) related to well-characterized outer membrane siderophore transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manck et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>DsbD systems</title><p>We identified 285 flavinylation gene clusters in 275 genomes that contain a DsbD protein (Pfam accession PF02683) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We find that multi-flavinylated proteins are often associated with established transmembrane electron transfer components and thus likely receive electrons through conventional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We observe that some clusters contain large unannotated proteins with putative cell wall-binding domains – such as SLH (Pfam accession PF00395), Rib (Pfam accession PF08428), FIVAR (Pfam accession PF07554), or LysM (Pfam accession PF01476) – and are thus likely involved in redox chemistry within the cell wall or at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We also identified 157 clusters that encode a multi-flavinylated protein and additional proteins with FMN-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). These clusters encode as many as five proteins with FMN-binding domains and frequently contain multiple multi-flavinylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These observations suggest that some multi-flavinylated proteins are part of multi-step electron transfer pathways and may form elaborate multi-subunit complexes that span the cell wall.</p><p>The role of multi-flavinylated gene clusters is generally unclear, with only a minority of clusters providing limited functional clues. We identified a subset of clusters that encode proteins with multiple fumarate reductase-like domains that likely establish an unusual multi-functional reductase platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and G</xref>). We also identified a number of RNF clusters that contain multi-flavinylated RnfGs (the extracytosolic flavinylated subunit in RNF complexes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These multi-flavinylated RNF complexes likely provide a second electron transfer pathway that facilitates transfer to alternative extracytosolic acceptors. This type of bifurcated electron transfer would be similar to a multi-heme cytochrome-based transfer mechanism recently suggested in studies of a methanogen RNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holmes et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we also identified a subset of multi-flavinylated RnfGs in the family Christensenellales that contain a multi-heme cytochrome domain and thus may assume additional functions relevant for cytochrome-based electron transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). While much remains to be learned, these preliminary observations are consistent with multi-flavinylated proteins establishing elaborate and functionally diverse electron transfer pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Comparative analysis of gene clusters within collections of prokaryotic genomes has emerged as a powerful discovery tool in recent years. Our large-scale survey of diverse genomes extends this approach and reveals that ApbE-mediated flavinylation is a prominent feature of bacterial physiology. More granular analyses of gene clusters provide evidence consistent with extracytosolic flavinylation usage in diverse redox activities and suggest that modular properties facilitate the integration of flavinylated components with various biochemical processes. While additional genetic and/or biochemical studies will be required to develop a better understanding of the physiological roles of flavinylation, these preliminary observations are consistent with flavinylated proteins being important components of microbial extracytosolic electron transfer. Our findings suggest that, alongside thioredoxin-like proteins and cytochromes, ApbE-flavinylated proteins represent a third major class of mediators of extracytosolic electron transfer.</p><p>The existence of three mechanistically distinctive protein classes with some apparent functional interchangeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) stimulates fundamental questions about the environmental or physiological context that favors each system. Unfortunately, the multiple functions and widespread distribution of flavinylated proteins across diverse microbes make it difficult to identify unique features that distinguish microbes that encode flavinylation components. Nevertheless, the relationship between flavinylation- and cytochrome-based electron transfer is interesting. The apparent functional interchangeability in the electron transfer capabilities of iron- and flavin-containing proteins is reminiscent of the relationship between ferredoxins and flavodoxins. Ferredoxins and flavodoxins are redox-active proteins that function in a number of cytosolic redox activities and contain iron and flavin cofactors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoch and Valentine, 1972</xref>). Microbes switch from ferredoxin to flavodoxin usage in iron-poor environments – presumably because minimizing the demand for iron cofactors is important for conserving the cellular iron reserve in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knight et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smillie, 1965</xref>). Based on this precedent, it seems plausible that flavinylation-based electron transfer mechanisms might be particularly advantageous within iron-poor environments. The coexistence of functionally similar but mechanistically distinctive flavinylation and cytochrome electron transfer components may thus, in part, reflect divergent resource management strategies in distinct environmental contexts.</p><p>Of the proteins linked to extracytosolic electron transfer by our studies, the class of multi-flavinylated proteins are particularly intriguing. These proteins may resemble multi-heme cytochromes in their use of multiple redox-active cofactors to achieve longer distance electron transfer. A particularly noteworthy aspect of multi-heme cytochromes concerns their ability to establish ‘nanowires’ that have a variety of potential biotechnological applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blumberger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Considering the unique redox properties of flavins, the electron-transferring behavior of multi-flavinylated proteins may provide an interesting juxtaposition to multi-heme cytochromes with implications for the development of novel redox-based biotechnologies. The function and mechanism of electron transfer in multi-flavinylated proteins may thus represent an interesting subject for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genome collection</title><p>The 30,238 bacterial and 1672 archaeal genomes from the GTDB (release 05-RS95 of July 17, 2020) were downloaded with the taxonomy and the predicted protein sequences of the genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parks et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Functional annotation</title><p>Protein sequences were functionally annotated based on the accession of their best Hmmsearch match (version 3.3) (E-value cut-off 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eddy, 1998</xref>) against the KOfam database (downloaded on February 18, 2020) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aramaki et al., 2020</xref>).

They discovered extracytosolic flavinylation of five protein classes potentially involved in transmembrane electron transfer. The study also proposes new connections between respiration and iron assimilation and identifies two novel substrates of ApbE enzymes. This work should inspire further work in the fields of redox enzymology and bioenergetics to characterize the suggested involvement of flavinylated protein complexes in prokaryotes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Widespread bacterial protein flavinylation in functionally distinct extracytosolic redox biochemistries&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Pimchai Chaiven as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Willem van Berkel (Reviewer #2); Peter Macheroux (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The introduction lacks a clear explanation about the mode of flavinylation of the FMN-binding proteins and how this relates to other covalent flavinylation systems (where an increase in redox potential of the flavin is a prominent effect of covalent binding). It is also not clearly explained whether the predicted flavinylation of the phosphate moiety of FMN is reversible.</p><p>2. Results and Discussion: The electron transfer properties of flavoproteins are not well explained. Quite some flavoproteins (e.g. flavodoxins) mediate one-electron transfer processes, and this is most likely the preferred way in the discussed transmembrane electron transport systems.</p><p>3. As mentioned by the authors, about 50% of the prokaryotic genomes analyzed harbor targets for flavinylation/and the FMN transferase. However, no discussion and not even a hint is provided what these 50% of prokaryotes have in common and what distinguishes this group from the other (50%) prokaryotes. Is it lifestyle (environment), energy production,.…?</p><p>4. On the other hand, the presented study leaves many issues unmentioned creating the (false) impression that all it takes to transport electrons across the membrane is a series of hemes and/or flavins along the way. For example, in the discussion of the very interesting hypothesis that flavinylation might replace multi-heme cytochromes under iron deficiency, discussed on page 20 (last para), the authors mention that &quot;flavins possess two-electron transferring properties (ref. 46)&quot; in contrast to the heme system. If this were true, the switch from heme to flavin would also imply that the electron transport itself would have to change from one- electron to two-electron transport. It is unclear that this would be compatible with all other components of the electron transport system. On the other hand, flavins can also – under certain circumstances and in certain environments – carry out one-electron transfer processes, e. g. DNA-photolyases, flavodoxins, etc. Thus, it is conceivable that the flavins operating in the suggested systems in prokaryotes also perform one-electron transport, similar to the operating mode of heme cytochromes. It is clear that we currently lack the biochemical/physical information to know what is really going on, but at least it should be discussed more thoroughly.</p><p>5. Title and wherever applicable: replace &quot;biochemistries&quot;, &quot;redox biochemistries&quot;, &quot;uncharacterized biochemistries&quot; and &quot;cytosolic biochemistry&quot; by &quot;redox reactions/systems/processes&quot; or &quot;biochemical reactions&quot; (Abstract, Introduction, pages 17 and 19). In our understanding &quot;biochemistry&quot; is a science and does not &quot;exist&quot; in plural.</p><p>6. Abbreviations: Explain protein (gene) abbreviations. Several abbreviations are used without proper introduction or explanation. I think it would enhance the readability, if these were properly explained, e. g. NQR, RNF, NapH-like, PceC, NosZ, PceA, etc.</p><p>7. Some adjustment and rearrangement of the introduction is required to improve the readability.</p><p>8. On page 2, line 56-58, the authors state that &quot;…more recently…&quot; but no reference is given here.</p><p>9. Issues regarding functions and properties of flavinylation.</p><p>9.1 What are the physiological functions of flavinylation of these proteins? Without having FMN flavinylated, many flavoenzymes can also mediate electron transfer. If these proteins can also bind FMN as a prosthetic group without flavinylation, one can address this issue by comparing redox properties of the enzyme-bound FMN with or without covalent linkage. Properties which should be characterized include redox potential measurement and reduction titration to investigate ability of these proteins to stabilize flavin semiquinones. One can address how does the binding of the flavin affects the redox potential (this is very important in order to understand the direction of electron transport).</p><p>9.2 In contrast to other covalent flavin attachments, the flavinylation addressed in the current work is reversible. Is anything known about the removal of flavins from the protein complexes in question?</p><p>How sure is it that the flavin is always covalently bound and what would be the consequence if this is not the case? Might there be next to iron limitation, also flavin limitation? Is the reversibility of flavinylation used for the overall regulation of electron transport?</p><p>9.3 Are there any enzymes that carry out de-flavinylation? If so, how are they regulated?</p><p>9.4 Is there any protein structural information about this mode of flavinylation available? For instance, is the flavin hidden in the protein or accessible? Do the amino acid sequence results can explain in more general terms the site(s) of flavinylation?</p><p>What is known about the environment of the flavin(s)? This can address if it &quot;behaves&quot; like a &quot;free&quot; flavin?</p><p>9.5 How sure is it that the conserved motif always represents covalent flavinylation?</p><p>9.6 Page 4, considerable amount of these proteins (50%) may remain inside the cytosol. Any ideas about their functional roles? Can we say more about the comparison with thioredoxins and cytochromes when we look at the 50% of bacteria that do not contain the flavinylation domains?</p><p>10. Page 6, can these DUF2271 or DUF3570 also be flavinylated by FAD or riboflavin?</p><p>11. Page 8, line 126, the sentence &quot;…we found that a threonine to alanine mutation at the predicted…&quot;. This should be rephrased: &quot;…we found that a threonine to alanine replacement/exchange at the predicted….&quot;.</p><p>12. Page 9, top sentences, the authors mention that 6,366 genomes contain transmembrane electron transfer apparatuses. It would be more informative to also mention the number of genomes without putative membrane-bound clusters.</p><p>13.

Page 20, Discussion, in addition to the issue of Fe availability, these flavinylated proteins may provide other functional advantage for cells to use them in mediating electron transfer. Knowing their redox properties (Issue#1) would give a clue on this.</p><p>16. DUF2271 or DUF3570 obviously should be able to bind to FMN. Is it possible to model the three dimensional structures of these proteins and analyze the difference and similarity compared to the known FMN-binding domain? Do they use different scaffold to interact with FMN?</p><p>17. Discussion, what strategies do the authors have in mind for testing the proposed functions of the flavinylated domains? I would like to see more discussion about how to validate the proposed functions of the flavinylated domains.</p><p>I assume that most of the questions cannot be satisfactorily answered yet, but I think these issues should at least be addressed in the discussion in order to stress the need for further in depths biochemical studies that target the obvious complexity of these systems.</p><p>18.

Unfortunately, we have not been able to identify features that clearly distinguish microbes that possess flavinylation-associated genes from those that do not. In reference to the related reviewer point, we performed additional analyses, but found no correlation between the presence of flavinylation-associated genes and cytochromes or thioredoxins within a genome. We’ve also been unsuccessful in our attempts to identify distinct habitats that distinguish microbes that encode flavinylation components. The difficulty in identifying features that differentiate these microbes is likely due to the multiple functional roles of flavinylation. While flavinylation is implicated in diverse bioenergetic activities, it has also been linked to other functions. For example, RNF is the most widespread flavinylated system and is used by some microbes for flavin bifurcation-based bioenergetic metabolism but by others for ferredoxin reduction (through reverse electron flow). Thus, while RNF is the main apparatus for flavin bifurcation-based bioenergetic metabolisms, its presence in a genome is not particularly predictive of whether or not a microbe uses this metabolic strategy. Another example of the functional heterogeneity of flavinylation is provided by Actinobacteria. While flavinylated systems linked to bioenergetic processes are distributed through most of the phylogenetic tree, almost all Actinobacteria possess a single MsrQ-like flavinylation system that likely functions in iron assimilation, implying a distinct significance of flavinylation in this context (Figure 2). The diverse functions of flavinylation thus likely mask features shared by microbes that possess it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

It is clear that we currently lack the biochemical/physical information to know what is really going on, but at least it should be discussed more thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point about the one- versus two-electron transferring properties. We’ve removed the mention of two-electron transferring properties in relation to multi-flavinylated proteins, modified the introduction to provide additional context about one-electron transport, and made extensive revisions to, hopefully, better contextualize the findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Issues regarding functions and properties of flavinylation.</p><p>9.1 What are the physiological functions of flavinylation of these proteins? Without having FMN flavinylated, many flavoenzymes can also mediate electron transfer. If these proteins can also bind FMN as a prosthetic group without flavinylation, one can address this issue by comparing redox properties of the enzyme-bound FMN with or without covalent linkage. Properties which should be characterized include redox potential measurement and reduction titration to investigate ability of these proteins to stabilize flavin semiquinones. One can address how does the binding of the flavin affects the redox potential (this is very important in order to understand the direction of electron transport).</p></disp-quote><p>Proteins flavinylated by ApbE have low affinity for flavins (Borshchevskiy et al., 2015). Consistent with this previous finding, we and others have found that flavinylated proteins do not copurify with non-covalently bound flavin when expressed in the absence of ApbE (Barquera et al., 2001). By contrast, ApbE does copurify with FAD (it’s substrate) (Boyd et al., 2011). Presumably, ApbE binds the flavin substrate and the [S/T]GA[S/T] motif from the substrate protein. As such, non-covalent flavin binding to the substrate protein would likely competitively inhibit flavinylation, which may provide a rationale for the low affinity.</p><p>At any rate, it’s generally accepted that the covalent linkage to FMN-binding proteins (or at least the best-studied protein, NqrC) does not impact the redox potential of the flavin. Also, others have found evidence that the semiquinone is stabilized in flavinylated proteins (Backiel et al., 2008; Barquera et al., 2006) – presumably by non-covalent interactions with the protein. We have added information about these properties to the introduction section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.2 In contrast to other covalent flavin attachments, the flavinylation addressed in the current work is reversible. Is anything known about the removal of flavins from the protein complexes in question?</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, ApbE catalyzed flavinylation is irreversible. We are not aware of a “de-flavinylating” enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How sure is it that the flavin is always covalently bound and what would be the consequence if this is not the case? Might there be next to iron limitation, also flavin limitation? Is the reversibility of flavinylation used for the overall regulation of electron transport?</p></disp-quote><p>We hesitate to make too sweeping a statement, but think the flavin is probably typically covalently bound and that control of the state of the post-translational modification is unlikely to serve a regulatory function. Consistent with this idea, our previous proteomics experiments on <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> found that &gt;99% of the motif-containing peptides were flavinylated (Light et al., 2018).</p><p>The point about flavin limitation is interesting. Obviously, flavin differs from iron in that it can be synthesized de novo and so isn’t a scarce environmental resource, at least not in the same sense. On the other hand, environmental flavins may be readily available in certain environments rich in organic matter and microbes that reside in such environments are often flavin auxotrophs. An environmental abundance of flavins may lead to a decreased demand for energy intensive flavin biosynthesis that, similar to the lack of environmental iron, changes the flavin vs iron usage cost/benefit ratio.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.3 Are there any enzymes that carry out de-flavinylation? If so, how are they regulated?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of such an enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.4 Is there any protein structural information about this mode of flavinylation available? For instance, is the flavin hidden in the protein or accessible? Do the amino acid sequence results can explain in more general terms the site(s) of flavinylation?</p><p>What is known about the environment of the flavin(s)? This can address if it &quot;behaves&quot; like a &quot;free&quot; flavin?</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, the only structures that exist of AbpE-flavinylated proteins are subunits of the NQR complex (Borshchevskiy et al., 2015; Steuber et al., 2014). The NQR complex from the bacterium <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> contains two flavinylation sites separately located on the NqrB and NqrC subunits. NqrC contains an FMN-binding domain, while NqrB does not (it has an unrelated domain found in NQR and RNF complexes). The NqrC structure is thus likely more relevant for understanding the majority of flavinylated proteins discussed in our study. Within the NqrC structure, the [S/T]GA amino acids within the [S/T]GA[S/T] motif are on a loop and the flavinylated S/T (the second S/T in the motif) is at the start of an alpha-helix. The isoalloxazine ring within the covalently bound flavin forms hydrogen bonds with the NqrC main chain and a threonine side chain. The more hydrophobic portion of the ring is positioned between two neighboring subunits (NqrD and NqrF) within the multi-subunit complex. Given the importance of the interactions with these NQR-specific subunits, it’s difficult to predict what the flavinylation site would look like in other flavinylated proteins.</p><p>As explained above, several previous studies have presented evidence that the semiquinone is stabilized in the bound NqrC (even the absence of other NQR subunits) and that this likely results from non-covalent protein interactions rather than the covalent linkage. We now discuss this point in the introduction section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.5 How sure is it that the conserved motif always represents covalent flavinylation?</p></disp-quote><p>The [S/T]GA[S/T] sequence is not a particularly stringent “motif”and occurs in numerous proteins. This sequence is unlikely to be sufficient for flavinylation. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the conserved motif <italic>within the identified domains</italic> is typically (if not always) flavinylated: (1) The sequence conservation of the motif (which, as noted above, does not seem to be involved in binding the flavin non-covalently). (2) The presence of the motif within a number of protein domains that have been established to be flavinylated. (3) The co-localization of the genes encoding ApbEs and FMN-binding domains, DUF2271s, and DUF3570s on gene clusters.</p><p>On the other hand our analysis likely overlooks biologically relevant flavinylation sites that occur outside of the identified domains. For example, the fumarate reductase that we recently showed was flavinylated in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> contains a conserved flavinylation motif that is not embedded within an identified domain (Light et al., 2019). In general, presently unknown structural features outside the [S/T]GA[S/T] sequence are likely essential for flavinylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.6 Page 4, considerable amount of these proteins (50%) may remain inside the cytosol. Any ideas about their functional roles? Can we say more about the comparison with thioredoxins and cytochromes when we look at the 50% of bacteria that do not contain the flavinylation domains?</p></disp-quote><p>Of the 19,203 genomes that we identified as encoding ApbE and/or FMN-binding domains 15,158 were computationally predicted to contain a protein with a signal peptide and thus likely possess extracytosolic flavinylation. This probably underestimates the number of genomes that encode extracytosolic proteins, because the signal peptide prediction tool appears to be fairly conservative (i.e., misses some that must be extracytosolic). While cytosolic flavinylation undoubtedly occurs, it is likely less common than extracytosolic flavinylation.</p><p>We considered including analyses of flavinylated cytosolic proteins, but ultimately decided that it would detract from the main focus of the paper. Many of the cytosolic proteins are likely involved in a mechanistically similar cytosolic electron transfer. FMN-binding domains are frequently associated with cytosolic enzymes that contain fumarate reductase-like domains. Other proteins with FMN-binding domains are annotated as flavoproteins or have predicted oxidoreductase activities.</p><p>It is an interesting point about the thioredoxins and cytochromes. Given the evidence of functional redundancy of flavinylation with these other redox-active proteins, it would make sense if flavinylation “replaced” cytochromes or thioredoxins in some genomes. To address this point, we have performed additional analyses to address whether genomes with flavinylation components are more or less likely to possess genes that encode thioredoxins or cytochromes. We compared genomes that contain or lack flavinylation-associated components, but did not find a significant difference in cytochrome or thioredoxin gene content. There may be too many other variables to uncover a relationship between flavinylation and these other redox proteins in this way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Page 6, can these DUF2271 or DUF3570 also be flavinylated by FAD or riboflavin?</p></disp-quote><p>Not to our knowledge, though we only observed the recombinantly expressed proteins in the presence or absence of ApbE. We performed MALDI TOF analysis of the DUF2271 (but were unable to analyze the DUF3570 protein due to technical issues). The detected ions are consistent with the protein being unflavinylated in the absence of ApbE and a single FMN being covalently attached in the presence of ApbE. In addition, a number of ApbEs from different organisms have been previously biochemically characterized and, without exception, been found to catalyze the same FMNylation reaction. For these reasons, we are confident FMNylation is the biologically relevant post-translational modification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Page 9, top sentences, the authors mention that 6,366 genomes contain transmembrane electron transfer apparatuses. It would be more informative to also mention the number of genomes without putative membrane-bound clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. This number (2,595) has been added to the text. Some of these microbes may use described electron transfer apparatuses encoded elsewhere on the genome (i.e., not in the same gene cluster as apbE or the other domains). As referenced in the text, this is likely true of some of the microbes with the Dsb/DUF3570 system. It’s also likely that we have failed to identify less common electron transfer apparatuses that account for electron transfer in some microbes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

Page 20, Discussion, in addition to the issue of Fe availability, these flavinylated proteins may provide other functional advantage for cells to use them in mediating electron transfer. Knowing their redox properties (Issue#1) would give a clue on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that iron limitation is unlikely to be the only advantage/reason for the existence of flavinylation. We’ve also expanded the discussion of what is known about the redox potential of ApbE-flavinylated proteins (i.e., that the semiquinone state is stabilized). We’re not experts in molecular-level electron transfer and may still not fully appreciate the functional implications of the characterized redox properties. Any additional reviewer input on these points would be appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. DUF2271 or DUF3570 obviously should be able to bind to FMN. Is it possible to model the three dimensional structures of these proteins and analyze the difference and similarity compared to the known FMN-binding domain? Do they use different scaffold to interact with FMN?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, structures of proteins with sequence homology have not been reported.

Discussion, what strategies do the authors have in mind for testing the proposed functions of the flavinylated domains? I would like to see more discussion about how to validate the proposed functions of the flavinylated domains.</p><p>I assume that most of the questions cannot be satisfactorily answered yet, but I think these issues should at least be addressed in the discussion in order to stress the need for further in depths biochemical studies that target the obvious complexity of these systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve made extensive changes to the Discussion section and now emphasize the need for additional studies to address the mechanism and function of the systems described in the manuscript. We decided against providing too much detail about our future experimental plans (which may or may not produce useful results), but we’re currently focusing on several flavinylated systems that seem particularly interesting and potentially tractable. We’re developing genetic approaches that can be used to identify the function of these systems and recombinant protein expression that will support biochemical and structural studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18.
