cytosol to detect viral RNA during infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle co-opted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products from cellular innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane system may enhance their ability to sense RNA generated by viruses that use these compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the <italic>OAS1</italic> splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform correlates with protection from severe COVID-19. This study highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and suggests that early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1 p46 is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>interferon stimulated genes</kwd><kwd>RNA

family of interferon (IFN)-induced sensors of viral RNA critical for cell-intrinsic innate immune defense against viruses through activation of the latent endoribonuclease RNase L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>). Recognition of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces a conformational change in OAS proteins to reveal a catalytic pocket which converts ATP to the second messenger 2′−5′A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lohöfener et al., 2015</xref>). Binding to 2′−5′A dimerizes and activates RNase L, which cleaves cellular and viral RNA in order to block viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Although the importance of RNase L in restricting a variety of viruses is well documented, it is unclear how individual OAS proteins contribute to this breadth of antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silverman, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the C-terminal region of human <italic>OAS1</italic> is alternatively spliced to produce the protein isoforms p42, p44, p46, p48, and p52, named according to their molecular weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonnevie-Nielsen et al., 2005</xref>). All human OAS1 isoforms share the first five exons of <italic>OAS1</italic>, which contain the RNA binding and catalytic domains, but each isoform splices a distinct sixth exon to generate unique C-termini. The specific antiviral roles of individual human OAS1 isoforms are not defined. The production of OAS1 p46 is controlled by an SNP in the splice-acceptor site of exon six in <italic>OAS1</italic> (rs10774671 A&gt;G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This splice site SNP in OAS1 is associated with genetic susceptibility to multiple flaviviruses and autoimmune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Awady et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haralambieva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simon-Loriere et al., 2015</xref>). The G allele of this SNP shifts the splice acceptor site in exon 6 by one nucleotide to generate p46, while other OAS1 isoforms, primarily p42, are produced when the A allele is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2009</xref>). OAS1 p46 is unique among OAS1 isoforms because it is the only isoform with a C-terminal CaaX (cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic-any residue) motif. Proteins containing CaaX motifs at their C-termini undergo a post translational lipidation modification termed prenylation and are targeted to the cytosolic face of intracellular organelle membranes of the endomembrane system following post-prenylation processing at the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Casey, 2016</xref>). The significance of the CaaX motif in OAS1 p46 and whether endomembrane targeting might alter the antiviral activity of OAS1 is unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The p46 isoform of OAS1 is targeted to the endomembrane system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differential C-terminal splicing of OAS1 creates isoform diversity.

Most intracellular viral RNA (vRNA) sensors localize to the cytosol where they are poised to sense accumulating vRNA during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablasser and Hur, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Gack, 2016</xref>). However, since many RNA viruses replicate their RNA in close association with intracellular membranes, placing OAS proteins at membranous compartments may augment vRNA sensing in certain contexts. Notably, positive-strand RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses replicate their RNA within modified host organelles of the endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014</xref>). These replication organelles shield vRNA from detection by cytosolic RNA sensors such as RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neufeldt et al., 2016</xref>). Whether or not the host has evolved strategies to survey specific intracellular membranes for viral replication is unclear. We therefore hypothesized OAS1 p46, through its CaaX motif, is targeted to the endomembrane system and this targeting gives it enhanced access to vRNA during infection. In support of this model, we show the prenylated isoform, OAS1 p46, is targeted to Golgi membranes and this membrane-targeting results in enhanced detection of vRNA and augmented antiviral activity against positive-strand RNA viruses such as flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Our human genetic data further supports the contribution of <italic>OAS1</italic> rs10774671 to severity of COVID-19. More broadly, this work reveals how intracellular membrane targeting of OAS1 is critical for detecting human pathogenic viruses that replicate on organellar membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells, cell culture conditions, and treatments</title><p>All cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The G allele is not evenly distributed across human populations and is more prevalent in individuals of African descent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We determined the protein expression of OAS1 isoforms across several human cell lines and assessed the impact of the SNP (rs10774671) on the expression of OAS1 isoforms. Genotyping revealed that the A549 cell line carried only the A allele, that PH5CH8 and THP-1 cell lines carried both the A and G alleles, and that Daudi cells carried only the G allele at rs10774671 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We treated these cell lines with recombinant human interferon beta (rIFNβ) or Sendai virus and evaluated OAS1 protein expression by immunoblot using an N-terminal OAS1 antibody that recognizes all isoforms. We detected two OAS1 isoforms at molecular weights of 42 and 46 kDa in cells with at least one copy of the G allele, while only p42 or p46 were expressed in A/A or G/G cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Corroborating our findings, PBMCs harboring at least one G allele expressed p46 stronger than p42, which may be influenced by splice site preference or mRNA stability.

Depending on the identity of the ‘X’ amino acid, CaaX-containing proteins can be either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated by the respective farnesyl or geranylgeranyl transferases. CaaX motifs with a leucine in the ‘X’ position, as in the case of p46, are preferentially geranylgeranylated by geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTaseI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartman et al., 2005</xref>). In order to test if the CaaX motif in p46 is geranylgeranylated, we performed an in vitro geranylgeranylation detection assay using a click chemistry approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeGraw et al., 2010</xref>). For this, <italic>OAS1</italic> KO 293 T cells were transfected with N-terminal FLAG-tagged OAS1 p42, p46, p42CTIL, and p46ATIL expression constructs. The p42CTIL construct represents p42 with the addition of the CaaX (CTIL) motif from p46, which allowed us to test if the CaaX motif from p46 is sufficient to drive geranylgeranylation of p42. The p46ATIL construct was generated by mutating the CaaX cysteine to an alanine (C&gt;A) to disrupt its prenylation, allowing us to test if this motif is necessary for its geranylgeranylation. Cells were incubated with a geranylgeranyl azide alcohol substrate, which is incorporated into all geranylgeranylated proteins in the cell and serves as a tag in the subsequent click-chemistry reaction with a biotin alkyne. FLAG-tagged OAS1 protein isoforms were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysate and subjected to on-bead click-chemistry reaction, which forms a covalent bond between the azide and alkyne moieties and labels geranylgeranylated proteins with a biotin tag, which was then probed for. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitated OAS1 proteins revealed CaaX-containing p46 and p42CTIL proteins were geranylgeranylated, while p42 and p46ATIL were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Since we verified which OAS1 isoforms are produced in PBMCs from specific donors and several human cell lines, we could stratify these cells into those producing p42 and or p46 based on the presence of an A or the G allele at rs10774671. PH5CH8, THP-1, and PBMCs containing both A and G alleles all produced p42 and p46, while PBMCs and A549 cells that carried only the A allele only produced p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We then tested if adding the CaaX motif to the p42 isoform is sufficient to localize p42CTIL to the Golgi. Consistent with our hypothesis, ectopically expressed p42CTIL localized to the Golgi and showed significantly stronger co-localization with the Golgi over p42, confirming the CaaX motif is both necessary and sufficient to localize OAS1 isoforms to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>).

To this end, we performed 2′−5′A synthetase activity assays using p42, p46, and their respective CaaX mutants. As expected, these isoforms shared a similar capacity to synthesize 2′−5′A and the CaaX motif did not alter the catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Cleavage of cellular RNA by RNase L has been shown to generate immunostimulatory RNAs that are sensed by RIG-I and MDA5 and increase antiviral protection through the production of interferon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malathi et al., 2007</xref>).

In wild type cells, overexpression of p42 and p46 reduced EMCV RNA significantly over the control.

Expression of p42 in <italic>IRF3</italic> KO cells showed a trend toward reducing EMCV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These data confirm p42 and p46 confer antiviral activity in the absence of additional factors that are induced by IRF3. Collectively, these data demonstrate that p42 and p46 both use the 2′−5′A/RNase L pathway and have a similar capacity to synthesize 2′−5′A to confer antiviral activity. This suggests that some other mechanism must account for their differential antiviral activities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Endomembrane targeting of p46 through the CaaX motif enhances access to viral RNA</title><p>Since the CaaX motif localizes p46 to the endomembrane system, we investigated if this motif played a role in the enhanced antiviral activity of p46 against EMCV. During picornavirus infection, ER- and Golgi-derived membranes form replication organelles that are sites of vRNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Melia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melia et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that endomembrane localization of p46 places this viral RNA sensor on membranes utilized by EMCV for replication and would allow the enhanced access of p46 to EMCV RNA. In contrast, p42 would have limited access to vRNA as it is localized to the cytosol and nucleus. We determined the localization of p42 and p46 during EMCV infection by infecting <italic>OAS1</italic> KO Huh7 cells expressing p42 or p46 with EMCV and then stained for OAS1 and dsRNA, followed by cLSM. In mock-infected cells expressing p46, this isoform was localized to perinuclear structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In cells infected with EMCV, p46 was no longer perinuclear and instead redistributed throughout the cell to sites of double-stranded viral RNA replication intermediate accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, p42 remained in the cytosol and nucleus before and after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These data suggest that p46 is in close proximity to sites of EMCV RNA replication where dsRNA ligands are present. We next used an RNA immunoprecipitation approach to test whether OAS1 p46 has enhanced access to EMCV RNA and if the CaaX motif enhances its ability to bind EMCV RNA. Since RNase L cleaves RNA and is required for OAS1-mediated restriction of EMCV, RNase L-deficient Huh7 cells allowed us to test OAS1 isoform binding to EMCV RNA in samples with equivalent amounts of EMCV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). N-terminally FLAG-tagged OAS1 p42, p46, p42CTIL, and p46ATIL isoforms were expressed in <italic>OAS1</italic> KO Huh7 cells, which are also naturally devoid of RNase L expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Expression of OAS1 isoforms in <italic>OAS1</italic> KO Huh7 cells had no impact on viral RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, RT-qPCR for EMCV RNA after FLAG immunoprecipitation revealed that p46 tended to bind more EMCV RNA than p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although adding a CaaX motif to p42 (p42CTIL) did not significantly increase the ability of p42 to pull down EMCV RNA, mutating the CaaX motif on p46 (p46ATIL) caused a significant loss in EMCV RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data confirm that endomembrane targeting through the CaaX motif is required for p46 to bind EMCV RNA, as mutating the CaaX motif completely ablated the ability of p46 to access EMCV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Endomembrane targeting of OAS1 p46 through the CaaX motif enhances access to viral RNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal micrographs from mock or EMCV infected (MOI=0.001, 12 hr) <italic>OAS1</italic> KO Huh7 cells ectopically expressing p42 or p46 and stained with anti-OAS1 (green) and anti-dsRNA (magenta) antibodies and DAPI (blue); representative cells from one out of two independently performed experiments are depicted.

Compared to cells expressing p46, cells expressing CaaX-mutant p46ATIL showed a significant five-fold increase in EMCV RNA as well as an increase in viral titer; a decreased antiviral activity similar to that of the p42 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Intriguingly, addition of a CaaX motif to OAS1 p42 did not increase the antiviral activity of p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that the peptide sequence in the unique C-terminus of p42 contains a motif that is inhibitory to its antiviral activity. We therefore generated another OAS1 variant which contains a CaaX motif directly downstream of the common OAS1 peptide sequence shared between all OAS1 isoforms, hereinafter referred to as OAS1 common+CTIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We tested the antiviral activity of OAS1 common+CTIL compared to the p42 and p46 isoforms. At similar protein expression levels, OAS1 common+CTIL did not confer significantly increased antiviral activity over the empty vector control and showed RNA levels similar to those in cells expressing the p42 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Interestingly, the OAS1 common+CTIL variant showed significantly decreased co-localization with Golgi membranes compared to p46 and appeared cytosolic and nuclear, as observed above for CaaX-deficient p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these data indicate membrane targeting of OAS1 p46 through a CaaX motif is crucial for its antiviral activity against EMCV. However, a CaaX motif alone is not sufficient to provide optimal antiviral activity against EMCV. Overall, these data suggest other features in the unique C-termini of OAS1 p42 and p46 contribute to their individual antiviral activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Combined effects of CaaX motif, C-terminus length and oligomerization domain confer differential antiviral activity of OAS1 isoforms</title><p>Since the unique C-terminus of p46 (50 aa) is longer than the unique C-terminus of p42 (18 aa), we investigated if the unique sequence in p46 contains additional motifs important for its antiviral activity.

The CFK motif is in close proximity to the unique C-termini of p42 and p46, however, the requirement of the CFK domain for the antiviral activity of these proteins is unknown. Therefore, we generated OAS1 p42 and p46 CFK mutants (C331A-F332A-K333A) and compared their antiviral activity against EMCV to their wild type counterparts. Relative to wild type p42 and p46, mutation of the CFK domain led to a significant loss in the ability of p42 and p46 to reduce EMCV RNA by threefold and twofold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Interestingly, disruption of the CFK motif in p42 resulted in complete loss of antiviral activity, demonstrated by similar EMCV RNA copies as cells expressing an empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). OAS1 p46 with a disrupted CFK motif maintained residual antiviral activity similar to the antiviral activity of wild-type p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). These data show that the antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 and p46 is partially mediated by CFK motif-dependent oligomerization. This oligomerization facilitates enhanced 2′−5′A synthesis capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we found that CFK-mediated oligomerization is required for optimal EMCV RNA binding of OAS1 p46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Importantly, mutation of the CFK motif did not alter the localization of either isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). This suggests that the antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 is completely dependent on the CFK oligomerization motif, whereas p46 only partially depends on the CFK oligomerization motif for its antiviral activity.</p><p>Since p46 is prenylated and embedded in cellular membranes, the longer C-terminus of p46 may function as a flexible linker to facilitate optimal oligomerization. This may explain why adding a CaaX motif to p42 is not sufficient to enhance its antiviral activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). To test this, we generated several C-terminal truncation mutants of p46 termed p46 Δ12aa, Δ22aa, and Δ32aa, and determined their antiviral activity against EMCV alongside p46 and p42CTIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Compared to p46, the truncation mutants showed a length-dependent decrease in their ability to reduce EMCV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). The Δ22aa and Δ32aa deletion mutants had similar antiviral activities as p42CTIL, which is identical in length to the Δ32aa mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Similar to p46, all the p46 truncation mutants localized to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). However, there was a slight but significant decrease in the correlation of p46 Δ32aa with the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). These data suggest that, in addition to the CaaX motif and an oligomerization domain, the C-terminal length of p46 is important for its antiviral activity.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed the conservation of a longer CaaX-containing p46-specific C-terminal sequence without sequence similarity in various other species. Interestingly, the p46-specific C-terminal sequence was truncated in rodents and bats. To test if the length of the p46-specific C-terminal sequence affected the antiviral activity against EMCV, we created chimeric proteins by inserting the C-terminal sequences of different lengths specific to the p46 orthologs of cow (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>), fox (<italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>), flying fox (<italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>), and alligator (<italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic>) into the human OAS1 p46 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). We selected species with divergent OAS1 p46-specific C-terminal sequences and minimal amino acid sequence identities when compared to human OAS1 p46. We found cow and fox OAS1 chimeras mimicked human OAS1 p46 antiviral activity, whereas the shorter C-terminus of flying fox led to decreased antiviral activity of the chimeric protein compared to human OAS1 p46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the length of the p46-specific C-terminal sequence is important for increased antiviral activity. Intriguingly, the alligator OAS1 p46 chimeric protein, with similar C-terminus length as human p46 but with most divergence in peptide sequence, failed to exhibit similar antiviral activity as human OAS1 p46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Upon close examination, we found that the alligator (and guinea pig) lack conservation of the E<sup>392</sup>-E/N<sup>393</sup>-D/N<sup>394</sup> motif proximal to the CaaX motif, which we have shown is required for strong antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data suggest that the length of the p46-specific C-terminal sequence, CFK oligomerization domain, and potentially E-E/N-D/N sequence are required for enhanced antiviral activity of OAS1 p46.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>OAS1 p46 has broad antiviral activity against viruses that use the endomembrane system for replication</title><p>We sought to define the antiviral activity of OAS1 isoforms against other positive-strand RNA viruses that use the endomembrane system for replication.

We infected <italic>OAS1</italic> KO 293 T cells expressing p42 and p46 with WNV, followed by staining for OAS1, dsRNA, and the endoplasmic reticulum protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3), since WNV replicates within invaginations of the ER membrane. During WNV infection, we observed p42 in the cytosol and nucleus. Indeed, p42 did not appear to be recruited to sites of WNV RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top panel, arrows). However, during WNV infection, p46 localized to PDIA3 and dsRNA-positive replication sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom panel, arrows). Quantification of OAS1 isoforms relative to PDIA3 revealed a significant increase in the correlation of p46, but not p42, to PDIA3-positive membranes during infection, suggesting that p46 is recruited to sites of WNV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Quantification of OAS1 isoform localization to viral RNA revealed OAS1 p46 has significantly stronger localization to dsRNA during WNV infection than p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated whether p46 was present in the Golgi during WNV infection by staining for OAS1, Golgin-97, and dsRNA in cells infected with WNV. OAS1 p46 was significantly more correlated with the Golgi than p42 in both uninfected and WNV-infected cells. However, WNV infection caused a significant decrease in the association of p46 with Golgin-97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This suggests that p46 may be recruited from the Golgi to sites of WNV replication and is consistent with previous observations that Golgi membranes and proteins, including RNA binding proteins, are recruited to the replication organelles of flaviviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ward et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, p46 might be recruited during prenylation at the ER membrane.</p><p>We next tested if p46 localizes to sites of Zika virus (ZIKV) replication, another flavivirus that utilizes ER membranes for replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cortese et al., 2017</xref>). We observed p46, but not p42, localized to ZIKV replication sites at the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that endomembrane localization of OAS1 p46 allows this protein to access sites of flavivirus RNA replication.</p><p>The human pathogenic picornavirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) replicates within modified Golgi membranes, and thus p46 may also be positioned to readily sense CVB3 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Melia et al., 2019</xref>). We tested the antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 and p46 against CVB3 by infecting <italic>OAS1</italic> KO 293 T cells expressing p42, p46 or a control. RT-qPCR analysis at 24 hr post-infection revealed a 70% reduction in CVB3 RNA in p46 expressing cells compared to control, while p42 had almost no effect on CVB3 RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, CVB3 titers at 48 hr post-infection were significantly reduced by 50% in p46 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These data suggest that OAS1 p46 may have broad antiviral activity against members of the picornavirus family, while p42 is less effective.</p><p>Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 use the endomembrane system for replication using primarily ER-derived membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snijder et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that p46 may have enhanced antiviral activity against coronaviruses. We assessed the antiviral activity of p42 and p46 against SARS-CoV-2 in 293 T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. Expression of p42 led to a fivefold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, p46 had a significant fivefold greater antiviral activity over p42 (25-fold over EV) against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Importantly, the enhanced antiviral activity of p46 against SARS-CoV-2 depended on the CaaX motif, as p46ATIL demonstrated decreased antiviral activity similar to that of p42. This suggests that endomembrane targeting of p46 is critical to its enhanced antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>We next tested the antiviral activity of p42 and p46 against negative-strand RNA viruses, such as Influenza A virus (IAV) and Indiana vesiculovirus (formerly VSV), which do not replicate on intracellular organelle membranes. IAV replicates within the nucleus where p42 is also present and is sensitive to the OAS/RNase L pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Min and Krug, 2006</xref>).

Viral RNA analysis revealed neither OAS1 isoform impacted IAV RNA levels significantly at 24 hr post-infection. Mutations in IAV NS1 disrupting RNA binding render this virus sensitive to the OAS/RNase L pathway, although it is unclear what antiviral role OAS1 isoforms play during IAV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Min and Krug, 2006</xref>). We found that expression of p42 or p46 had no impact on the replication of this NS1-mutant IAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Similarly, we observed that GFP-expressing VSV, which replicates in the cytosol, was also insensitive to OAS1 p42 and p46. Compared to an empty vector control, expression of p42 or p46 did not impact the number of GFP+ cells during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

In contrast, p42, which is localized to the cytosol and nucleus, has a comparatively weak ability to sense viral RNA and initiate antiviral activity against viruses that replicate within intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic depicting how endomembrane targeting of OAS1 p46 primes antiviral activity against positive-strand RNA viruses.</title><p>A splice-acceptor SNP (rs10774671) controls production of the p42/p46 OAS1 isoforms. Isoform-specific prenylation localizes p46 to the Golgi apparatus, while OAS1 p42 is cytosolic. During positive-strand RNA virus infection, OAS1 p46 is recruited to virus replication organelles (VROs) of flaviviruses, picornaviruses and coronaviruses. Through this targeting p46 gains enhanced access to viral RNA. OAS1 p42 remains cytosolic and nuclear during infection and has limited access to viral RNA. Both OAS1 isoforms require catalytic activity and RNase L to be antiviral.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71047-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>RNA replication for positive-strand RNA viruses occurs within the replication organelle. Placement of innate immune sensors at intracellular membranes is an antiviral strategy likely difficult for positive-strand RNA viruses to evade, as these viruses are unlikely to evolve away from this fundamental replication strategy. Based on our data, we propose that prenylated OAS1 p46 localizes to the cytosolic surface of the organelle membrane. During infection with a positive-strand RNA virus, the viral non-structural proteins and viral RNA are recruited to the organelle surface, where p46 can interact with vRNA. As the membrane is involuted to form the viral replication organelle (VRO), prenylated p46 is also included in the VRO. Confinement of p46 in the VRO may enhance its access to viral RNA. Furthermore, newly prenylated proteins are continuously recruited to the organelle surface during infection, which may allow for additional interference of vRNA as it escapes the replication organelle.</p><p>Secondly, many positive-strand RNA viruses depend on lipid products of the mevalonate pathway or prenylation for replication and therefore cannot broadly antagonize this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014</xref>). Viral antagonism by specifically targeting OAS1 p46 protein or directly blocking its prenylation or splicing could be possible. Alternatively, viral interference of the OAS-RNase L pathway would negate the antiviral activity OAS1 p46. Such a mechanism is exemplified in the case of some viruses, where the non-structural proteins inhibit the OAS-RNase L pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silverman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thornbrough et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Among positive sense RNA viruses Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and MERS-CoV accessory protein encodes for a phosphodiesterase which degrade 2’−5’A. As 2’−5’A is critical for the activation of RNAseL, antagonizing this pathway makes them insensitive to OAS1-RNaseL-mediated virus control. However, intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 do not carry this phosphodiesterase in their genome, probably making them susceptible to OAS1 p46.</p><p>We also show addition of the CaaX motif to p42 is not sufficient to enhance its ability to bind viral RNA or increase its antiviral activity. This suggests that the CaaX motif is just one of the crucial features in the unique OAS1 p46 C-terminal region that contributes to differential antiviral activity. Tetramerization of OAS1 has been proposed as a requirement for synthesis of the second messenger 2′−5′A, indicating that several OAS1 molecules in close proximity are required to induce 2′−5′A synthesis upon viral RNA binding and to subsequently activate the RNase L pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 1997</xref>). Aggregation of several OAS1 proteins around viral dsRNA might also increase the number of RNA-binding domains within the OAS1/vRNA complex, thereby allowing access to longer vRNA which would increase 2′−5′A synthesis. Mutation of the CFK oligomerization motif in OAS1 p42 led to a complete loss of antiviral activity, while the p46 CFK mutant maintained antiviral activity similar to that of the wildtype p42 isoform. This suggests a model in which OAS1 p46 without a functional CFK oligomerization domain still maintains a residual antiviral activity. These data show p46 proteins might oligomerize which is further aided by CaaX motif-mediated localization at Golgi membranes. Together, we have defined features including the CaaX motif in the unique C-terminus that contribute to the enhanced antiviral activity of p46. The unique alternatively spliced C-terminal region including the oligomerization and prenylation motifs in p46 is maintained across vertebrates presumably because it displays the strongest antiviral activity compared to other OAS1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The rs10774671 G allele controlling OAS1 p46 expression was originally identified as a West Nile virus resistance allele, although the mechanism accounting for the protection conferred by this SNP was lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we identify a functional <italic>OAS1</italic> splice site variant affects COVID-19 outcome. We found the A allele contributes to genetic risk for severe COVID-19 disease in patients with respiratory failure compared to healthy control subjects in two cohorts. We propose that the G allele association with protection against severe COVID-19 is explained by the enhanced antiviral activity of OAS1 p46 against SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to early control of viral replication. Additionally, both rs10774671 and the lead GWAS SNP rs10735079 are expression and splicing QTL for <italic>OAS1</italic> and <italic>OAS3</italic> in our analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the association of these SNPs with severe COVID-19 may be two-fold: affecting splicing and expression levels both of those observed in primary human cells.</p><p>We have shown that the splice-site SNP controls the subcellular targeting of a critical viral RNA sensor, OAS1, which may allow the host to respond to viral evolutionary pressures and replication strategies. Interestingly, the G allele is ancestral and prevalent in African populations. In contrast, the A allele is prevalent in rest of the world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Previous studies have documented reintroduction of the G-allele into <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> population by introgression from Neanderthals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sams et al., 2016</xref>), and this could have implications for COVID-19 disease. Other innate immune genes upstream of OAS1 that are associated with severe COVID-19 in a genome wide association study are <italic>IFNAR2</italic>, and <italic>TYK2</italic>, which are in the type I IFN pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021</xref>). Perturbations in any of these genes could affect OAS1 expression and its effector activity. Genetic studies, SARS-CoV-2 antagonism of IFN transcription, and autoantibodies against IFNα/β strongly associate with severe COVID-19, indicating that the type I IFN pathway might be compromised in patients with severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Prost et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). While it would be interesting to study the individual and combined effects of the above genes on OAS1 and COVID-19 disease, our study suggests there are strong selective pressures, presumably viral, impacting the prevalence of OAS1 causal splice site-SNP in in human populations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Brien et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The broad number of RNA- and even DNA-viruses inhibited by the OAS/RNAse L pathway has raised interesting questions about the determinates of OAS antiviral specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silverman, 2007</xref>). In humans, the OAS family is comprised of three catalytically active OAS proteins: OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3. OAS1 contains an RNA binding domain and a catalytically active domain, while OAS2 contains a catalytically inactive repeat of this unit, and OAS3 contains two catalytically inactive repeats of this unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>). The effect of OAS3 SNPs that associate with COVID-19 is still unclear. Although the OAS proteins have different RNA binding capabilities and favor synthesis of different lengths of 2′−5′A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibsen et al., 2014</xref>), we demonstrate a novel mechanism where subcellular localization determines the antiviral specificity of these proteins. Based on the reduction of vRNA in our study, we propose a model in which 2′−5′A locally activates RNase L around sites of viral replication. While the function of OAS1 p42 is unclear but might confer resistance to yet unknown pathogen. This is further supported by the genetic association of the A allele with multiple autoimmune disorders, as enhanced immune responses are sometimes made at a tradeoff for overall host fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Brien et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our work highlights intracellular targeting as a crucial determinant for the specificity of OAS1. By positioning viral RNA sensors at different subcellular sites of viral RNA accumulation, the host can potentially respond to diverse replication strategies in the cytosol, nucleus, or on intracellular membranes. Although this work focused on OAS1 and the detection of viral nucleic acids, subcellular targeting is likely also important for function of other OAS proteins. Future studies on the subcellular localization of other OAS proteins will define how this pathway is able to respond to viruses with diverse intracellular replication strategies.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by National Institutes of Health grants (nos.

In this study, Soveg et al. propose a novel mechanism by which viral RNA may be sensed by the p46 isoform of the OAS1 protein. Five alternatively spliced isoforms of human OAS1 have been described, their specific roles have not been defined. Here, the authors provide evidence that the OAS1 p46 isoform is targeted to Golgi membranes via its C-terminal prenylation motif. Endomembrane targeting of OAS1 p46 resulted in enhanced detection of viral RNA as well as antiviral activity against different positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate within modified host organelles. The authors found that antiviral activity was mediated through activation of RNase L. In comparison, the OAS1 p42 isoform also showed some RNase L dependent anti-viral activity but localized to the cytosol and nucleus. Targeting of p42 to endomembranes by expressing the p46 CaaX prenylation motif did not increase p42 binding to viral RNA or antiviral activity, suggesting additional properties of the p46 C-terminus contribute to its antiviral activity. The authors provide support for their findings from human genetic data in which the splice site SNP mediating synthesis of the OAS1 p46 isoform was associated with COVID19 severity.</p><p>The experimental work is extensive and was performed on cell lines (lentiviral transduction of OAS1 and ACE2 constructs, siRNA knockdown of OAS1, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of OAS1 and RNASEL genes, transient or stable) and primary human PBMCs and fibroblasts. Prenylation (geranylgeranylation) of OAS1 isoforms was assessed using a click-it chemistry immunoprecipitation approach. Cellular localization of proteins was studied by confocal microscopy. Importance of the CaaX prenylation motif on the OAS1 p46 was shown by expressing modified OAS1 isoforms in cell lines expressing or lacking the C-terminal CaaX motif and assessing cellular localization and function. Standard in vitro virus infection and quantification assays were performed with a range of viruses. Genetic OAS1 SNP association studies were performed by genotyping a local cohort of 34 severe COVID-19 cases and 99 healthy controls and validated using a dataset from a larger European cohort (&gt;10.000 datasets).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s assessment of our study and thoughtful review to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Confocal microscopy: It seems that quantifications were performed on as little as six individual cells (e.g. 1F)? Information on how these cells were chosen or how often experiments were repeated is not provided in the legend. Co-localizations are difficult to interpret from images shown. All confocal quantifications in the manuscript should display means of several individual experiments. Number of repeated individual experiments and quantified cells per experiment have to be stated in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Confocal microscopy quantifications shown in the manuscript are from one representative experiment. We now have provided specifics on the number of independent biological replicates for the microscopy images in the respective figure legends. Showing the number of cells analyzed provides the most transparency in the way these data are analyzed. This point is made by the reviewer’s question, as they raised a valid point that one of the cell type (Daudi cells; Figure 1F) had only a few cells quantified. This would not have been apparent if we had just plotted means from each experiment. In regards to Daudi cells, these are difficult to image as they are small and are hard to get them on the slides. Colocalization clarity issues is due to reduced resolution of the images in the manuscript, as we were constrained by file size limitations for the initial submission of our manuscript, but we will provide high resolution images for publication. We have also provided insets to show co-localization in the revised manuscript. We are also happy to send high resolution images to the journal so that they can transfer them to the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Expression of OAS1 isoforms increased drastically upon IFN-b treatment (cell lines, primary cells, Figure 1). The authors should provide information if IFNb was added to virus infection experiments with (untransfected) cell lines or primary cells (e.g. Figure 2F-I) to induce OAS1 expression. Was infection in primary cells tested +/- IFN-b addition? Was IFN-b production from infected cells measured?</p></disp-quote><p>THP-1 cells transfected with isoform-specific siRNAs against OAS1 were not pre-treated with rIFNb before EMCV infection, as these cells induce a strong IFN response against viral infection. In THP-1 cells viral infection is sufficient to induce endogenous expression of OAS1 protein isoforms (Figure 2H-G). However, in the primary human fibroblasts (Figure 2H-I), EMCV infection alone was not sufficient to induce OAS1 protein levels to be detectable by Western blot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This is in line with previous studies have shown that fibroblasts are weak IFN producers when compared to sentinel cells, such as macrophages or pDCs. To circumvent this issue, we induced OAS1 by pre-treating cells with 25 U/mL rIFNb, a concentration at which the cells induce an antiviral state that would still support EMCV infection and replication. This is stated in the figure legend for Figure 2H-I of the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Primary human fibroblasts do not induce OAS1 expression upon infection with EMCV.</title><p>Primary human fibroblasts of (A/A) and (A/G) genotype at rs10774671 were infected with EMCV (MOI=0.01) or treated with 25 U/mL rIFNβ for 24h.

Figure legends should state how often experiments were repeated, if results from a representative or average of all experiments are displayed. Statistical methods seem adequate but should be calculated from all replicates of the experiments (which should be stated in the legend).</p></disp-quote><p>Number of replicates/independently performed experiments and whether data shown is representative or averaged is now stated in the respective figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor questions:</p><p>Geranylgeranylation pull-down assay not explained in detail. Specific? Are there other methods?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have now expanded the description of the click-chemistry labeling experiment in the Results section, and we describe the procedure in more detail in the Methods section. Click-chemistry labeling approaches are the gold standard for labeling and assessing small post-translational protein modifications for which suitable antibodies do not exist. We have modified the original protocol for the Click-iT labeling kit (Thermo) slightly by performing an OAS1 isoform-specific FLAG-IP prior to the click-chemistry labeling, which was performed ‘on-bead’. This facilitates a clear readout on whether the protein of interest is geranylgeranylated or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Western blots (Figure 1, S1): To allow visualization of all possible OAS1 isoforms, the range from 35 to 60 kDa should be shown on the images, ideally with a marker as reference (Western blot images range only from 3750 kDa). Lysates from the A549 cells ectopically expressing different OAS1 isoforms might have been used in WB to visualize the size of the different isoforms.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have extended the range on our primary cell Western blot (Figure 1C) and these data show that no other isoforms other than p42 and p46 are expressed in primary cells of (A/A), (A/G), or (G/G) genotype. Similar to the primary cells, none of the other OAS1 isoforms were detected by immunoblot in other cell-lines we tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested improvements:</p><p>The manuscript text contains text duplicates many places which impairs reading.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this issue caused due to formatting issues in MS Word. We have now fixed those duplicate sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Too much and too detailed (result text and figures), could be shortened (some data removed) and focused to emphasise the major findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate this reviewer’s comment, especially when revision puts an enormous burden on the authors to generate new supportive data. Most of the data that are supportive to the story are in the supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major question for discussion or further experiments:</p><p>The manuscript opens by saying replication within host organelles shields viral RNA from sensing e.g. by RIGI/MDA-5, and targeting of host viral sensors to these would be beneficial. However, since p46 is targeted to the cytosolic side of endomembranes – and supposedly co-localises with viral RNA – this suggests that viral replication is not within organelles, but rather located to the cytosolic side of endomembranes. How, then, is RNA shielded from RIG-I/MDA-5? Authors should discuss or rewrite this part, alternatively use more markers (other golgi/ER markers, Rabs…?) to identify the precise localisation better. In addition, imaging should be improved to show co-localisation better (high-resolution insets?) underlying quantifications. Purple and red are not ideal choices combined in images.</p></disp-quote><p>The RNA replication for positive-strand RNA viruses occurs within the replication organelle. Our confocal and viral RNA immunoprecipitation experiments suggest either p46 gains access to the replicating organelle where it can detect vRNA as it is replicating, or p46 is proximal to sites of vRNA export. We also</p><p>have provided high-resolution insets for the confocal microscopy panels in Figure 6B and S2C.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ question regarding the placement of the viral protein in relation to the replication organelle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> provides a schematic on how OAS1 could interact with the viral RNA. Based on our data, we propose that prenylated OAS1 p46 localizes to the cytosolic surface of the organelle membrane. During infection with a positive-strand RNA virus, the viral non-structural proteins and viral RNA are recruited to the organelle surface, where p46 can interact with vRNA. As the membrane is involuted to form the viral replication organelle (VRO), prenylated p46 is also included in the VRO. Confinement of p46 in the VRO may enhance its access to viral RNA. Furthermore, newly prenylated proteins are continuously recruited to the organelle surface during infection, which may allow for additional interference of vRNA as it escapes the replication organelle. We have now added this in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71047-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some specifics:</p><p>Text duplicates: Lines 80-86 (same as 86-92), line 105-111 (same as 111-118), lines 170-176 (same as 176183).

The study provides a conceptual advance by demonstrating that the OAS1 p46 isoform, via prenylation of a Cterminal CaaX motif, is targeted to Golgi membranes. By adding or removing the prenylation motif to different OAS1 isoforms as well as further modifications, the authors could narrow down the effect of the p46 isoform mainly, but not exclusively to the C-terminal prenylation motif and found that the antiviral activity was mediated via RNaseL. It is further of interest that the p46 isoform also had antiviral activity against SARS CoV-2 and that alleles encoding for the cytosolic isoform OAS1 p42 were overrepresented in seriously ill COVID-19 patients (two cohorts).</p><p>This is the first study to identify a function specific to one of the OAS p46 isoform. Targeting of the OAS1 p46 RNA sensor isoform to endomembranes might present a novel host defense mechanism to detect RNA from viruses replicating in modified host organelles.</p><p>The study demonstrates a general antiviral mechanism and findings should be of interest to a broad audience (especially with the increased focus on viral infections due to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic). The study could direct increased focus on differential functions of isoforms of immune proteins.</p><p>Our expertise: Immunology, host-pathogen interactions, host defense to infection</p><p>Referee Cross-commenting</p><p>I agree with the comments from the other reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The work by Soveg and Schwerk et al. presents findings on the role of an isoform of OAS1, p46, on control of viral infection. This work concludes that the p46 isoform targets to endomembranous compartments of the cell, which are replication sites for some viruses. In the case of infection with these viruses, p46 confers protection to cells against virus infection, by targeting the antiviral p46 to the appropriate sites of viral replication. The authors demonstrated this by a series of biochemical and microscopy assays, mostly on protein overexpression systems. They complemented the work with experiments on endogenous OAS1, and human genetic studies linking the p46 isoform genetic variant with susceptibility to COVID-19. Overall, this was a well executed study showing clearly that the targeting of OAS1 to the site of virus infection is important for its antiviral activity.</p><p>The conclusion that p46, with is distinct subcellular localization, confers better protection against viral infection compared to p42 is very convincing. The molecular manipulations of p46 C-terminal domains demonstrate the importance of the CaaX domain as well as the length of the C-terminal region. However, one of the major weaknesses of this study is the reliance on overexpression of the OAS1 proteins rather than studying endogenous proteins in the context of viral infection. In some experiments, the authors addressed this by investigating endogenous isoforms in THP1 and primary human fibroblasts. In these experiments, the role of OAS1 on control of EMCV is overall less strong, but there is nevertheless a difference between p42 and p46 isoforms that is clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s insights and suggestions. We have addressed your concerns in our point-by-point response below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional improvements to the manuscript are as follows:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The major outcomes of viral infection measured in the study were viral titres and RNA levels. Could the authors employ additional experiments to look at other outcomes? E.g. measurement of cellular 2'-5'-A produced, cell death, or cellular RNA degradation (i.e. RNaseL activation)?</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the reviewer that measuring another parameter could be helpful, there are no assays that are sensitive enough that can provide quantitative measurement of endogenous 2’-5’A production in infected cells. In the initial phase of our study, we also tried to assess RNase L activation by measuring RNA degradation using bioanalyzer. Although the OAS/RNase L community have shown laddering mostly in A549 cells, we did not observe RNA laddering as a readout for RNase L activation in a variety of cells tested. As we do not observe host RNA degradation/laddering, this might indicate a more localized viral RNA-specific degradation induced by RNaseL. We show that OAS1 isoforms produce 2’-5’A and its antiviral activity is dependent on intact RNase L (see Figures 3D-F), demonstrating that this pathway is required for the antiviral activity of p46. Based on these issues, quantification of the viral titer by plaque assay is most sensitive and biologically relevant readout when assessing the activity of OAS1 isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors mentioned in the discussion, often there are examples of viral antagonism in important innate immune pathways. The authors briefly touch on this. Could they provide more detailed examples of OAS1 targeting specifically by viruses relevant to sensing at the ER/Golgi membranes? This will help demonstrate the important role of OAS1 p46 in innate immunity to virus infection.</p></disp-quote><p>While a few viruses are known to antagonize OAS-RNAseL pathway, among positive sense RNA viruses Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and MERS-CoV accessory protein encodes for a phosphodiesterase which degrade 2’-5’A (PMIDs: 27025250, 19176619). As 2’-5’A is critical for the activation of RNAseL, antagonizing this pathway makes them insensitive to OAS1-RNaseL mediated virus control. However, intriguingly, SARSCoV-2 do not carry this phosphodiesterase in their genome, making them susceptible to OAS1-p46. This is now included in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The link found between OAS1 p42/p46 isoforms and COVID-19 lends weight to the importance of this protein in innate immunity. However, the authors only compared between severe cases and uninfected individuals. Would a more appropriate comparison be between severe and mild/asymptomatic cases?</p><p>Furthermore, graphical depiction of this data could potentially be useful for the reader to appreciate the effects.</p><p>It would also be useful if the authors more directly described the prevalence of rs10774671 A/G variants in the general population.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not have enough patients with mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 to give us sufficient power for such analysis. None of the recently published genetic studies including our replication cohort have recruited mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (Pairo-Castineira et al., Nature 2021). However, the reviewer has a valid point, studies on mild/asymptomatic should be carried out when we are out of the pandemic phase since current priority has been to treat severe covid-19 patients.</p><p>Based on the reviewers advice, we have now included a graphical depiction of our genetic association data in the main figure (Figure 6G) as requested.

This is something that has not been investigated in much depth, and continues to be not well understood for many other receptors in the field. This work opens the possibility that subcellular localization of other receptors, or their isoforms, could similarly have effects on their function, and that investigations of localization will be important avenues of research in the field in future.
