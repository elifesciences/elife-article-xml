processing. In this circuitry, ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain innervate targets throughout the limbic forebrain, such as the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dopaminergic signaling in the NAc has been widely studied for its role in behavioral reinforcement, reward prediction error encoding, and motivational salience. Less well characterized is the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the response to surprising or alerting sensory events. To address this, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight1 and fiber photometry to explore the ability of striatal dopamine release to encode the properties of salient sensory stimuli in mice, such as threatening looming discs. Here, we report that lateral NAc (LNAc) dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than the visual stimulus threat level. This encoding is highly sensitive, as LNAc dopamine could be evoked by light intensities that were imperceptible to human experimenters. We also found that light-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, robust to previous exposure history, and involve multiple phototransduction pathways. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine system’s ability to encode visual information in mice, which is likely relevant to a wide body of scientists employing light sources or optical methods in behavioral research involving rodents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>central visual pathways</kwd><kwd>visual pigment genes</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014370</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BTI Award 663007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>J Elliott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016618</institution-id><institution>Gilbert Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Team Science Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>J Elliott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010327</institution-id><institution>Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Trustee Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>J Elliott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014370</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEED award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cotella</surname><given-names>Evelin M</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>J Elliott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in mice encodes the rate and magnitude of rapid environmental luminance changes rather than visual stimulus novelty or threat intensity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mesolimbic dopamine system is an evolutionarily conserved set of circuits that plays a role in approach and avoidance, appetitive behavior, and reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wise, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcantara et al., 2022</xref>).

While many previous studies have reported phasic firing of dopaminergic neurons in response to light flashes in laboratory animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horvitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Comoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dommett et al., 2005</xref>), it is unclear how NAc dopamine release encodes the properties and/or emotional valence of arousing visual stimuli, such as visual threats.</p><p>Across a range of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ball and Tronick, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sun and Frost, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakagawa and Hongjian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Temizer et al., 2015</xref>), rapidly approaching objects or looming visual threats elicit automatic defensive or avoidance responses. In mice, the presentation of an expanding, overhead, black disc that simulates an aerial predator approach (a looming stimulus) promotes rapid escape to an available shelter, followed by long periods of freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). In our previous work published in eLife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>), mice modeling cognitive dysfunction associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) exhibited more vigorous escape in responses to looming stimulus presentation. Additionally, NAc dopamine release evoked by a white light stimulus was higher in NF1 model mice compared to wildtype littermates, which correlated with behavioral conditioning abnormalities in <italic>Nf1</italic> mutants. Despite the demonstration that white light can induce NAc dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutlu et al., 2021</xref>), the striatal dopamine response to visual threats is not well characterized in mice. Additionally, it is unknown what visual stimulus characteristics – if any – are encoded by NAc dopamine. Thus, one cannot fully interpret the significance of aberrant responses in neurodevelopmental disease models without a more thorough understanding of visual stimulus encoding by mesolimbic dopamine release in typically developing subjects.</p><p>In this Research Article, we sought to probe ventral striatal dopaminergic responses to arousing visual stimuli, including looming visual threats. Given the ability of dopaminergic neurons to signal stimulus saliency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010b</xref>), we hypothesized that looming discs would induce ‘alerting’ NAc dopamine release whose magnitude would scale proportionately with perceived threat intensity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the genetically-encoded sensor dLight1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patriarchi et al., 2019</xref>) to monitor dopamine release in the lateral NAc (LNAc) of freely moving adult C57Bl/6J mice with fiber photometry, as performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). The LNAc was chosen given our previous observation that light stimuli evoked robust dopamine transients in this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we report that lateral NAc dopamine release reliably reads out unique visual stimulus properties in mice, a phenomenon that is likely relevant to a wide body of scientists employing light sources or optical methods in behavioral research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dopaminergic responses to looming visual threats</title><p>To explore the encoding of visual threats by ventral striatum dopamine, we stereotaxically injected an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV5-hSyn-dLight1.2) to express dLight1.2 in the lateral nucleus accumbens of adult C57Bl/6J mice, followed by implantation of a 400 μm optical fiber for sensor excitation and emitted photon collection with fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our fiber photometry system utilized a 465 nm LED for sensor excitation and a 405 nm LED for isosbestic (control) excitation, which was used as a reference signal to account for the effects of photobleaching and movement artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Post hoc</italic> histological analysis of dLight1 recording sites showed good targeting of the LNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) with the distribution of optical fiber tip locations centered upon the medial LNAc shell (LNAcS) and spanning from the lateral edge of the LNAcS to the lateral aspect of the NAc core medially. This region is innervated by the broad axonal arbors of lateral VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beier et al., 2015</xref>), whose terminals respond similarly to aversive stimuli in the LNAcS and lateral NAc core in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>).

During photometry recordings, mice were exposed to trains of five overhead, black, looming discs on a light gray background that we empirically determined produce short-latency escape in C57Bl/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). As controls, we presented mice with trains of discs that do not reliably evoke defensive responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), such as a static disc (a fixed 30.5 cm black disc on a light gray background), a receding disc (a black disc that contracted from 30.5 cm to 0 cm on a light gray background), and contrast inverted discs (light gray static, looming, or receding discs on a black background). We observed that looming discs induced low-amplitude dopamine transients at the onset of the first stimulus in each train that – contrary to our hypothesis – was not significantly different from the dLight1 responses to non-threatening static and receding discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Surprisingly, repeating these experiments with contrast-inverted discs that do not induce escape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) evoked ~3–6-fold greater dopamine release than black discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>).

To test this possibility, we exposed mice to full-screen, instantaneous transitions from black to light gray during dLight1 recordings, which eliminated disc edge motion as a contributing visual stimulus property. We found that instantaneous dark-to-light transitions produced a high amplitude (10.38 ± 0.43 z-score), short duration (full width a half-maximal amplitude: 143 ± 9.7 ms) dopamine transient that peaked 434 ± 3.3 ms after transition onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Lengthening the dark-to-light transition time (i.e. the fade-in time) to full-screen illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) non-linearly decreased the magnitude of the dLight1 peak and increased the peak latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For transition times less than ~500 ms, the dopamine peak latency closely matched the fade-in time, above which peak response occurred hundreds of milliseconds to seconds before full field illumination was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When transition times were greater than 1 s, evoked dLight1 transients were often too small to accurately resolve from the fluorescent baseline for individual mice. However, averaging the fluorescence trace from all mice prior to peak detection allowed signals to be resolved for longer transition times. Thus, results are presented as both the fluorescence peak(s) derived from the photometry trace averaged across all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which showed high concordance for transition times of 1 s or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

High irradiance LED illumination (5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>) evoked a dLight1 transient at stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) that was similar to transients evoked by the LCD monitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>; irradiance at mouse level: 11 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>).

When LED irradiance was reduced, we observed an intensity-dependent decrease in the magnitude of the dLight1 peak and an increase in the response latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>), consistent with Bloch’s law of temporal summation in mammalian photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scharnowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donner, 2021</xref>). Significant dopaminergic responses were observed at all irradiances tested, including 0.2 nW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which was not perceptible to the human experimenter. As a point of reference, the lock screen of a Samsung S21 smart phone on the lowest brightness setting had an irradiance of 20 nW/cm<sup>2</sup> when placed in the same position as the white LED. Likewise, time-locked dopamine release could be evoked by simply uncovering the enclosure peephole that allows users to observe mouse behavior (irradiance: 17 nW/cm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results were not likely caused by mouse movement, as illumination of a white LED that was 1000-fold more intense (5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) than the highest irradiance tested had little effect on behavior when freely exploring mice entered a target zone within a dark arena (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

In order to test if the dLight1 response to 5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> white LED light is affected by a repeated exposure, we exposed mice to twenty consecutive 1 s white light pulses over five trials (100 pulses total) across a range of ISIs (10 ms to 10 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that light-evoked dopamine transient magnitude decayed logarithmically as a function of the ISI duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). When the ISI was short (e.g. 10–100 ms), dLight1 responses habituated rapidly. This is exemplified by the dopaminergic response to 40 Hz light flicker, which is used therapeutically to enhance neural activity in the context of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singer et al., 2018</xref>). Presentation of a sixty-second 40 Hz white LED flicker (5.0 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> irradiance, 50% duty cycle) induced a dopamine transient only at stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that was indistinguishable from the response to constant illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This is in contrast to earlier repeated white LED experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) with a long ISI (90–180 s) that showed no trial-by-trial reduction in the dopaminergic response to light across a range of LED irradiances. To further explore how LNAc dopamine responses are affected by exposure history, we measured the response to 5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> white LED light (1 s duration × five trials with a 100 s ISI) in stimulus-naïve mice before and after three hundred consecutive 1 s light exposures (1 s ISI) during the same session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Compared to baseline measurements, there was a significant reduction (31.6%) in the peak dLight1 response to the 5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> light after exposure to three hundred LED exposures. This reduction in the dopaminergic response to white LED light was transient, as peak dLight1 magnitude returned to baseline when mice were re-exposed to the light stimulus 48 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

This is additionally germane given the widespread use of molecular and optical technologies in rodents that require delivery of specific wavelengths of visible light in order to probe neural activity, structure, or biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Resendez and Stuber, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sabatini and Tian, 2020</xref>).

Additionally, melanopsin (λ<sub>max</sub> ~480 nm) is expressed in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that mediate circadian entrainment, the pupillary light reflex, and light-regulated changes in mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Panda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hattar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). While it has been hypothesized that ipRGCs engage VTA dopamine neurons via hypothalamic intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), the role of melanopsin in the dopaminergic response to light is unknown. In order to parse the role of visual opsins versus melanopsin in the mesolimbic response to dark-to-light transitions, we performed LNAc dLight1 recordings in <italic>Opn4</italic> (melanopsin) knockout mice and <italic>Gnat1</italic>/<italic>Gnat2</italic> double knockout mice (<italic>Gnat1/2</italic>-dKO). <italic>Gnat1 and 2</italic> knockout mice lack expression of rod and cone α-transducin, respectively, and exhibit loss of signal transduction through these photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). Compared with wildtype littermates, <italic>Gnat1/2</italic>-dKO mice displayed a robust reduction in the dopaminergic response to a 5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> white LED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and an increase in the dLight1 response latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Light-evoked dopamine release was not abolished, however, in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Spectral analysis indicated that <italic>Gnat1/2</italic>-dKO mice retain sensitivity to UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which may be indicative of residual cone-based vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, loss of melanopsin expression in <italic>Opn4</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Panda et al., 2002</xref>) did not affect the dLight1 response to the white light stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings indicate that light-evoked dopamine release is rod and cone-dependent and may not involve melanopsin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In these investigations, we used the genetically-encoded dopamine sensor dLight1 to demonstrate that lateral NAc dopamine release can encode rapid changes in luminance but not looming threat intensity. We found that rapid dark-to-light transitions evoked time-locked dopamine responses at stimulus onset at irradiances as low as 0.2 nW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is in line with findings that mice see over a 100 million-fold range of light intensity beginning at ~4 μcd/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Umino et al., 2008</xref>). The magnitude of these dopaminergic responses was highly dependent on light stimulus frequency and transition rate rather than duration or novelty. In fact, high amplitude LNAc dLight1 responses to a white LED persisted after hundreds of exposures. Although mesolimbic dopamine systems regulate wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>) and exhibit circadian oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Korshunov et al., 2017</xref>), the time of testing did not appear to be a significant contributor to our findings. Sudden dark-to-light transitions are highly salient to nocturnal rodents that must avoid detection by visual predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>), so it is possible that the dopaminergic response to light represents a specialized saliency signal that helps the animal alert to stimuli that require motivated responses to promote survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schultz and Romo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horvitz, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In primates, midbrain dopaminergic neurons fire in response to unrewarded visual stimuli independent of physical salience or novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014</xref>). However, the magnitude of these responses is significantly more robust in rewarded environments, suggesting that dopaminergic responses to sensory stimuli primarily serve to promote interaction with potentially rewarding objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014</xref>) or enable novel action discovery that could lead to reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Redgrave and Gurney, 2006</xref>). While there was no conditioned reward explicitly available in the present study, dopaminergic responses to visual stimuli may relate to changes in environmental context that predict future reward availability based on past experiences, such as rapid lighting changes that occur when mouse cages are opened to provide food pellets. Additionally, dopamine release in the medial NAc core in response to unconditioned auditory cues has been shown to facilitate latent inhibition, in which habituation to repeated presentation of a neutral sensory stimulus reduces its ability to drive cue-outcome learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kutlu et al., 2022</xref>). These considerations emphasize the need for future studies to firmly establish the ethological and neurobiological importance of dopaminergic responses to environmental light, especially when the relationship to a past or future reward is not obvious, as in our experiments.</p><p>The LNAc dopamine response to light may also be influenced by the ability of dopaminergic neurons to signal sensory prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Howard and Kahnt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stalnaker et al., 2019</xref>). In an elegant set of experiments in rats, VTA dopaminergic neurons were shown to fire in response to unexpected changes in the sensory properties of a reinforcer when the relative subjective value was unchanged (e.g. switching the flavor of an equally palatable Kool-Aid reward) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stalnaker et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the ISI-dependent attenuation of the dopamine response to repeated light stimuli that we observed is not true habituation. Rather, the dopaminergic response to light response may have decayed rapidly because events occurring closer in time are inherently more predictable, thus reducing the sensory prediction error and evoked dopamine release. While this hypothesis could be tested by unexpectedly altering the stimulus wavelength to induce a sensory prediction error during a train of repeated light exposures, one would need to carefully account for the spectral overlap of mouse visual opsins and the non-uniform distribution of cone opsins across the retina to ensure that changes in dopamine release were due to changes in chromaticity rather than luminance, which would confound the results. The use of transgenic mice genetically engineered to express the red human cone opsin (λ<sub>max</sub> = 556 nm) in place of the mouse M-opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smallwood et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lall et al., 2010</xref>) may be useful in future efforts to test this hypothesis, as it would allow for activation of cones with isoluminant blue and red light independent of melanopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In these studies, we demonstrate that LNAc dopamine is broadly evoked by wavelengths across the visual spectrum. Given the high proportion of rods in the mouse retina (~97% of photoreceptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jeon et al., 1998</xref>) and the reduced sensitivity of dopaminergic responses to 360 and 635 nm light at lower irradiances, it is probable that rod-based phototransduction is primarily responsible for visually-evoked dopamine release under dim (scotopic) lighting conditions. Conversely, rod and cone opsins likely contributed to dLight1 signals in the photopic range. These hypotheses are supported by our observation that genetic disruption of rod and cone-based signaling in <italic>Gnat1/2</italic>-dKO mice substantially attenuated the dopaminergic response to light. <italic>Gnat1/2</italic>-dKO mice retained sensitivity to high irradiance UV light, which was most likely caused by incomplete loss of cone-based vision in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2010</xref>). We cannot, however, rule out the involvement of UV-sensitive non-visual opsins in our observed findings, such as neuropsin (<italic>Opn5</italic>), which is maximally activated by 380 nm light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tarttelin et al., 2003</xref>). Neuropsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells project to multiple limbic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>), and this opsin promotes thermogenesis via intrinsically light-sensitive glutamatergic neurons in the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). While melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs are hypothesized to engage VTA outputs via a disynaptic circuit involving the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), we found that <italic>Opn4</italic> knockout had no effect on the ability of light to evoke LNAc dopamine. Given that ipRGCs receive rod and cone input via the retinal synaptic network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Güler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altimus et al., 2010</xref>), it is possible that these neurons contribute to light-evoked dopamine release independent of melanopsin. Thus, functional lesioning studies will be required to elucidate the role of non-image forming visual pathways in the dopaminergic encoding of visual stimuli.</p><p>Visual information is conveyed from the retina to the brain via the axons of retinal ganglion cells that synapse in downstream nuclei to mediate image processing, circadian entrainment, pupillary reflexes, gaze orientation, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peirson et al., 2018</xref>). While thalamocortical visual pathways are required for conscious visual perception, neither the primary visual cortex (V1) nor the visual thalamus (e.g. lateral geniculate nucleus) significantly innervates ventral midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>). Previous work by Redgrave and colleagues suggest that dopaminergic responses to light are driven by the superior colliculus (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Comoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dommett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takakuwa et al., 2017</xref>), which receives direct input from retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande and Huberman, 2014</xref>) in its superficial layers and promotes motivated behavior via deep motor-output layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Branco and Redgrave, 2020</xref>). SC glutamatergic projection neurons directly synapse onto VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Solié et al., 2022</xref>) and substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), both of which project to the lateral NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, optogenetic stimulation of SC neuron somata is sufficient to evoke lateral NAc dopamine release <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). While these observations support a role for the SC in dopaminergic responses to light, the relative contribution of different visual processing centers to our findings is an important area of future study.</p><p>One important question not addressed by the current study is whether the dopaminergic response to unconditioned visual stimuli is consistent across striatal sub-regions or shows regional heterogeneity. We performed dLight1 recordings in the lateral NAc, which receives dopaminergic innervation from the lateral VTA and medial substantia nigra pars compacta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farassat et al., 2019</xref>). LNAc-projecting VTA dopamine neurons have broad axonal arbors covering the dorsal striatum, olfactory tubercle, and NAc core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beier et al., 2015</xref>), which may indicate that dopamine release encodes visual stimulus properties across these sub-regions. Conversely, the NAc medial shell is innervated by more medially located VTA dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beier et al., 2015</xref>) whose axonal arbors are primarily restricted to this downstream site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beier et al., 2015</xref>). These differences in connectivity may explain previously observed variations in dopaminergic encoding across NAc subregions. For example, VTA axon terminals and dopamine release in the LNAc encode both stimulus valence and prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>), similar to responses in the adjacent NAc core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>). This is in contrast to the NAc medial shell, where dopaminergic axons are strongly activated by appetitive and aversive motivational stimuli but not reward predictive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>). At this time, how and if NAc medial shell dopamine encodes visual stimulus characteristics is unknown and represents an important future direction for study.</p><p>Mesolimbic dopaminergic circuits are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric conditions, including disorders of impulse control, schizophrenia, and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Purper-Ouakil et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maia and Frank, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robinson and Gradinaru, 2018</xref>), including NF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diggs-Andrews et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anastasaki et al., 2015</xref>). Patients with NF1 exhibit high rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mautner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miguel et al., 2015</xref>), in which difficulties with attentional orientation are associated with a diminished ability to suppress distractive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboitiz et al., 2014</xref>) such that irrelevant environmental cues are assigned exaggerated stimulus salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tegelbeckers et al., 2015</xref>). Previously in eLife, we showed that dopaminergic responses to light are enhanced in NF1 model mice and correlate with disruptions in the expression of conditioned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). Our current findings suggest that these responses reflect changes in the encoding of environmental lighting conditions and, given their correlation with phenotypic expression, may reflect altered stimulus saliency. Aberrant sensory processing and motivational dysregulation are common features of neurodevelopmental disorders, including syndromic and non-syndromic forms of autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behrmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tomchek and Dunn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robinson and Gradinaru, 2018</xref>). Therefore, better characterization of the functional interplay between visual processing and dopaminergic circuitry may improve our pathophysiological understanding of these disorders.</p></sec><sec

The emission signal from 405 nm isosbestic excitation was used as a reference signal to account for motion artifacts and photo-bleaching. A first-order polynomial fit was applied to align the 465 nm signal to the 405 nm signal. Then, the polynomial fitted model was subtracted from the 465 nm channel to calculate ΔF values.

Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> were performed in a separate cohort of stimulus-naïve mice. Experiments in <italic>Gnat1/2</italic> knockout and wildtype littermates were performed in the following order: white LED light stimuli, and individual wavelength exposures. Opn4 mice underwent white LED exposure only. For overhead disc stimuli, photometry was performed within a custom setup that featured a 24-inch LCD mounted 25.4 cm above mouse level in a light and sound attenuating chamber (Model 83018DDP, Lafayette Instrument Company). Stimuli (looming, static, and receding discs; full screen fades; etc.) were generated on the LCD display using Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>), which also controlled delivery of a TTL pulse to the photometry system via a BNC cable to timestamp stimulus onset. The TTL pulse was generated with an Arduino Uno Rev3 microcontroller. During each experiment, mice were placed within the bottom of a clean shoebox cage with a thin layer cob bedding in the light and sound-attenuating chamber underneath the LCD. Looming discs expanded from 0 cm to 30.5 cm over 0.84 s and froze at full expansion for 0.26 s, encompassing 61.9 degrees of visual angle, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). Receding discs shrunk from 30.5 cm to 0 cm over 0.84 s. Static discs maintained their 30.5 cm diameter throughout the duration of the stimulus. During each stimulus train, five discs were shown consecutively with a 0.5 s interstimulus interval (ISI). Mice were exposed to five stimulus trains with a 600 s inter-trial interval (ITI) on each experimental day. In a separate experiment, single full field fades from black to light gray (0–10 s fade duration) was delivered via the LCD screen across five trials with a 120 s ITI on different days of testing.</p><p>White LED exposures were delivered via the house light of a modular conditioning chamber (Model 80015NS, Lafayette Instruments Company) placed within the light and sound attenuating box and controlled by ABET II software (Lafayette Instrument Company). A TTL breakout adapter (Model 81510) was used to synchronize stimulus delivery with the photometry recording. Single 10 s light stimuli were delivered across ten trials with a randomized ITI between 90 and 180 s. Glass neutral density filters were used to attenuate the irradiance when necessary (0.1–3.0 OD, HOYA Filter USA and/or Edmund Optics TECHSPEC filters). Because ND filters could not be changed mid-testing session, responses to each light intensity were recorded on different testing days. Trains of twent 1 s light stimuli with variable ISIs (10 ms – 10 s) were delivered across five trials (100 total exposures) with a 300 s ITI on different testing days. Five 1 s light stimuli with a 100 s ISI were delivered before and after 300 1 s light stimuli with a one-second ISI; 100 s separated the 300 1 s stimuli and each 100 s ISI stimulus train. The five-stimulus train with a 100 s ISI was repeated 48 hr later in the same group of mice. 1 min of 40 Hz flicker exposure (50% duty cycle) was repeated across 5 trials with a 120 s ITI. For paired light stimuli experiments, a 1 s white LED stimulus was delivered 1 s after a 300 s or 1 s light stimulus across ten trials (five trials/stimulus pair presented in a random order) during the same testing session. Each trial was separated by 300 s.</p><p>Individual wavelength light stimuli were generated with a Lumencor Aura III LED light engine, which was triggered via TTL inputs from the Lafayette Instruments TTL breakout adapter and controlled by ABET II. The liquid light guide that delivered the visual stimulus was positioned in the approximate location of the white LED within the testing chamber. LED light power (measured at mouse level with a Thor Labs PM100D optical power meter with S130VC photodiode sensor) was modulated using the onboard Lumencor graphical user interface and, when necessary, attenuated via the use of glass neutral density filters (0.1–3.0 OD, HOYA Filter USA and/or Edmund Optics TECHSPEC filters) placed in front of the liquid light guide outlet within a custom housing. Ten-second single-wavelength stimuli were delivered in random order with a randomized ITI (140–200 s) to achieve five total exposures per color per mouse. Because LED power could not be adjusted mid-testing session, responses to different irradiances were measured on separate testing days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Auditory stimulus exposure</title><p>Auditory stimulus exposures were performed in the modular testing chamber within the light and sound attenuating enclosure similar to single white LED exposures. A 10 s 80 dB tone (1–16 kHz; generated via Lafayette Instruments 7 Tone Generator Model 81415 M) was presented via a speaker (0.25–16 kHz; Model 80135 M14, Lafayette Instrument Company) across five trials with a randomized ITI (140–200 s) during the same experimental session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Looming stimulus assay</title><p>The looming stimulus assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>) using an apparatus built to the specifications of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans et al., 2018</xref>. The apparatus featured a 20.3 cm (w) × 61 cm (l) × 40.6 cm (h) clear, open, rectangular acrylic arena with a dark, infrared (IR) light-transmitting shelter at one end and a ‘threat zone’ at the opposite end that housed a 9 cm clear plastic petri dish to encourage exploration outside of the shelter. A 15.6-inch monitor was mounted above the arena so that discs (19.5 cm maximum diameter encompassing 27 degrees of visual angle) could be presented to the mice when they entered the threat zone. The arena floor was backlit with an infrared light (880 nm back-lit collimated backlight, Advanced Illumination) to improve mouse tracking under dim light conditions. The entire apparatus was placed inside a custom light-attenuating enclosure for testing. During testing, mice were recorded with a Basler acA2040-120 um camera with an Edmunds Optics TECHSPEC 6 mm C Series fixed focal length lens, and real-time position tracking was performed with Bonsai. This allowed for the presentation of the overhead looming, receding, or static disc stimulus to be automatically triggered when the animal was in the threat zone following a 10 min habituation period. Mouse position and velocity data were analyzed <italic>post hoc</italic> using Ethovision XT software (Noldus Information Technology) and Python. Note: In <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, the clear, circular pedestals that separated the infrared backlight from the apparatus base can be seen with the IR camera; they were below the arena floor and inaccessible to the mouse. The setup was modified for spotlight experiments so that the pedestals would not be visible in the captured videos. Spotlight experiments were performed in the same apparatus using the same procedure described above except that a high-intensity white LED (5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> measured at mouse level) positioned to illuminate the threat zone replaced the LCD monitor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Python, GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, Inc), and/or Data Science Workbench 14 (for 3-way repeated measures ANOVA; TIBCO Software, Inc). All statistical tests performed on data presented in the manuscript are stated in the figure captions and provided in detail with the corresponding source data files. For each experiment, statistical tests were chosen based on the structure of the experiment and the data set. No outliers were removed during statistical analysis. Parametric tests were used throughout the manuscript. Sample size estimates were based on studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2019</xref> and power analysis performed using the sampsizepwr function in Matlab (MathWorks). When analysis of variance (ANOVA; 1-way, 2-way, 3-way, and/or repeated measures) was performed, multiple comparisons were corrected using the Bonferroni correction. When repeated measures ANOVA could not be performed due to missing values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), data were analyzed by fitting a mixed model in GraphPad Prism 9; this approach uses a compound symmetry covariance matrix and is fit using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). When results were compared to a pre-stimulus baseline, this value was defined as the amplitude of the dLight1 peak that occurred 500 ms prior to stimulus delivery. When results were compared to a ‘null’ stimulus, the value was defined as the dLight1 peak that occurred at the onset of a TTL that timestamped a trial in which no stimulus was delivered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data and materials availability</title><p>Viral vector plasmids used in this study are available on Addgene.

With your revision please include a point x point response to each point raise below and in the public review and recommendations for authors.</p><p>1) Some information and/or histology figure illustrating the placement of the fibers and also viral expression.

These are detailed in each reviewer's comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The scholarship of this study could be substantially improved, and some critical points need to be clarified or addressed:</p><p>– It is not immediately clear which mice were used for which experiments, what was the sensory history of each subject, or even what was the total number of mice used in the study. The authors mention that responses persisted after months of testing, so presumably, the same mice were tested and retested across different experiments. This information needs to be better detailed in the methods section, and it would be useful to have a visual timeline of each experiment.</p><p>– The authors do not provide any histological confirmation of fiber placement and viral expression. Not even a schematic of each fiber placement. This is a critical issue, especially as the lateral shell of the NAcc is a very small and narrow target in mice, and there are several discussions in the field about the potential computational specificity of dopaminergic signals in different NAcc compartments.</p><p>– The authors did not discuss or cite a number of relevant studies that have addressed similar issues, such as Kutlu et al. 2022 and Morrens et al. 2020, that have shown that dopamine transients in the VS evoked by visual, auditory, and odor cues are attenuated as a function of latent inhibition, similarly to some of results presented here. To what extent is the short-term sensory habituation found here different from this latent inhibition effect? Likewise, previous work has shown that dopamine neurons encode prediction errors generated by unexpected sensory (gustatory) transitions, including the specific sensory identity of the transitions (Takahashi et al., 2017; Stalnaker et al., 2019). Could the present results be a reflection of sensory prediction errors as proposed by these two previous papers?</p><p>– In the same vein as the previous point, one critical argument against the direct encoding of sensory stimuli properties by dopamine neurons or dopamine release is that these responses reflect a generalization of conditioning to previously rewarded events or contexts (Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014). According to this interpretation, dopamine is indeed only encoding reward-related information, but responses to neutral stimuli arise from a generalization of previous cue-reward pairings. If one were to apply this logic to the current study, it could be that the mice associate sharp transitions in their visual landscape with the renewal of their food supply (e.g., by experimenters or animal care staff opening the cage to give them more pellets), and therefore this is why there are sharp dopamine responses to these sensory events. Which components of the experiments in this study can rule out this interpretation, or at least mark it as unlikely?</p><p>References:</p><p>Kobayashi S, Schultz W (2014) Reward contexts extend dopamine signals to unrewarded stimuli.

They further find that the frequency of illuminance transitions, rather than the number per se, dictates the extent that dopamine signals habituate. In a number of studies, they characterize dopamine signals to light of different wavelengths, durations, and intensities. These results shed new light on the role of dopamine in signaling salience, independent of reward or threat learning. I thought the work was elegantly done and compellingly reported.</p><p>I have a few questions and comments.</p><p>A thought I had while reading this report is the question of why the lateral shell/ventral striatum was chosen as the focal point. There is, as the authors note, a reason to suggest that salience or value-free signals from dopamine occur in this portion of the striatum, but that is also the case in some studies for other regions, such as the accumbens core. I also appreciate that a previous paper from the senior author demonstrated a lateral shell visual cue-related effect. Nevertheless, I think the main limitation in the current data is a lack of comparison to another striatal region, either in the accumbens or elsewhere. Given the pretty extensive (and still growing) literature on dopamine heterogeneity in reward, valence, novelty, salience, and reinforcement signaling and function, I think it's reasonable to expect that some features of the demonstrated results here would differ, even in other ventral striatal regions. I would suggest including some discussion of this complexity, and perhaps changing the title to more specifically denote the findings here are in the lateral shell rather than &quot;ventral striatum&quot;. Lateral, ventral, medial shell and core all have pretty well-documented variable dopamine dynamics to salient stimuli in other studies and that may play in here.</p><p>Conversely, a demonstration that at least some of the illuminance transition signals are similar across other striatal regions would be very interesting and informative in the context of the growing heterogeneity work. I'm not suggesting that the whole striatum needs to be probed, and definitely not to the level of detail as in the current report, but it would be really informative to know if some of the basics here hold/don't hold for another region.</p><p>In more specific questions, I was a little confused about the specific focus on dark-to-light transitions, given the framing of the evolved need to respond quickly to overhead threats, since that scenario presumably usually involves a light-to-dark transition (as a bird descends above the mouse). It wasn't clear if light-to-dark transitions were directly studied beyond the initial looming disc studies. Presumably, a rapid transition from bright lighting to darkness would also evoke strong dopamine.</p><p>I think it would be useful to emphasize in the descriptions of experiments for Figures 1 and 2 that long inter-stimulus intervals were used (I didn't learn this until the end of the methods). The authors later show that light transition signals don't really habituate if the ISIs are long – as I was reading I was confused about how rapidly repeated stimuli presentations were delivered, when intensity and duration conditions were within subject or between, etc. Perhaps a supplement figure showing more of the trial-by-trial data could be included to demonstrate a lack of habituation in the experiments in Figures 1 and 2 and clarify some of this.</p><p>The lack of clear habituation in the light transition signals when they occur separated by long intervals is super interesting. I do wonder if there are still possible long-term changes occurring, especially with mice that are getting 100s of light transition trials.</p><p>Related, do the authors know if auditory cue-evoked signals also don't habituate if spaced out? This isn't an experiment that would need to be done for this paper, but if that data exists it would be interesting to know if the habituation effect is similar across stimulus modalities or not.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85064.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In addition to the specific concerns of each reviewer, there were several things that were deemed essential and/or come out as themes across all reviewers, to which you should pay special attention.

While reward generalization could be a contributing factor to our findings, there are a few points that make it less likely. In our vivarium, the cages are changed during the light phase of the light-dark cycle, so a dark-to-light transition does not occur at cage opening. Additionally, food is always available to the mice, so they never undergo a period of fasting that would necessarily make opening of the cage a rewarding event. It is very possible, however, that there are rewarding stimuli associated with dark-to-light transitions that we have not accounted for, which could potentially affect the findings. Future studies will need to better parse this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– One way to determine the role of stimulus prediction in canceling stimulus-evoked dopamine response would be to train mice to form tone → light associations and compare signaled (tone→light) vs unsignaled light-evoked dopamine responses.

Lateral, ventral, medial shell and core all have pretty well-documented variable dopamine dynamics to salient stimuli in other studies and that may play in here.</p><p>Conversely, a demonstration that at least some of the illuminance transition signals are similar across other striatal regions would be very interesting and informative in the context of the growing heterogeneity work. I'm not suggesting that the whole striatum needs to be probed, and definitely not to the level of detail as in the current report, but it would be really informative to know if some of the basics here hold/don't hold for another region.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is critical to know whether dopaminergic responses to visual stimuli generalize to other striatal sub-regions or show regional heterogeneity. This is a question we are actively exploring and hope to include it in a follow-up publication. As mentioned in the responses to other reviewers, we have greatly expanded our Discussion section to better highlight the issue of regional heterogeneity in the dopaminergic response to light, which I hope the reviewer finds addresses their concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In more specific questions, I was a little confused about the specific focus on dark-to-light transitions, given the framing of the evolved need to respond quickly to overhead threats, since that scenario presumably usually involves a light-to-dark transition (as a bird descends above the mouse). It wasn't clear if light-to-dark transitions were directly studied beyond the initial looming disc studies. Presumably, a rapid transition from bright lighting to darkness would also evoke strong dopamine.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on dark-to-light transitions because presentations of dark discs on a light background did not induce robust dopamine release (whereas light discs on dark backgrounds did). However, we believe that the reviewer’s point is important and would like to point to several places in the manuscript where dopamine responses to light-to-dark transitions were measured. For example, the dLight1 traces in Figure 2A, 3C, 3E, 4C, and 4E show the dopaminergic response to a rapid light-to-dark transition. In all cases, the dopaminergic ‘offset’ response is small (e.g. Figure 3C) and is dependent on the light stimulus duration (Figure 3E). This mimics light-adapted responses of OFF and ON-OFF retinal ganglion cells, although likely involves additional downstream neurocircuit mechanisms. While we did not test whether contrast inverted overhead fades (i.e. a fade out) could be encoded by lateral NAc dopamine release, the low amplitude dopamine response to black discs on a light background (e.g. the receding disc) suggests that it is not robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think it would be useful to emphasize in the descriptions of experiments for Figures 1 and 2 that long inter-stimulus intervals were used (I didn't learn this until the end of the methods). The authors later show that light transition signals don't really habituate if the ISIs are long – as I was reading I was confused about how rapidly repeated stimuli presentations were delivered, when intensity and duration conditions were within subject or between, etc. Perhaps a supplement figure showing more of the trial-by-trial data could be included to demonstrate a lack of habituation in the experiments in Figures 1 and 2 and clarify some of this.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this concern, we have provided additional information about the stimulus parameters (stimulus duration, ISI, etc.) in the text related to Figure 2. We have also included seven trial-by-trial heatmaps (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) with associated peak data (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 – source data 1) for white LED exposures across the entire irradiance range presented in Figure 2. Additionally, we have reworked our Methods section to clarify the stimulus parameters and trial structure for each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lack of clear habituation in the light transition signals when they occur separated by long intervals is super interesting. I do wonder if there are still possible long-term changes occurring, especially with mice that are getting 100s of light transition trials.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the response to Reviewer 1, we have repeated the experiment in Figure 3D where mice were exposed to 100 s ISI light before and after three hundred 1 Hz light pulses in a new group of stimulus-naïve mice, which allowed us to be sure that a history of previous exposures did not affect our results. We then repeated the 100 s ISI stimulus train 48 hours later to determine if changes in the dopaminergic response to light after repeated exposure were durable. We found that the response white LED presentation was decreased by ~30% after 300 consecutive white LED exposures (1 second stimulus, 1 s ISI) within the same session; however, this reduction did not persist 48 hours later. These findings suggest that the dopaminergic response to light is relatively robust to previous exposure history between sessions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related, do the authors know if auditory cue-evoked signals also don't habituate if spaced out? This isn't an experiment that would need to be done for this paper, but if that data exists it would be interesting to know if the habituation effect is similar across stimulus modalities or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that responses to unconditioned tones were not robust in the LNAc in our hands, we did not ultimately pursue this line of research. However, it was recently shown by Dr. Erin Calipari’s group that dLight1 responses to neutral auditory stimuli in the nucleus accumbens core habituate with repeated exposures (see Kutlu et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2022). Examining the encoding of other sensory modalities by LNAc dopamine is an important future direction that we are considering going forward.</p></body></sub-article></article>
