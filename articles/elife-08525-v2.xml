Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have been detected in Mtb-infected individuals. However, their role in protective immunity against Mtb remains unclear due to the absence of group 1 CD1 expression in mice. To overcome the challenge, we generated mice that expressed human group 1 CD1 molecules (hCD1Tg) and a CD1b-restricted, mycolic-acid specific TCR (DN1Tg). Using DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice, we found that activation of DN1 T cells was initiated in the mediastinal lymph nodes and showed faster kinetics compared to Mtb Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after aerosol infection with Mtb. Additionally, activated DN1 T cells exhibited polyfunctional characteristics, accumulated in lung granulomas, and protected against Mtb infection. Therefore, our findings highlight the vaccination potential of targeting group 1 CD1-restricted lipid-specific T cells against Mtb infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08525.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08525.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08525.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cases of tuberculosis are caused by a bacterium called <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, which is believed to have infected one third of the world’s population. Most of these infections are dormant and don’t cause any symptoms. However, active infections can be deadly if left untreated and often require six months of treatment with multiple antibiotics. One reason why these infections are so difficult to treat is because the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cell walls contain fatty molecules known as mycolic acids, which make the bacteria less susceptible to antibiotics. These molecules also help the bacteria to subvert and then hide from the immune system.</p><p>The prevalence of the disease and the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance have spurred the search for an effective vaccine against tuberculosis. While most efforts have focused on using protein fragments in tuberculosis vaccines, some evidence suggests that human immune cells can recognize fatty molecules such as mycolic acids and that these cells could help manage and control <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections. However, it has been difficult to determine whether these immune cells genuinely play a protective role against the disease because most vaccine research uses mouse models and mice do not have an equivalent of these immune cells.</p><p>Now, Zhao et al. have engineered a “humanized” mouse model that produces the fatty molecule-specific immune cells, and show that these mice do respond to the presence of mycolic acids. Infecting the genetically engineered mice with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> revealed that the fatty molecule-specific immune cells were quickly activated within lymph nodes at the center of the chest. These cells later accumulated at sites in the lung where the bacteria reside, and ultimately protected against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. The results show that these specific immune cells can counteract <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and highlight the potential of using mycolic acids to generate an effective vaccine that provides protection against tuberculosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08525.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08525.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CD1</kwd><kwd>Mycolic acid</kwd><kwd>T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobaterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI057460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chyung-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI040310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chyung-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A humanized transgenic mouse model reveals that CD1b-restricted, mycolic acid-specific T cells play a protective role during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CD1 family of antigen presenting molecules presents self and microbial lipids to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Rhijn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Libero and Mori, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams, 2014</xref>). Two major groups of CD1 isoforms have been identified in humans: group 1 CD1 (CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c) and group 2 CD1 (CD1d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams, 2014</xref>). While CD1d is broadly expressed, group 1 CD1 expression is limited to cortical thymocytes and professional antigen presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barral and Brenner, 2007</xref>). Humans express all CD1 isoforms while mice only express CD1d. Due to the lack of a suitable small animal model to study group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, CD1d-restricted NKT cells have been better studied. A large proportion of CD1d-restricted NKT cells express an invariant TCR α chain and are known as iNKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendelac et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike conventional T cells, which are positively selected by thymic epithelial cells (TECs), hematopoietic cells (HCs) select iNKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendelac et al., 2007</xref>). The unique developmental selection program is thought to drive their pre-activated phenotype, which allows for rapid effector function manifestations upon TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendelac et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Unlike iNKT cells, group 1 CD1-restricted T cells are known to have diverse TCR usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grant et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vincent et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felio et al., 2009</xref>). Group 1 CD1-restricted T cell responses have mostly been characterized in the context of mycobacterial antigens, although recent studies have shown that humans have a significant proportion of autoreactive group 1 CD1-restricted T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Jong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lalla et al., 2011</xref>). The Mtb cell wall is lipid rich (60% of its cell wall is composed of lipids) and contains a plethora of lipid antigens that are presented by group 1 CD1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Rhijn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Libero and Mori, 2014</xref>). Among group 1 CD1 molecules, CD1b presents the largest pool of Mtb-derived lipids like mycolic acid (MA), glucose monomycolate, glycerol monomycolate, diacylated sulfoglycolipids, lipoarabinomannan and phosphatidylinositol mannoside to cognate T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Rhijn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Libero and Mori, 2014</xref>). Of the Mtb lipids mentioned above, MAs are the major lipid constituents of the Mtb cell envelope and considered a potent Mtb virulence factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karakousis et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, MA-specific CD1b-restricted T cells have been detected in the blood as well as disease sites of Mtb-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montamat-Sicotte et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Tuberculosis (TB), the disease caused by Mtb, is a global health burden, especially in developing countries and amongst HIV/AIDS patients. Additionally, due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant Mtb and the lack of an effective vaccine to prevent pulmonary TB in adults, it is important to decipher the role of various T cell subsets in Mtb infection for the development of better preventive or therapeutic vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ottenhoff et al., 2012</xref>). The subunit vaccines currently under development for Mtb utilize peptide or protein antigens which target MHC-restricted conventional T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dorhoi and Kaufmann, 2014</xref>), but the utility in targeting lipid antigens has not been explored. Since CD1 molecules are non-polymorphic, CD1-restricted Mtb lipid antigens are likely to be recognized by most individuals, making them attractive vaccine targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barral and Brenner, 2007</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells contribute to anti-mycobacterial immunity. Investigation of group 1 CD1-restricted T cell lines derived from healthy or mycobacteria-infected individuals has revealed that these T cells are cytotoxic and produce IFN-γ and TNF-α, cytokines critical for protective immunity to TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Rhijn et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, group 1 CD1-restricted Mtb lipid-specific T cells are found in higher frequencies in individuals exposed to Mtb compared with control populations, suggesting that they are activated following infection with Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moody, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ulrichs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilleron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Layre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moody et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, a robust Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cell response has been detected in Mtb-infected human group 1 CD1 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felio et al., 2009</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether this unique T cell subset plays a protective role during the course of infection.</p><p>In this study, we generated transgenic mice expressing mycolic acid-specific CD1b-restricted TCR (DN1Tg) and human group 1 CD1 molecules (hCD1Tg). Using this mouse model, we found that DN1 T cells were selected most efficiently by group 1 CD1-expressing HCs in the thymus. Upon adoptive transfer of DN1 T cells to Mtb-infected hCD1Tg mice, DN1 T cells were first activated in the mediastinal lymph nodes, exhibiting faster kinetics than Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. DN1 T cells were cytotoxic, polyfunctional and contributed to anti-mycobacterial immunity by reducing bacterial burdens in the lung, spleen and liver. Thus, this study provides the first direct demonstration that group 1 CD1-restricted Mtb lipid-specific T cells play a protective role during Mtb infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a mycolic acid-specific CD1b-restricted TCR transgenic mouse model</title><p>We developed human CD1 transgenic mice, which expressed group 1 CD1 molecules in a similar pattern to that observed in humans. Using this model, we demonstrated the feasibility to study group 1 CD1-restricted T cell responses in aerosol infection with Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felio et al., 2009</xref>). To facilitate the direct analysis of Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, we generated a novel transgenic mouse strain that expressed a human/mouse chimeric TCR, composed of variable region from human T cell clone DN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grant et al., 1999</xref>), specific for CD1b/mycolic acid (MA), and mouse TCR constant region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). DN1Tg founders and their progeny were screened for the presence of <italic>TRAV13-2-TRAJ57</italic> gene fragment by PCR and for the surface expression of human Vβ5.1 (TRBV5-1) by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Subsequently, DN1Tg mice were bred onto hCD1Tg/Rag<sup>-/-</sup> background to eliminate the expression of endogenous TCR. All DN1Tg mice used in this study were on a Rag<sup>-/-</sup> background. To examine whether the development of DN1 T cells was dependent on group 1 CD1 molecules, we compared DN1 T cells in WT and hCD1Tg backgrounds. We found that both frequency and absolute number of DN1 T cells were greatly reduced in DN1Tg mice compared with DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in all tested organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). This suggested that group 1 CD1 supported the development of DN1 T cells. Notably, unlike CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, DN1 T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice exhibited a naïve phenotype (characterized by low expression levels of T cell activation markers such as CD69 and CD44) similar to conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and were either CD8αβ<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> (DN). In addition, DN1 thymocytes from DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice did not express PLZF, the master transcription factor for innate T cell lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovalovsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Savage et al., 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08525.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of DN1 T cells is dependent on the presence of group 1 CD1 molecules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of <italic>DN1 TCR</italic> construct used to generate DN1Tg mice.

Several studies have demonstrated the correlation between positive selection on HCs and a pre-activated T cell phenotype of innate-like T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendelac et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bediako et al., 2012</xref>). Given that DN1 T cells exhibited a naïve surface phenotype, one would expect DN1 T cells to be positively selected by TECs. To test this hypothesis, we adoptively transferred bone marrow from DN1Tg and DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice (in the Rag-deficient background) into irradiated CD45.1 congenic WT and hCD1Tg recipients. 5 weeks after transfer, DN1 T cells were identified by CD45.2and hVβ5.1 surface expression in different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

This suggested that HCs most efficiently mediate the positive selection of DN1 T cells. As a small number of DN1 T cells developed in mice that lack CD1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), it is possible that mouse CD1d is responsible for their selection.

To test whether DN1 T cells that developed in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice retained the same functional properties as the original human T cell line, we stimulated lymph node cells from DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice with un-pulsed or MA-pulsed bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to detect IFN-γ production and antigen-specific cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). DN1 T cells produced IFN-γ in response to MA-pulsed hCD1Tg DCs but not WT DCs or un-pulsed DC, suggesting the activation of DN1 T cells required both antigen and group 1 CD1 molecules. In addition, DN1 T cells showed cytotoxic activity against MA-pulsed hCD1Tg DCs. MA is located within the Mtb cell wall, either covalently attached via arabinogalactan to the cell wall peptidoglycan, or non-covalently associated in the form of trehalose dimycolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karakousis et al., 2004</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, co-culture of DN1 T cells with Mtb-infected hCD1Tg DCs led to up-regulation of activation markers CD69 and CD44 on DN1 T cells. Furthermore, DN1 T cells produced multiple cytokines, of which the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-6 was dependent on the presence of group 1 CD1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), with the exception of IL-17. It is possible that co-stimulatory molecules and/or cytokines induced by Mtb-infected DCs can stimulate DN1 T cells to secrete this cytokine independent of TCR-CD1b interaction.

Whereas BMDCs and a subset of myeloid DCs from hCD1Tg mice expressed high levels of CD1b, the expression of CD1b was almost undetectable on bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), similar to the observation in human monocyte derived macrophages. Accordingly, we detected only minimal DN1 T cell activation when stimulated with Mtb-infected BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). While our data showed that Mtb-infected macrophages do not directly present antigen to DN1 T cells, apoptotic vesicles released from Mtb-infected macrophages have been shown to transfer mycobacterial antigens to uninfected APCs, such as DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ulrichs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaible et al., 2003</xref>), which could in turn activate DN1 T cells. To explore whether and how DN1 T cells can control Mtb in infected macrophages, Mtb-infected BMDMs from WT or hCD1Tg mice were cultured together with DN1 T cells in the presence or absence of uninfected WT or hCD1Tg DCs. After 7 days, we determined the number of colony forming units (CFU) to investigate whether DN1 T cells inhibited intracellular bacterial growth within BMDMs. As expected, addition of DN1 T cells alone did not have a significant effect on bacterial burdens in Mtb-infected BMDMs. However, when DN1 T cells were added together with uninfected hCD1Tg DCs to infected BMDMs, the number of CFU decreased significantly compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For comparison, we also used Mtb-infected BMDCs from WT or hCD1Tg mice as targets. We found that DN1 T cells efficiently controlled Mtb growth within infected hCD1Tg DCs but not WT DCs. Similarly, if DN1 T cells and uninfected hCD1Tg DCs were added to Mtb-infected WT DCs, Mtb growth was significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These data indicated that group 1 CD1-expressing DCs mediated activation of DN1 T cells, which in turn controlled bacterial growth not only in the group 1 CD1-expressing DCs but also in macrophage and group 1 CD1-negative DCs.

This model not only allowed for the in vivo tracking of Mtb lipid antigen-specific T cells but also for deciphering their developmental requirements and functional role in Mtb infection. Like CD1d-restricted NKT cells, DN1 T cells were most efficiently selected by HCs even though they did not exhibit a pre-activated phenotype. In both in vitro and in vivo Mtb infection systems, the presence of DN1 T cells resulted in lower bacterial burden, indicating their role in protective immunity against Mtb. Interestingly, DN1 T cells were first activated in the lung draining lymph node and seemed to have faster activation and proliferation kinetics compared to Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The distinct kinetics of the priming of these two T cell populations may allow them to contribute to anti-mycobacterial activity at the different stages of infection. However, since only one TCR was investigated in this study, it remains unclear whether these findings could be extrapolated to all group 1 CD1-restricted mycolic acid specific T cells.</p><p>While TECs select conventional T cells, innate-like T cells, characterized by an effector/memory phenotype in the naïve state, have been correlated with their selection by HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bendelac et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, MHC Ib H2-M3-restricted T cells could be selected by both HCs and TECs, however, only HC-selected T cells exhibited a pre-activated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, CD1d-restricted iNKT cells and CD1b-autoreactive T cells, which are also pre-activated, are selected by HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendelac, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coles and Raulet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, DN1 T cells, though phenotypically naïve, were most efficiently selected by HCs. This finding suggests that HC-mediated selection could lead to the development of two distinct phenotypes of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells. However, the mechanism behind this dichotomous selection process is unknown. Factors like TCR-CD1b avidity, the nature of the selecting lipid antigen(s) could all play a role in determining the phenotype of DN1 T cells. The fact that CD5 expression was significantly higher on DN1 T cells selected by HCs suggests that a stronger TCR-CD1b interaction ensued between HCs and DN1 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azzam et al., 2001</xref>). The strength of the interaction could be a reflection of the high CD1b expression on DP thymocytes compared to TECs. Although a significant proportion of DN1 T cells in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice are CD8<sup>+</sup>, we did not detect differences in the activation kinetics and effector functions between CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>-</sup> DN1 T cells. Also, HC-selected and TEC-selected DN1 T cells in bone marrow chimeric mice have similar proportions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that CD8 may not play a critical role in the selection and function of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells.</p><p>From a naïve phenotype, DN1 T cells transformed to an activated state upon encountering Mtb-derived MA. When CD1b-expressing DCs were infected with Mtb, DN1 T cells effectively lowered bacterial burden. This response was dependent on the presence of CD1b on DCs. Additionally, when Mtb-infected BMDMs (which do not express CD1b and are known to be the natural reservoirs of Mtb) were co-cultured with uninfected CD1b-expressing DCs, DN1 T cells retained their protective capacity. In this in vitro Mtb infection system, BMDMs were washed extensively after infection to remove extracellular Mtb before addition of the DCs and DN1 T cells. This suggests that CD1b-expressing DCs are most likely capable of cross-presenting Mtb-lipid antigen from infected macrophages to DN1 T cells. This is consistent with a previous study, which showed that upon death of mycobacteria infected-macrophages; apoptotic vesicles containing Mtb antigens are taken up by DCs, which present these antigens to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaible et al., 2003</xref>). When DN1 T cells were adoptively transferred to Mtb-infected mice, they were first activated in the lung draining MLN instead of the lungs. Recent studies have shown that, after aerosol infection of mice with Mtb, myeloid DCs become infected in the lung, and represent the predominant cells that contain Mtb in the MLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>). Since peripheral CD1b expression is limited to a subset of myeloid DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felio et al., 2009</xref>), initial DN1 T cell activation could be mediated by infected CD1b-expressing DC or by uninfected DCs that cross-present MA from infected DCs migrating from the lungs. However, the events and processes leading to the presentation of MA by DCs in the MLN remain to be clearly elucidated.</p><p>The protective capacity of DN1 T cells was also demonstrated in vivo upon transferring effector DN1 T cells to Mtb infected group 1 CD1 expressing Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Bacterial burden reduction of approximately five (lung) to ten (spleen and liver) fold was observed in various organs. This demonstrated that DN1 T cells were capable of providing systemic immunity against Mtb. Numerous studies have shown that conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical for resistance to Mtb infection, though it’s widely accepted that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a more dominant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Woodworth and Behar, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, studies using adoptive transfer of transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reactive to Mtb antigens have yielded mixed results. While Ag85B specific T cells did not confer protection against Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reba et al., 2014</xref>), ESAT-6 reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reduced bacterial burden by a hundred fold, which was dependent on the infectious dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallegos et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, immune conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lowered Mtb CFU by ten fold in the lungs of infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woodworth et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, the role of CD1d-restricted iNKT cells has been more appreciated in the context of in vivo Mtb infection. For example, mice that lack CD1d, the only CD1 isoform expressed in mice, did not show any differences in bacterial burden upon Mtb infection compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behar et al., 1999</xref>). However, upon adoptive transfer of iNKT cells, bacterial burden was reduced five fold in the lungs, suggesting iNKT cells may play a protective role during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sada-Ovalle et al., 2008</xref>). Based on these studies, the protective capacity of DN1 T cells appears to be comparable to that of conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, suggesting an important role of CD1b-restricted T cells in anti-mycobacterial immunity.</p><p>Traditionally, T effector responses against Mtb have been associated with production of IFN-γ by conventional T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Behar, 2013</xref>). Aside from cytokine-mediated protection, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are also capable of contributing to anti-mycobacterial immunity through their cytolytic activities. Even though T cell derived IFN-γ has been associated with macrophage activation-induced control of Mtb, several studies have shown that IFN-γ alone does not absolutely correlate with protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Torrado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallegos et al., 2011</xref>). However, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 polyfunctional cytokine producing T cells have been linked to protection against mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darrah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagaard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagaard et al., 2009</xref>). The anti-mycobacterial immunity conferred by DN1 T cells was probably mediated in part by the concomitant secretion of cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2) and cytotoxicity. These data suggest that DN1 T cells employ a two-pronged mechanism for contributing to anti-mycobacterial immunity. A recent study suggests that CD1d-restricted iNKT cells mediate anti-mycobacterial immunity by producing GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rothchild et al., 2014</xref>). However, activated DN1 T cells did not seem to produce significant amounts of GM-CSF, suggesting that the protective effects of DN1 T cells may not be mediated by this cytokine.</p><p>Although DN1 T cells shared similar mechanisms of imparting protective immunity against Mtb with conventional T cells, DN1 T cells showed a faster activation and proliferation kinetics than Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells when they were co-transferred to Mtb-infected mice. Several mechanisms could contribute to the distinct kinetics of DN1 T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during Mtb infection. Such mechanisms include: the selecting cell type in the thymus; availability of microbial antigen during infection; expression levels of antigen-presenting molecules and efficiency of antigen loading onto antigen presenting molecules. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that rapid DC maturation after Mtb infection induces MHC II trafficking to the plasma membrane without efficient antigen loading. On the other hand, CD1b, which continuously surveys the phagosome for antigens, is properly loaded with Mtb lipid antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hava et al., 2008</xref>). This leads to earlier antigen presentation by CD1b compared to MHC II molecules. This phenomenon could at least in part explain why priming of DN1 T cells occurs earlier than Ag85B-specific MHC class II-restricted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during Mtb infection.</p><p>Even though Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have been implicated to play a protective role during Mtb infection, this is the first study to directly demonstrate their anti-mycobacterial activity in an in vivo infection setting. The secretion of various cytokines, the cytotoxic capacity, and the ability to be recruited to the site of infection likely contribute to the protective effect of MA-specific T cells during Mtb infection. Additionally, these T cells are activated and proliferate earlier than conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Given these promising findings, it would be worthwhile to explore whether a multi-subunit vaccine, containing both Mtb protein and lipid antigens that activate both conventional and group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, is more effective against Mtb. Furthermore, like DN1 T cells, a substantial proportion of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells are CD4 negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montamat-Sicotte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 1998</xref>), and would not be affected by HIV infection. Thus, harnessing this subset of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells in vaccination strategies could prove to be particularly beneficial for HIV-infected patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lucia Mori and Luc Van Kear (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Thus far, in vivo evaluation of the biological function of class I CD1 molecules (i.e. CD1a, CD1b and CD1c) and CD1-restricted TCRs has been difficult because mice only express class II CD1 (i.e. CD1d). To address this problem, the authors generated mice that express a transgene encoding a CD1b-resticted human/mouse chimeric TCR that detects mycolic acid (DN1 Tg). Taking advantage of previously generated human CD1b Tg mice, the authors show that T cells expressing the DN1 transgene are positively selected in the thymus by hematopoietic cells and respond to DC pulsed with mycolic acid or infected with Mtb. While in vitro derived macrophages do not activate DN1 Tg T cells alone, they do in the presence of uninfected DC, suggesting that the mycolic acid is transferred from macrophages to DC, which can activate T cell responses. The new mouse line allowed to study the requirements for positive selection of human CD1b-restricted T cells and to explore the capacity of these transgenic T cells to protect mice from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. The new data confirm the important finding previously obtained from the same group (using a mouse line Tg for a CD1b-autoreactive human TCR), that CD1b-expressing hematopoietic cells are the main drivers of thymic positive selection. Overall, these findings provide the first clear evidence that group 1 CD1-restricted T cells can protect against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. It also provides an experimental model that will be helpful to test the efficacy of lipid-based vaccines. The work therefore represents an important advance that will move the field forward.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should take advantage of this model to see whether vaccination with mycolic acid or with DC pulsed with mycolic acid provides resistance to subsequent challenge with aerosolic Mtb.</p><p>2) The authors showed that although to a lower extent, also TEC were able to support selection of human DN1Tg T cells and they also showed that small numbers of human DN1Tg T cells could be found in mice in the absence of human CD1 molecules. These findings suggest that perhaps mouse CD1d could be responsible for this selection. Adoptive transfer experiments into mice with CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> background could clarify this issue.</p><p>3) The functional phenotype of DN1Tg T cells showed that these cells secreted high amounts of cytokines in response to hCD1Tg BMDCs infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, but also significant amounts of TNFα, IL-6 and IL-17 in response to infected WT DCs. Could the author comment on that?</p><p>4) The important aspect of protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection was addressed using adoptive transfer of DN1 Tg T cells into hCD1Tg Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice subsequently infected. The experimental design misses two important controls in order to unequivocally demonstrate that protection is mediated by DN1 Tg cells: 1) adoptive transfer of irrelevant T cells into hCD1Tg Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice and 2) adoptive transfer of DN1 Tg T cells cells into WT mice. As a further control, as the authors elegantly used P25 Tg T cells (specific for Ag85B Mtb peptide) for comparison of classical vs. CD1-restricted T cells, I would suggest to use these cells as well. In addition, why not looking at protection directly infecting with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> the DN1Tg/hCD1Tg double Tg mice?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mycolic Acid-specific T Cells Protect Against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> Infection In a Humanized Transgenic Mouse Model&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Given this preliminary data, my lab is now exploring the option of using nanoparticle loaded with mycolic acid as an alternative and more effective form of vaccination. The mycolic acid-loaded nanoparticles are being delivered to the mice intranasally so that antigens are present at the site of infection. However, it is extremely time consuming to optimize the vaccination strategies. Therefore, we would like to address the efficacy of lipid-based TB subunit vaccines more thoroughly in a follow-up study.</p><p><italic>2) The authors showed that although to a lower extent, also TEC were able to support selection of human DN1Tg T cells and they also showed that small numbers of human DN1Tg T cells could be found in mice in the absence of human CD1 molecules.

Adoptive transfer experiments into mice with CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> background could clarify this issue.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comments that CD1d could potentially act as a selecting molecule for DN1 T cells in the absence of CD1b. To address this issue, we compared the percentage of DN1 T cells in the spleen and thymus of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg (CD1d<sup>+</sup>), DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup>, DN1Tg(CD1d<sup>+</sup>) and DN1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We found that the percentage of DN1 T cells were comparable in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg and DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In addition, DN1 T cells were barely detectable in the thymus and spleen of DN1Tg and DN1Tg/CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These data suggest that CD1d does not contribute to the thymic selection of DN1 T cells. We have included these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. A paragraph describing these results can be found in the subsection “CD1b-expressing hematopoietic cells (HCs) most efficiently select DN1 T cells”.</p><p><italic>3) The functional phenotype of DN1Tg T cells showed that these cells secreted high amounts of cytokines in response to hCD1Tg BMDCs infected with</italic> M. tuberculosis<italic>, but also significant amounts of TNFα, IL-6 and IL-17 in response to infected WT DCs. Could the author comment on that?</italic> </p><p>Infected DCs (both hCD1Tg and WT) alone secrete minimal TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17. Therefore, DN1 T cells in the presence of infected DCs secrete these cytokines. While TNF-α and IL-6 secretion by DN1 T cells is partially dependent on the presence of CD1b, IL-17 secretion is CD1b independent. We speculate that co-stimulatory molecules and/or cytokines induced by Mtb-infected DCs can stimulate DN1 T cells to secrete these cytokines independent of TCR-CD1b interaction.</p><p><italic>4) The important aspect of protection against</italic> M. tuberculosis <italic>infection was addressed using adoptive transfer of DN1 Tg T cells into hCD1Tg Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice subsequently infected.

In addition, why not looking at protection directly infecting with</italic> M. tuberculosis <italic>the DN1Tg/hCD1Tg double Tg mice?</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion, we have included CFU data from adoptive transfer of DN1 T cells into Mtb-infected (WT, hCD1Tg<sup>-</sup>) Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice and demonstrated that the protective effect of DN1 T cells is hCD1Tg-dependent (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We have also showed that substantial numbers of DN1 T cells were present in granuloma areas of infected hCD1Tg/Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and 7E</xref>). As an additional control, we adoptively transferred D7 Tg T cells, specific for M3-Listeria LemA peptide, to hCD1Tg/Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Upon infection with Mtb, these T cells did not confer significant protection when compared to non-T cell transferred mice. We have included this data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Due to the limited number of hCD1Tg/Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice currently available in the lab, we were not able to include P25 Tg T cells in our protection study. However, a study from Rebaet al<italic>.</italic> has shown that adoptive transfer of P25 Tg T cells did not confer protection against Mtb infection (Reference #37).</p><p>DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice were not directly infected for protection assays because the T cell repertoire in these mice is substantially different from that of hCD1Tg mice (e.g. DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice have decreased percentages of MHC I and MHC II-restricted T cells and NKT cells). This could introduce an unwanted variable, complicating data interpretation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>In the rebuttal letter you mention that DN1Tg/hCD1Tg double transgenic mice have an unusual T cell repertoire. We think that it is important to share this observation with the scientific community. Perhaps the finding reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> on the fact that large amounts of IL-17 are produced by T cells in response to Mtb-infected DC independently from hCD1b, could be explained by such T cell repertoire. We would like you to comment on these findings in the text.</italic> </p><p>We would like to clarify that experiments involving the characterization and assessment of DN1 T cells during Mtb infection have all been performed with DN1 T cells isolated from DN1Tg/hCD1Tg/Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This would eliminate the expression of endogenous TCR that may interfere with the analysis of DN1 T cells. Therefore, we do not anticipate the IL-17 present in the DN1 T cell and Mtb infected DC co-cultures to be a result of the unusual TCR repertoire of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice. We speculate that co-stimulatory molecules and/or cytokines induced by Mtb-infected DCs can stimulate DN1 T cells to secrete IL-17 independent of TCR-CD1b interaction (subsection “DN1 T cells exhibit effector functions in response to mycolic acid stimulation and Mtb infection”). This explanation has been included in the Results section. The use of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>-/-</sup> background has been mentioned at the beginning of the Results section of our manuscript. We have now included this information in the figure legends and Materials and methods section in this version of the manuscript. In the previous review, one of the reviewers had suggested that we perform the DN1 protection assay by directly infecting DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice. By this comment, we assumed that the reviewer wanted us to infect DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background and compare it to hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background, which have an intact immune system. Since these mice have endogenous TCR rearrangement aside from the expression of DN1Tg, we explained why the use of DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background might complicate our conclusions. In addition, we found the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background was altered compared to hCD1Tg mice in the Rag<sup>+/+</sup> background. Also, the percentage of TCRβ<sup>+</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> T cells was decreased in these mice. The above-mentioned observations are what we meant by an unusual TCR repertoire. We hope this explanation clarifies the questions raised by the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
