Although OCRL, a direct clathrin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits, clinical manifestations have been primarily attributed to intracellular sorting defects. Here we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which we found to bind OCRL directly, remains associated with such vesicles. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02975.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02975.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02975.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Oculo-Cerebro-Renal syndrome of Lowe (Lowe syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause cataracts, mental disabilities and kidney dysfunction. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding OCRL, a protein that modifies a membrane lipid and that is found on membranes transporting molecules (cargo) into cells by a process known as endocytosis.</p><p>During endocytosis, the cell outer membrane is deformed into a pit that engulfs the cargo to be taken up by the cell. The pit then pinches off from the outer membrane to form a vesicle—a bubble-like compartment—inside the cell that transports the cargo to its destination. In one type of endocytosis, this process is mediated by a basket-like coat primarily made up from the protein clathrin that assembles at the membrane patch to be internalized. After the vesicle is released from the cell membrane, the clathrin coat is broken apart and its components are shed and recycled for use by new budding endocytic vesicles.</p><p>The OCRL protein had previously been observed associated to newly forming clathrin-coated vesicles, but the significance of this was not known. Now, Nández et al. have used a range of imaging and analytical techniques to further investigate the properties of OCRL, taking advantage of cells from patients with Lowe syndrome. These cells lack OCRL, and so allow the effect of OCRL's absence on cell function to be deduced. OCRL destroys the membrane lipid that helps to connect the clathrin coat to the membrane, and Nández et al. show that without OCRL the newly formed vesicle moves into the cell but fails to efficiently shed its clathrin coat. Thus, a large fraction of clathrin coat components remain trapped on the vesicles, reducing the amount of such components available to help new pits develop into vesicles. As a consequence, the cell has difficulty internalizing molecules.</p><p>Collectively, the findings of Nández et al. outline that OCRL plays a role in the regulation of endocytosis in addition to its previously reported actions in the control of intracellular membrane traffic. The results also help to explain some of the symptoms seen in Lowe syndrome patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02975.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02975.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>clathrin-mediated endocytosis</kwd><kwd>uncoating</kwd><kwd>Lowe syndrome</kwd><kwd>PI(4,5)P2</kwd><kwd>SNX9</kwd><kwd>actin comet</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Science Training Program Training Grant T32GM07205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balkin</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK082700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003925</institution-id><institution>Lowe Syndrome Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000881</institution-id><institution>Lowe Syndrome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Federal Ministry of Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FKZ01GS0861, DiGtoP consortium</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK045735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS036251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000888</institution-id><institution>W.

Phosphoinositide levels are dynamically and spatially regulated by kinases and phosphatases, establishing a code of membrane identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vicinanza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balla, 2013</xref>). The human genome contains 10 genes encoding inositol 5-phosphatases, a group of enzymes that dephosphorylate the inositol ring at the 5 position, nine of which act on inositol phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dyson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pirruccello and De Camilli, 2012</xref>). Mutations in one such gene, OCRL, give rise to Oculo-Cerebro-Renal syndrome of Lowe (Lowe syndrome) and type 2 Dent's disease, two X-linked diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attree et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoopes et al., 2005</xref>). Lowe syndrome is characterized by congenital cataracts, renal proximal tubule dysfunction, cognitive disabilities and developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delleman et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kenworthy and Charnas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Böckenhauer et al., 2008</xref>). Patients with Dent's disease exhibit similar proximal tubule defects but no, or only mild, additional clinical defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bökenkamp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shrimpton et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>OCRL has a modular structure that is comprised of an N-terminal PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mao et al., 2009</xref>) followed in sequence by an unstructured amino acid stretch, the 5-phosphatase domain, an ASPM-SPD2-Hydin (ASH) domain and a catalytically-inactive RhoGAP-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ponting, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>). OCRL is expressed in all tissues and has a broad subcellular distribution, which is mediated by interactions with proteins that control membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton. These include clathrin-heavy chain, the clathrin adaptor AP-2, Rab and Rho family GTPases and the endosomal adaptors APPL1 and Ses1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ungewickell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyvola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lichter-Konecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dambournet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Noakes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pirruccello et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with such interactions, OCRL has been localized to the Golgi complex, to a variety of endosomal compartments as well as to clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Olivos-Glander et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dressman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ungewickell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faucherre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyvola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>). INPP5B, a 5-phosphatase very similar to OCRL, has many of the same properties, but does not bind clathrin and AP-2, and correspondingly is not localized at endocytic clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, the two preferred substrates of OCRL, are primarily concentrated in the plasma membrane, where they help define its identity. The broad intracellular localization of OCRL may reflect its importance in preventing the build-up of ectopic intracellular pools of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. Alternatively, OCRL may act on small yet physiologically relevant pools of these phosphoinositides on intracellular membranes. The pathological manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease are thought to arise from abnormal protein sorting and membrane recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mehta et al., 2014</xref>), as loss of OCRL would disrupt the appropriate coordination between membrane progression and changes in phosphoinositide composition.</p><p>One open question is the physiological significance of the localization of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits. Nucleation and expansion of endocytic clathrin coats requires PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> represents a critical co-receptor for all the clathrin adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mettlen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Traub, 2009</xref>) and its levels (controlled by dynamic turnover) impact the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zoncu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonescu et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, coat shedding (uncoating) after the endocytic reaction requires PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation, as first revealed by studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>). Absence of synaptojanin 1, the most abundant 5-phosphatase in the synapse, results in a striking accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). There is also evidence that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation may assist in the fission reaction of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stefan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rusk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang-Ileto et al., 2011</xref>). While it has been shown that OCRL has a role in preventing the accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on post-endocytic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>), there is no evidence to date that the absence of OCRL, or defects in OCRL function, impairs clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>The initial goal of this study was to gain new insights into the function of OCRL through a global analysis of the OCRL interactome. Such an analysis corroborated evidence for a primary role of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits as it confirmed clathrin and other endocytic adaptors as OCRL binding partners. In addition, it revealed that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. Prompted by these findings, we examined the contribution of OCRL to clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts. We found that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to loose their coat. Such vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suchy and Nussbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dambournet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis. Defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OCRL interactome reveals a major link to clathrin-mediated traffic</title><p>The binding partners of an enzyme define its sites of action and regulatory mechanisms.

This technique, in contrast to other methods such as yeast two-hybrids or pull-downs with purified proteins, allows the preferential capture of physiologically occurring protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vermeulen et al., 2008</xref>). To this aim, HeLa M cell lines stably expressing either GFP-OCRL or GFP alone were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) so that OCRL specific interactions could be identified by analysis of proteins selectively recovered in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from cells expressing GFP-OCRL. While GFP alone had a diffuse cytosolic distribution, GFP-OCRL had a punctate localization characteristic of endogeneous OCRL immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), thus validating GFP-OCRL expressing cells as an appropriate model for our experiments. Two cell lines were used for further analysis, which expressed GFP-OCRL at near endogenous levels (1X) or at about five times the endogenous level (5X), as revealed by western blotting against OCRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02975.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The OCRL interactome strongly links this protein to clathrin-dependent membrane traffic.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) GFP fluorescence in HeLa M cells stably expressing GFP alone (<bold>A</bold>) or GFP-OCRL (<bold>B</bold>).

As expected, a major band was detected at 170 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), shown to be clathrin heavy chain by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ungewickell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, there were numerous other bands selectively observed in GFP-OCRL samples. Mass spectrometry further confirmed clathrin heavy and light chain as major hits in the immunoprecipitates and revealed additional specific OCRL interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A,B</xref>). These included known binding partners of OCRL, such as subunits of the endocytic clathrin adaptor AP-2, Rab proteins and Ses1/2 but, surprisingly, not APPL1. Possibly APPL1 was outcompeted by Ses1/2, which bind to the same site in OCRL but with a higher affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Noakes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pirruccello et al., 2011</xref>). Specific interactors also included numerous proteins implicated in membrane trafficking, primarily along the endocytic pathway and vesicular transport steps between endosomes and the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A,B</xref>). Proteins that participate in clathrin-dependent transport steps featured particularly prominently in the OCRL interactome.</p><p>The enrichment of these proteins in the GFP-OCRL immunoprecipitate relative to the homogenate was further assessed by western blot analysis. In addition to clathrin, interactors such as AP-2, EpsinR (CLINT1), SNX9 and PI3KcIIα showed the highest enrichment by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), a cargo protein for clathrin-coated pits whose transport was previously shown to be affected by OCRL knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>), was also confirmed by western blotting, but was not as enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Clathrin and AP-2 are known to bind OCRL directly, while EpsinR, SNX9 and PI3KcIIα are all known clathrin interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaidarov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mills et al., 2003</xref>). These findings raised the possibility that at least some of these proteins may bind OCRL indirectly through clathrin. In fact, a substantial overlap was observed between major OCRL interactors revealed by our experiments and proteins previously identified in a similar mass spectrometry analysis of clathrin binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>) as well as in a global analysis of clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blondeau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borner et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, to determine the contribution of clathrin to the interactions of OCRL, anti-GFP immunoprecipitations were repeated with cells expressing a GFP-OCRL construct lacking clathrin-binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SNX9 is a novel direct OCRL interactor</title><p>Anti-GFP immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts from cells expressing either GFP-OCRL<sup>WT</sup> (wild type OCRL) or GFP-OCRL<sup>X3</sup> (an OCRL mutant in which both clathrin boxes as well as the AP-2-binding motif are mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mao et al., 2009</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that loss of clathrin and AP-2 binding was accompanied by the loss of CI-M6PR, EpsinR and PI3KcIIα in the anti-GFP-OCRL<sup>X3</sup> immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, the interaction of OCRL with SNX9, which also contains binding sites for clathrin and for AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</xref>), was not abolished by the three mutations in OCRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This prompted us to explore the possibility of a direct interaction between OCRL and SNX9.</p><p>SNX9 binds other proteins implicated in the late stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, such as dynamin, synaptojanin and N-WASP, through an N-terminal SH3 domain that recognizes proline-rich motifs with the canonical PxxP sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badour et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mayer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow-Fong et al., 2005</xref>). OCRL contains a PxxP site (<sup>175</sup>REPPPPP<sup>181</sup>) in the predicted unfolded region that connects its N-terminal PH domain to its central inositol 5-phosphatase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Anti-GFP immunoprecipitation of cell extracts expressing GFP-OCRL<sup>WT</sup> co-enriched endogenous SNX9, while a GFP-OCRL mutant in which three prolines (P177, 178, and 181) of the PxxP motif were mutated to alanine (GFP-OCRL<sup>P3</sup>), failed to co-precipitate SNX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, GFP-SNX9<sup>WT</sup> but not a GFP-SNX9 construct lacking the SH3 domain (GFP-SNX9<sup>ΔSH3</sup>) co-precipitated endogenous OCRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the PxxP motif in OCRL is necessary for the interaction with SNX9. A close paralogue of SNX9 with partially overlapping functions is SNX18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59a">Park et al., 2010</xref>).

This analysis confirmed the global increase in the number of clathrin-coated endocytic profiles and, in particular, a prominent increase of wide-neck (primarily U-shaped) pits and of free clathrin-coated vesicles in the cortical region of the cell (less than 500 nm from the plasma membrane, that is clathrin-coated vesicles most likely of endocytic origin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These results suggest that the loss of OCRL impairs uncoating, a finding consistent with its very late recruitment at pits. Its absence also delays late steps in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, possibly as a result of sequestration of endocytic factors on uncoated vesicles. Such findings prompted us to assess the potential occurrence in patient cells of a defect in the internalization of transferrin, a well established cargo of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>Confocal microscopy of cells pre-incubated with fluorescent transferrin revealed a delay in the shift of fluorescence from the cell surface to deeper positions in the cytoplasm in patient cells compared to control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>).

In addition, biotin labeling of the endogenous surface pool of the transferrin receptor showed its accumulation at the plasma membrane in patient cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).

Nearly every actin tail propelled vesicles positive for these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

This may also explain the great increase of SNX9 punctate immunoreactivity in patient cells previously mentioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>). In contrast, the overall cellular levels of clathrin and AP-2 were similar in control and patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, an increase in the pool of assembled clathrin coats in patient cells was demonstrated biochemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). Homogenization of cells under conditions known to preserve assembled clathrin, followed by high-speed centrifugation to yield cytosol (C) and total particulate (P) fractions, revealed an increased fraction of clathrin heavy chain in the particulate fraction of patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the coat and cargo of the intracellular actin-propelled vesicles are very similar to those of endocytic clathrin-coated pits. This supports the idea that vesicles at comet tips are endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles whose coat failed to shed due to the lack of OCRL catalytic activity. A small subset of vesicles driving the comets were larger than would be expected from endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles and may represent micropinosomes.</p><p>Given the striking increase of SNX9 levels in patient cells and its known role in coordinating clathrin-coated pits maturation with actin nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>), we explored its importance in the formation of actin tails. Knockdown of SNX9 followed by immunostaining with phalloidin revealed a decrease in the number of endogenous comets observed in patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). There was noticeable cell-to-cell variability however, roughly correlating with residual SNX9 levels in knockdown cells (generally higher in patient cells given the elevated basal level of this protein). Importantly, most of the remaining SNX9 puncta observed in cells after knockdown associated with the tips of the comets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction between SNX9 and OCRL may help coordinate actin polymerization at late stage clathrin-coated pits with the turnover of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The recruitment of OCRL to clathrin-coated pits was not dependent on its interaction with SNX9, however. This was evidenced by the expression of an SNX9-binding mutant construct of OCRL (GFP-OCRL<sup>P3</sup>) that still localized to clathrin-coated pits in patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Given the interactions of OCRL with several prominent endocytic factors such as clathrin and AP-2, it is highly likely that multiple binding partners regulate its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Progressive loss of actin comets upon plasma membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion</title><p>If actin comets are in fact nucleated by plasma membrane-derived PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> still present on uncoated endocytic vesicles due to the absence of OCRL, depletion of plasma membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> should result in their progressive disappearance. Alternatively, if comets are generated by the synthesis of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on intracellular structures, depletion of plasma membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> would not affect them. In order to discern between these two scenarios, we selectively depleted PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane via the activation of a PLC-coupled receptor, the M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M<sub>1</sub>R).</p><p>Patient cells co-expressing untagged M<sub>1</sub>R, the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> probe GFP-PH<sup>PLCδ</sup> and the F-actin reporter mCherry-CH<sup>UTR</sup> were analyzed by dual-color time-lapse confocal microscopy while an agonist (OxoM), and subsequently an antagonist (atropine), were added during live acquisition. Prior to OxoM addition, GFP-PH<sup>PLCδ</sup> was selectively localized at the plasma membrane, as typically observed for this PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensor in resting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The addition of OxoM triggered PLC-mediated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis into IP3 and diacyl glycerol, which resulted in the relocation of GFP-PH<sup>PLCδ</sup> to the cytosol, indicating PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Data concerning the action of OCRL in membrane traffic, and the impact of its loss in patient cells, pointed primarily to a post-endocytic role, including intracellular clathrin-dependent transport reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dressman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ungewickell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyvola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>). Additional roles for OCRL in clathrin-independent forms of endocytosis (micropinocytosis and phagocytosis) had also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohdanowicz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuhbacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marion et al., 2012</xref>). Our present results demonstrate that the absence of OCRL in Lowe syndrome patient cells results in an impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These findings provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of endocytosis as well as into the molecular pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.</p><p>A role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation in the normal progression of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was first described at neuronal synapses, where studies of synaptojanin 1 emphasized an uncoating function of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>). Subsequent work in a variety of model systems supported this idea but also suggested a role of this phosphoinositide in the late stages of endocytosis. Dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the membranes of the budding vesicles was proposed to act as a mechanism to generate a line tension at the vesicle neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stefan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rusk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang-Ileto et al., 2011</xref>). Progression through the late stages of endocytosis could be also affected by the sequestration of endocytic proteins on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-rich uncoated vesicles, as postulated for synapses lacking synaptojanin 1 or all three endophilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The present study demonstrates a defect of endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts. This defect is characterized by an accumulation of late-stage (primarily U-shaped) endocytic clathrin-coated pits and by a delay in the internalization of transferrin, a clathrin-coated pit cargo. Our results also point to a defect in clathrin uncoating, as in the case of synaptojanin 1 KO synapses. More specifically, electron microscopy demonstrated a robust increase in the number of clathrin-coated vesicles in patient cells relative to control fibroblasts. Additionally, immunofluorescence and live microscopy analysis revealed an abundance of intracellular vesicles positive for both coat and cargo proteins of endocytic origin including, besides clathrin, the adaptor complex AP-2, SNX9, PI3KcIIα and transferrin. These vesicles were at the tips of actin comets, which are known to be nucleated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-positive organelles. The dramatic decrease in the number of these comets upon the selective, pharmacologically-induced depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane demonstrates that at least a large cohort of these comets are nucleated by endocytic vesicles. The prominent impact of the lack of OCRL on total cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in patient cells is reminiscent of the robust increase in brain levels of this phosphoinositide observed in the absence of synaptojanin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>). We suggest that synaptojanin 1 and OCRL have partially overlapping functions, but with predominant roles at synapses and in non-neuronal cells, respectively.</p><p>The newly discovered direct interaction of OCRL with SNX9, a protein implicated in the transition from late stage clathrin-coated pits to free clathrin-coated vesicles, is of significant interest as it provides a new link between OCRL function and late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pit nucleation. Interestingly, SNX9 also binds synaptojanin 1 and 2, consistent with a partial overlap in the function of these 5-phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow-Fong et al., 2005</xref>). SNX9 is a member of a family of BAR domain-containing endocytic adaptors that help coordinate changes in bilayer curvature with reactions that occur as membranes progress along the endocytic pathway. Specifically, SNX9 is thought to have an important role in coupling clathrin coat maturation to actin nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>). Our observation that the knockdown of SNX9 decreases comet formation in patient cells supports a role for this protein in actin nucleation at clathrin-coated pits. It also suggests a functional link between SNX9-regulated actin polymerization and the turnover of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> controlled by OCRL. The modular structure of SNX9 is ideally suited to mediate this coordination. SNX9 binds the plasma membrane with a PX-BAR domain module, which exhibits a preference for curved membranes enriched in PI(4,5)P2 and 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallop et al., 2013</xref>), clathrin via a ‘clathrin-box’ motif and AP-2 via an α-adaptin-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</xref>). Through its SH3 domain, SNX9 binds and thus helps to activate both N-WASP to trigger actin nucleation, and dynamin to mediate fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>). The SH3 domain of SNX9 binds synaptojanin and also OCRL, as we have demonstrated in this study. Given that SNX9 is a protein dimer that is present in multiple copies at endocytic sites, SNX9 is an attractive candidate to help bring together all these factors.</p><p>Recently, SNX9 was shown to act as an effector of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, which is generated at endocytic clathrin-coated pits by PI3KcIIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Posor et al., 2013</xref>). In principle, 5-phosphatases such as OCRL and synaptojanin could directly contribute to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> production by dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, or indirectly by generating PI4P, the PI3KcIIα substrate, from PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Posor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmid and Mettlen, 2013</xref>). These models would place OCRL upstream of SNX9. However, SNX9 is recruited to coated pits prior to OCRL, and also in its absence. Instead, the recruitment of OCRL at endocytic clathrin-coated pits coincides with the temporal recruitment signature of GAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), which, like its homologue auxilin, is a cofactor for Hsc70 and thus a key player in the disassembly of the clathrin lattice after fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fotin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Massol et al., 2006</xref>). Both OCRL and GAK peak after the clathrin fluorescence has started to diminish, as expected for proteins that mediate the shedding of the clathrin coat (GAK) and its adaptors (OCRL). Interestingly, the lack of GAK or auxilin results in endocytic defects in addition to the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and empty clathrin cages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lee et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yim et al., 2005</xref>). This impairment of endocytosis is thought to result from the sequestration of coat components on assembled lattices. Similarly, a defect in uncoating in the absence of OCRL may impair the recycling of endocytic factors and affect the maturation of clathrin-coated pits. As OCRL binds multiple proteins present in endocytic clathrin coats, an important question for future studies will be to determine the precise mechanisms responsible for the timing of OCRL recruitment.</p><p>The presence in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts of numerous actin comets driven by clathrin-positive vesicles adds further support to a close relationship between endocytic clathrin coats and actin, a topic of intense debate, although most recent studies support such a link at least for a major subset of clathrin-dependent endocytic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boucrot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsujita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>). Actin has been implicated in both the invagination of clathrin-coated pits as well as in the propulsion of endocytic vesicles away from endocytic sites. The occurrence of comets in Lowe syndrome cells suggests that failure to dephosphorylate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> not only delays coat shedding, but also disrupts the release of actin nucleating factors associated with endocytic clathrin coats.</p><p>The collective information emerging from this and previous studies suggests that the function of OCRL is needed, either directly or indirectly, at a multiplicity of sites. The 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL is required to complete endocytosis and to prevent the ectopic accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on endosomes and membranes in the Golgi complex area (this work; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dressman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyvola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ungewickell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>). This multiplicity of actions is supported by its numerous interactors, which comprise proteins implicated in membrane traffic, signaling and actin regulation in a variety of cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pirruccello and De Camilli, 2012</xref>). As shown here, proteins implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis are prominently featured in the OCRL ‘interactome’, which also comprises numerous proteins that participate in the clathrin-dependent traffic between endosomes and the Golgi complex. These include the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) and the clathrin adaptor EpsinR, implicating OCRL in these trafficking stations as well. It remains unclear whether the function of OCRL at these intracellular sites is to prevent the buildup of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or to control small yet physiologically relevant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> pools.</p><p>A surprising result of our study was the unexpected absence of a robust signal for the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> probe, PH<sup>PLCδ</sup>, at intracellular sites in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts. The presence of clathrin, AP-2 and actin nucleating proteins on intracellular vesicles, however, strongly suggests the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on these vesicles. Sequestration of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on such vesicles by clathrin adaptors and actin nucleating factors may be one reason explaining absent or inefficient PH<sup>PLCδ</sup> labeling, as we have shown that transient depolymerization of actin results in the appearance of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reporter on intracellular vesicles.</p><p>OCRL has a close homologue, INPP5B, and these two proteins share many common interactors including endosomal proteins and Rabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyvola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukuda et al., 2008</xref>). INPP5B however, does not contain either clathrin or AP-2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ungewickell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2005</xref>). Correspondingly, OCRL and INPP5B share similar localizations on endosomes and in the Golgi complex area but INPP5B is not present at endocytic clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, a major functional difference between OCRL and INPP5B seems to be the involvement of OCRL, but not of INPP5B, in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. One important open question is why the lack of OCRL produces major phenotypes in humans but not in mice, in spite of the conservation of all known properties of OCRL in mice and humans, including the SNX9 binding site reported here. As INPP5B does not participate in endocytic clathrin-coated dynamics, differences in the expression or splicing of INPP5B in mice and humans cannot fully account for this difference. Elucidating mechanisms underlying this difference represents an important goal of future studies.</p><p>Previous studies had attributed the proximal tubule reabsorption defects occurring in Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease primarily to abnormal endosomal recycling, such as for example the recycling of megalin, the scavenger receptor that mediates low molecular weight protein endocytosis, and CI-M6PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mehta et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings suggest that endocytosis itself may also be affected, as shown previously for CLC5 mutations that produce Dent's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Novarino et al., 2010</xref>) although they do not exclude the previously suggested intracellular sorting abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lowe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vicinanza et al., 2011</xref>). Rather, they suggest that defects in endocytosis and in the fate of newly formed endocytic vesicles ultimately contribute to abnormal cargo sorting, as exemplified by the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the tip of actin comets. Impairments in endocytosis may also contribute to the cognitive deficiencies observed in Lowe syndrome patients. While synaptojanin 1 is the key player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at synapses, OCRL may function at clathrin-coated pits that participate in a housekeeping form of endocytosis in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and reagents</title><p>GFP-Rab5, mRFP-clathrin light chain (mRFP-CLC), GFP-N-Wasp, GFP-OCRL, catalytically inactive GFP-OCRL<sup>D523G</sup>, deletion fragments GST-OCRL<sup>176</sup> and GST-OCRL<sup>217</sup> and clathrin-binding mutant GFP-OCRL<sup>X3</sup> have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2012</xref>). mCherry-tagged OCRL was generated by excising the OCRL coding sequence from GFP‐OCRL and ligating it into the pmCherry‐C1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) using Xho<italic>I</italic> and BamH<italic>I</italic>.

Patient cells were rescued by expressing mCherry-OCRL<sup>WT</sup>. For this analysis all images were acquired using TIRF microscopy. 12 control cells, 12 patient cells and 7 rescued patient cells were used and an average of 809 events per cell were analyzed. Only endocytic pits that appeared during the acquisition and with a lifetime of at least 12 s were selected. An automated tracking analysis was used to determine the lifetime distributions of µ2 puncta for each cell. Using expectation-maximization algorithms, a Gaussian mixture model was then fitted to each lifetime histogram independently, identifying three subpopulations (short, medium and long lifetimes). The mean lifetimes of the three subpopulations across different cells were calculated (40 s, 108 s, and 244 s respectively), fixed and then Gaussian models using these means for each subpopulation were re-fitted to the histograms.</p><p>Particle counting was conducted in ImageJ (National Institutes Of Health, Bethesda, MD) by thresholding and using the analyze particles plug-in.

Using cells from patients with Lowe's syndrome, the authors find accumulations of clathrin and adaptor proteins and Vps9 under the plasma membrane. These structures nucleate actin comets not seen in wild type cells. The findings reported here potentially fill an important conceptual gap in the endocytosis field as it has remained unclear how and at which point in the pathway PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis occurs in non-neuronal cells that express very low levels of synaptojanin 5-phosphatases. The work will be of broad interest with modifications as described here.</p><p>1) Loss of OCRL causes a defect in CCP maturation at the level of u-shaped CCPs that apparently fail to constrict, yet the numbers of CCVs seen in electron micrographs is normal, a finding that seems inconsistent with the accumulation of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles propelled by actin comets in OCRL mutant cells. Please clarify. What is the fraction of actin comets harboring clathrin at their tips? Is this seen for endogenous proteins; i.e. could the clathrin-coated tips observed at actin comets be resulting from clathrin light chain overexpression used to visualize these structures?</p><p>2) The authors favor a model in which trapping of endocytic proteins in CCVs that fail to uncoat in absence of OCRL-mediated PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis indirectly causes stalling of CCP dynamics and an accumulation of u-shaped CCPs. The evidence in favor of this model is by TIRF imaging that OCRL appears to be recruited late to endocytic structures, in fact, at a time point when clathrin uncoating sets in. However, it is also possible as the authors state, that a fraction of OCRL acts early in the pathway. Is the primary role of OCRL is in CCP maturation or in uncoating? The authors seem to prefer a model in which SNX9 acts prior to OCRL and potentially recruits OCRL to late-stage CCPs but do not provide data to support this. If OCRL is recruited to CCPs after the peak of clathrin recruitment then the majority of CCPs should lack detectable OCRL signals when imaged by confocal microscopy. Please quantify this. Conversely, substantial colocalization of OCRL with plasma membrane CCPs might be considered a sign of an early role of OCRL in addition to the late pool observed in TIRF imaging.</p><p>3) Regarding the mechanism of OCRL action and its relationship to SNX9: Does depletion of SNX9 (and/ or related SNXs) perturb OCRL recruitment to CCPs? What is the role of SNX9, which accumulates at CCPs and is overexpressed in OCRL mutants, in actin comet tail generation? If KD of SNX9 in OCRL mutants would abolish actin comets this would be a strong indication for a close functional and physical link between OCRL-mediated PI(4,5)P2 turnover and SNX9 regulation of actin polymerization.</p><p>4) Other studies of patient fibroblasts have seen defects in internalization of certain, but not all cargoes. The authors use a fluorescent assay to monitor uptake and a single time point, surface biotinylation assay. Since other labs seem to have missed this defect, and Tf internalization should continue linearly for ∼20 minutes, it seems to this reviewer that a biotin uptake assay continuing on the time zero findings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref> would strengthen the story and cement their conclusions in relation to previous work from other labs; please provide a quantitative assay of endocytosis that extends to 20 minutes.</p><p>5) The number of CCPs analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2G and 4F–H</xref> is very low and ought to be increased to derive valid conclusions.</p><p>6) Not essential but please comment: The SNX9 subfamily includes other members such as SNX18 and SNX33. Do these bind to OCRL as well and accumulate at CCPs in OCRL mutant fibroblasts? Does KD of PIPK isoforms rescue stalled CCP dynamics in cells lacking OCRL? Data in this direction would further strengthen the link between OCRL and PI(4,5)P2 levels and their effect on CCP maturation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02975.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We were very pleased by the positive assessment of our study and we thank the reviewers for their helpful suggestions. We have addressed each of the points raised and modified our manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Major changes include a new quantitative, biochemical uptake assay, the impact of SNX9 knockdown on the comets, an increase of EM samples analyzed showing the buildup of coated vesicles as well as wide-neck pits, and the automated analysis of clathrin-coated pit dynamics based on thousands of events. New and edited figures include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplements 1 and 2</xref></p><p>We have slightly modified the text to better reflect our interpretation that endocytic proteins are sequestered on uncoated vesicles in the absence of OCRL leading to a defect in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and endocytosis.

Is this seen for endogenous proteins; i.e. could the clathrin-coated tips observed at actin comets be resulting from clathrin light chain overexpression used to visualize these structures?</italic></p><p>The number of CCVs is indeed higher in patient cells. This was already shown in the original submission. Given the importance of this point, we have now doubled the number of cells analyzed by EM and corroborated evidence for a robust, statistically significant increase in the number of CCVs in patient cells. We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> to reflect our newest analysis. For both the original figure and the new figure we have only analyzed CCVs in proximity of the plasma membrane (within 500 nm), as CCVs located more deeply into cells may also represent Golgi-derived vesicles. Since CCVs rapidly disperse throughout the cell upon fission, our data may actually represent an underestimate of the total number of endocytic CCVs that accumulate in Lowe syndrome patient cells.</p><p>Concerning the fraction of actin comets harboring endocytic clathrin coat proteins at their tip, we measured this fraction for clathrin, AP-2 and SNX9. We found that nearly 100% of the comets are positive for these proteins at their head and have included this analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. The presence of these proteins at comet tips was confirmed by immunofluorescence of the endogeneous proteins. Examples of endogenous clathrin and SNX9 at the tip of comets are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors favor a model in which trapping of endocytic proteins in CCVs that fail to uncoat in absence of OCRL-mediated PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis indirectly causes stalling of CCP dynamics and an accumulation of u-shaped CCPs. The evidence in favor of this model is by TIRF imaging that OCRL appears to be recruited late to endocytic structures, in fact, at a time point when clathrin uncoating sets in. However, it is also possible as the authors state, that a fraction of OCRL acts early in the pathway. Is the primary role of OCRL is in CCP maturation or in uncoating? The authors seem to prefer a model in which SNX9 acts prior to OCRL and potentially recruits OCRL to late-stage CCPs but do not provide data to support this. If OCRL is recruited to CCPs after the peak of clathrin recruitment then the majority of CCPs should lack detectable OCRL signals when imaged by confocal microscopy. Please quantify this. Conversely, substantial colocalization of OCRL with plasma membrane CCPs might be considered a sign of an early role of OCRL in addition to the late pool observed in TIRF imaging</italic>.</p><p>Yes, based on our results, we strongly favor a model in which a primary function of OCRL is at the uncoating stage. As we show in this manuscript and as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erdmann et al. 2007</xref>), OCRL is recruited only at very late stages at CCPs. Additionally, as we mention in the discussion of the manuscript, a previous study by Taylor et al. had also shown a sharp recruitment of OCRL at the very end of the CCP lifetime. Interestingly, this study also showed that the OCRL recruitment profile precisely coincided with that of GAK, a key clathrin uncoating factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We note that, similar to our current results, lack of GAK results in an impairment of endocytosis due to sequestration of clathrin in assembled coats (Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005, Yim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010). In response to this comment of the referee, we have modified the text by emphasizing how the partial stalling of clathrin coated pit maturation at mid-stage (U-shaped pits) may only be an indirect effect of the sequestration of endocytic factors on uncoated vesicles. We have calculated the fraction of CCPs positive for OCRL at any given time and found that such fraction is below 25 % in control fibroblasts.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the mechanism of OCRL action and its relationship to SNX9: Does depletion of SNX9 (and/ or related SNXs) perturb OCRL recruitment to CCPs? What is the role of SNX9, which accumulates at CCPs and is overexpressed in OCRL mutants, in actin comet tail generation? If KD of SNX9 in OCRL mutants would abolish actin comets this would be a strong indication for a close functional and physical link between OCRL-mediated PI(4,5)P2 turnover and SNX9 regulation of actin polymerization</italic>.</p><p>In response to this comment we performed KD experiments of SNX9 and of its homologue SNX18. Microscopy observations suggested a decrease in the number of comets but with variability from cell to cell, which roughly correlated with remaining levels of SNX9 immunoreactivity. Interestingly, even in KD cells, when comets were observed they had tips positive for SNX9 immunoreactivity. These results are consistent with a role of SNX9 in the actin polymerization leading to actin tails. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>. We note however, that interaction of OCRL with SNX9 is not required for its recruitment to clathrin coated pits, as an OCRL mutant harboring a mutation in the SNX9 binding site, but still capable of binding clathrin and AP-2, was still recruited to very late stage clathrin coated pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Other studies of patient fibroblasts have seen defects in internalization of certain, but not all cargoes.

Schmid’s lab; Yarar <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005). The results of these experiments confirm the observations reported in our original manuscript, as they show a delay in endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient cells compared to controls. These new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, replacing the fluorescent transferrin time-course uptake data.</p><p><italic>5) The number of CCPs analyzed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4"><italic>Figures 2G and 4F-H</italic></xref> <italic>is very low and ought to be increased to derive valid conclusions</italic>.</p><p>In order to increase the number of CCPs analyzed, we have used a recently published automated tracking method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) that allows the calculation of the lifetime distributions of CCPs. We have examined the lifetime distributions of over 6500 events per condition, increasing our sample size over 400-fold. The results of this analysis, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>, are consistent with our previous observations indicating that the lack of OCRL in patient cells leads to a delayed turnover and extended CCPs lifetime.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, which focuses on the sequential recruitment of SNX9 and OCRL to the pit, we increased the number of events manually scored by 10-fold.

Data in this direction would further strengthen the link between OCRL and PI(4,5)P2 levels and their effect on CCP maturation</italic>.</p><p>We tested an overexpressed GFP-SNX18 construct and observed that it accumulates at the tip of actin comets in patient cells, akin to SNX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, we observed that SNX18 is also capable of co-immunoprecipitating OCRL and we have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. The expression levels of SNX33 are very low in our patient and control cells as assayed by qPCR, and we decided not to focus on this protein.</p><p>We have not investigated the effects of knocking down PIPKs on CCP dynamics in patient cells. Given the occurrence of different isoforms and their potential functional overlap, we expect this analysis to lead to inconclusive results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
