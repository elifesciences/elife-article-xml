lacking. Here, we define the order of acquisition, lifetime, and release of critical components involved in late secretion from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Of particular interest is the timing of the many reported effectors of the secretory vesicle Rab protein Sec4, including the myosin-V Myo2, the exocyst complex, the lgl homolog Sro7, and the small yeast-specific protein Mso1. At the trans-Golgi network (TGN) Sec4’s GEF, Sec2, is recruited to Ypt31-positive compartments, quickly followed by Sec4 and Myo2 and vesicle formation. While transported to the bud tip, the entire exocyst complex, including Sec3, is assembled on to the vesicle. Before fusion, vesicles tether for 5 s, during which the vesicle retains the exocyst complex and stimulates lateral recruitment of Rho3 on the plasma membrane. Sec2 and Myo2 are rapidly lost, followed by recruitment of cytosolic Sro7, and finally the SM protein Sec1, which appears for just 2 s prior to fusion. Perturbation experiments reveal an ordered and robust series of events during tethering that provide insights into the function of Sec4 and effector exchange.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>Sec1-Munc18</kwd><kwd>exocyst</kwd><kwd>myosin-V</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5RO1GM039066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bretscher</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R35GM131751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bretscher</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first quantitative live-cell microscopy this work shows depicting the order of events preceding secretion in budding yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins destined for the secretory pathway are made on the endoplasmic reticulum, transferred to the Golgi complex, from where they are sorted into secretory vesicles that are transported and ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane to deliver their cargo. This pathway has been highly conserved in eukaryotes, from budding yeast to animal and plant cells. Indeed, many of the proteins involved in the secretory pathway were first identified and characterized in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Novick et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Novick, 2014</xref>), which remains the organism in which the secretory pathway is best understood. Despite several decades of research, during which the general function of the major proteins involved has been elucidated, many of the components have not yet been visualized in vivo at a spatiotemporal resolution sufficient to assess their order of action. A similar timeline has been previously defined for the events and components of yeast endocytosis, a process which involves hundreds of copies of some proteins and takes on the order of 10–12 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Picco et al., 2015</xref>), but this work represents the first such timeline for exocytosis, the totality of which occurs over approximately 5 s.</p><p>This laboratory has previously analyzed and imaged the transport of budding yeast secretory vesicles, marked by the Rab Sec4, from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Initial studies showed that secretory vesicles are transported by the myosin-V motor protein, Myo2 along actin cables at about 3 µm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donovan and Bretscher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donovan and Bretscher, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Santiago-Tirado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schott et al., 2002</xref>). In the current study, we sought to build on these results by imaging components involved in secretory vesicle biogenesis and exocytosis individually and in combination at rates significantly faster than previously achieved. Our goal was to generate a timeline along which the participation of each component could be recorded. Of particular interest is the timing of effectors of Sec4, the Rab protein which associates with secretory vesicles and has a number of known effectors, including the exocyst, the myosin-V motor Myo2, and Sro7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schott et al., 1999</xref>). This goal presented a number of technical challenges. First, all components had to be tagged in such a way as to minimally impair their function when expressed from their cognate promoters. Second, the number of molecules involved for many of the components is very small, making single, and especially double-label, imaging challenging. Third, since events occur in the timeframe of seconds, rapid frame capture was imperative to allow imaging at a significantly higher rate and resolution than has so far been achieved.</p><p>In this study we were able to image secretory vesicle biogenesis, with the arrival at the trans Golgi network of the Rab GEF Sec2, the Rab Sec4, and its effector the myosin-V motor Myo2. During transport, the secretory vesicle recruits the exocyst, the Sec4-effector complex necessary for vesicle tethering. During tethering, Rho3 is recruited, followed by Sro7, and then very briefly by the SM protein complex, Sec1/Mso1. Perturbation experiments show that this time-line is remarkably robust to levels of these and other components. Finally, we show that the associated Sec1 and Mso1 have redundant membrane-recruitment domains that aid its surprisingly fleeting participation during exocytosis. This time-line, together with an estimation of the number of molecules of each component involved and their known functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), provides a framework to better understand biogenesis of secretory vesicles and their consumption at the plasma membrane.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Proteins discussed in this work.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Protein</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Brief Description</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Interactions Relevant to this Work</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Ypt31/32</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Paralogous Rab proteins which localize to late Golgi to facilitate TGN transport by Myo2 and help drive vesicle formation.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sec2, Myo2, Exocyst (Sec15)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Sec4</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The secretory vesicle Rab protein which recruits effectors critical to exocytosis.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sec2, Myo2, Msb3/4, Exocyst (Sec15), Sro7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Sec2</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GEF (Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor) for Sec4.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ypt31/32, Sec4, Exocyst (Sec15)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Msb3/4</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Redundant GAPs (GTPase Accelerating Proteins) for Sec4.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sec4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Myo2</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Class V Myosin motor protein responsible for transporting secretory vesicles (among other cargo) to the growing bud.

At the TGN, a GTPase cascade results in the generation of secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Novick, 2016</xref>). The Arf-GEF Sec7 activates Arf1, which in turn recruits Pik1-Frq1 (the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase complex) and the TRAPPII Rab-GEF complex. TRAPPII then recruits Ypt31/32 (Rab11 homologs), which recruits another Rab-GEF Sec2, which finally activates and recruits the secretory vesicle Rab, Sec4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomas and Fromme, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walch-Solimena et al., 1997</xref>). Ypt31/32 and Sec7 have frequently been used as interchangeable TGN markers; however, Ypt31/32 level has recently been shown to peak on compartments a full eight seconds after Sec7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Highland et al., 2021</xref>). While endogenously tagged Sec7-mNeonGreen occasionally appears to fragment into small compartments or vesicles, most Sec7 appears to dissipate around the time of fragmentation, leaving resulting vesicles difficult to identify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, mNeonGreen(mNG)-tagged Ypt31 can be followed through vesiculation and appears to remain on vesicles through fusion with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The population of Ypt31 which appears to remain on the plasma membrane is most likely an artifact of the fluorescent tag, though this was not probed further. For this reason, we assessed the timing of recruitment of Sec2, Sec4, and a Myo2-marker (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for construction) to mScarlet-Ypt31 marked compartments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recruitment of Sec2, Sec4, and Myo2 precede secretory vesicle budding from the TGN and all exocyst components are on secretory vesicles before arrival at the plasma membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example of mNG-Ypt31 TGN vesiculation in a diploid cell.

Sec2 first appeared on the Ypt31-containing TGN approximately 2 s prior to separation, whereas Sec4 and the Myo2-marker appeared approximately 1 s before separation, and, presumably, about one second after Sec2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). The close temporal proximity of Sec4 and Myo2 arrival suggests that Myo2 is likely the first effector of Sec4 recruited to secretory vesicles. This early recruitment relative to other exocytic factors is probably aided by the fact that Myo2 is also a direct effector of Ypt31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lipatova et al., 2008</xref>). While Sec4, Sec2, and Myo2 were all found to be rapidly directed towards the bud following separation from the TGN—generally in under half a second—only compartments marked with Sec2 or Sec4 appeared capable of moving diffusely for up to several seconds, suggesting that at least some vesicles can separate from the TGN without first acquiring Myo2.</p><p>It’s remarkable that the machinery driving secretory vesicle formation has not yet been identified. The field has long held that since secretion itself is an essential process, formation of the classical 80–100 nm secretory vesicles must be carried out by similarly essential components. Progress in this regard has been at least partially hampered by the observation that there appears to be more than one redundant pathway ultimately leading to exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harsay and Bretscher, 1995</xref>). Our preliminary experiments examining the non-essential Vps1, which has been implicated in a late step of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurunathan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harsay and Schekman, 2007</xref>), suggest that it is directly involved in the formation of at least one class of secretory vesicle. Loss of this small GTPase which is known to act at the endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chi et al., 2014</xref>), results in cells containing larger compartments capable of maturing to the point that they recruit Sec4 and apparently fuse with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This directly challenges the notion that the 80–100 nm vesicles themselves are essential for secretion, but will need to be examined more closely in future studies.</p><p>Ypt31 and Ypt32 are often described interchangeably as they are considered functionally redundant (deletion of one or the other is consistent with viability, whereas loss of both is lethal). Interestingly, while the relative recruitment timing of Sec2 and Sec4 was similar when compared to Ypt32 compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), relative Ypt32 to Ypt31 ratios appeared to mark subtly different compartments, with Ypt32 being more prominent on compartments within the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and C). This trend of compartments within the bud carrying a higher concentration of Ypt32 also held when the markers on Ypt31 and Ypt32 were reversed and only expressed from endogenous promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Though Ypt31 and Ypt32 are paralogs generated during the whole genome duplication event and clearly provide similar-enough functions to compensate for the loss of one another, existing genetic data supports the possibility of the two proteins serving subtly different cellular functions. Of the 54 reported significant negative genetic interactors of Ypt32, only two overlap with significant negative genetic interactors of Ypt31 (of 182 total). Similarly, the two show no overlap in significant positive genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that Ypt32-enriched TGN within the bud could represent the more early-endosome-like TGN compartments with which endocytic cargo colocalize and seems consistent with earlier descriptions of post-Golgi endosomes in yeast and recycling endosomes in higher eukarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pelham, 2002</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the recruitment of the exocyst to secretory vesicles. The exocyst complex, comprised of single copies of Sec3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, Exo70, and Exo84, tethers secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane before fusion and is primarily thought to localize to the vesicles themselves, ahead of membrane delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyd et al., 2004</xref>). Sec3, however, has long been suggested to be a ‘landmark’ of secretory vesicle tethering—residing on the plasma membrane, apart from the other seven subunits of the complex on the vesicle itself. This long-standing model suggests that once a vesicle comes into proximity of the plasma membrane, Sec3 then joins the bulk of the complex to complete the exocyst and facilitate tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiederkehr et al., 2003</xref>). More recent studies suggest that the yeast exocyst complex is an obligatory heterooctamer, with Sec3 always being bound to the other components with no discernible subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heider et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, each exocyst component, including Sec3, was individually tagged with mNeonGreen. When each component was imaged, they could be seen on vesicles in the mother cell, although clear vesicular localization was generally only noticeable in immediate proximity to the bud neck and within the bud itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Additionally, fluorescence loss of Sec3 and Sec5 from the bud during constant photobleaching (‘FLIP’) of the mother cell was identical, suggesting that Sec3 recycles to the mother cell at the same rate as other exocyst components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, Sec3 appears to be a component of the octameric exocyst complex in vivo which associates with secretory vesicles ahead of tethering and is not likely to be a spatial 'landmark' component of the exocyst. This echoes earlier work downplaying the landmark model of Sec3 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roumanie et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Localization of the exocyst to moving vesicles in the mother only became slightly more apparent upon multiply-tagging the complex with one copy of mNeonGreen on each of three subunits (Exocyst-3x-mNG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>). Within the mother, few examples of Sec4-Exocyst colocalization could be found, though the clearer examples occurred on vesicles which moved in a diffusive manner briefly before polarized movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). While this further supports that our exocyst marker was identifying moving secretory vesicles, this rare observation stands in stark contrast to Sec4 or Sec2 which could be readily observed on vesicles at all points within the mother, indicating that exocyst association with vesicles generally occurs well after vesicle biogenesis and during transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Improved techniques for the imaging of yeast exocytosis</title><p>Our previous study to examine secretory vesicle tethering utilized standard spinning disk confocal imaging of the cellular volume surrounding the bud neck of haploid <italic>GFP-Sec4</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donovan and Bretscher, 2015a</xref>).

An average of 22 vesicles enter the bud per minute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The previous technique of intentionally photobleaching the bud thus necessarily relied on fortuitously timed secretory vesicle formation and transport from the mother and for that vesicle to then tether within the small vertical observation window centered around the bud neck.

Instead of photobleaching, we utilized the larger volume and plasma membrane surface area of mid-sized diploid buds to identify individual vesicles that tethered, fused, and could be confidently discerned from nearby vesicles. This three-dimensional capture was performed by streaming EM-CCD frames to RAM from a very small optically centered field of view, using short exposures (between 10 and 50ms), constant laser excitation, and continuous vertical movement of the stage. Additional discussion of the rationale for the imaging set-up used is provided in the Methods Section. By removing the need for discrete stage stepping, camera-shuttering, and laser firing this drove down the capture time per frame, resulting in typical captures of 175ms per stack of six planes for brighter signals from more abundant proteins, and less than a third of a second for very low abundance proteins. This is far faster than the capture of five planes in 1.5 s used in our earlier studies.</p><p>With these adjustments and careful analysis of these videos in 3D projections (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), we were able to identify far more unambiguous tethering and fusion events than previously possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) and could even identify many events per cell in some captures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we defined tethering as the first frame where a Sec4 vesicle came to a full stop at a location not more than one apparent vesicle diameter from where it eventually fused with the plasma membrane. Similarly, fusion was assumed to occur at the last frame in which signal could be positively identified at the tethering location. Although a fluorescent marker capable of visualizing cargo release would be ideal for this task, to this date no such tool has been successfully developed. Analyzing many such events resulted in diploids resulted in a tether-to-fusion time of approximately five seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, we found early on in this study that the presence of the GFP-tag on Sec4 itself affects Sec4 function. A significant increase in tether-to-fusion time was seen when no untagged Sec4 was available (such as in a GFP-Sec4/GFP-Sec4 diploid or GFP-Sec4 haploid; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This difference indicated that the heterozygous diploid GFP-Sec4/Sec4 strain would be the most physiological framework in which to explore secretory vesicle tethering. By measuring the average intensity of GFP-Sec4 signal on tethered vesicles in the diploids, we found that GFP-Sec4 signal on the vesicle remains constant throughout the duration of tethering, only rapidly disappearing after several seconds, suggesting that Sec4 is not extracted from the vesicle during tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-78750-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Example of a typical three-dimensional live-cell vesicle tethering video showing a single diploid cell containing one endogenously-tagged copy of GFP-Sec4 over 26 seconds.</title><p>Six planes were captured with 25ms exposures during continuous stage movement, resulting in 176ms per stack or ‘timepoint’.

Both Sec3-mNG and Sec15-mNG remain on tethered vesicles for about the same time as the tether-to-fusion time of GFP-Sec4, although both consistently appeared slightly shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Although this difference is not statistically significant, it is consistent with reports showing that the mammalian exocyst remains associated with exocytic vesicles roughly until fusion. Sec3 and Sec15 represent constituent components of the two putative exocyst sub-assemblies (Sec3, 5, 6, 8 vs 10, 15, Exo70, Exo84) and we do not see a significant difference in the residence timing of the two sub-complexes, as has been reported in mammalian cells, though this discrepancy could be a matter of confidence and sample size and underlying differences may be probed further in future exocyst-specific studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Earlier studies employing haploid GFP-Sec4 strains reported a longer tethering time of about 15–18 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donovan and Bretscher, 2015a</xref>), which cannot be explained by the use of a haploid GFP-Sec4 strain alone. During the current study, it became evident that a lower temporal resolution could result in longer apparent vesicle tethering due to a newly observed phenomenon of tethering ‘hot-spots’. At these transient locations, secretory vesicles can be seen to tether sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and/or simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). It is not currently possible to quantify the frequency with which this occurs due to the complexity of tracking the many vesicles within the bud for their entire pre-fusion lifetime. One possibility is that tethering hot-spots are near the end of actin cables that are used to transport vesicles to the plasma membrane. Disruption of actin cables with Latrunculin B resulted in an accumulation of secretory vesicles in the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) thereby precluding obtaining a definitive answer to the involvement of actin cables ends as hot-spots. Moreover, this disruption caused a significant elongation of tethering-to-fusion time with individual tethering events being moderately easier to identify due to their more broad distribution within the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Interestingly, though puncta and patches of Bni1 (the formin within midsized buds responsible for actin cable assembly) only persist for slightly longer than the lifetime of a single vesicle tethering event (mean, 6.4 s), patches of another exocytic protein, Boi2, were capable of lasting significantly longer (median, 16.5 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The redundant Boi1/2 proteins have been suggested to play a role in both actin and vesicle tethering regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glomb et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masgrau et al., 2017</xref>) and, indeed many, but not all, vesicles appear to tether at Boi2-mNG puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).While this could potentially explain the underlying biology of tethering hot-spots, the actual mechanisms and dynamics of tethering hot-spots will need to be explored in a future study.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tethering Hotspots Exist.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequentially tethering vesicles may appear as long-lived events in captures with low spatiotemporal resolution, especially when considering the elongated tethering time in cells with no untagged Sec4 (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The arrival and departure kinetics of Sro7, as measured by average punctum intensity over time, were roughly symmetrical, with the longevity before peak intensity being about equal to the longevity after the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Sec1, the SM (Sec1-Munc18) family protein responsible for directing secretory vesicle SNARE assembly, has primarily been visualized at low spatiotemporal resolution or via BiFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kustermann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we visualized Sec1-mNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) and found the shortest localization timing of any exocytic component examined, with Sec1 puncta longevity having a median time of 2.1 s (mean, 2.3 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, unlike Sro7, Sec1 arrival and departure times were different, with the accumulation of signal taking slightly longer than its dissipation following peak intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This is potentially consistent with Sec1 functioning at the end of vesicle tethering, rapidly disappearing around the moment of membrane fusion. Mso1, a small nonessential protein tightly associated with Sec1 and suggested to be an effector of Sec4, was found to have a similarly short lifetime, not significantly different from Sec1 (median 2.5 s, mean 2.6 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weber-Boyvat et al., 2013</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-78750-video4.mp4" id="video4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Sum projection video of Sec1 localization events in a Sec1-mNG homozygous diploid cell.</title><p>Six planes were captured with 50ms exposure times, resulting in 350ms per timepoint.

About 23±9 molecules of Sec2 could be seen on vesicles during transport. Finally, few copies of Sro7 (20±8) and Sec1 (14±5) were found to localize to their respective membrane puncta in the bud.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Constructing a timeline</title><p>Having measured the timing of various components individually, we next sought to correlate these timings into a cohesive timeline of events from initial tethering to fusion. This endeavor was a complex one. Most of the proteins examined have a low number of molecules associated with each tethering event, so ensuring sufficient fluorescent intensity for meaningful detection of multiple markers, each expressed at endogenous levels, while maintaining a reasonable imaging frequency, was challenging. This was further complicated by synthetic negative genetic interactions encountered between some fluorescently-tagged protein pairs (such as diminished growth or perturbed protein localizations compared to singly-tagged strains), potentially due to induced steric clashes. Additionally, even the most abundant vesicular protein, Sec4, was not bright enough for our experiments when tagged heterozygously with mScarlet, the brightest currently available red fluorescent protein.</p><p>Unfortunately, GFP-Sec4 paired poorly with our best red vesicle marker Exocyst-3x-mScarlet, with tethering time as measured by GFP-Sec4 alone in this strain being somewhat elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, even in this strain we can see that Sec4 and the exocyst depart from exocytic sites around the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Fortunately, Exocyst-3x-mScarlet was able to be successfully utilized in combination with several other tagged components with minimal detriment. Further, since several components (Sec2, Myo2, Smy1, and the exocyst itself) are transported to the tethering site on the vesicle, alignment of loss of these components to the moment of tethering is easy, for example tracking the loss of a Tomato-Myo2-marker compared to GFP-Sec4, confirms that Myo2 begins dissociating shortly after the start of tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Relative ordering of exocytic events and the tether-to-fusion timeline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single example of vesicle fusion showing near simultaneous loss of Sec4 signal and the exocyst in GFP-Sec4/Sec4 Exocyst-3x- mScarlet.

Although Rho3 plays an integral role in vesicle tethering, it has not been shown to be present on constitutive secretory vesicles themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forsmark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson et al., 1999</xref>). Rather, in wildtype cells, Rho3 is broadly resident on the plasma membrane with transient bud-localized patches of increased concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Rho3 was visualized with a recently developed internal-mNG (imNG) tag and compared to the arrival of vesicles marked by Exocyst-3x-mScarlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingras et al., 2020</xref>). Alignment of multiple such events illustrates that Rho3 peaks at sites of tethered vesicles about 1.5 s after tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>When Sro7-mNG was imaged alongside Exocyst-3x-mScarlet, Sro7 signal peaked between 3 and 4 s after tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). While Sro7 signal appears to plateau and remain longer than expected in this context when compared to imaging of Sro7 alone (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), this is likely an artifact of variable Sro7 arrival time. Regardless, it is evident that Sro7 localizes to sites of exocytic vesicles about 2 s after tethering and leaves around the moment of fusion. Interestingly, while Sro7 almost always co-localized with clear exocyst puncta in still images (as expected by the timing of its arrival relative to tethering), approximately 20% of Sro7-mNG puncta did not colocalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Although it’s not clear what these Sro7-only puncta represent, it is possible that there is simply an undetectable quantity of exocyst complexes residing on the associated vesicle. Alternatively, these may represent the remnants of aborted tethering events, or more intriguingly, events with a class of vesicle more highly dependent on Sro7 for fusion, such as the ones suggested might contain proteins required for salt-stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forsmark et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Alignment of several Sec1 puncta co-imaged with Exocyst-3x-mScarlet showed that peak Sec1 intensity corresponded with the moment of exocyst loss, the expected moment of vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). When the timing of this Sec1-mNG peak was compared to Smy1-mScarlet, we found that Smy1 arrived and began decreasing in intensity (like Myo2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) approximately 5 s before Sec1 peak, indirectly illustrating the time between vesicle arrival and fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>Together, we can generate a timeline of events from initial secretory vesicle arrival and tethering to terminal fusion with the plasma-membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The data paint a picture where secretory vesicles are delivered to the bud tip along actin cables and tethering is aided by the directive force of Myo2 as loss of actin cables extends tethering time. Shortly after arrival, the Sec4 GEF, Sec2, dissociates from the vesicle, followed closely by release of Myo2 and its cofactor Smy1. During this period, Rho3 on the plasma-membrane begins to associate with the tethered vesicle, likely enforcing tethering through its interactions with exocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson et al., 1999</xref>). Once the exocyst is activated and adopts an “open” conformation thanks to interactions with Rho proteins and the membrane itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>), Sro7 is recruited to the putative site of exocytosis by interactions with newly unoccupied Sec4:GTP molecules on the vesicle and the exocyst itself. Finally, with the chaperoned recruitment of Sec9 by Sro7, Sec1/Mso1 begins to concentrate around the vesicle, aided by direct interactions with Sec6 of the exocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgera et al., 2012</xref>). Sec1 then templates and stabilizes trans-SNARE complex assembly before rapid fusion, dissociation of the exocyst, and eventual extraction of Sec4 from the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Tether to fusion time is remarkably robust</title><p>With a newly defined timing from secretory vesicle tethering to fusion, we wished to identify which components regulated this timing by examining how the reduction or over-expression of various components affected tethering time.

Heterozygous reduction in the vesicle SNARE Snc2, which is functionally redundant with Snc1, had little effect (homozygous loss of Snc2 results in vesicle accumulation which precluded measurement of tethering time). While SNARE limitation had a clear detrimental effect on tether-to-fusion time, over-expression of either Snc2, Sec9, or Sso2 had a consistently minor, but not significant, effect of lowering tether-to-fusion time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Neither did overexpression nor heterozygous reduction of Sec2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It is surprising that over-expression of Sec2, which should elevate Sec4:GTP on vesicles, has no effect on tethering, whereas loss of Msb3 (<italic>msb3∆/msb3∆</italic>), that should also elevate Sec4:GTP, elongates tethering. To see where in the time-line this extension of tethering occurred, we examined the duration of individual components in <italic>msb3∆/msb3∆</italic> cells compared with wildtype. This reveals that the rapid release of Sec2 from secretory vesicles after tethering is unchanged, whereas loss of Myo2 and the exocyst is delayed and the duration of Sro7 and Sec1 is extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, reducing the hydrolysis rate of Sec4:GTP is uncoupled from the release of Sec2, but affects all downstream events.</p><p>Rho3, which likely plays an important role in the initial establishment of tethering, also had no significant effect on tether-to-fusion time when either overexpressed or heterozygously deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

This is best explained as an effect caused by diluting Sec9 at the tethered vesicle, as heterozygous deletion of Sec9 also resulted in a significant increase in tethering time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Since there are relatively few Sec9 molecules in the cell, a gross overabundance of Sro7 (from overexpression) results in Sro7 being recruited to vesicles without bringing along the SNARE it’s responsible for chaperoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hattendorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lehman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Overexpression of another key Rho protein, Cdc42, as well as other regulatory components also had no significant effect on tethering time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).

In one scenario, loss of Mso1 may delay the arrival of Sec1 to the tethered vesicle but, once recruited, Sec1 may take the same amount of time to perform its essential functions. In the second scenario, if Mso1 participates in Sec1’s essential function, its absence could cause Sec1 to be prolonged at the tethered vesicle, thereby delaying fusion. A defining feature of these two models is the longevity of Sec1 puncta on the plasma membrane. When we examined the longevity of Sec1-mNG in an <italic>mso1</italic> null, we saw no such change in the time from Sec1 punctum appearance to disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Nor were there any apparent changes in the number of Sec1 molecules per punctum in the <italic>mso1</italic> null strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We did, however, find that broad plasma membrane localization of Sec1 (outside of discrete puncta) was diminished in the <italic>mso1</italic>∆ strain, especially for cells with midsized buds, in which vesicle tethering times were normally measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that Mso1s primary function may be to increase the local concentration of Sec1 on the plasma membrane near sites of polarized growth, hastening its ultimate recruitment to a tethered vesicle thereby promoting efficient secretory vesicle fusion. This is further supported by our new observations concerning Sec1 membrane recruitment. Sec1 has a positively charged C-terminus, and Mso1 has an amphipathic N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), either of which when visualized independently localize broadly to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Individual loss of either of these regions from Sec1 or Mso1, can be tolerated, but simultaneous loss of these two membrane-associating regions is lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is interesting to note that the extended Sec1 tail is unique to fungi and all Sec1 C-termini appear to contain this highly positively charged sequence, although the length of the preceding linker region varies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Mso1 is also unique to fungi, specifically ascomycetes, but is considerably more variable between species, with the Sec1-binding domain being the principal highly-conserved motif within the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). This poses interesting questions concerning the evolutionary divergence of exocytic mechanisms and regulators; why the Sec1 tail is found in non-ascomycetes, while Mso1 appears limited to this phylum is not immediately apparent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since many of the components of the yeast secretory pathway were first described in the 1980’s, attempts to further characterize the proteins have relied primarily on genetic and biochemical dissection of interactions to order the events leading to vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.

For the best spatiotemporal resolution, we opted to use high-speed spinning disk-confocal microscopy with short exposures and high excitation energies to image exocytic events over short time windows (30 s-1m). Imaging only the half of the bud closest to the coverslip also simplified the task of visualization. Analysis of all single-fluorophore microscopy was performed by viewing videos in 3D, as opposed to simple max or sum projections and this technique was invaluable for the ability to track individual vesicles through space, define tethering events with high confidence, and rule out abortive tethering events. Super-resolution microscopy techniques, while desirable for the increased spatial resolution, are yet unable to capture such events with sufficient temporal resolution.</p><p>When possible and when they did not appear to compromise function or localization, we used the brightest yeast codon-optimized and monomeric fluorescent proteins currently available: mNeonGreen and mScarlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bindels et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lambert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, all proteins were tagged directly in the genome under the expression of their own promoters, despite this severely restricting the number of molecules available to image. In part due to this imposed limitation, correlative imaging of any combination of two proteins with separate fluorescent tags became an even more complicated task. Under ideal conditions (excitation laser λ, emission filter λ, equal camera sensitivity), mScarlet is still roughly 75% as bright as mNeonGreen and, in our hands, mScarlet fusion proteins were generally less well-behaved. Tagged mScarlet-Sec4 did not even appear as bright as GFP-Sec4, perhaps owing to mScarlet’s much longer fluorescence maturation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lambert, 2019</xref>). For these reasons, very few protein pairs were possible to image while maintaining reasonable temporal resolution.</p><p>During the formation of secretory vesicles at Ypt31-marked compartments, the secretory Rab-GEF Sec2, precedes arrival of its cognate Rab, Sec4, by about a second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The direct recruitment of Sec4 to the Ypt31 compartment is apparently distinct from mechanisms described in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, where recruitment of these Rabs is spatially separated. In this filamentous fungus, RabE, the homolog of Yp31, is transiently recruited to the trans-Golgi Network where it picks up actin- and microtubule-based molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pantazopoulou et al., 2014</xref>). This compartment is then moved apically to the vesicle supply center (or Spitzenkörper), where RabD, the homolog of Sec4, is then recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pinar and Peñalva, 2021</xref>). Following arrival of newly activated Sec4, the myosin-V motor protein, Myo2, is recruited to the membrane by Sec4, though its rapid arrival is likely supported by active Ypt31/32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lipatova et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, while Myo2 appears capable of localizing to these compartments ahead of vesicle separation from the TGN, the force generated by Myo2 transport does not appear to be necessary for vesicle formation, as this process continues in the absence of actin cables. We have also found that the entire exocyst complex (including Sec3) localizes to secretory vesicles during transport to the bud and remains associated with the vesicle throughout tethering, only disassociating near the moment of fusion. While this does not necessarily rule out the presence of a population of Sec3 that localizes to the plasma membrane independently, the vesicular localization and the FLIP data appear to support a model where the yeast exocyst is an obligate hetero-octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heider et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Visual timeline of secretion from Golgi to plasma-membrane fusion.</title><p>Active Ypt31/32 on Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) membranes recruits the secretory Rab-GEF Sec2, which thereby recruits Sec4 to the TGN ahead of vesicle formation. Though vesiculation of the Golgi occurs by as-yet-unknown mechanisms, newly activated Sec4 recruits the myosin-V motor protein Myo2 to the Golgi around the time of separation from TGN compartments and the Myo2-vesicle interaction is enhanced by the kinesin-related protein Smy1. During transport to the plasma membrane of the bud the complete exocyst complex, including Sec3, is recruited to vesicles through interactions with multiple proteins including Sec4, Myo2, and Sec2. Upon reaching the plasma membrane, Rho-proteins on the membrane (Rho3, but likely Cdc42 as well) concentrate slightly at the vesicle interface facilitating the activation of the exocyst, thereby aiding tethering. The initial plasma-membrane recognition and selection of tethering sites likely involves many other inputs, including but not limited to the PIP composition of the membrane, position of actin-cable termini, and scaffolding proteins like Boi1/2. Shortly after tethering, Sec2, Smy1, and Myo2 dissociate from the tethered vesicle and Msb3 begins inactivating portions of the vesicle-bound Sec4 population. Sro7 (and Sec9) are then recruited to the vesicle-PM interface through active Sec4 as well as multivalent interactions with the exocyst. SNARE assembly at the interface is subsequently aided by the exocyst—including Sec6 and Sec8, as well as Sec3, which is partially responsible for activating Sso1/2—and, finally, Mso1. Shortly before fusion, Mso1 and Sec1, which are enriched on the plasma membrane of the bud by their respective membrane-binding domains, begin accumulating at the vesicle interface and rapidly dissipates around the moment of exocyst complex disassociation and vesicle fusion. After membrane fusion, any remaining active Sec4 is returned to an inactive state by Msb3/4 to facilitate removal from the plasma membrane.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78750-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In this study, secretory vesicles were found to tether for about five seconds before fusion with the plasma membrane; a far shorter time than previously believed. Prior work had indicated a ‘long’ tether-to-fusion time for vesicles on the order of 15–18 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donovan and Bretscher, 2015a</xref>). However, it now seems far more likely that such results are artefacts of slow imaging speed and the presence of vesicle tethering hot-spots. These hot-spots are likely biologically favorable for the maintenance of efficient and productive vesicle fusion. Sequential and/or simultaneous tethering events would logically permit utilization of the same pool of cofactors responsible for the initiation of tethering and downstream events preceding fusion.</p><p>Sec2, Smy1, and Myo2 all dissociate from secretory vesicles shortly after tethering, though release occurs at different rates and is not a concerted event. In future studies, it will be interesting to see how displacement of Sec2 affects release of other components and timing of overall vesicle tethering as a whole. Since deletion of the Sec4 GAP Msb3 elongates the vesicle residence time of every component measured except Sec2, it appears that Sec2 release is controlled by a Sec4-independent process, perhaps dephosphorylation by an as yet unknown bud-resident phosphatase, a regulatory mode previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stalder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stalder and Novick, 2016</xref>). Further, since GAP function necessarily requires binding to the same face of the Rab recognized by most effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2006</xref>), a direct competition is implied since Msb3 cannot simply “kick off” Myo2 and others bound to Sec4 at the plasma membrane by stimulating Sec4-GTP hydrolysis allosterically. Thus, exactly how Msb3 function and Sec4:GTP state are coupled to tethering time needs to be explored further.</p><p>Loss of Msb3 elongates the tethering time by acting on tethered vesicles prior to fusion. Although loss of Msb3 also results in accumulation of Sec4 in the plasma membrane, we have shown that this is not the cause of elongated tethering. If we take as axiom that Sec4:GDP readily binds new GTP without the aid of its GEF Sec2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kabcenell et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rinaldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walch-Solimena et al., 1997</xref>), then some portion of Sec4 delivered to the plasma membrane through fusion is likely to be Sec4:GTP, preventing extraction by GDI (Guanine-nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor). Therefore, Msb3 acts on Sec4 ‘twice’, once on the vesicle pre-fusion and once on the plasma membrane post-fusion. We believe this to be the simplest explanation of the observed data. Since efficient hydrolysis of Sec4:GTP is not strictly essential for exocytosis (<italic>Sec4<sup>Q79L</sup></italic> dramatically reduces GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis and GEF GDP release, yet haploids with this allele are viable), one interpretation is that the action of Msb3 on vesicle-bound Sec4 aids in the facilitated release or swapping of Sec4 effectors. The effectors likely to be bound by Sec4 after vesicle arrival at the plasma membrane could include Sro7 and the Sec1 accessory Mso1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weber-Boyvat et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The unexpected difference between the effects of two conditions which, in principle, both increase relative Sec4:GTP abundance (Sec2 overexpression and loss of Msb3) highlights the spatiotemporal regulation and robustness of secretion. Whereas deletion of plasma membrane localized Msb3 shifts the Sec4 equilibrium towards the GTP-bound state in the context of tethered vesicles, overexpression of Sec2 shifts the GTP equilibrium in the context of vesicle formation and transport. The early presence of Sec2 and the maintenance of Sec4:GTP during transportation to the bud tip directly aids in the recruitment of crucial effectors like Myo2 and the exocyst. Such Sec4:GTP maintenance is unfavorable in the context of a tethered vesicle, perhaps due to the exchange of Sec4 effectors near the plasma membrane. Correspondingly, when we look at the timing of individual components in the context of an <italic>msb3∆∆</italic>, we can see that the rapid release of Sec2 from secretory vesicles after reaching the bud tip is uncoupled from the downstream events preceding vesicle fusion, as it is the only component for which there is no significant change.</p><p>By combining the rapid three-dimensional capture and analysis of individual components with fast 2D dual-color microscopy we were next able to align several events which occur before fusion vesicle fusion to generate a timeline from tethering to fusion. Strains with multiple subunits of the exocyst tagged with mScarlet proved to be the most useful tool for alignment of these exocytic events. This set of three tags (comprised of fusions with Sec10, Sec15, and Exo84) localizes well and appeared to behave fine when combined with most other fusions, only moderately affecting timing of various events.</p><p>While Rho1 and Cdc42 are capable of interacting with the exocyst through the N-terminal PH-like domain of Sec3, Rho3 is of particular interest due to its ability to bind the exocyst through Exo70, a subunit which appears to be involved in the activation of the exocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have shown that gain of function mutants in Exo70 are capable of suppressing loss of Rho3 and that the same gain of function mutations cause the exocyst to shift into a partially open ‘active’ conformation which exposes new binding sites. We previously showed that Rho3 primarily localizes to the plasma membrane, and not on internal vesicles, with concentration on the membrane increasing toward the bud tip and transient discrete puncta of yet higher concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingras et al., 2020</xref>). Imaging of Exocyst-3x-mScarlet with endogenous expression of this previously developed Rho3-imNG showed that Rho3 initially concentrates in puncta at vesicles shortly following their arrival to the plasma membrane. Together, a plausible model suggests that diffusing Rho3 on the plasma membrane is slowed down through interaction with Exo70, resulting in an apparent local accumulation, after which the interaction induces a conformational change in the exocyst, potentially to facilitate the exocysts binding of SNARE complexes and other exocytic proteins.</p><p>Subsequent to this, Sro7, a homolog of the <italic>lethal giant larvae</italic> and tomosyn polarity protein, is recruited to the exocytic site. As Sro7 primarily interacts with the exocyst through the exposed and labile N-terminus of Exo84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), it seems unlikely that the aforementioned conformational change in the exocyst is responsible for triggering binding of Sro7. Rather, it seems plausible that loss of Sec2 and Myo2 from the vesicle frees a population of active vesicular Sec4 which then enhances the recruitment of Sro7 as a new effector, in concert with Exo84; this would be consistent with observed timing of Sro7 accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watson et al., 2015</xref>). How Msb3 plays a role in this transition is unclear, however, a direct role seems likely based on the increase in Sro7 punctum longevity observed in <italic>msb3</italic> null cells. Interestingly, despite Sro7 localizing to sites of exocytic vesicles mid-tether, some 20% of Sro7-mNG puncta appeared to lack clear exocyst colocalization. Sro7 has been claimed to function in parallel to the exocyst, and overexpression can bypass loss of certain exocyst components, so it’s possible that these puncta represent a separate class of vesicle of uncertain identity which remains more dependent on Sro7 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lehman et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>While tethering, as facilitated by the exocyst complex, is the first and more reversible step towards vesicle fusion, docking, which is thought to be facilitated by SNARE-assembly, is likely more stable. SNARE proteins are not capable of stimulating membrane fusion on their own in vivo, instead requiring the aid of additional factors called Sec1-Munc18 (SM) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hong and Lev, 2014</xref>). Notably, the exocyst itself plays several important roles in SNARE assembly, including initial Sec3-stimulated disinhibition of Sso1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yue et al., 2017</xref>) and direct SNARE complex assembly independent of Sso1/2 opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2022</xref>), although the myriad interactions responsible for this assembly have been better discussed in recent publications and preprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Though not directly imaged, the SNARE Sec9, Sro7, and Sec4:GTP have been shown to form a ternary complex, so the arrival of Sro7 at the tethered vesicle likely indicates the arrival of Sec9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>). The local recruitment of Sec9 thereby increases the likelihood of forming the binary and ternary SNARE-pin intermediates capable of binding both Sec1—which has essentially no interaction with SNARE monomers but is essential for exocytosis and viability—and Sec6 of the exocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubuke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Togneri et al., 2006</xref>). Crystallographic studies of the vacuolar SM protein Vps33 suggest that SM proteins function as templates of SNARE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). Earlier studies, however, have shown that Sec1 has distinct functions both before and after ‘docking’, where docking is defined as SNARE-pin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashizume et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, early studies of the neuronal Sec1 in rats (Munc18) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Rop) suggested that SM proteins may have a negative-regulatory role in exocytic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halachmi and Lev, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schulze et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>This study contains the first direct in vivo visualization of SM proteins with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to identify localization to single exocytic vesicles. The data presented here on the timing and dynamics of Sec1 function in yeast, support a model where SM proteins accumulate at pre-fusion membranes helping to facilitate SNARE assembly, holding in place briefly before concerted release, and thereby, membrane fusion. Since Sec1 has such a low affinity for individual SNARE motifs, direct ‘templating’ through Sec1 seems unlikely, though it is possible it plays some role in directing alignment of the zero-layer SNARE residues. It is far easier to imagine why it would be beneficial for Sec1 to remain associated with SNARE-pins preassembled with the aid of the exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yue et al., 2017</xref>), as the presence of the SM protein should prevent the unwanted disassembly of otherwise productive trans-SNARE complexes by NSF and α-SNAP, Sec18 and Sec17, respectively, in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jun and Wickner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Sec1 is aided in initial plasma membrane localization by the small ascomycete-specific peripheral plasma membrane protein, Mso1, and that this initial membrane recruitment represents a shared essential function of Mso1 and the (also fungal-only) Sec1 C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, this initial localization is instead accomplished through a direct interaction between the exocytic SM protein and an N-terminal peptide on the Syntaxin-homologs (which is not found in the yeast Sso1/2 syntaxins)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rathore et al., 2010</xref>). Mso1 has also been previously reported to play a role in the assembly of SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castillo-Flores et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weber-Boyvat et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our timeline and relative abundance of participating components involved in the biogenesis of secretory vesicles at the Golgi and their exocytosis at the plasma membrane raises many questions. Notably, the exact mechanism of secretory vesicle biogenesis is still shrouded in mystery. Previous searches for proteins responsible for secretory vesicle biogenesis have relied on the assumption that if secretion itself is essential, the formation of secretory vesicles must also be essential. Additionally, previous studies have suggested the existence of multiple secretory pathways, a model which is supported by some observations in this study. Although we did not uncover any clear evidence of differentially regulated tethering and fusion events, future studies (perhaps utilizing cargo-specific markers) may still find subtle but physiologically significant differences in the regulation of vesicle subpopulations. The solutions of these mysteries, as well as mechanistic and structural studies on how the conformational transition of the exocyst facilitates the shift from tethering to docking in fusion are all questions that can build on the framework presented here.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, growth, and transformation</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

For two-channel microscopy, single planes focused on the bottom or center of the cell were captured in rapid alternation with 75–100ms exposure per channel.

With a continuously moving stage, this means each subsequent image on this camera represents a discrete position along the vertical axis which could subsequently be assembled into a 3D volume with the knowledge of stage position at each timepoint (recorded as piezo voltage during capture).

These measurements were later averaged and depicted ± SD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics and presentation</title><p>Graphs and statistical analyses were generated in Prism 9. Except where stated, non-parametric tests were used due to non-normality of some data sets. Paired t-tests were used to compare the relative Ypt32/Ypt31 TGN intensities between mother cells and buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>). For all single component timings (compiled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), general differences were first assessed via Kruskal-Wallace non-parametric ANOVA, followed by the select Dunn’s corrected post-hoc tests shown. Similarly, vesicle tether-to-fusion timings in deletions and overexpressions were grouped (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), with deletions being compared to the wildtype vesicle tether-to-fusion times first shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and each overexpression being compared to the relevant 2 µm empty vector control. In this case, corrected post-hoc tests were performed between the relevant control and each experimental condition only (not between any independent overexpression or deletion conditions). Due to non-normality, comparisons for individual component timings in wildtype versus in <italic>msb3∆</italic> cells were performed via Mann-Whitney test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Benjamin S Glick as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three reviewers have evaluated your manuscript, and all of us are enthusiastic about the work. It is a substantial advance both technically and conceptually.</p><p>As you will see from the reviews, there are issues to be clarified as well as suggestions for improving the presentation. Please consider these comments carefully and revise the manuscript according to your best judgment. The changes will be primarily at the level of the text and figures, although some minor additional experimentation might be merited. The main points are as follows.</p><p>– Nonspecialists will find it challenging to keep track of the various components and their roles in the pathway. Additional background would be helpful to orient readers. You might consider providing a table that lists the components with brief summaries of their functions. In addition, it will help to define terms explicitly and to acknowledge your assumptions. An example is to explain how you are assessing &quot;tethering&quot; and &quot;fusion&quot; experimentally-e.g., if fusion is defined as loss of Sec4-GFP signal at the plasma membrane, that's an important assumption that should be stated and justified.</p><p>– On a related note, the manuscript would benefit from a mechanistic diagram that pulls together the new findings into a model. Some speculation is fine here. The idea is to emphasize how the results deepen our understanding of the journey experienced by a secretory vesicle.</p><p>1) Given the emphasis in this work on imaging technology, it would be useful to provide full explanations about how the microscopy system was configured and why particular choices were made.</p><p>2) Studies of related phenomena in Aspergillus should be cited and considered. It's likely that many basic aspects of secretion are conserved between yeast and Aspergillus, but the Aspergillus system has unique properties that can illuminate features of the pathway.</p><p>3) Further discussion of Ypt31/32 would be helpful. The reviewers were surprised by the conclusion that Ypt31/32 remains on secretory vesicles. Perhaps the GFP tag partially compromises function and inhibits GAP activity? I note that GFP tags have been reported to compromise Ypt1 function, and we see something similar for Ypt6. Another point is that the Ypt31/Ypt32 pair arose from a relatively recent whole-genome duplication, so it's unlikely that the two paralogs have substantially different functions or that such differences are relevant beyond yeast. This concept is worth mentioning.</p><p>4) It would be helpful to distinguish more clearly between firm interpretations and speculations, especially in cases where you are pushing the technology to the limit and making inferences about what you are seeing.</p><p>5) Some of the conclusions echo prior work from other investigators, and those earlier contributions should be better acknowledged.

We now define tethering as &quot;the first frame where a Sec4 vesicle came to a full stop at a location not more than one apparent vesicle diameter from where it eventually fused with the plasma membrane&quot; and fusion &quot;at the last frame in which signal could be positively identified at the tethering location&quot;. Later in the results, we underscore this assignment of fusion as the length of tethering is unchanged in GDI mutants where some of the Sec4 becomes incorporated into the plasma membrane (Figure 4 D,E).</p><p>Additionally, we have added a summary figure schematizing the timeline of events as the new Figure 9 within the discussion and clarified some assumptions with regards to Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Given the emphasis in this work on imaging technology, it would be useful to provide full explanations about how the microscopy system was configured and why particular choices were made.</p></disp-quote><p>As no new imaging technology was employed, simply optimized techniques and newer cameras, we did not believe a mechanistic diagram of imaging technology would be helpful, but we have elaborated further as to the choices made and the set-up of the system within the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Studies of related phenomena in Aspergillus should be cited and considered.

The concern that the fluorescent tags used could be compromising Ypt31/32 function is a valid one and one that we are certainly sensitive to. Upon discussion with colleagues and review of early literature regarding Ypt31 localization we have decided to deemphasize this observation as at least its localization to the plasma membrane is likely an artifact. We still, however, believe that Ypt31 and Ypt32 may be playing subtly different cellular roles. Though clearly the two provide similar-enough functions to compensate for the loss of one another, of the 54 reported significant negative genetic interactors of Ypt32, only two overlap with significant negative genetic interactors of Ypt31 (of 182 total). Similarly, the two show no overlap in significant positive genetic interactions. (Costanzo M et al. Science. 2016 Sep 23;353(6306). pii: aaf1420.

For issues of sterics alone, we initially excluded Sec5 and Exo70 from a multi-tag complex. We also excluded Sec6 due to critical interactions with SNAREs and Sec1 which we feared interfering with (the exact residues required for these interactions are unknown). Sec3 and Sec8 may have worked fine as alternative tags and, in fact, we wanted to use a 4x-tag exocyst, but found this behaved worse than the 3x. Exo84 ended up as the 3<sup>rd</sup> tag by happenstance.
