pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28118.001</object-id><p>Haploinsufficiency of the melanocortin-4 receptor, the most common monogenetic obesity syndrome in humans, is associated with a reduction in autonomic tone, bradycardia, and incidence of obesity-associated hypertension. Thus, it has been assumed that melanocortin obesity syndrome may be protective with respect to obesity-associated cardiovascular disease. We show here that absence of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in mice causes dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by reduced contractility and increased left ventricular diameter. This cardiomyopathy is independent of obesity as weight matched diet induced obese mice do not display systolic dysfunction. <italic>Mc4r</italic> cardiomyopathy is characterized by ultrastructural changes in mitochondrial morphology and cardiomyocyte disorganization. Remarkably, testing of myocardial tissue from <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> mice exhibited increased ADP stimulated respiratory capacity. However, this increase in respiration correlates with increased reactive oxygen species production – a canonical mediator of tissue damage. Together this study identifies MC4R deletion as a novel and potentially clinically important cause of heart failure.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28118.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called the melanocortin-4 receptor are the most common genetic cause of early onset obesity in children. These mutations occur in about 1 in 1,500 people. The melanocortin-4 receptor is mostly found in the brain where it helps to balance how much a person eats with how many calories they burn. A mutation in just one of the two copies of the gene a person gets from their parents is enough to cause severe obesity.</p><p>Mice that have been genetically engineered to lack this gene develop all the same symptoms as humans with the mutation. These symptoms include early onset obesity, a slower than normal heart rate, and reduced activity in the nerves that communicate with many body tissues including the gut. Patients with this syndrome are less likely to develop obesity-linked high blood pressure, which could be considered protective from some of the ill effects of excess weight. As a result, studying the animal model of the syndrome may help scientists better understand why mutations in the gene for the melanocortin-4 receptor cause obesity and how to better care for people with these mutations.</p><p>Now, Litt et al. show that, contrary to expectations, mice lacking the gene for the melanocortin-4 receptor have a higher risk of heart failure than normal mice. An ultrasound scanner showed that the left side of the heart in the mice without the melanocortin-4 receptor becomes progressively larger and weaker. This reduces the heart’s ability to pump blood. Additionally, Litt et al. showed that the energy-producing structures within cells, called mitochondria, are defective in the heart cells of these mice. These defects cause the mitochondria to work harder and produce more harmful byproducts. The mitochondria in the animal’s muscles, however, appear normal.</p><p>Further experiments showed that the genes active in the hearts of the mice lacking melanocortin-4 receptors are similar to genes active in heart cells treated with doxorubicin, a cancer drug that is toxic to the heart. This drug is known to cause heart failure in some people. The experiments suggest that physicians should watch for signs of heart failure in people who have mutations that affect their melanocortin-4 receptors. Mice with one good copy of the gene did not have signs of heart failure, but they appeared more sensitive to the toxic affects of doxorubicin. These findings suggest that clinical studies are needed to determine if there are potential heart problems or drug sensitivities in patients with mutations that affect the melanocortin-4 receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular</kwd><kwd>cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>MC4R</kwd><kwd>melanocortin-4 receptor</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 DK108476-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Litt</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Litt</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 HL121174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fessel</surname><given-names>Josh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The melanocortin-4 receptor knockout mouse exhibits a cardiomyopathy syndrome, which raises concerns about cardiovascular function in patients with the similar loss of function mutations, and perhaps even in the 1 in 1500 patients with heterozygous loss of the gene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the last 30 years, obesity has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christakis and Fowler, 2007</xref>). Health risks associated with obesity include type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Obesity is also an independent risk factor associated with the development of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kenchaiah et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levitan et al., 2009</xref>). Haploinsufficiency of the <italic>Mc4r</italic> is the most common monogenetic obesity syndrome in man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farooqi et al., 2003</xref>) and is responsible for 0.5–2.5% of all early onset morbid obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stutzmann et al., 2008</xref>) making it an important consideration in personalized obesity care. The prevalence of the <italic>Mc4r</italic> obesity syndrome is a result of its dominant inheritance pattern, and penetrance of approximately 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tarnow et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biebermann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tao, 2005</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mc4r</italic> is expressed most heavily in the central nervous system where it plays a critical role in energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cone, 2005</xref>). <italic>Mc4r</italic> expressing neurons within the hypothalamus receive orexigenic and anorexigenic inputs from arcuate nucleus POMC and AgRP projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balthasar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balthasar et al., 2005</xref>) and act to maintain energy homeostasis through modulation of both food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huszar et al., 1997</xref>) and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ste Marie et al., 2000</xref>). A reduction of MC4R signaling, through either genetic or pharmacological means, results in hyperphagia, bradycardia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), and reduced blood pressure. Clinical studies have found that heterozygous <italic>Mc4r</italic> mutations confer protection from obesity-associated hypertension through reduced sympathetic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sweeney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenfield et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sayk et al., 2010</xref>). Mice and humans with MC4R mutations also experience hyperinsulinemia that exceeds their degree of adiposity due to the role MC4R in the suppression of insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mansour et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, patients with <italic>Mc4r</italic> heterozygosity have reduced growth hormone suppression in response to obesity when compared to patients matched with standardized BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martinelli et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, while the effects of <italic>Mc4r</italic> deletion on peripheral vascular resistance may be cardioprotective, other aspects of the <italic>Mc4r</italic> obesity syndrome, such as hyperinsulinemia, incomplete growth hormone suppression, and altered autonomic tone are potentially cardiotoxic. Since no group to our knowledge has directly examined the effects of MC4R deletion on myocardial function, we chose to examine how <italic>Mc4r</italic> deletion affects myocardial function in vivo, and further characterized its effects on myocardial energy metabolism ex vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cardiac function in heterozygous, and homozygous MC4R knockout mice</title><p>In order to characterize the effects of MC4R on heart function, age- and sex-matched <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic>, <italic>Mc4r+/- </italic>and WT mice were serially assessed using echocardiography.

The <italic>Mc4r</italic> is not expressed in adult mouse myocardial tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that certain effects of the cardiomyopathy in <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> mice are due directly to insulin resistance and/or negative metabolic effects of obesity. In order to address this possibility, a cohort of age matched diet induced obesity mice was generated and evaluated by echocardiography. Age matched male C57BL/6J wild type mice were placed on a 60% HFD for 35 weeks until they reached the same body weight as the <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Accordingly, there was no difference in the abundance of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I-IV proteins or ATP synthase by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Based on these results and the abnormal mitochondrial morphology on TEM, we then sought to characterize <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> myocardial mitochondrial function in situ using high-resolution respirometry of saponin permeabilized left ventricle fibers. Using the protocol described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, no difference in the O<sub>2</sub> consumption between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) was observed upon exposure to glutamate and malate in the absence of ADP (complex I substrates, state IV respiration). Similarly, addition of palmitoylcarnitine in the absence of ADP (Fatty Acid Substrate, state IV respiration) did not result in any difference in O<sub>2</sub> consumption. When ADP was added to this reaction (Complex I substrates, state III respiration) there was a trend towards <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> myocardium consuming more O<sub>2</sub> than control tissue. The increase in state III respiration became more pronounced in the presence of medium chain fatty acid substrates (L-Octanoylcarnitine), as well as in the presence of succinate (complex II substrate, state III mediated respiration).

One possible explanation is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Formed as a byproduct of normal aerobic metabolism, ROS play both physiological and pathophysiological roles throughout the body. However, excessive ROS production is known to contribute to heart failure through irreversible modifications of cellular lipids, proteins and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giordano, 2005</xref>).

However, no significant fold change in <italic>Mc4r</italic> mRNA was observed in the left ventricle between WT and <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Similar to the qRT-PCR and western blot data, <italic>Mc4r</italic> expression in the myocardium was undetectable. However, 247 transcripts that were significantly different from WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) were identified. Differential expression of select genes was confirmed using qRT-PCR including increased expression of <italic>Myl7</italic> and reduced expression of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). In order to understand the significance of these gene changes, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify a known stimulus that promotes a similar transcriptional change. GSEA revealed that <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> gene changes in the myocardium resemble that seen following doxorubicin treatment — a known inducer of ROS and heart failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Pathway ontology analysis of all significantly different transcripts was then used to identify a potential mechanism responsible for heart failure. This analysis revealed a contribution 45 known signaling pathways and protein classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>) including growth factor signaling, GPCR signaling, cytoskeleton regulation, glycolysis and inflammation. Thus, while the pathway changes associated with <italic>Mc4r</italic> deficiency appear to affect multiple nodes of cardiac tissue function, these changes appear to induce a tissue phenotype that is consistent with oxidative stress.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28118.022</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Gene changes in <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> myocardium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of RNA-seq results.

In this mouse model of obesity, we observed a progressive decline in contractility as well as an increase in cardiac chamber size. This decline in cardiac function is found in <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> animals regardless of animal sex or knockout strategy but is absent in weight matched, diet induced obese mice. Using transmission electron micrographs, we observed grossly disorganized myofibers and pleomorphic mitochondria in <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> myocardium. Subsequent functional testing of myocardium revealed a nearly 2-fold increase in O<sub>2</sub> consuming capacity in 30-week-old <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> myocardium as well as a 2-fold increase in ROS. Studies in young lean <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> myocardium revealed similar findings with a 1.5-fold increase in O<sub>2</sub> consuming capacity and a 1.5-fold increase in ROS. We did not detect any change in skeletal muscle O<sub>2</sub> consuming capacity indicating that this change is specific to the myocardium. The underlying pathology appears to be due to an indirect mechanism as we were unable to detect <italic>Mc4r</italic> expression in atrial or ventricular tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Subsequent in silico analysis of RNAseq revealed gene set similarities in <italic>MC4R−/−</italic> myocardium to those seen in doxorubicin treated myocardial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Based on these findings, <italic>Mc4r+/-</italic>and WT mice were treated with a low dose doxorubicin treatment to see if a partial reduction of MC4R signaling might cause an increased sensitivity to a cardiotoxic challenge. These studies revealed that <italic>Mc4r+/-</italic>animals were more sensitive to doxorubicin than their WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), as indicated by an increased cachexigenic response. This was quite surprising, because inhibition of MC4R signaling is well documented to reduce the response to a variety of cachexigenic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steinman and DeBoer, 2013</xref>). This finding provides a potential model system for further studies of the role of MC4R signaling in cardiomyopathy, in which the level of MC4R signaling can be modulated. We are currently testing cardiac function in <italic>Mc4r+/- </italic>mice following doxorubicin treatment.</p><p>Homozygous loss of MC4R function, and homozygous loss of proopiomelanocortin gene function, a preprohormone precursor of the endogenous MC4R agonist have both been reported in patients with early onset obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farooqi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krude et al., 1998</xref>). Based on our findings, these patients, though rare, should be followed for cardiomyopathy. While most of these studies were conducted on <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> mice, it is important to note that a trend towards reduced contractility was seen in <italic>Mc4r+/-</italic>mice, as is demonstrated for fractional shortening and left ventricular internal dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).</p><p>Heterozygous hypomorphic/null alleles of the <italic>Mc4r</italic> are common, appearing in up to 1/1500 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Since most phenotypes characterized in <italic>Mc4r+/-</italic>mice have translated to <italic>Mc4r+/-</italic>patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenfield et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van der Klaauw et al., 2016</xref>), patients with heterozygous <italic>Mc4r</italic> mutations should also be followed as our studies suggest they may have an increased risk for the development of heart failure. Patients with dominant negative <italic>Mc4r</italic> mutations should also be identified and followed as they will more closely reflect the <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tarnow et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biebermann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tao, 2005</xref>). Our finding may thus also have clinical relevance in identifying the etiological factor in certain patients with obesity associated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, our GSEA and doxorubicin treatment findings suggest that common mutations in the MC4R may be an important risk factor for increased sensitivity to cachexia, or possibly even cardiomyopathies induced by cardiotoxic drugs, such as doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singal and Iliskovic, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Additional research will need to be conducted to determine the mechanism by which <italic>Mc4r</italic> deletion causes cardiomyopathy. However, the data shown here provides some important clues. First, since we were unable to observe <italic>Mc4r</italic> expression in adult mouse cardiac tissue, MC4R is likely acting indirectly. One possibility would be an early role for MC4R in cardiomyocyte development; developmentally restricted expression of the <italic>Mc4r</italic> has been observed in E14 through E18 rat heart, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mountjoy et al., 2003</xref>). Since we observed mitochondrial defects by respirometry in young lean <italic>Mc4r−/−</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>) not yet exhibiting significant cardiac dysfunction, it is possible that defective development and/or regulation of cardiomyocyte function contributes to the defective cardiac function seen by 26 weeks of age. Absent a role for early developmental expression in mouse cardiomyocytes, the prominent expression of the <italic>Mc4r</italic> in the central and peripheral nervous system implicates an autonomic mechanism. However, endocrinological mechanisms such as the hyperinsulinemia or abnormal obesity associated growth factor suppression may also need to be considered. Collectively, these studies characterize a novel form of heart failure with clinical importance and raise the need for further examination of how <italic>Mc4r</italic> deletion affects myocardial function in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse handling</title><p>All mouse experiments with approval from the Vanderbilt animal care and use committee.

The authors used a number of approaches that support the model that lack of melanocortin 4 receptor signaling results in a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype, which was previously unrecognized in this widely studied model of obesity. They report that, even though MC4R is not expressed in the heart, silencing of its expression provokes a dilated cardiomyopathy. They go on to provide evidence that this myocardial phenotype is both indirect (receptor not expressed in the heart) and independent of the concomitant obesity phenotype. Given the relative frequency of mutations in the MC4R gene in obese subjects, the current results have immediate translational relevance. This is an important observation, which should provoke further studies in humans as it is of potential clinical significance. It raises interesting mechanistic questions which will no doubt be the subject of future research. Thus, the manuscript seems to be a strong candidate and would be of interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. A few suggestions are offered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As the authors well know, a melanocortin obesity syndrome is characterized by a constellation of phenotypes that include hyperinsulinemia and increased linear growth. The increased growth phenotype is evident in the skeletal muscle. Was there also an increase in heart size/weight? If so, does this precede the onset of obesity? Similarly, does the cardiac abnormalities correlate with any changes in insulin sensitivity in the cardiac tissue?</p><p>The authors report that, on two different genetic backgrounds, deletion of the MC4R leads to systolic dysfunction, sufficient, on one background at least, to lead to a dilated cardiomyopathy. Given the fact that MC4R deficient human and mice have lower life time blood pressures and might be expected to be relatively protected from cardiac overload, this is a surprising and potentially clinically important finding. The data are clearly presented, the experimental findings look robust and the statistical analysis appears appropriate. The authors demonstrate that this phenomenon is not cell-autonomous and they suggest a range of systemic features of the MC4R deficient state that might contribute (low sympathetic tone, hyperinsulinemia, unsuppressed growth hormone). However they do not &quot;close the loop&quot; in terms of manipulating one or more of these parameters and correcting the cardiac metabolic defect. However, we appreciate that this would involve a very demanding and time-consuming set of experiments.</p><p>Why is it that humans with loss-of-function mutations in this gene do not develop systolic heart failure, whereas mice do?

Similarly, does the cardiac abnormalities correlate with any changes in insulin sensitivity in the cardiac tissue?</p> </disp-quote><p>The MC4R obesity syndrome is characterized by an early onset euglycemic hyperinsulinemia and increased linear growth in both mice (Fan. W et al., 2000) and humans (Martinelli, C. et al., 2011). Hyperinsulinemia is associated with myocyte hypertrophy and can lead to heart failure through a variety of mechanisms including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress and impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling (Boudina S and Abel E. 2007, Guanghong J et al., 2016). In our studies, we find that the heart weight of MC4R-/- mice is no different than lean controls at 6 and 12 weeks of age despite this early onset hyperinsulinemia. We do however see an increase in heart weight at 30 weeks of age, which is following the development of systolic dysfunction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> has been updated to include these data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, this increase in heart weight is proportional to an increase in total lean mass and is consistent with appropriate allometric organ scaling (Dawson et al., 2014). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, the increase in heart weight in MC4R-/- mice is out of proportion with their increased adiposity. MC4R-/- mice have increased heart weight when compared to weight matched DIO animals. This again is in line with the generalized increase in lean mass described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref>. Based on the reviewers’ suggestion and the importance of insulin sensitivity in normal heart function, we have gone on to characterize the insulin sensitivity of MC4R-/- using a phospho-specific pAKT-T308 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In these experiments, no difference in myocardial insulin sensitivity was observed between MC4R-/- and DIO mice. This is consistent with clinical studies that find no difference in insulin studies between MC4R deficient subjects and weight matched controls (Greenfield J et al., 2009). These findings indicate that MC4R-/- mice develop an increased cardiac mass by 30 weeks of age that correlates with an increase in lean mass but not insulin resistance. Based on our echocardiography studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5O</xref>), this increase in heart mass is not due to concentric hypertrophy – a compensatory response to increased afterload (Hill J &amp; Olson E. 2008), Rather, MC4R-/- mice display eccentric hypertrophy which is more consistent with elevated preload.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report that, on two different genetic backgrounds, deletion of the MC4R leads to systolic dysfunction, sufficient, on one background at least, to lead to a dilated cardiomyopathy.

We agree that the findings of cardiomyopathy in MC4R -/- mice necessitate further investigation, which include a better understanding of the mechanism of cardiomyopathy. For instance, does hypothalamic or autonomic MC4R deletion precipitate cardiomyopathy? Can postnatal MC4R deletion or re-expression induce or rescue cardiomyopathy? These studies necessitate the generation of new animal models and will be the subject of future studies. For this manuscript, we specifically wanted to make sure that the cardiomyopathy phenotype was robust and as a result of MC4R deletion and not due to other confounders (e.g. obesity).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is it that humans with loss-of-function mutations in this gene do not develop systolic heart failure, whereas mice do? To what extent have patients harboring this mutation been phenotyped in terms of cardiac structure and function?</p> </disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, no study has formally examined cardiac function in patients with MC4R LOF mutations. It is important to keep in mind that most MC4R LOF patients have been identified in young children with early onset obesity; just as our phenotype appears in older mice, systolic heart failure may only develop in older MC4R LOF individuals, and may also exhibit variable penetrance. Determining this will require non-invasive and invasive cardiac studies such as cardiac imaging and cardiac catheterization in these patients as they age. Anecdotal reports of acute respiratory distress as a cause of death in MC4R LOF patients were mentioned to us (personal communication with Sadaf Farooqi); however, it is unclear if this is due to cardiomyopathy or some other process (e.g., pulmonary disease). Heterozygosity of null and hypomorphic MC4R mutations has a high prevalence (~1/1500), and future studies will examine differences in cardiac function between MC4R+/- mice and wild type control mice. In experiments added to this revised MS, we show that MC4R+/- mice have increased sensitivity to a sub-cardiotoxic dose of doxorubicin, compared to wild type mice, as measured by weight loss. Preliminary data from one large cohort also indicate increased doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in MC4R+/- vs. WT mice, as well, but this will be the focus of future studies, and a possible Research Advance submission to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, assessment of myocyte hypertrophy will be a required step in the evaluation of ventricular remodeling.

Myocardial hypertrophy can be one means by which the heart is capable of responding to various stimuli (including pathological ones) (Hill J and Olson E. 2008). We have examined cardiac hypertrophy by different means. First, on echocardiography, we examined posterior wall thickness and observed no difference between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G, 1N</xref>, and 5O) Second, we assessed cardiac weight of the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). Third, based on the reviewer’s excellent suggestion, we characterized myocyte cross sectional area on multiple cross-sections and also found no difference in cross sectional myocyte area. These data are plotted in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to evaluate sympathetic tone in these animals (microneurography, or indirectly by assessing circulating catecholamine levels).</p> </disp-quote><p>Reduced 24 hour urine norepinephrine levels, a reliable indicator of serum catecholamines, has been observed in humans (Greenfield J et al., 2009) with MC4R deficiency. Previous studies in rats have also shown that central administration of an MC4R agonist causes an increase in blood pressure that can be blocked with β<sub>1</sub>AR blockers(Kuo, Silva, and Hall, 2003). Studies on MC4R-/- mice have shown they are protected from obesity associated hypertension (da Silva, A et al., 2014) which is driven by increased sympathetic tone (Hall J et al., 2010). Therefore, there is ample evidence in the literature that reduced MC4R signaling results in reduced sympatric tone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the bradyarrhythmia sinus bradycardia? It appears to me that p waves are dropped.</p> </disp-quote><p>We carefully examined ECG traces of chow fed WT, MC4R+/- and MC4R-/- mice. In the traces presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the p waves are indeed dropped in MC4R-/- mice. This finding must be tempered by the fact that this is a single external lead taken during echocardiograms. Therefore, it is difficult to safely conclude whether or not the bradycardia is sinus in nature. Future studies have been planned to examine this aspect of MC4R-/- cardiac function using invasive electrophysiological recording techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the upward increment in oxygen consumption consistent with the increase in ROS production? The authors argue that these processes are both linked and central to myocardial pathogenesis.</p> </disp-quote><p>Reactive oxygen species production in the heart is byproduct of mitochondrial respiratory activity by complex I and complex III which can result in heart failure (Brown D. et al., 2017). We note a global increase in ROS production that is proportional to the increase in respiratory capacity and increases with age. Older MC4R-/- mice have a 2 fold increase in tissue ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) and a 2 fold increased maximal respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Younger MC4R-/- mice have a 1.5 fold increased in ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) and a 1.5 fold increase in maximal respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The link between these two findings remains untested. However, both ROS formation and measured state 3 respiratory activity go up in response to increased mitochondrial membrane potential (Nicholls D, 2004) and contributes to age associated tissue damage. While an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential is a possible source of ROS production in these animals, this hypothesis remains to be tested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
