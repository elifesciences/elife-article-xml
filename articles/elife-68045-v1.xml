insults often develop motor disorders and cognitive difficulty. Excitatory granule cells, the most numerous neuron type in the brain, are especially vulnerable and likely instigate disease by impairing the function of their targets, the Purkinje cells. Here, we use regional genetic manipulations and in vivo electrophysiology to test whether excitatory neurons establish the firing properties of Purkinje cells during postnatal mouse development. We generated mutant mice that lack the majority of excitatory cerebellar neurons and tracked the structural and functional consequences on Purkinje cells. We reveal that Purkinje cells fail to acquire their typical morphology and connectivity, and that the concomitant transformation of Purkinje cell firing activity does not occur either. We also show that our mutant pups have impaired motor behaviors and vocal skills. These data argue that excitatory cerebellar neurons define the maturation time-window for postnatal Purkinje cell functions and refine cerebellar-dependent behaviors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Preterm infants have a higher risk of developing movement difficulties and neurodevelopmental conditions like autism spectrum disorder. This is likely caused by injuries to a part of the brain called the cerebellum. The cerebellum is important for movement, language and social interactions. During the final weeks of pregnancy, the cerebellum grows larger and develops a complex pattern of folds. Tiny granule cells, which are particularly vulnerable to harm, drive this development.</p><p>Exactly how damage to granule cells causes movement difficulties and other conditions is unclear. One potential explanation may be that granule cells are important for the development of Purkinje cells in the brain. The Purkinje cells send and receive messages and are very important for coordinating movement.</p><p>To learn more, van der Heijden et al. studied Purkinje cells in mice during a period that corresponds with the third trimester of pregnancy in humans. During this time, the pattern of electrical signals sent by the Purkinje cells changed from slow and irregular to fast and rhythmic with long pauses between bursts. However, mice that had been genetically engineered to lack most of their granule cells showed a completely different pattern of Purkinje cell development. The pattern of electrical signals emitted by these Purkinje cells stayed slow and irregular. Mice that lacked granule cells also had movement difficulties, tremors, and abnormal vocalizations.</p><p>The experiments confirm that granule cells are essential for normal brain development. Without enough granule cells, the Purkinje cells become stuck in an immature state. This discovery may help physicians identify preterm infants with motor disorders and other conditions earlier. It may also lead to changes in the care of preterm infants designed to protect their granule cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Purkinje cells</kwd><kwd>granule cells</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001595</institution-id><institution>Dystonia Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Heijden</surname><given-names>Meike E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS089664</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sillitoe</surname><given-names>Roy V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS100874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sillitoe</surname><given-names>Roy V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS119301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sillitoe</surname><given-names>Roy V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS101891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Amanda M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intersectional genetics show that excitatory neurons are essential for the functional and anatomical maturation of cerebellar circuits in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Abnormal cerebellar development instigates motor diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders including ataxia, dystonia, tremor, and autism. These conditions have a high incidence in premature infants as well as in newborns with cerebellar hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dijkshoorn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Limperopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Steggerda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zayek et al., 2012</xref>). The affected children ultimately attain a smaller cerebellar size compared to children born full-term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Limperopoulos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Volpe, 2009</xref>), and they have altered functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Herzmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hortensius et al., 2018</xref>). Observations from human clinical data indicate a strong correlation between abnormalities in cerebellar size and the subsequent incidence of cognitive disorders, suggesting that the late-term stage of cerebellar development encompasses a critical developmental time-window for establishing not only the motor but also the non-motor circuitry that is required for complex cerebellar functions and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">van der Heijden et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Volpe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The cerebellum undergoes a series of dynamic developmental changes during the third trimester and early postnatal stages, a period that corresponds to the first 2 postnatal weeks in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sathyanesan et al., 2019</xref>). At the level of gross morphology, the rapid proliferation of granule cell precursors and the integration of granule cells into the cerebellar circuit result in a fivefold enlargement of cerebellar size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chang et al., 2000</xref>), an increase in foliation complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corrales et al., 2006</xref>), and the formation of the tri-laminar cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyata et al., 2010</xref>). At the cellular level, the differentiation and arrival of mature granule cells into the circuit modifies the laminar localization and synaptic specification of cerebellar afferents that project to Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">van der Heijden and Sillitoe, 2021</xref>). Despite an extensive literature describing the temporal anatomical changes in the cerebellum and studies postulating that perturbations to the cerebellum during this dynamic period may lead to cognitive, social, and motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Volpe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), there is still relatively little known about how the anatomical aspects of cerebellar development correspond to its functional maturation programs that establish animal behavior.</p><p>Previous studies show that preterm birth in pigs, as well as postnatal hemorrhage and hypoxia (which mimics cerebellar hemorrhage) in mice, result in decreased granule cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Iskusnykh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yoo et al., 2014</xref>) and abnormal motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sathyanesan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yoo et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, postnatal hypoxia causes impairments in the spontaneous firing properties of Purkinje cells in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sathyanesan et al., 2018</xref>), and impaired Purkinje cell firing properties are also observed in prematurely born baboons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barron and Kim, 2020</xref>). It is not surprising that decreasing the number of granule cells results in abnormal Purkinje cell function, since each Purkinje cell may integrate inputs from up to two hundred fifty thousand excitatory granule cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Napper and Harvey, 1988</xref>). Nevertheless, genetic silencing of granule cells causes only modest alterations to the baseline firing properties of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>), perhaps because the predominant Purkinje cell action potential, called the simple spike, is spontaneously generated by the Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Raman and Bean, 1999</xref>). In line with this hypothesis, gross motor control is not affected in mice with impaired granule cell signaling, although they do have impaired motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, some mouse models that lack the majority of granule cells (agranular mice) have such severe motor defects that these mice are named after their phenotype; for example <italic>scrambler</italic>, <italic>weaver</italic>, <italic>reeler</italic>, and <italic>staggerer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bolivar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Falconer, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heuzé et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Le Marec et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sheldon et al., 1997</xref>). The discordance between the functional outcomes in mutant mice with reduced granule cell numbers and mice lacking granule cell signaling raises the question whether granule cell neurogenesis, rather than granule cell synaptic signaling, contributes more to the maturation of Purkinje cell firing properties in vivo.</p><p>To probe these cellular interactions, we manipulated the mouse cerebellum by genetically blocking neurogenesis of excitatory neurons. We used an <italic>En1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wurst et al., 1994</xref>) to delete the proneural gene, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, from the embryonic hindbrain. <italic>Atoh1</italic> is necessary for the development of excitatory cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ben-Arie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rose et al., 2009</xref>) and is not expressed in the inhibitory Purkinje cells. In this agranular cerebellar model, we test how Purkinje cells develop their structure, connectivity, and function using immunostaining, neural tract tracing, and in vivo electrophysiology performed in the second postnatal week. We also examined motor function and vocal skills in the mutant pups to test how the structural and functional changes in the cerebellum impact the expression of behaviors that are usually acquired during the first two weeks of life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons shape multiple aspects of cerebellar morphogenesis</title><p>To test the hypothesis that granule cell neurogenesis is essential for the functional development of Purkinje cells, we first needed to establish an appropriate agranular mouse model. In previously generated models, the mice lack granule cells due to spontaneously occurring mutations in genes with widespread expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Falconer, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">van der Heijden and Sillitoe, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sheldon et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, one could not differentiate cell-extrinsic from cell-intrinsic effects in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dusart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gold et al., 2007</xref>). To impair granule cell neurogenesis in a manner independent of genes expressed in Purkinje cells, we made use of the distinct origins of Purkinje cells and granule cells to establish a new model of agranular mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hoshino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rose et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Atoh1</italic> is necessary for the development of excitatory cerebellar neurons, including granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ben-Arie et al., 1997</xref>), which are the most populous cell type in the cerebellum and make up at least 99% of all neurons in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Consalez et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>En1</italic> is a homeodomain transcription factor that is expressed in the mesencephalon and rhombomere 1 by embryonic day 8 (E8), where it is required for the formation of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Davis and Joyner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wurst et al., 1994</xref>). The intersection of the <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>En1</italic> lineages converges on excitatory neurons that originate from the rostral rhombic lip (rRL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), but does not include inhibitory neurons like Purkinje cells that originate in the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hoshino et al., 2005</xref>). We demonstrate this selectivity by conditional expression of TdTomato, which is expressed by an intersectional reporter allele that is dependent on both Cre- (<italic>En1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wurst et al., 1994</xref>]) and FlpO- (<italic>Atoh1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018</xref>]) mediated excision of a stop-cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, we observed TdTomato expression in the granule cell layer and molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex, where the axons (parallel fibers) of granule cells reside, but not in the Purkinje cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conditional deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from the <italic>En1</italic> domain prevents proper size expansion, lamination, and foliation of the cerebellum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of an embryonic brain.

We generated conditional knockout mice by crossing mice that are heterozygous for the <italic>En1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> knock-in allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wurst et al., 1994</xref>) and heterozygous for <italic>Atoh1</italic> with mice that are homozygous for a LoxP-flanked <italic>Atoh1</italic> allele (<italic>Atoh1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shroyer et al., 2007</xref>).

The different control alleles were analyzed separately for the behavioral data and subsequently grouped together for anatomical and electrophysiological analyses due to the absence of any significant behavioral differences. In addition, the cross generates our experimental <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/FlpO</sup></italic> mice that we will hereafter refer to as <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice because the <italic>Atoh1<sup>FlpO</sup></italic> is a functional null-allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018</xref>). We previously showed that these <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice are informative for assessing the period of dynamic cerebellar development (P7-P14) but the animals succumb at around weaning age (P21), likely due to a combination of impaired motor coordination and breathing abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018</xref>). Using these mice, we have now investigated how the <italic>En1</italic>-mediated deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> influences the period of cerebellar growth that usually occurs in the second postnatal week. We found that cerebellar size rapidly expands between P7 and P14 in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, cerebellum is pseudo-colored in red) but that no such size-expansion occurs in the <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When we overlay the outlines of the cerebellum, we furthermore observe that the size of the cerebellum in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice is markedly smaller at both P7 and P14 compared to that of similar aged controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In sagittal tissue sections cut through the hindbrain and then stained with cresyl violet to visualize cell nuclei, we also observe that P7 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> cerebella lack a densely packed granule cell layer, that <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> cerebella do not form cerebellar lobules, and that there is no substantial increase in cerebellar size that takes place during the second postnatal week, which are morphological milestones typically observed in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). At P14, sagittal cerebellar tissue sections from <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice measure just 11.3% (±1%, n=12 sets) the size of paired control tissue sections and in addition, coronal-cut cerebellar tissue sections from <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice measure just 20.2% (±3%, n=6 sets) the size of paired control tissue sections. Moreover, as expected based on the expression patterns of the two genes we used in our manipulation, the deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from just the <italic>En1</italic> domain did not result in any gross morphological abnormalities in brain regions other than the cerebellum, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, pons, vestibular nuclei, inferior olive, and neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies on agranular animal models have reported a spectrum of morphological changes in the cerebellum, depending on the degree of granule cell loss; a range of cerebellar size differences compared to controls, thinner to completely absent granule cell layers, and fewer or complete lack of cerebellar foliation (compared to controls, the cerebellum in X-irradiated rats has: smaller size, thinner granule cell layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armstrong and Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zanjani et al., 1992</xref>]; <italic>staggerer</italic> and <italic>weaver</italic> mice: smaller cerebellar size, thinner granule cell layer, less foliation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armstrong and Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zanjani et al., 1992</xref>]; <italic>reeler</italic> and <italic>scrambler</italic> mice: smaller cerebellar size, thinner granule cell layer, no foliation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Goldowitz et al., 1997</xref>]; <italic>Atoh1</italic> chimera mice: smaller cerebellar size, thinner/no granule cell layer, less/no foliation [the phenotype is variable depending on the percentage of chimerism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>]).

Therefore, our <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice encompass all of the morphological changes observed in previous agranular models, although at the more extreme end of the severity spectrum, with little experimental variability and high regional specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Atoh1</italic> deletion reduces the number of excitatory lineage neurons in the cerebellum</title><p>Next, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate which of the main cellular components of the cerebellum is affected in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice. Based on the intersectional strategy we employed in our studies, we would expect a reduction in excitatory lineage cells with minimal changes to inhibitory neurons, including Purkinje cells. We show that deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> prevents granule cells from reaching differentiation by staining for GABARα6, which marks mature granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–2A</xref>). However, it remained unclear whether this change in signal was due to abnormal maturation or impaired granule cell neurogenesis. To address this question, we decided to employ a genetic strategy to label all <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons in control and conditional knockout mice with an intersectional TdTomato-reporter allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–3A–B</xref>). In this strategy, control animals are <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>FlpO/+</sup>;Rosa<sup>lsl-lfl-TdTomato/+</sup></italic> mice (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and conditional knockout mice are <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>FlpO/fl</sup>;Rosa<sup>lsl-lfl-TdTomato/+</sup></italic> mice. Within the granule cell layer of control mice, the TdTomato<sup>+</sup> signal saturates due to the dense packing of granule cell bodies. This leads to a signal density of 99.6% (± 0.1%, N=2, n=10) within the granule cell layer of lobule IX in control mice (<italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>FlpO/+</sup>;Rosa<sup>lsl-lfl-TdTomato/+</sup></italic>), compared to just 43.4% (± 3.5%, N=3, n=15) in the ventral-caudal regions of cerebella in conditional knockout mice (<italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>FlpO/fl</sup>;Rosa<sup>lsl-lfl-TdTomato/+</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–3D</xref>). Despite the mainly qualitative utility of these data, this reduced signal density does not provide direct numerical insight in the quantity of <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons that escape our genetic manipulation because it does not account for the origins of the signal saturation, the nearly 50-fold size difference between control and conditional knockout cerebella, or the difference in cellular compartments present in the area of interest (only cell bodies and dendrites in control mice, versus cell bodies, dendrites, and axons in conditional knockout mice). Unfortunately, the signal density in the control animals prevented us from manually counting individual <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons in control mice, but we were able to count the total number of TdTomato<sup>+</sup>, <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons in sagittal tissue sections from conditional knockout mice. We found an average of 925 (± 22, N=3, n=12) TdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells in each tissue section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–3A–BC–D</xref>). We usually obtain ~70 sagittal sections from a single conditional knockout mouse brain (N=5), leading us to estimate that the total number of <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage cells that escape the conditional knockout of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from the <italic>En1</italic> lineage to be in the range of 65 • 10<sup>3</sup> (/thousand) neurons per mutant mouse brain. The total number of cerebellar neurons (99% of which are granule cells) in control mice has previously been estimated in the range of millions (between 35 • 10<sup>6</sup> and 70 • 10<sup>6</sup> neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Consalez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Surchev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vogel et al., 1989</xref>]). We therefore estimate an approximate 10<sup>3</sup> (thousand)-fold reduction in the total number of <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons in our mutant mice, or less than 1% of the <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons escape the genetic manipulation.</p><p>Consistent with the substantially reduced number of <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons in the conditional knockout mice, we observe that <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> conditional knockout mice have a reduced pool of excitatory unipolar brush cells, which also derive from the <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–4A</xref>), compared to the density of unipolar brush cells that are localized to lobule IX and X in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). When we counted the number Tbr2<sup>+</sup>unipolar brush cells in control and conditional knockout mice, we found an approximately eight-fold reduction in the number of unipolar brush cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C–E</xref>). Interestingly, none of the Tbr2<sup>+</sup> escaper unipolar brush cells in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>FlpO/fl</sup>;Rosa<sup>lsl-lfl-TdTomato/+</sup></italic> conditional knockout mice express the TdTomato reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), suggesting that these cells may derive from a different sub-lineage. We also counted the number of excitatory cerebellar nuclei neurons, that derive from the <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and found an approximate fivefold reduction in their number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F–H</xref>). Unlike the escaper Tbr2<sup>+</sup> unipolar brush cells, cerebellar nuclei neurons in the conditional knockout mice express the TdTomato reporter, but the NFH signal appears more fibrous. Taken together, we find a significant reduction in the total number of all types of excitatory neurons that are derived from the <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage. We also observed an abnormal localization of GABARα6 expression in granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and NFH expression in excitatory nuclei neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F–G</xref>), which is an interesting molecular response to progressing this far into development without <italic>Atoh1</italic>.</p><p>To confirm that our genetic strategy did not prevent the development of inhibitory neurons, specifically Purkinje cells, we stained control cerebella using a combination of Calbindin, which marks Purkinje cells, and DAPI, which binds to DNA and ubiquitously marks cell nuclei. In sagittal and coronal tissue sections cut through the cerebella from control mice, the staining again highlights the increase in size between P7 and P14, as well as the formation of perfectly delineated dorsal-ventral layering of cells and the establishment of the characteristic folding that defines the cerebellar lobules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These morphological features are not evident in the cerebellum of the mutant mice. In addition to the easily visualized difference in the pattern of rostra-caudal lobules and reduced cerebellar size, the mediolateral morphological divisions of the cerebellum are not apparent and lamination is almost non-existent in P7 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). In <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice, we could identify Purkinje cells (Calbindin<sup>+</sup> cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), confirming that conditional deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> does not block Purkinje cell neurogenesis. However, the cellular organization of Purkinje cells in cerebella from <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice is markedly different from controls. We confirmed the stunted cerebellar size and lack of lobule complexity by comparing the outline of cerebella from control to <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). In line with our conditional knockout that targets neurons in the excitatory lineage, we further found that the representation of different classes of inhibitory neurons, including molecular layer interneurons, basket cells, and Golgi cells, remains robust and clearly detected by cell-type-specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–H</xref>). These data indicate that there are simultaneously occurring alterations in cerebellar morphology and cytoarchitecture in the mutant mice, both owing to the principal defect, which is the elimination of excitatory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Excitatory cerebellar neurons guide the transformation of cerebellar clusters into zones</title><p>One of the hallmarks of cerebellar circuit organization are the longitudinal zones, or modules, that have a specific pattern and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2018</xref>). While Purkinje cells differentiate into distinct molecular subtypes shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wassef et al., 1990</xref>), they initially group together into cellular clusters and only form the more precise and sharply delineated longitudinal zones as the cerebellum greatly expands in size and volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dastjerdi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Larouche and Hawkes, 2006</xref>). Here, we investigated whether Purkinje cell molecular subtypes in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice form distinct zones. As expected, at P14, ZebrinII<sup>+</sup> and PLCβ4<sup>+</sup> expressing Purkinje cells in control mice are organized in alternating zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–G</xref>). In contrast, ZebrinII<sup>+</sup> and PLCβ4<sup>+</sup> expression patterns in the <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> cerebellum are organized into a series of clusters rather than sharp zones.

To test how this sequence of events was impacted by the lack of granule cells in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice, we injected the anterograde tracer WGA-Alexa 555 into the lower thoracic-upper lumbar spinal cord of P12 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gebre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lackey and Sillitoe, 2020</xref>). We observed WGA-Alexa 555 labeled fibers and terminals at P14 after two days of tracer transport. In controls, mossy fibers project to the cerebellar cortex in a zonal pattern that reflects the topography of ZebrinII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O–P</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sillitoe and Hawkes, 2002</xref>). As in the controls, we found that spinocerebellar mossy fibers projected mainly to ZebrinII<sup>-</sup> domains in the <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice. However, in controls the mossy fibers occupy the domains in the granular layer that are located directly below the Purkinje cell zones, whereas in the mutants the mossy fibers remain intermingled within Purkinje cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O–Q</xref>). These results confirm that excitatory cerebellar neurons are not essential for initiating the zonal topography of mossy fiber projections that arise from the spinal cord. However, the organization of mossy fibers into poorly defined clusters in the mutants indicates that integration of excitatory neurons into the circuit is important for the architectural rearrangement and the refinement of both the Purkinje cells and afferents into zones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Excitatory cerebellar neurons promote Purkinje cell dendritic complexity</title><p>Previous studies suggest that decreasing excitatory input alters Purkinje cell dendrite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bradley and Berry, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Takeo et al., 2021</xref>), which results in abnormal dendrite morphology in agranular mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sotelo and Dusart, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated the cellular morphology of Purkinje cells in control and <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice by staining mouse brains using a modified Golgi-Cox method. We found that Purkinje cells in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice had stunted and smaller dendritic arbors compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and unlike in the control cerebella, neighboring Purkinje cells did not orient their arbors in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Sholl analysis revealed that the Purkinje cells in the mutants were smaller with less bifurcated dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). Furthermore, spine density was significantly lower in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice compared to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>), which is in agreement with previous work showing that dendrite outgrowth is dependent on the formation of excitatory synapses, the majority of which are contributed from granule cell parallel fibers in control animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bradley and Berry, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Takeo et al., 2021</xref>). From these data, we conclude that Purkinje cells in the P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice have less morphological complexity.

First, we looked how the density of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> synapses on Purkinje cells changed during the dynamic period. From P7 to P14, a large population of excitatory (Vglut1<sup>+</sup>) granule cells integrate into the cerebellar circuit and make direct contacts to Purkinje cells via their parallel fibers in the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). While some mossy fibers are also Vglut1<sup>+</sup>, they do not directly contact mature Purkinje cells in control mice but instead target granule cells in the granule cell layer. Therefore, we only quantified the density of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> synapses in the molecular and Purkinje cell layer. We saw an increase in the density of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> synapses in the Purkinje cell layer and molecular layer from P7 to P14 in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, top row). Because we impaired the neurogenesis of Vglut1-expressing granule cells, we expected the density of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> synapses to be lower in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice and not increase between P7 and P14. Indeed, we saw that the signal of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> synapses in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice did not change between P7 and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom row) and quantification showed that this signal was significantly lower at both time points in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice compared to age-matched control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The remaining Vglut1<sup>+</sup> synapses in the <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice likely originate from mossy fibers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and the small number of granule cells and unipolar brush cells that escaped our genetic manipulation of rRL-derived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, the approximately nine-fold reduction in Vglut1<sup>+</sup> signal in the cerebella of <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice further confirms that our conditional knockout strategy impairs the integration of granule cells into the cerebellar circuit. Taken together, we show that without excitatory cerebellar neurons, the density of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> excitatory synapses in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice is much lower when assessed on individual Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>) as well as throughout the morphogenetically abnormal mutant cerebellum at large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The density of Vglut1 synapses onto Purkinje cells increases between P7 and P14 in control mice and is lower in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of Purkinje cell microcircuit in control (left) and <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice (right) at P7 and P14.

Therefore, we set out to answer two questions: first, how do the in vivo Purkinje cell firing patterns change during the dynamic period? Second, is Purkinje cell firing affected in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice that have a reduced number of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> excitatory inputs? We hypothesized that the reduced number of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> excitatory inputs affects the modulation of simple spike firing rate. Based on the time points we tested, and in line with the highest Vglut1<sup>+</sup> density in P14 control mice, Purkinje cells recorded from these mice had the highest peak firing frequency, whereas Purkinje cells in P7 control mice had an overall lower firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Interestingly, Purkinje cells in P14 controls fired in burst-like patterns that have unique powerfully represented features in their firing frequency and frequency mode (or preferred frequency) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>), whereas Purkinje cells in P7 control mice fired more continuously, yet at a lower frequency and with higher variability in their inter-spike intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and E</xref>). We quantified the firing features with six parameters: frequency (total spikes/recording time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), frequency mode (most frequently observed frequency; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), CV (a measure for global regularity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), pause percentage (defined as a discrete portion of the trace where no spikes were observed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>), rhythmicity index (the oscillatory properties in the auto-correlation of spike times; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–N</xref>), and CV2 (inter-spike interval irregularity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Holt et al., 1996</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that there are changes in the firing patterns that occur between P7-10 and P13-14, and that these changes in activity involve a higher firing frequency, with more burst-like firing patterns, and a higher rhythmicity within the burst. The changes in firing patterns are further visualized in the firing frequency distributions for each single cell that we recorded for this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we set out to quantify the firing patterns in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

This is further supported when looking at representative traces from Purkinje cells recorded in P7 to P14 control mice and P10 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, no single parameter alone can fully describe the complex temporal dynamics of the transformation that occurs in Purkinje cell firing patterns during the second postnatal week. Therefore, we used several mathematical approaches to compare the firing patterns of the 149 single neuron recordings, based on all six firing properties described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. First, we performed an unbiased cluster analysis that groups together neurons that have the most similar firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). When we retrospectively label the age and genotype of each cell after unbiased clustering, we see that older control cells cluster together (P11-14 in difference shades of green, clustered at the top) and younger control cells cluster together (P7-10 in different shades of purple, cluster at the bottom). Interestingly, Purkinje cells from both P10 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice cluster with the young control cells (orange, at the bottom) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Second, we performed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis on the aforementioned firing parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). After retrospectively color-coding the data points, we present a pseudo-timeline of the developmental transformation of firing patterns, with Purkinje cells from both P10 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice clustered with the young (P7-10) control cells in the bottom right and older (P11-14) control cells on clustered together on the top left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Both the unbiased cluster and the tSNE analysis show some cells in an intermediate state (between young and old) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>, middle cells). This suggests the existence of a transformation that occurs between younger and older cells, but the transformation does not occur at the same time for all Purkinje cells, as is expected based on previous studies showing that the heterogeneity of Purkinje cell function is an inherent property of Purkinje cells that respects and spans the timelines of anatomical and functional development of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beekhof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McKay and Turner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">van Welie et al., 2011</xref>). To further test whether there are general changes that occur at different time points or a transformation that occurs at a discrete age, we averaged the firing properties of all cells recorded in each group, allowing us to test for the relative contribution of specific firing properties in each age group, and performed an unbiased, hierarchical cluster analysis on the first two principal components of the averaged firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We find that although the young control cells (P7-10) are most similar to themselves and most dissimilar from older control cells (P11-14), there is a level of variability that likely reflects systematic differences for when the transformation occurs across different Purkinje cells. In agreement with our aforementioned findings, we found that the P10 and P14 Purkinje cells recorded in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice cluster with the young control cells (P7-10) and do not undergo the functional transformation in firing patterns that Purkinje cells in control mice do. Taken together, in a period of dynamic circuit development, Purkinje cells undergo a major developmental transformation in firing patterns between P7-10 and P11-14. Furthermore, in agreement with the absence of change in gross cerebellar morphology or dynamics in Vglut1<sup>+</sup> synapses, this developmental transformation does not occur between P10 and P14 in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Purkinje cell simple spike firing patterns undergo a developmental transformation between P7-P10 and P11-P14 that does not occur in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative electrophysiological recordings (each 10 s long) from Purkinje cells recorded in P7-P14 control mice and P10 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice.

We then reran the unbiased clustering analysis and tSNE analysis on all 179 single-cell recordings, and the hierarchical cluster analysis on the all group means to investigate whether P18 Purkinje cells in control and <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice more closely relate to Purkinje cells at the start (P7-10) or end (P11-14) of the dynamic developmental period. We found that Purkinje cells recorded in P18 control mice cluster with Purkinje cells recorded in P11-14 control mice, but Purkinje cells recorded in P18 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice cluster with the younger Purkinje cells that were recorded at P7-10 in control mice, which were also similar to Purkinje cells recorded in P10 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). These analyses further underscore that developing Purkinje cells rely on the neurogenesis of their surrounding excitatory neurons to make a dynamic functional transformation in their firing properties and that Purkinje cells developing in an environment largely devoid of granule cells are maintained in a functionally immature state, rather than acquiring a new, pathophysiological firing pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Excitatory cerebellar neurons are necessary for pruning away excess Vglut2 synapses from Purkinje cells</title><p>Our results argue that excitatory neurons are essential for shaping the spontaneous firing properties of Purkinje cells. However, a subset of Purkinje cell action potentials is dynamically induced by excitatory inputs from climbing fibers originating in the inferior olive. Interestingly, during early postnatal development, multiple climbing fibers contact one Purkinje cell, but in a parallel-fiber/granule cell-dependent process, the additional climbing fibers are pruned away during the second and third weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crepel and Delhaye-Bouchaud, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hashimoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kano and Hashimoto, 2012</xref>). Immature Vglut2<sup>+</sup>/climbing fiber synapses are located around the Purkinje cell body in controls, but at around P9 only the ‘winner’ among these synapses translocates to the Purkinje cell dendrites in the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kano et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to this change in Vglut2<sup>+</sup>-expressing climbing fibers, mossy fibers temporarily innervate Purkinje cells bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kalinovsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sillitoe, 2016</xref>) and granule cells may transiently express Vglut2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Miyazaki et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore expected a reduction in Vglut2<sup>+</sup>-positive synapses around the Purkinje cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, we observed a decrease in the density of Vglut2<sup>+</sup> synapses in P14 control cerebella compared to P7, likely due to a combined reduction in Vglut2<sup>+</sup> expression in granule cells, displacement of mossy fibers to granule cells, and pruning of climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>).

Given the large reduction in the total number of granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), it is likely that this high density of Vglut2<sup>+</sup> synapses stems from mossy fibers and climbing fibers directly innervating Purkinje cell bodies.

Interestingly, the predominant shape of the complex spike was different between P7 and P14. Purkinje cells in P14 control mice fired classical complex spikes, which are defined by a large sodium spike followed by a train of three to five smaller spikelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Davie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zagha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In contrast, Purkinje cells in P7 control mice fire ‘doublets’, which are characterized by an initial simple spike-like action potential, followed by a smaller action potential that occurs within 20 ms (a similar profile of doublets was previously reported in neonatal rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Puro and Woodward, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sokoloff et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>]). Similar to Purkinje cells in P7 control mice, the Purkinje cells in P10 and P14 <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice also predominantly fired doublets instead of true complex spikes, suggesting that the extrinsically-induced action potentials in Purkinje cells are maintained in an immature state just like the firing patterns of spontaneous simple spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Furthermore, we found that some Purkinje cells fired both complex spikes and doublets, which may indicate two separate climbing fibers promoting distinct types of post-synaptic spikes (example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We observed heterogeneity in complex spike type in about half of the Purkinje cells recorded in the youngest P7-10 control mice (P7-8: 10/21 cells; P9-10: 19/30 cells) and in about one third of Purkinje cells in the older P11-14 control mice (P11-12: 9/35 cells; P13-14: 12/32 cells).

Purkinje cells send projections to the cerebellar nuclei, which consists of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as some direct projections to the vestibular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>). These circuits are important for motor coordination and balance as well as social behaviors including ultrasonic vocalization (USV) in neonatal pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the contribution of the cerebellum to these behaviors is initiated before circuit rewiring is completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we were curious to know whether the immature circuit of <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice was sufficient for performing a substantial repertoire of cerebellar-dependent behaviors. Observations of control and <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mutant mice showed overt phenotypic differences in motor control (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) similar to what was previously observed in other agranular mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sidman et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sidman et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Woodward et al., 1974</xref>). At P14, control mice explore an open arena with smooth intentional motions, whereas <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice often fall on their backs. The frequent falling over onto their backs prevented us from performing classical assays of motor function such as rotarod or foot printing. Instead, we assayed the righting reflex, open field exploration, and USVs. We also tested for clinically relevant features such as tremor and dystonia-like postures, which often arise with cerebellar dysfunction. We found that <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice perform poorly compared to control littermates during the righting reflex. They were significantly slower in returning onto four paws when compared to <italic>Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> control mice at P8 and P10, and they were slower than heterozygous <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>mice only at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Because all mice attempted to turn right-side-up immediately after being placed on their backs, it is likely that this delay in righting is the result of impaired motor coordination rather than an abnormal sense of gravity. Next, we tested whether <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice showed abnormal USVs when briefly separated from their mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We found that call time in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice was shorter than those observed in control littermates and that <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice called less frequently than <italic>Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E</xref>).

The distance traveled or movement time in a 15-min-period was not significantly impaired (total distance (cm): <italic>Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>: 58.1±11.7; <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>: 35.7±9.9; <italic>Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic>: 44.4±6.5; <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic>: 43.1±12.4; Kruskal-Wallis test p=0.32; movement time (s): <italic>Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>: 55.9±5.9; <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>: 42.1±7.2; <italic>Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic>: 50.1±7.4; <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic>: 83.5±17.7; Kruskal-Wallis test p=0.14).

In humans, granule cell neurogenesis is impaired in premature infants with cerebellar hemorrhages, which is expected as proliferating granule cell precursors are highly vulnerable to the hemorrhage, likely because of their high metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dobbing, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gano and Barkovich, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hortensius et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, even a localized lesion that occurs during early cerebellar genesis can have major repercussions; loss of just a few precursors has exponential effects on the number of granule cells that integrate into the cerebellar circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corrales et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corrales et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings show that manipulating granule cell neurogenesis not only causes major anatomical defects, but it also obstructs the remodeling and wiring of circuits that establish cerebellar cortical function during a dynamic postnatal period. Our data add to our understanding of how temporally defined insults to the developing cerebellum may result in downstream circuit dysfunctions that are associated with specific neurological disorders observed in premature infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dijkshoorn et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In our model of agranularity, we show that deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from the <italic>En1</italic> domain impairs the development of the majority of granule cells. Even though some granule cells escape our genetic manipulation, we are confident that we impair the neurogenesis of the majority of granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Granule cells are the major driver for increasing cerebellar size, foliation, and lamination. Accordingly, the cerebella of <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice do not undergo proper expansion, and are devoid of lobules and a densely packed granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–J</xref>). In addition, the granule cell marker, GABARα6, is not reliably expressed in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and we find an approximate thousand-fold reduction in total <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the density of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> terminals is decreased nearly nine-fold, with the remaining Vglut1 signal mainly representing mossy fiber terminals since any granule cell and unipolar brush cell escapees would only contribute minimally to the existing circuit in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Regardless, even if some granule cells are present, they are not sufficient to drive the cellular circuit reorganizations that are known to depend on granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In addition to impaired granule cell neurogenesis, we observe a lower number of unipolar brush cells and excitatory nuclei cells in our <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice, which could, in theory, contribute to our findings of abnormal Purkinje cell function by causing a lack of feedforward and feedback signals, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). However, both excitatory nuclei cells and unipolar brush cells signal through the granule cells, so loss of granule cells alone would in theory have a similar effect on Purkinje cell function as the combined loss of all three subtypes. In addition, a lower number of excitatory nuclei cells can reduce the number of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Willett et al., 2019</xref>) and a lower number of Purkinje cells was also noted in models of chimeric <italic>Atoh1</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>); therefore, the reduction in cerebellar size that we reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could be, at least in part, enhanced by a lower number of Purkinje cells. Regardless, the <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> cerebellum is filled with Purkinje cells, the predominant neuronal type comprising this massively altered cerebellum, making it an ideal environment for identifying and measuring synapse densities and easily isolating single-units during the in vivo recordings.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are several caveats to using an agranular model to investigate circuitry. For instance, loss of morphogenetic processes that determine cerebellar architecture including its size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dahmane and Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</xref>), foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corrales et al., 2006</xref>), and layering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyata et al., 2010</xref>) complicate interpretations of how Purkinje cells directly respond to granule cells. A previous study showed that impaired granule cell migration can also impair Purkinje cell morphology and monolayer formation, which in turn could change Purkinje cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2002</xref>). However, here, we observed that the firing patterns of young Purkinje cells (P7-P10) do not differ between control and experimental mice, even though the defects in monolayer formation and foliation have already occurred by this time. This suggests that our observations of abnormal maturation in Purkinje cell firing patterns cannot be solely attributed to gross abnormalities in the anatomical structure of the cerebellum during morphogenesis in the <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice. In addition, changes in cerebellar shape and size could influence the function of forebrain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kuemerle et al., 2007</xref>), and the vast connectivity of the cerebellum with forebrain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex could contribute to the non-motor vocalization defects that we observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McAfee et al., 2019</xref>). The regional specificity of cerebellar circuitry that mediates non-motor connectivity is thus likely obscured in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Badura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stoodley and Limperopoulos, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite these caveats, much can be learned from our genetically precise agranular mouse model. Specifically, our mouse model has several advantages over previously described agranular mice when it comes to investigating the contribution of granule cell neurogenesis to cerebellar development and function. Because our model takes advantage of a conditional genetic strategy that only targets the rhombic lip lineage, our manipulation does not affect cell intrinsic developmental Purkinje cell programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herrup, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sheldon et al., 1997</xref>). And unlike previous models, our approach is independent of procedural variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altman and Anderson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sathyanesan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yoo et al., 2014</xref>), targets the entire <italic>Atoh1</italic> lineage in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ben-Arie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>), and has allowed us to study postnatal development. As a result, mutant mice with the <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> genotype have highly penetrant, consistent, and reliable anatomical and functional phenotypes, all of which have provided us with key insights into how cerebellar lineages shape circuit development and behavior.</p><p>The cerebellum controls motor and non-motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hull, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wagner and Luo, 2020</xref>). Regardless of the specific behavior, Purkinje cells are always at the center of the responsible circuit. Interestingly, during the first 2 weeks of life in mice, motor control becomes more precise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2015</xref>), in concert with the refinement of the cerebellar circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">White and Sillitoe, 2013</xref>). During this period, Purkinje cell innervation switches from climbing fibers and mossy fibers to climbing fibers and parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mason and Gregory, 1984</xref>), climbing fibers are pruned and a ‘winner’ establishes a single Purkinje cell target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kano et al., 2018</xref>), and Purkinje cell zones are sharpened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">White et al., 2014</xref>). Accompanying these changes are emergent properties of the two Purkinje cell spike profiles, simple spikes and complex spikes. In addition to the increased complexity of intrinsic cellular properties that have been defined using slice electrophysiology approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McKay and Turner, 2005</xref>), we postulated using our in vivo recordings that intercellular interactions between granule cells and Purkinje cells during development may support the maturation of Purkinje cell firing properties, both by providing direct inputs and by supporting anatomical maturation, including the outgrowth of Purkinje cell dendrites. In control mice, we observed dynamic changes in normal Purkinje cell firing between P7 and P14. We found an increase in firing rate that was not uniformly acquired but was present during bursts of rapid firing that were interspersed with frequent pauses without Purkinje cell action potentials. We previously reported burst-like Purkinje cell firing from P15 to P19, although by P30 the pattern acquires the regularity that is characteristic of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arancillo et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, burst-like firing occurs at intermediate stages of normal Purkinje cell development. Interestingly, bursting Purkinje cell firing patterns are also observed in mouse models of ataxia, tremor, and dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">LeDoux and Lorden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Miterko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Miterko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">White and Sillitoe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">White et al., 2016</xref>). The dynamically adapting circuit in control mice and the range of disease severities in disease models with bursting Purkinje cells raise the possibility that Purkinje cell firing is differentially decoded by downstream neurons based on the age of the mice. The data also indicate that the intermediate stages of Purkinje cell development not only highlight a developmental phase characterized by erratic neuronal activity, but that this mode of firing represents a pathophysiological hallmark that could be a default network state in different diseases. The higher level of baseline tremor in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice suggests the possibility that perhaps the process of stabilizing neuronal activity is affected in our mutants. In contrast, alterations in other behaviors such as the USVs indicates that behaviors required during the postnatal period, such as communication with the dams, are also dependent of stage-specific neuronal properties. Therefore, the presence of granule cells in the cerebellar cortex impacts behaviors used at different ages as a consequence of how they influence Purkinje cell firing.</p><p>The behavioral abnormalities in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice are likely caused by a combined effect of Purkinje cell dysfunction and a reduction of excitatory neurons in the cerebellar nuclei. Given the broad network effects of our manipulation, it is not surprising that <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice have such severe behavioral abnormalities. However, our findings are very interesting given what we know about cerebellar function. First, while <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice often rotate onto their backs and have a slower righting reflex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), they immediately initiate righting in both cases, suggesting that these mice have normal perception of gravitational force and that the observed phenotypes are mainly due to motor impairments. Second, because some extra-cerebellar structures are involved in airway pressure and breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bautista and Dutschmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chamberlin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dutschmann and Herbert, 2006</xref>), specifically the parabrachial nucleus and Kölliker Fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018</xref>), the defects in USVs could ultimately be due to alterations in multiple brain regions with particular effects on the duration of vocalizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–D</xref>). Yet, the respiratory cell types we have manipulated are unlikely to drive the initiation and number of vocalizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), suggesting that these abnormalities are cerebellum-driven. Finally, loss of Purkinje cell signaling is sufficient to reduce baseline and harmaline-induced tremor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2020</xref>), whereas we observe that loss of excitatory cerebellar neurons causes an enhanced tremor phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I–K</xref>). These data show that unlike Purkinje cells, excitatory cerebellar neurons are not necessary for propagating tremor but they are nevertheless required for modulating it to achieve adequate control of the muscles.</p><p>The severity of motor impairments and electrophysiological changes in Purkinje cells in our model and previously reported agranular mice remains in contrast to the modest changes in Purkinje cell firing after silencing granule cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>). However, a noteworthy distinction should be made that in our mice, granule cells are removed altogether, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Galliano et al., 2013</xref> blocked granule cell neurotransmitter release – the difference in functional outcomes could therefore include unique cell non-autonomous impacts on development induced by each type of manipulation and not solely depend on the primary manipulated cell type, the granule cells. Furthermore, in multiple models, impairing parallel fiber synapses results in motor impairments that can be assessed with the rotor rod assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiba et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2019</xref>), which we could not do due to the severity of motor impairment in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice. Taking these results together, from both the technical and conceptual standpoints, when one seeks to resolve developmental mechanisms, we must not only consider what is manipulated, but also how it is manipulated. As such, the timing of neurogenesis is a primary consideration. Purkinje cells are generated between E10 and E13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hashimoto and Mikoshiba, 2003</xref>) and granule cell progenitors from ~E13 onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Machold and Fishell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Whereas Purkinje cells migrate into the core of the cerebellar anlage upon their birth, granule cell precursors first migrate over the surface of the developing cerebellum and proliferate extensively in the external granular layer to increase the precursor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wingate and Hatten, 1999</xref>). Only after this phase do they migrate radially past Purkinje cells, the first potential opportunity for direct cell-to-cell interactions. Based on our data, we argue that the initial communication between Purkinje cells and granule cells sets the efficiency of Purkinje cell function and the establishment of Purkinje cell spike properties through structural as well as synaptic signals. Thus, insults to granule cell proliferation and an obstruction of granule cell neurogenesis may have different, and perhaps more severe effects on downstream Purkinje cell function, compared to lesions of mature granule cells. This may explain why relatively mild but early lesions and structural changes, as observed in preterm infants with and without cerebellar hemorrhage, have large effects on cerebellar function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Tissue was frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) solution and stored at −80°C until it was cut. All tissue were cut into 40 µm free-floating tissue sections and stored in PBS at 4°C until it was used for immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Free floating tissue sections were stained according to the following protocol. Free floating tissue sections were blocked in 10% normal goat or donkey serum and 0.1% Triton-X in PBS (PBS-T) for two hours. Next, tissue sections were incubated overnight in primary antibodies in blocking solution. Tissue was washed three times for 5 min in PBS-T. For fluorescent staining, the tissue was incubated for 2 hr in PBS-T with the preferred secondary antibodies conjugated to an Alexa fluorophore. Finally, tissue sections were washed three times in PBS-T and mounted on electrostatically coated slides with hard-set, DAPI-containing mounting medium. Alternatively, for DAB staining, we incubated the tissue for 2 hr in PBS-T with the preferred secondary antibodies that was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After washing three times in PBS-T, the tissue was incubated with diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution until the desired color intensity was reached. The DAB color reaction was stopped by washing tissue three times with PBS-T. The tissue was then mounted on electrostatically coated glass slides, dehydrated in an ethanol series (70% → 90% → 100%) and then mounted using Xylene or histoclear. All steps of immunohistochemistry were performed at room temperature. All mounted slides were stored at 4°C until they were imaged.</p><p>The following primary antibodies were used for the data described in this manuscript: guinea pig (gp)-α-Calbindin (1:1,000; SySy; #214004); rabbit (rb)-α-gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor α6 (GABARα6; 1:500; Millipore Sigma; #AB5610), rb-α-T-box brain protein 2 (Tbr2; 1:500; Abcam; #AB23345), mouse (ms)-α-Calretinin (1:500; Swant; #6B3); ms-α-Neurofilament Heavy (NFH; 1:1,000; Biolegend; #801701); rb-α-Hyperpolarization Activated Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Potassium Channel 1 (HCN1; 1:500; Alomone Lab; #APC-056); goat (gt)-α-RAR-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα; 1:250; Santa Cruz; #F2510); rb-α-parvalbumin (PV; 1:1,000; Swant; #PV25); rb-α-neurogranin (1:500; Millipore Sigma; #AB5620); ms-α-ZebrinII (1:500; kind gift from Dr. Richard Hawkes, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada); rb-α- PLCβ4 (1:150; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog #sc-20760); rb-α-Vglut1 (1:500; SySy; #135302); rb-α-Vglut2 (1:500; SySy; #135403).

P12 pups were anesthetized with isoflurane on a surgery rig. Hair was removed and an incision was made in the skin over the lower thoracic/upper lumbar spinal cord, using the curvature of the spine as a guide. We used a Nanoject II to inject 0.2–1 µl of 2% WGA-Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; #W32464) and 0.5% Fast Green (Sigma-Aldrich; #F7252, used for visualization) diluted in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldric; #P4417; pH 7.4). Tracer was injected 1 mm below the surface of the spinal cord, on the right side of the dorsal spinal vein. After tracer injection, we applied antibiotic ointment and closed the incision using VetBond (3M; #1469 SB) and wound clips (Fine Science Tools; #12032–07). Pups were placed back with the mom after waking up from anesthesia. We placed soft food and hydrogel on the cage floor and monitored behavior closely for whether the mom accepted the pups back into the litter.

Brains were dissected from the skulls and immediately emerged in the staining solution. After staining, tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 10 µm and directly mounted onto electrostatically coated glass slides. The tissue was then dehydrated in an ethanol series (70% → 90% → 100%), cleared with Xylene, and mounted with cytoseal.

Photomicrographs of Golgi-Cox stained tissue sections and WGA-Alexa 555 tracing were captured using Zeiss cameras AxioCam MRc5 and AxiaCam Mrm, respectively, attached to a Zeiss Axio Imager.M2 microscope. Whole mount images were stitched together using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems 2020) Photomerge function. Color brightness and contrast were adjusted using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).

This allowed us to have an unbiased tissue collection system that spanned the entire cerebellum. We then stained all tissue sections collected in a single well for anti-Tbr2 (unipolar brush cells) or anti-NFH (excitatory nuclei neurons and Purkinje cells) plus anti-Calbindin (Purkinje cells). Co-staining for NFH and Calbindin was necessary to distinguish between Purkinje cells (Calbindin<sup>+</sup> and NFH<sup>+</sup>) and excitatory nuclei cells (Calbindin<sup>-</sup> and NFH<sup>+</sup>) in primarily the conditional knockout mice, as nuclei neurons and Purkinje cells did not have clear anatomical segregation in these mice. After staining our tissue sections as described above, we imaged whole tissue sections at a magnification that allowed us to identify and count single cells. Images were merged together in photoshop and all Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells and NFH<sup>+</sup>/Calbindin<sup>-</sup> cells were counted in all tissue sections from a single animal in ImageJ. The final cell-count was multiplied by six (coronal) or eight (sagittal) to obtain an estimate of the total number of unipolar brush cells or excitatory nuclei cells for each animal. A t-test was performed to investigate whether there was a statistically significant difference between cell number in control and <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image quantification – Purkinje cell morphology analysis</title><p>Brightfield images of Golgi-Cox stains were imported into ImageJ and then converted into a binary image with brightness and contrast adjusted so that cellular processes were clearly visible. Then, Sholl analysis was performed using the build-in Sholl analysis module in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>) and false positive intersections were manually subtracted from the counts. Next, we used a Zeiss Laser Scanner confocal Microscope model 710 to take high-magnification Z-stacked images (0.2 μm). We imported the images to imageJ/Fiji and used the Simple Neurite Tracer plug-in to track the length of a stained dendrite. We manually counted the number of synaptic boutons along the dendrite and reported this number as a density per dendrite length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Image quantification – Vglut1 and Vglut2 density</title><p>We stained tissue sections obtained from P7 and P14 control and <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice with anti-Calbindin and anti-Vglut1 or Vglut2 antibodies as described above. Next, we imaged 3–5 tissue sections from three mice per age, per genotype. We imported tissue sections into ImageJ and defined our area of interest as the area of the image where Vglut1<sup>+</sup> and Vglut2<sup>+</sup> synapses could directly innervate Purkinje cells. This included the molecular and Purkinje cell layers in control tissue and the area occupied by Purkinje cell bodies in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> tissue; both were identified as the area of the image positive for the Calbindin signal. We adjusted the brightness and contrast in the Vglut1 or Vglut2 channels so that individual synapses were visible and then transformed the image into a binary (black and white) image using the Threshold function in ImageJ. We quantified the percentage of area of interest covered by Vglut1 or Vglut2 synapses using the Analyze Particles tool in ImageJ. We also manually counted the number of Purkinje cells that received direct Vglut2<sup>+</sup> inputs on their somas. Finally, we averaged the values of the area covered by Vglut1<sup>+</sup> or Vglut2<sup>+</sup> synapses across all tissue sections (n=3–5) per animal (N=3) and performed a two-way ANOVA (genotype*age) followed by a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis to identify the statistical significance of observed differences in the density of Vglut1<sup>+</sup> and Vglut2<sup>+</sup> synapses in mice of different genotypes and ages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>All in vivo, anesthetized experiments were performed as described in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arancillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">White and Sillitoe, 2017</xref>). Specifically, we anesthetized mice using a mixture of ketamine 80 (mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (16 mg/kg). We held mice on a heated surgery pad. We removed hair from skull and made an incision in the skin over the anterior part of the skull. We stabilized the heads of our mice using ear bars and a mouth mount when animals were large enough (most P11-P14 mice) and otherwise fixed the mouse skull (P7-P10 mice) to a plastic mount that was attached to ear bars on our stereotaxic surgery rig to stabilize the head during recordings. Using a sharp needle or dental drill, we made a craniotomy in the interparietal bone plate, ~3 mm dorsal from lambda and ~3 mm lateral from the midline, with a diameter of ~3 mm. We kept our surgical coordinates consistent based on the distance from lambda across mice of all ages, as the skull undergoes significant growth during the ages at which we measured neural activity. After making a craniotomy, we recorded neural activity using tungsten electrodes (Thomas Recording, Germany) and then the digitized the signals into Spike2 (CED, England). We recorded neural activity from cells that were 0–2 mm below the brain surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of in vivo electrophysiological recordings</title><p>All electrophysiological recording data were spike sorted in Spike2. We sorted out three types of spikes: simple spikes, complex spikes, and doublets. Complex spikes were characterized by their large amplitude, and post-spike depolarization and smaller spikelets that follow. Doublets were characterized as action potentials that were followed by one or more smaller action potentials within 20 ms after the initial action potential. All other action potentials were characterized as simple spikes (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). We only included traces with clearly identifiable complex spikes or doublets and analyzed only cells from which we could obtain a sufficiently long and stable recording (186 ± 6.5 s; minimum = 75 s) with an optimal signal to noise ratio.</p><p>After spike sorting our traces in Spike 2, we analyzed the frequency and regularity of firing patterns in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, version R2018a). For this study, we defined ‘frequency’ as number of all spikes observed in the total analyzed recording time (spikes/s). We determined the ‘frequency mode’ by populating the inverse of all observed interspike intervals (ISI<sup>−1</sup>, representing the frequency of a single spike) into 2.5 Hz bins and defining the center of the bin with the largest proportion of spikes as the ‘frequency mode’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref> for examples). Pause Percent was the proportion of the recording time during which the ISI was longer than five times the mean ISI for each independent cell, defined as the following: (sum(ISI&gt;5*mean(ISI)))/(total recording time). Our measures of global regularity or burstiness (CV) and regularity (CV2) were based on the interspike intervals (ISI) between two adjacent spikes (in seconds). CV = stdev(ISI)/mean(ISI), and CV2 = mean(2*|ISI<sub>n</sub>-ISI<sub>n-1</sub>|/ (ISI<sub>n</sub>+ISI<sub>n-1</sub>)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Holt et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The rhythmicity index was based on oscillatory properties represented by the auto-correlogram of the ISI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L and M</xref> for examples) and based on previously described quantifications with minor adjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sugihara et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">White et al., 2016</xref>). The ‘rhythmicity index’ was calculated as the sum of the difference in peak and trough of the proportion of spikes at each delay from spike onset, divided by the baseline proportion of spikes. Baseline = (total spike number)<sup>2</sup>/(recording time/bin width). We used a bin width of 5 ms. The first peak of each oscillation was determined as the highest bin between 10 ms and 1.5 times the mean ISI for a given cell, and the time of the peak was denoted as a<sub>1</sub>. Each subsequent peak was determined as the highest bin between the delay-time of the previous trough and a<sub>n</sub>+a<sub>1</sub>+10 ms, where a<sub>n</sub> is the time of the previous peak. The first trough was determined as the lowest bin between the first peak (a<sub>1</sub>) and a<sub>n</sub>+a<sub>1</sub>. Peaks and troughs were only accepted if their sum was higher than four times the standard deviation of auto-correlation between 0.96 and 1 s lag-time, or if the peak was higher than baseline + two times the standard deviation and the trough was lower than baseline – two times the standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cluster and dimension reduction analysis on simple spikes</title><p>To investigate and visualize how firing patterns changed over time, we performed additional computational analysis of the firing properties of single neurons (n=179 neurons). We included the parameters summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in our analysis (frequency, frequency mode, pause percent, rhythmicity index, CV, and CV2). First, we performed an unbiased cluster analysis on the firing properties of single neurons using the MATLAB function ‘clusterogram,’ which previously allowed us to visualize genotype-specific changes in Purkinje cell firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">van der Heijden et al., 2021a</xref>). After analysis, we de-identified the cells and labelled them by age and genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we performed a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) dimension reduction analysis to visualize the relative similarities of firing patterns between cells using the MATLAB function ‘tsne’ based on Euclidean distance. We plotted tSNE component 1 and 2 against each other (tSNE(1) and tSNE(2)) and color-coded the coordinates based on age and genotype of the cell recording to generate an electrophysiological pseudotimeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, we used the MATLAB function ‘linkage’ on the first two components of the principal component analysis on the average firing properties per age and genotype group to define how the firing patterns of each group clustered together. We visualized this unbiased linkage analysis using the MATLAB function ‘dendrogram’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>Righting reflex was measured on P6, P8, and P10 as follows. The mouse was placed on its back in a clean cage without bedding. One finger was used to stabilize the mouse on its back. The timer was set the moment the experimenter removed their finger, and time was recorded until the mouse righted itself up onto its four paws. All mice were tested twice at each age. A ‘failed’ trial was defined as when the mouse did not right itself within one minute (sixty seconds).</p><p>At P7, we recorded pup vocalizations as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yin et al., 2018</xref>). Pups were placed in an anechoic, sound-attenuating chamber (Med Associates Inc). The pup was placed in a round plastic tub that was positioned near a CM16 microphone (Avisoft Bioacoustics) that was located in the center of the chamber. Sound was amplified and digitized using UltraSoundGate 416H at a 250 kHz sampling rate and bit depth of 16. Avisoft RECORDER software was used to collect the recordings. Ultrasonic vocalizations were monitored for 2 min for each animal.</p><p>We also performed an open-field assay at P13, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcott et al., 2020</xref>). Mice were habituated to a room with the light set to 200 lux and ambient white noise to 60 dB. We placed each mouse in the center of an open field (40x40x30 cm chamber). The chamber has photobeams that records movement. Each mouse was tested for 15 min and activity was recorded using Fusion software (Accuscan Instruments). We used the standard settings for movement segmentation. We analyzed the data for total distance traveled, movement time, speed, and total movements during the 15-min test period.</p><p>We measured tremor using our custom-built tremor monitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2020</xref>). Each mouse was placed in the tremor chamber, which is a translucent box with an open top that is suspended in the air by eight elastic cords that are attached to four metal rods. An accelerometer is attached to the bottom of the box. Mice were allowed to habituate to the chamber for 120 s prior to initiating the tremor recordings. The mice are free to move around in the box. Power spectra of the tremor recordings were assessed using Fast Fourier transform (FFT) with a Hanning window in Spike2 software as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2020</xref>). FFT frequency was targeted to ~1 Hz per bin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB. For the Purkinje cell morphology data, we performed a linear mix-model analysis with genotype as the fixed variable and mouse number as the random variable and accepted p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant. For Vglut1/2 quantification, we averaged measurements from three to five tissue sections per mouse and performed a two-way ANOVA (genotype*age) followed by a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis to define statistical significance between independent groups. For electrophysiology data (frequency (complex spikes and simple spikes), frequency mode, pause percent, rhythmicity index, CV, CV2, and doublet frequency), analysis was performed using an ANOVA with six total groups (four control groups, two mutant groups), followed by a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. For behavioral data, we performed a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test to define significance between independent groups. For these tests, we accepted p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), Texas Children’s Hospital, The Hamill Foundation, and the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) R01NS089664, R01NS100874, and R01NS119301 to RVS.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Maturation of Purkinje cell firing properties relies on granule cell neurogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers appreciate the authors for collecting this data set recording the various effects of loss of granule cells on Purkinje cells and motor behaviors. However, reviewers also pointed out several weaknesses in the manuscript. Primarily, the manuscript feels like a collection of unrelated observations as no clear causal link is established between the various cellular/behavioral phenotypes. Secondly, some of the phenotypes reported have also been seen in other models of agranularity and the results presented are along expected lines, taking away from the novelty of their study. Thirdly, several of the claims need stronger support and quantification with accompanying statistical testing. Please see the individual reviews appended below for more detail on these comments. We grappled with whether we could consider a revision that addressed these concerns. In the event, they are rather substantive and attending to them will take time and experimental effort, This will not be feasible in the time we usually expect. Should the authors be able to address all concerns fully, they may want to consider a fresh submission to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Sillitoe and colleagues use a novel conditional knockout mouse line to ask how the absence of granule cells affects Purkinje neuron development and function. By knocking out the Atoh1 gene in the Engrailed1 lineage, they generate mice that are 'agranular' – i.e. lacking cerebellar granule cells. This mouse has previously been studied by two of the authors with respect to respiratory networks (van der Heijden and Zoghbi, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2018) where also they report the loss of granule cells. The main focus of this paper is the effect of agranularity on Purkinje cells and motor behaviors.</p><p>Using immunohistochemistry, authors show that Purkinje neurons are present, but have stunted dendritic arbors and lack clear organization into ZebrinII stripes as compared to controls. They also seem to receive more vGluT2 positive synapses (presumably from mossy fibers and climbing fibers), while lacking the vGluT1 positive parallel fiber synapses. Next authors record extracellularly from Purkinje cells of control mice during the first two post-natal weeks and from the agranular mice at P14. Purkinje neurons show a less bursty and irregular simple spike firing pattern in the agranular mice compared to control, which seems to be similar to the immature activity pattern seen at P8. Complex spikes are also less frequent. Finally authors show that the agranular mice exhibit several severe motor deficits including deficits in righting reflex, ultrasonic vocalizations and the presence of tremor.</p><p>These results, documenting severe impact on Purkinje neuron development, physiology and behavior are in contrast to earlier studies which showed mild effects on Purkinje neuron physiology after acute silencing of granule cell input. Thus the authors argue that the developmental presence of granule cells is more important in sculpting the Purkinje cell layer rather than just the excitatory synaptic input they provide.</p><p>While these ideas are compelling, I was left somewhat disappointed by this paper as there aren't any clear threads emerging from the various lines of investigation, nor are there links that connect them directly. What is the connection between data presented in figures 2,3 and 4? It is unclear which of these deficits reported in these figures are a direct result of not having granule cells and which are due to secondary effects arising out of compensatory and/or other pathways that may be affected. For instance, with granule cells being absent, feed forward inhibition in the molecular layer is also likely to be affected. With the behavioral readouts, effect of the mutations on extracerebellar structures cannot be ruled out either.</p><p>Another point is that it is also not clear whether any or all of these changes are merely a delay in development and whether they persist into adulthood. The authors should consider repeating some of their assays in the adults.</p><p>Figure 2 needs quantitative measures, especially with statements about the density of synapses. The argument that the increased vGlut2 synapses could be from retained mossy fibers is not investigated further, but needs to be.</p><p>For figure 3, there are a number of methods available to better estimate the regularity of neural activity, such as looking at power spectral density. Peak frequency and power at that frequency should be estimated for controls and mutants.</p><p>Are granule cells completely absent? The staining in Figure supplement 1A for the mutants appears weak and diffuse, such as would be seen if some granule cells were indeed present, but not organized into a layer. Authors should consider using another marker to show the agranularity as this is a major point of their paper. Likewise quantifications are necessary for making points such as &quot;reduced number of UBCs&quot;. Are the numbers of Purkinje cells normal?</p><p>The discussion tries to place the study in the context of cerebellar pathologies in pre-term infants however, some of the statements are very strong and need to be toned down (such as that in lines 255-258). Authors should also try to address how they think the agranular state is influencing the properties of Purkinje neurons as described in the figures. In addition they should clearly state how the different results are related or not. Authors mention seeing lower number of complex spikes in mutants, but what they think this means is not discussed at all. Same goes for the doublets and for the zebrin stripes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by van der Heijden et al. presents an interesting and thorough analysis of the cerebellar deficits in a novel mouse model, in which the transcription factor Atoh1 is conditionally deleted in Engrailed 1-expressing cells. Given what we know about cerebellar development and the consequences of disrupting this complex process from previous mouse models, the results of the study were largely to be expected. However, as the authors elegantly demonstrate, their new model is highly specific and reproducible and allows the interrogation of effects mostly specific to granule cell neurogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this article, van der Heijden et al. use mouse genetics to generate a model in which the transcription factor Atoh1 is deleted from the En1 domain and the cerebellum lacks granule cells. They analyze the consequences on cerebellar development, Purkinje cell firing properties and mouse behavior. They conclude that &quot;granule cell neurogenesis sets the maturation time window for Purkinje cell function and refines cerebellar-dependent behavior.&quot; The mouse model generated by the authors provides a controlled way to generate agranular mutants and its analysis can provide new information on the mechanisms controlling the development of the cerebellar circuit. The morphological and behavior analysis confirms observations and conclusions made previously by several other groups through comparisons of different agranular models. The role of granule cells in the maturation of PC firing properties is an interesting new observation that deserves to be documented. However more work is needed to confirm that the phenotype is a blockade of maturation and to determine how granule cells control the development of this property.</p><p>1. The first conclusion of the manuscript is that lack of granule cells due to deletion of Atoh1 in the En1 domain leads to abnormal cerebellar development, Purkinje cell dendritic differentiation and circuit defects. While figure 1 clearly illustrates the major effect on cerebellar morphogenesis, the effects on the different neuronal populations deserves better documentation. The results of some of the immunostainings are not sufficient to document the lack of neurons (for example GABA-Ra6 or HCN1), and quantifications of the effects on cell numbers are not provided. In particular since unipolar brush cells are affected by the mutation, the effect should be quantified. The result on cerebellar development and Purkinje cell differentiation and connectivity is expected from previous research using x-irradiation and genetic mutants (these need to be cited in the Van der Heijden manuscript). Pan et al. (Cell Tissue Res (2009) 337:407-428) have shown that lack of granule cell death (induced by NeuroD1 knockout in the Atoh1 lineage) leads to defects in PC dendritogenesis and deficient mossy fiber targeting. Granule cell depletion using X-irradiation during early postnatal development in the rat has shown in addition defects in climbing fiber and mossy fiber connectivity both by electrophysiological and morphological analysis (cf. not only the cited reference Altman and Anderson 1971, but also for example Puro and Woodward 1978, Crepel and Delhaye-Bouchaud 1979, Arsenio Nunes et al. 1988).</p><p>2. The second conclusion of the manuscript is that lack of granule cells blocks the maturation of Purkinje cell firing. The result is interesting: the Purkinje cell firing properties are not similar to controls at two weeks and resemble those that are found in controls at the end of the first postnatal week. However a major issue is that measurements of PC firing were done only at P14 in the mutant and compared to several ages in controls (cf. figure 3). This leads to a problem in interpretation : is the phenotype really the result of blockade of maturation?</p><p>3. The third conclusion of the manuscript is that cerebellum dependent behaviors are deficient in these agranular mutants. Given the morphological and circuit phenotype, this is expected. The authors argue that &quot;the contribution of the cerebellum to these behaviors is established before circuit rewiring is completed&quot; to justify their analysis. However, what they mean by this is unclear and references to support this affirmation are not provided.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Maturation of Purkinje cell firing properties relies on neurogenesis of excitatory neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The revised version of this manuscript includes new quantification and analysis and is a significant improvement. But, there are several points that remain to be clarified in the text or addressed with experiments and analysis. Please see the reviews below for a detailed description of these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, authors generate mice lacking cerebellar granule cells using intersectional genetics and analyze the phenotype of these mice at the anatomical, physiological and behavioral levels. The major findings are that Purkinje neuron morphological and physiological development is impaired when granule cells are absent. In addition, motor coordination and ultrasonic vocalizations are also affected. These deficits are much more severe than the effects observed after acute silencing of granule cells in other studies. Thus, in addition to the synaptic influence of granule cells, their developmental presence at the correct stages seems to be critical for proper Purkinje cell development.</p><p>The manuscript is a significant improvement over the previous version that was submitted last year. Several results have now been properly quantified and add to the weight of their arguments. Nevertheless, some key points remain to be addressed:</p><p>1. The key result that the entire paper rests on is the agranular state of the En1Cre/+;Atoh1fl/- mice. The authors acknowledge that some granule cells and UBCs may escape and be present. The only data to show a lack of granule cells is the GABARa6 staining shown in Supp Figure 1-1A. As pointed out in the earlier review, given the criticality of knowing the extent of agranularity, authors should provide additional substantiation of this result. The ISH does not clarify whether the lower level of staining seen is non-specific background or remaining granule cells. This point needs to be clarified thoroughly. When the authors mention that there are escapees, how many cells do they see per animal?</p><p>2. Another point regarding genetic intervention is whether brain areas other than the cerebellum are affected. This is especially critical for understanding the basis of the behavioral phenotypes observed. Images showing ventricles and nuclear staining in key brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, etc) will help sort out this issue.</p><p>3. The authors claim that PCs in mutants are not bursty while those in controls at P14 are. The representative traces also show this clearly. Nevertheless, all of the analysis done is on spike regularity and do not reflect burstiness. The pause percent could reflect burstiness, but it will also depend on baseline firing rates, which are lower for the mutant. The autocorrelogram shows spike regularity within a +/- 100 ms window while the burst intervals are much longer and therefore are likely not reflected in the peaks of the autocorrelogram. The authors should consider Fourier analysis and show a heatmap power spectrum reflecting the various frequency bands found in PCs of P14 animals.</p><p>4. The authors' claims regarding Vglut1 and Vglut2 positive terminals onto PCs need more bolstering. Regarding Vglut1, the images shown in Figure 4 show diffuse weak staining of Vglut1 puncta. Can we rule out the existence of more widespread Vlglut1 synapses from escapee GCs and mossy fibers? In line 254, the authors state, &quot;Taken together, we show that without excitatory cerebellar neurons, Purkinje cells do not acquire a large number of excitatory synapses during the second postnatal week.&quot; I do not believe that such a statement can be made based on these data on Vglut1 staining alone. To be able to say this, either mEPSC recordings or quantification of PF synapses using GFP positive lines must be done.</p><p>Similarly, for the Vglut2 staining, the authors state in line 368, &quot;These data show that the rRL-derived excitatory cerebellar neurons are necessary for shaping the regional localization and cellular targeting of climbing fiber afferents that project from the inferior olive to the Purkinje cells.&quot; However, since Vglut2 is also present in mossy fibers, and it is not clear if the increased staining arises from an increased number of CFs projecting to single PCs, this is a strong interpretation of the results. For both vglut1 and vglut2 staining data, without additional experiments, effects on numbers or placement of CF/PF synapses cannot be unequivocally concluded.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have fully addressed my comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a smart genetic design to generate mice with agranular cerebella in a very reproducible manner and will be of interest to the field of cerebellar development. This mouse mutant recapitulates many previously described phenotypes for agranular mutants. A detailed in vivo analysis shows that Purkinje cells do not acquire mature firing properties, indicating a contribution of excitatory inputs to their development.</p><p>The manuscript from van der Heijden et al. describes the analysis of mice with an invalidation of the Atoh1 gene in the Engrailed 1 domain (mesencephalon and rhombomere 1) generated by breeding En1Cre mice with Atoh1Flox mice (En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup>). This should result in the invalidation of Atoh1 in excitatory neurons generated by the rostral rhombic lip, and thus impair the generation of cerebellar granule cells. The authors use a broad range of techniques to provide a thorough analysis of the phenotype of these mice at the morphological, functional and behavioral levels.</p><p>Using immunolabeling with different cellular markers and quantification for some of the cell types, the authors demonstrate that indeed the majority of cerebellar granule cells are not generated and that the number of unipolar brush cells and excitatory cerebellar nuclei neurons is significantly decreased. The dendritogenesis of cerebellar PCs, as well as excitatory synapse formation on these neurons, are profoundly affected. These mutant mice display behavioral deficits: tremor, motor deficits and alterations of the pattern of ultrasonic vocalizations.</p><p>The main novelty is in the analysis of PC activity during postnatal development. The authors perform a detailed analysis during the 3 first postnatal weeks in control mice and analyze the properties of mutant PCs at P14 and P18. They show that during the second postnatal week a change occurs in the spontaneous activity of PCs in control mice. In En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup> mutants the properties of PCs at P14 and P18 more closely resemble those of Purkinje cells in control mice until P10. The authors thus propose that the switch in Purkinje cell activity is under the control of excitatory neurons in the cerebellum, and most likely granule cells.</p><p>1. The manuscript should clearly mention the fact that many of the phenotypes found in the En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup> mutants have already been described in other agranular models. While those models are less specific (genetic mutants) or less controlled (x-irradiation in neonates), their study has nonetheless led to similar findings. For example, in the X-irradiation model, the consequences have been described for PC dendritic development (cf. for review Sotelo and Dusart 2009); for circuit and synaptic maturation (multi-innervation by climbing fibers for example in Woodward, Hoffer and Altman, 1974 and Crepel, Delhaye-Bouchaud and Dupont 1981), ataxic behavior and tremor (Woodward, Hoffer and Altman, 1974) and Purkinje cell activity (also Woodward, Hoffer and Altman 1974). The similarities and differences between the phenotypes described in these papers and those in the van der Heijden manuscript should be discussed.</p><p>2. The mutant mice are called En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>/Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup> and the analysis is done by comparing to &quot;control&quot; mice in all the manuscript except in figure 9 where 3 different controls are used in the behavioral analysis. How were the mutants generated? Is there a cross with an Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup>(not mentioned in the methods)? What genotype is &quot;control&quot; mice in the manuscript?</p><p>3. The authors describe that there is a change in PC spiking during the second postnatal week in controls and that mutant PCs do not acquire the characteristics of control PCs. The study of the developmental pattern of PC spontaneous firing in vivo adds to previously obtained results by the team (Arancillo et al; 2015) and others (Crepel, 1972). The analysis done by van der Heijden et al. is detailed and measures many parameters. Their data confirm the observation of a switch during the second postnatal week (Crepel 1972 should be cited, in particular line 260). However, in figure 5, no statistical test is performed to determine which data points are significantly different between the different control stages analyzed. The use of clustering and t-SNE analysis is helpful and defines two broad stages: until P10 and after. But there seem to be a large heterogeneity amongst Purkinje cells at each postnatal day, and it is not exactly clear what drives this heterogeneity.</p><p>4. For the mutant PCs, the authors state that &quot;this developmental switch does not occur by P14 in En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup>mice&quot;. I do not think this can be stated since there is no data on the mutant PCs during the first postnatal week. It could be that the PCs in the agranular cerebellum never behave like control ones. The authors should record from PCs in the mutant at P7 if they want to state that the phenotype is due to the non-occurrence of a developmental switch.</p><p>5. There is sometimes confusion between intrinsic spiking properties and spontaneous spiking in Purkinje cells. For example, line 82 in Sathyanesan et al. 2018, the authors study spontaneous and evoked firing properties of PCs, not intrinsic properties. In the discussion, it is not very clear to me what the authors mean by &quot;In addition to the increased complexity of intrinsic cellular properties (McKay and Turner, 2005), we postulated that intercellular interactions during development may support the maturation of Purkinje cell firing&quot;(line 532/533). Could actually granule cells change the intrinsic spiking properties of PCs ? Slice recordings would be helpful to study this.</p><p>6. Line 358: There is a switch between Vglut2 and vglut1 at Parallel fiber PC synapses during development (cf. Miyazaki EJN 2003). The decrease in VGLUT2 puncta density observed in the molecular layer is most likely due to this switch rather that CF synaptic pruning. It is thus difficult to interpret the result in panel 7C.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Maturation of Purkinje cell firing properties relies on neurogenesis of excitatory neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

If I understand well the explanation about the control mice, the controls are either Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup>, En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup> or Atoh1<sup>fl/FlpO</sup> and the data are grouped together except in the behavioral analysis. This should be stated clearly not only in the methods section, but at the beginning of the Results section (line 138 and line 146), as it is important for the interpretation of the results (some of the variability in the &quot;control&quot; data could be due to the difference in genotype). As it is, the description is misleading. How was the Atoh1FlpO line characterized (I can only find genotyping data in a previous paper)? Is there any data showing that the three control genotypes are not different from each other and from wild-type animals?</p><p>2. Result section page 10 lines 342 to 345: Crepel had described in 1972 (Experimental Brain Research) in vivo recordings of Purkinje cell activity in rat neonates and showed increased frequency with maturation (see figure 1 of that paper). The Crepel paper should be cited in this part of the result section, as well as in the discussion page 19. Line 343, the Beekhof et al. article describes not only in vitro but also in vivo recordings of Purkinje cell activity. The sentence as it is in line 343 is misleading.</p><p>3. The last paragraph of the discussion should be simplified. Granule cells influence the maturation of Purkinje cell spiking (line 728-729), but also many other parameters of Purkinje cell development and maturation, as described in this manuscript but also previous data on agranular models. As the relationship between the different deficits is difficult to disentangle, this part of the discussion should be toned down (line 728 for example &quot;direct influence&quot;).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68045.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

What is the connection between data presented in figures 2,3 and 4?</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we have clarified the connections between the cellular anatomy and electrophysiology data as well as network-level behavioral abnormalities by focusing on the changes that occur between P7 and P14. In control animals, there are highly dynamic changes in cerebellar size (figure 1), density in Vglut1 and Vglut2 synapses (figure 4 and 7), and, as reported before, electrophysiological properties in Purkinje cells (figure 5, 6, and 8). None of these changes occur in our agranular mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear which of these deficits reported in these figures are a direct result of not having granule cells and which are due to secondary effects arising out of compensatory and/or other pathways that may be affected.

With the behavioral readouts, effect of the mutations on extracerebellar structures cannot be ruled out either.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the lack of granule cells has additional, secondary effects. We have included a paragraph in our discussion outlining the caveats of our model (Line 451-474) and the considerations that readers should take when interpreting the behavioral data (Line 499-547). Thus, we present the strengths and new information that our model has provided, but we now also provide a more balanced assessment of the data and interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another point is that it is also not clear whether any or all of these changes are merely a delay in development and whether they persist into adulthood.

Unfortunately, our mouse model does not survive post weaning age, likely due to a combination of breathing impairments and severe motor impairments (see Van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018). However, we have addressed this issue by performing additional experiments. In lieu of performing additional recordings in adult mice, therefore, we have provided additional analysis to show that in control animals there is a striking functional switch in Purkinje cell function that does not occur in the same ages of our mutant mice (Figure 6). The temporal coincidence of this switch, with rearrangement of synapses at the peak of granule cell integration, further suggests that this maturation is driven by granule cells entering the circuit, which never occurs in the agranular mice. Additionally, we recorded from P18 conditional knockout and control mice. By this time point, the functional switch has still not occurred. These data are included in Figure 6 – supplement 1. Again, we could not reliably record from mice older than P18 as the health of the mutants rapidly declines towards the time of death, which happens consistently within one to three days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 needs quantitative measures, especially with statements about the density of synapses.

We have now quantified the density of Vglut1 and Vlgut2 synapses and have adjusted our text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For figure 3, there are a number of methods available to better estimate the regularity of neural activity, such as looking at power spectral density.

We decided to include a second measure of regularity by calculating the rhythmicity index, which is computed by the oscillation properties of the autocorrelation simple spikes in our Purkinje cells. High oscillatory properties in the autocorrelation means highly rhythmic/regular firing patterns, thus a high rhythmicity index is means high regularity. This computation is included in Figure 5I-K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are granule cells completely absent? The staining in Figure supplement 1A for the mutants appears weak and diffuse, such as would be seen if some granule cells were indeed present, but not organized into a layer.

Likewise quantifications are necessary for making points such as &quot;reduced number of UBCs&quot;.

It is likely that the number of Purkinje cells is reduced, as we have discussed in Lines 469-474.

The first conclusion of the manuscript is that lack of granule cells due to deletion of Atoh1 in the En1 domain leads to abnormal cerebellar development, Purkinje cell dendritic differentiation and circuit defects. While figure 1 clearly illustrates the major effect on cerebellar morphogenesis, the effects on the different neuronal populations deserves better documentation. The results of some of the immunostainings are not sufficient to document the lack of neurons (for example GABA-Ra6 or HCN1), and quantifications of the effects on cell numbers are not provided. In particular since unipolar brush cells are affected by the mutation, the effect should be quantified. The result on cerebellar development and Purkinje cell differentiation and connectivity is expected from previous research using x-irradiation and genetic mutants (these need to be cited in the Van der Heijden manuscript). Pan et al. (Cell Tissue Res (2009) 337:407-428) have shown that lack of granule cell death (induced by NeuroD1 knockout in the Atoh1 lineage) leads to defects in PC dendritogenesis and deficient mossy fiber targeting. Granule cell depletion using X-irradiation during early postnatal development in the rat has shown in addition defects in climbing fiber and mossy fiber connectivity both by electrophysiological and morphological analysis (cf. not only the cited reference Altman and Anderson 1971, but also for example Puro and Woodward 1978, Crepel and Delhaye-Bouchaud 1979, Arsenio Nunes et al. 1988).</p></disp-quote><p>We now quantified the number of unipolar brush cell, excitatory nuclei cells, and Vglut1/2 density. Please also see our responses above to Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2.</p><p>We appreciate that this reviewer recognizes that our mouse model recapitulates many aspects of previously reported agranular mice. This was the intention of some of our experiments, as we needed to validate our <italic>new</italic> model for cerebellar agranularity. We specifically choose this model of agranularity because it was reliable, independent of experimental variability, and independent of genes expressed in Purkinje cells. The last was specifically important because we wanted to exclude the possibility that our results were confounded by Purkinje cell autonomous effects. The fact that many of the anatomical findings are similar to those reported in other models of agranularity, underscores the effectiveness of our new genetic approach. We have now included more references to previous models of agranularity to highlight the similarities to our new models. Specifically, we have added the excellent references the reviewer has suggested – thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The second conclusion of the manuscript is that lack of granule cells blocks the maturation of Purkinje cell firing. The result is interesting: the Purkinje cell firing properties are not similar to controls at two weeks and resemble those that are found in controls at the end of the first postnatal week. However a major issue is that measurements of PC firing were done only at P14 in the mutant and compared to several ages in controls (cf. figure 3). This leads to a problem in interpretation : is the phenotype really the result of blockade of maturation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and one that was also raised by Reviewer #1 above. We noted above that unfortunately, our mouse model does not survive post weaning age, likely due to a combination of breathing impairments and severe motor impairments (see Van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018).

The third conclusion of the manuscript is that cerebellum dependent behaviors are deficient in these agranular mutants. Given the morphological and circuit phenotype, this is expected. The authors argue that &quot;the contribution of the cerebellum to these behaviors is established before circuit rewiring is completed&quot; to justify their analysis. However, what they mean by this is unclear and references to support this affirmation are not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a more in-depth discussion of our findings in the behavioral essays in our discussion:</p><p>“The behavioral abnormalities in <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup></italic> mice are likely caused by a combined effect of Purkinje cell dysfunction and a reduction of excitatory neurons in the cerebellar nuclei.

When the authors mention that there are escapees, how many cells do they see per animal?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we decided to employ a genetic strategy to circumvent the potential ISH issues, as pointed out by the reviewer. In our genetic strategy, we marked all <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage neurons with TdTomato using an intersectional allele (see Supp. Figure 1-3). In this method, the marker signal of granule cells in the granule cell layer of control animals is near saturation (which was fully expected), due the density of their cell bodies (99.6% ± 0.4% of the area of interest measured is occupied by the TdTomato signal). However, we were able to distinguish individual TdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons in the conditional knockout mice and estimated that ~65 thousand neurons escaped our genetic manipulation. This is an approximate thousand-fold reduction in neurons compared to what has previously been reported for control animals in the literature (between 35 and 70 million neurons using density estimations or isotropic fractionation (Vogel et al. 1989; Herculano-Houzel et al. 2006; Surchev et al. 2007; Consalez et al. 2020)).</p><p>We now provide several lines of evidence that all indicate and describe the significant reduction of granule cells in our conditional knockout mice:</p><p>1) The total number of <italic>Atoh1;En1</italic> lineage neurons that are left in the mutant is in the range of tens of thousands of cells (versus tens of millions reported in the literature for control animals).</p><p>2) There is a nearly 50-fold reduction in cerebellar size (10X in sagittal plane, 5X in coronal plane), and the cerebellum does not have a visible granule cell layer or obvious cerebellar foliation. These morphological phenotypes encompass the most experimentally consistent and profound cerebellar malformations as a result of granule cell agenesis, and together culminate into a severe phenotype compared to previously reported manipulations. (X-irradiated rats: small cerebellar size, thin GCL (Zanjani et al. 1992; Armstrong and Hawkes 2001); <italic>staggerer</italic> and <italic>weaver</italic> mice: small cerebellar size, thin GCL, less foliation (Zanjani et al. 1992; Armstrong and Hawkes 2001); <italic>reeler</italic> and <italic>scrambler</italic> mice: small cerebellar size, thin GCL, no foliation (Goldowitz et al. 1997); <italic>Atoh1</italic> chimera mice: small cerebellar size, thin/no GCL, less/no foliation (phenotype is variable depending on degree of chimerism) (Jensen et al. 2004)). Our mutants exhibit each of these phenotypes, but with increased severity.</p><p>3) The total density of Vglut1 signal is reduced 9-fold in the mutant mice (Figure 4). However, this number does not only account for the total escaper granule cells because the density analysis does not distinguish the granule cell parallel fiber synapses from either Vglut1 expression in mossy fibers or escaper UBCs, and in addition this estimate does not account for the overall size difference of the cerebellum.</p><p>4) Purkinje cell monolayer formation and the establishment of mature stripe/zonal patterns do not occur (Figure 1 and 2).</p><p>5) VGluT2<sup>+</sup> climbing fibers and/or mossy fiber synapse displacement from the Purkinje cell bodies is severely impaired (Figure 2 and 7).</p><p>Based on these different but complementary lines of evidence, we conclude that our genetic model of agranularity significantly reduces granule cell neurogenesis to ultimately result in the cerebellum having only a fraction of differentiated granule cells. The manipulation therefore massively obstructs but does not completely eliminate granule cell neurogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another point regarding genetic intervention is whether brain areas other than the cerebellum are affected. This is especially critical for understanding the basis of the behavioral phenotypes observed. Images showing ventricles and nuclear staining in key brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, etc) will help sort out this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We have generated a new supplemental Figure (Supp Figure 1-1 A-B) showing that the overt gross morphological changes only occur in the cerebellum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors claim that PCs in mutants are not bursty while those in controls at P14 are. The representative traces also show this clearly. Nevertheless, all of the analysis done is on spike regularity and do not reflect burstiness. The pause percent could reflect burstiness, but it will also depend on baseline firing rates, which are lower for the mutant. The autocorrelogram shows spike regularity within a +/- 100 ms window while the burst intervals are much longer and therefore are likely not reflected in the peaks of the autocorrelogram. The authors should consider Fourier analysis and show a heatmap power spectrum reflecting the various frequency bands found in PCs of P14 animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for creating confusion in our descriptions of the “burstiness” in the parameters quantified in Figure 5. We refer to “bursty” cells as cells that have many high-frequency (short inter-spike interval (ISI)) spikes occurring in bursts that are interspersed by a few low frequency (long ISI) pauses. The vast majority of the spike trains thus have a short ISI, whereas a small proportion in our cells have a very long ISI. The reviewer is correct that these bursts are not reflected in the regularity within a +/- 1 s window (as is reflected in Figure 5L), because the bursts occur at a longer interval, have variable length, and only a small proportion of all the spikes have a very long ISI, despite their clear contribution to the burst. Therefore, we would not see a peak for the long ISI spikes in the auto correlogram even if we extended the time window beyond 1 s.</p><p>Our parameters define two types of irregularities: global and local. Global irregularity is caused by the occurrence of pauses and bursts (as in the Purkinje cells in P14 control mice). Local irregularity is caused by irregularity of inter spike intervals (as in the Purkinje cells of P14 mutant mice).</p><p>To examine the burstiness (or global irregularity in firing patterns) in our Purkinje cells we used a number of other parameters that are very effective for detecting global changes in neuronal firing patterns:</p><p>1. Frequency is calculated as the total number of spikes per second. Frequency mode (or preferred firing frequency) is calculated as the inverse of the most common ISI. We are able to detect the presence of “bursty” features because the presence of very long ISIs alters the relationship between Frequency and Frequency mode since the long ISIs reduce the average Frequency that is calculated over the entire duration of the recording. For example, the Purkinje cells in P13-14 control animals have an average Frequency of ~13.7 Hz, whereas the Frequency mode is ~26.2 Hz (nearly 2-fold difference). In contrast, in the P14 conditional knockout mice the Purkinje cell Frequency is ~4.35 Hz and the Frequency mode is ~5.25 Hz (about 1.2-fold difference). Therefore, Frequency-based relationships can reflect the pattern.</p><p>2. As the reviewer states, the pause proportion reflects burstiness. We defined a pause as an ISI that was five times as long as the most common ISI, to control for the differences in firing rate that the reviewer has mentioned. This calculation allowed us to measure the more reliable breaks in between spikes instead of long ISI that can happen in slowly firing neurons. If we would define the pause as an ISI of pre-set duration, it would miss pauses in fast-firing neurons or designate regularly occurring long ISI in slow firing neurons a pause. For example, in Purkinje cells in the P13-14 control animals have a pause proportion of ~0.35 whereas Purkinje cells in P14 conditional knockout mice have a pause proportion of ~0.14.</p><p>3. Finally, we included the CV. This parameter is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation and mean of the ISI. As mentioned before, in the bursty cells, there are a few ISI that are much longer than the most common ISI (namely the pauses). Thus, the range, and therefore the standard deviation, of ISIs in bursty cells is very large. By dividing this large standard deviation by the mean ISI we normalize this variability to the firing rate to give a proportional variation. As a result, a more bursty cell will have a higher CV. For example, in Purkinje cells in the P13-14 control animals the CV is ~4.0 whereas in P14 conditional knockout mice, Purkinje cells in have a CV of ~1.3.</p><p>Even though we find that Purkinje cells in the P13-14 control animals have more bursty firing patterns, we observe that the simple spikes <italic>within</italic> the burst are very rhythmic. This is the reason we also included measures of local spike irregularity namely, the rhythmicity index (low in irregular cells) and CV2 (high in irregular cells). We now define in the text that these are measures for local irregularity in firing patterns.</p><p>We liked the idea that this reviewer has raised. The suggestion was to show a heatmap of the various frequencies at which the cells fire. Unfortunately, performing a Fourier analysis on single cell in vivo recordings would not provide us with an easily interpretable heatmap. Even though our single cell recordings are continuous, the signal information in our continuous recording is binary; spike or no spike. As a result, the Fourier analysis would detect the sinusoidal shape of single spikes, but not the frequency at which these spikes occur. Performing a Fourier analysis on the frequency averaged over small time-windows (for example 1 s as is presented in Figure 5H and I) would not provide a satisfactory power frequency plot because the pauses and bursts occur at random intervals. Instead, to visualize a heatmap of various frequency bands, as the reviewer suggested, we included heatmaps of spike frequency distributions of all 149 cells included in Figure 5 and 6 as Figure 5 – supplement 1. In this figure, some cells show a second, small peak, at a lower frequency, which indicates pause-events (and therefore bursts). However, the firing frequency is much higher within the burst than within the pause (per definition) and the duration of the pause is not the same for each pause. Therefore, the relative proportion of spikes that occur at a low frequency is so small that this second peak in not visible for all cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors' claims regarding Vglut1 and Vglut2 positive terminals onto PCs need more bolstering. Regarding Vglut1, the images shown in Figure 4 show diffuse weak staining of Vglut1 puncta. Can we rule out the existence of more widespread Vlglut1 synapses from escapee GCs and mossy fibers? In line 254, the authors state, &quot;Taken together, we show that without excitatory cerebellar neurons, Purkinje cells do not acquire a large number of excitatory synapses during the second postnatal week.&quot; I do not believe that such a statement can be made based on these data on Vglut1 staining alone. To be able to say this, either mEPSC recordings or quantification of PF synapses using GFP positive lines must be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. It is an excellent suggestion to bolster our statement that the number of excitatory synapses on Purkinje cells is reduced. Therefore, to address this comment, we quantified the spine density on Golgi-Cox stained images of Purkinje cells from control and mutant cerebellar. These quantifications are now included in Figure 5D-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, for the Vglut2 staining, the authors state in line 368, &quot;These data show that the rRL-derived excitatory cerebellar neurons are necessary for shaping the regional localization and cellular targeting of climbing fiber afferents that project from the inferior olive to the Purkinje cells.&quot; However, since Vglut2 is also present in mossy fibers, and it is not clear if the increased staining arises from an increased number of CFs projecting to single PCs, this is a strong interpretation of the results. For both vglut1 and vglut2 staining data, without additional experiments, effects on numbers or placement of CF/PF synapses cannot be unequivocally concluded.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We reworded the cited sentence to include mossy fibers. The new sentence now reads:</p><p>“These data show that the <italic>En1;Atoh1</italic> lineage, excitatory cerebellar neurons are necessary for shaping the regional localization and cellular targeting of immature mossy fibers and climbing fiber afferents that project to the Purkinje cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1. The manuscript should clearly mention the fact that many of the phenotypes found in the En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup> mutants have already been described in other agranular models. While those models are less specific (genetic mutants) or less controlled (x-irradiation in neonates), their study has nonetheless led to similar findings. For example, in the X-irradiation model, the consequences have been described for PC dendritic development (cf. for review Sotelo and Dusart 2009); for circuit and synaptic maturation (multi-innervation by climbing fibers for example in Woodward, Hoffer and Altman, 1974 and Crepel, Delhaye-Bouchaud and Dupont 1981), ataxic behavior and tremor (Woodward, Hoffer and Altman, 1974) and Purkinje cell activity (also Woodward, Hoffer and Altman 1974).

The authors describe that there is a change in PC spiking during the second postnatal week in controls and that mutant PCs do not acquire the characteristics of control PCs. The study of the developmental pattern of PC spontaneous firing in vivo adds to previously obtained results by the team (Arancillo et al; 2015) and others (Crepel, 1972). The analysis done by van der Heijden et al. is detailed and measures many parameters. Their data confirm the observation of a switch during the second postnatal week (Crepel 1972 should be cited, in particular line 260). However, in figure 5, no statistical test is performed to determine which data points are significantly different between the different control stages analyzed. The use of clustering and t-SNE analysis is helpful and defines two broad stages: until P10 and after. But there seem to be a large heterogeneity amongst Purkinje cells at each postnatal day, and it is not exactly clear what drives this heterogeneity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. To attain the necessary power to make the statistical comparisons between all the age groups, we grouped together our data from P7-8, P9-10, P11-12, and the P13-14 mice. We next performed an ANOVA between all groups (4 control groups, 2 experimental groups) and did a post-hoc analysis to identify which groups have a statistically significant different from each other.</p><p>The use of clustering and t-SNE analysis is helpful and defines two broad stages: until P10 and after. But there seem to be a large heterogeneity amongst Purkinje cells at each postnatal day, and it is not exactly clear what drives this heterogeneity.</p><p>Heterogeneity in the maturation of anatomical properties have been reported previously (McKay and Turner, 2005; van Welie et al., 2011). Furthermore, it is known that adult Purkinje cells that are recorded in vivo in awake animals have a large degree of variability in their firing frequency and regularity (see for example our previous publications: Brown et al., 2020; Miterko et al., 2021; van der Heijden et al., 2021). Other groups have found that this heterogeneity can be in part attributed to the molecular identity (patterning) of Purkinje cells (Zebrin<sup>+</sup> vs. Zebrin<sup>-</sup> cells) (Zhou et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019). It was also recently reported that the patterned identity of Purkinje cells within specific zones arises according to the development of these patterns and ultimately contributes to the heterogeneity of Purkinje cell functional properties observed in adults (Beekhof et al., 2021). Taken together, the heterogeneity in Purkinje cell function is an expected observation. We address this point in the text as follows:</p><p>“This suggests the existence of a transformation that occurs between younger and older cells, but the transformation does not occur at the same time for all Purkinje cells, as is expected based on previous studies showing that the heterogeneity of Purkinje cell function is an inherent property of Purkinje cells that respects and spans the timelines of anatomical and functional development of Purkinje cells (Beekhof et al. 2021; van Welie et al. 2011; McKay and Turner 2005).”</p><p>Additionally, we account for the expected inter- and intra-animal heterogeneity of Purkinje cell development by recording from a large number of single neurons (10-20) and from multiple mice (3-7) on each of the 8 developmental days that fall within our analysis time-window (P7 to P14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For the mutant PCs, the authors state that &quot;this developmental switch does not occur by P14 in En1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Atoh1<sup>fl/-</sup>mice&quot;. I do not think this can be stated since there is no data on the mutant PCs during the first postnatal week. It could be that the PCs in the agranular cerebellum never behave like control ones. The authors should record from PCs in the mutant at P7 if they want to state that the phenotype is due to the non-occurrence of a developmental switch.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another excellent suggestion. We decided to perform additional recordings in P10 mutant mice. We choose this time point for several reasons:</p><p>1: Our mutant mice lack several excitatory pontine respiratory nuclei (Van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018), which makes them more sensitive to the respiratory repression that results from anesthetics such as ketamine, which we use in our studies for anesthetizing the mice during our recordings. In our experience, P10 mutant mice were more resilient to the anesthesia than P7 mutant mice. Using the P10 timepoint allowed us to record mice using the same dose as all other mice in the study, which ultimately helped us avoid having to change the anesthesia concentration, which would have been a confounding factor in our analysis.</p><p>2: The initial ANOVA results as described in the first part of this reviewer comment showed no statistically significant difference between P7 and P10 control mice.</p><p>3: Our clustering analysis showed that P14 experimental mice were most similar to P10 control mice (Figure 6D).</p><p>When we performed these experiments, we found that Purkinje cells in P10 mutant mice were not different from Purkinje cells in P14 mutant mice in any of the parameters included in our study, confirming our hypothesis that the developmental transformation that typically occurs at this stage does not occur in our mutant mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There is sometimes confusion between intrinsic spiking properties and spontaneous spiking in Purkinje cells. For example, line 82 in Sathyanesan et al. 2018, the authors study spontaneous and evoked firing properties of PCs, not intrinsic properties. In the discussion, it is not very clear to me what the authors mean by &quot;In addition to the increased complexity of intrinsic cellular properties (McKay and Turner, 2005), we postulated that intercellular interactions during development may support the maturation of Purkinje cell firing&quot;(line 532/533). Could actually granule cells change the intrinsic spiking properties of PCs ? Slice recordings would be helpful to study this.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We did not mean to draw too many conclusions with reference to intrinsic properties as our in vivo recordings did not measure such firing features. To avoid this confusion, we changed the wording from intrinsic to spontaneous. We have also toned down the extent of comparisons that we make to the previous slice physiology data from the Turner lab. We have now made the intent of our comparison clearer:</p><p>“In addition to the increased complexity of intrinsic cellular properties that have been defined using slice electrophysiology approaches (McKay and Turner 2005), we postulated using our in vivo recordings that intercellular interactions between granule cells and Purkinje cells during development may support the maturation of Purkinje cell firing properties, both by providing direct inputs and by supporting anatomical maturation, including the outgrowth of Purkinje cell dendrites.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 358: There is a switch between Vglut2 and vglut1 at Parallel fiber PC synapses during development (cf. Miyazaki EJN 2003). The decrease in VGLUT2 puncta density observed in the molecular layer is most likely due to this switch rather that CF synaptic pruning. It is thus difficult to interpret the result in panel 7C.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We included this citation in the text.

If I understand well the explanation about the control mice, the controls are either Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup>, En1Cre/+;Atoh1<sup>fl/+</sup> or Atoh1<sup>fl/FlpO</sup> and the data are grouped together except in the behavioral analysis. This should be stated clearly not only in the methods section, but at the beginning of the Results section (line 138 and line 146), as it is important for the interpretation of the results (some of the variability in the &quot;control&quot; data could be due to the difference in genotype).
