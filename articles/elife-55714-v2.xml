plasticity have been examined in many types of experimental studies, but a unified picture on how multiple biochemical pathways collectively shape neocortical plasticity is missing. We built a biochemically detailed model of post-synaptic plasticity describing CaMKII, PKA, and PKC pathways and their contribution to synaptic potentiation or depression. We developed a statistical AMPA-receptor-tetramer model, which permits the estimation of the AMPA-receptor-mediated maximal synaptic conductance based on numbers of GluR1s and GluR2s predicted by the biochemical signalling model. We show that our model reproduces neuromodulator-gated spike-timing-dependent plasticity as observed in the visual cortex and can be fit to data from many cortical areas, uncovering the biochemical contributions of the pathways pinpointed by the underlying experimental studies. Our model explains the dependence of different forms of plasticity on the availability of different proteins and can be used for the study of mental disorder-associated impairments of cortical plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LTP/LTD</kwd><kwd>biochemically detailed model</kwd><kwd>STDP</kwd><kwd>intracellular signalling cascade</kwd><kwd>calcium signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>248828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäki-Marttunen</surname><given-names>Tuomo</given-names></name><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Andrew G</given-names></name><name><surname>Einevoll</surname><given-names>Gaute T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>785907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Einevoll</surname><given-names>Gaute T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemically detailed modelling of pathways leading to post-synaptic plasticity reveals the dependence of neocortical LTP/LTD on the availability of different proteins and stimulation patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic plasticity in the neocortex has been under intense research since the first observations of neocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Komatsu et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee, 1982</xref>). Although most often studied in brain slices, synaptic plasticity in the neocortex is a key phenomenon underlying vital mammalian brain processes ranging from formation and storage of memories to attentional selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roelfsema and Holtmaat, 2018</xref>). These processes are impaired in heritable mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and fragile X syndrome, as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, all of which have been associated with deficits in cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kantrowitz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Martin and Huntsman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2014</xref>). Improved understanding of neocortical synaptic plasticity all the way from molecular to circuit level is therefore needed to further our understanding of these yet incurable diseases.</p><p>Similar to hippocampal synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Larkman and Jack, 1995</xref>), synaptic plasticity in the neocortex is highly variable — the outcomes of any plasticity-inducing protocol depends on the cortical area, neuron type as well as details of the stimulation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castro-Alamancos et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Froc and Racine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sjöström et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feldman, 2009</xref>). Computational models provide a tool for efficient hypothesis testing of mechanisms of neocortical plasticity, which helps to overcome the challenges posed by excessive variability. The foundations of our mechanistic understanding of neocortical synaptic plasticity lie upon the phenomenological Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) theory, which predicts that small synaptic activity (later attributed to small Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bear et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lisman, 1989</xref>]) cause long-term depression (LTD) whereas large synaptic activity (large Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients) give rise to LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bienenstock et al., 1982</xref>). Simple BCM-based models and the closely related models of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have been widely used to explain the emergence of input-specific cell assemblies mediating, e.g., orientation selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shouval et al., 1997</xref>) or memory traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klampfl and Maass, 2013</xref>) in the cortex. These models, however, typically fail to provide a mechanistic understanding of the biochemistry within the synapse — namely, they do not reveal how various molecules downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulate the induction and maintenance of plasticity occurring in neuronal circuits, their composite neurons and synapses of the cortex. Moreover, current models often ignore the joint contributions of neuromodulators, which are critical for inducing some forms of cortical synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meunier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brzosko et al., 2019</xref>). These shortcomings impede testing biochemical mechanisms of heritable mental illnesses associated with impaired cortical plasticity.</p><p>In this work, we aim at filling this gap of knowledge by introducing a biochemically detailed, mass-action law-based model of neocortical post-synaptic plasticity that can be used to study the induction of plasticity in different genetic conditions and neuromodulatory states, and under various stimulation protocols. Despite the lack of biochemically detailed models of synaptic plasticity in the neocortex, models of intracellular signalling have been used to study LTP and LTD in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>), cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gallimore et al., 2018</xref>), and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackwell et al., 2019</xref>). These models permit systematic studies on how patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs to the post-synaptic spine, either alone or in combination with neuromodulatory actions, activate different signalling pathways leading to post-synaptic plasticity in the form of, e.g., AMPA-receptor (AMPAR) phosphorylation and membrane insertion. We integrate quantitative descriptions of the intracellular signalling pathways underlying synaptic plasticity in the neocortex into a unified model that is capable of describing both stimulation protocol-dependent plasticity, as well as neocortically observed neuromodulator-gated forms of STDP. We show that our model can be tuned by alterations of protein expression to reproduce not only BCM-like forms of plasticity but also experimental observations on neocortical plasticity from various cortical areas. Our results help to quantify and explain the differences in molecular constituents of different forms of neocortical LTP and LTD, and the different, data-fitted versions of our model can be directly used to examine the effects of chemical inhibitors and genetic manipulations of signalling proteins on synaptic plasticity in different cortical cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model construction</title><p>We reviewed the literature of molecular signalling pathways that needed for neocortical LTP/LTD, in particular in the post-synaptic spine of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1A</xref>). Three main pathways were highlighted in the experimental studies, namely, the protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) pathways. To construct a computational model of cortical post-synaptic plasticity that describes these pathways, we adopted mass-action law-based descriptions of these pathways from biochemically detailed models of post-synaptic LTP/LTD in other brain areas, namely, hippocampus, basal ganglia and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1B</xref>). We prioritised the model components from hippocampal models due to the relatively small ontological differences between hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirsch and Chechik, 2016</xref>). We focused on the effects of these pathways on AMPARs due to the better description of intracellular regulation of AMPAR dynamics in comparison to that of NMDA and kainate receptors or voltage-gated ion channels. In short, we based our model on that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>, which describes the PKA- and CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit 1 (GluR1), and added the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor-mediated activation of PKC from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackwell et al., 2019</xref>, respectively. Other types of receptors that interact with these pathways, such as serotonin (5HT) and dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2015</xref>), have been shown to underlie certain types of neocortical plasticity. Dopamine D1/D5 receptors as well as serotonin 5HT4, 5HT6 and 5HT7 receptors are coupled to Gs proteins whereas 5HT2 receptors are Gq-coupled. The effects of these neurotransmitters would therefore be similar to those of norepinephrine and acetylcholine in our model (depending on the receptor composition in the post-synaptic neuron), and thus they are omitted in the present work. We then adopted the reactions describing PKC-dependent phosphorylation and endocytosis of AMPAR subunit 2 (GluR2) and reinsertion to the membrane from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gallimore et al., 2018</xref>, which allowed the representation of post-synaptic depression with our model. The pathways included in the model are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Both PKC pathway-mediating proteins PLC, diacylglycerol lipase (DGL), and PLA2, along with the PKA and CaMKII pathway-related protein CaM became completely activated if large enough Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is given, but their degrees of activity varied across the magnitude of the injected Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). DGL was most completely activated throughout the Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude, owing to the large equilibrium constant of its Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. At extremely large Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes, CaM was more completely bound by Ca<sup>2+</sup> than PLC and PLA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), but at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes, CaM remained largely unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> inset). This is reflected in the activation patterns of the catalytic subunit of PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and CaMKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), both of which are dependent on the activation of CaM and thus had a small response at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes. PKC, by contrast, became activated at relatively small Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Of these three pathways, the PKC pathway was dependent on the cholinergic ligands or the activation of the mGluRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), and the PKA pathway was dependent on the availability of β-adrenergic ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, these results highlight the need for large Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux to the post-synaptic spine for the activation of the CaMKII pathway, relatively large Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux for the activation of the PKA pathway, and relatively small Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux for the activation of the PKC pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>High-frequency stimulation (HFS) causes LTP and low-frequency stimulation (LFS) causes LTD in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses</title><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux entering the post-synaptic spine is extremely large during and after synaptic transmission and low otherwise, which causes the signalling pathways to be activated and deactivated in a more dynamic way than described in the previous section ('<italic>Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates multiple pathways that regulate the post-synaptic plasticity in cortical PCs</italic>'). The activation of these pathways and their dependence on the stimulus protocol are difficult to study experimentally due to methodological constraints (e.g., side effects of fluorescence indicators, lack of signal calibration, and poor temporal or spatial resolution), but biochemically detailed models, such as the one considered in this work, can provide insights into the transient molecular mechanisms behind LTP and LTD. Our model is particularly well suited to study the mechanisms behind CaMKII-, PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of AMPAR subunits, which are important mediators of long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Phosphorylation of GluR1 subunits at S845 increases the insertion rate of the AMPAR into the membrane, thus leading to post-synaptic LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diering et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, phosphorylation of GluR2 subunits at S880 increases the rate of receptor endocytosis from the membrane, and has thus been observed to lead to post-synaptic LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xia et al., 2000</xref>). However, it is not the number of the membrane-expressed AMPAR subunits alone that determine the strength of the synapse, but different compositions of the subunits have different single-channel conductances, and phosphorylation at S831 of the GluR1 subunit also affects the conductance of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oh and Derkach, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To simulate the reaction dynamics in the post-synaptic spine under realistic input patterns, we applied the 4xHFS and LFS protocols. Each input contained transient (3 ms) influxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1900 particles/ms) into the cytosol and glutamate (20 particles/ms), acetylcholine (20 particles/ms) and β-adrenergic ligand (10 particles/ms) into the extracellular subspace near the spine membrane. We used a balanced ratio (1:1) of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits. We recorded the time courses of the concentrations of all CaMKII-, PKA-, and PKC-pathway molecules contributing to LTP or LTD to monitor their activity during and following the stimulation protocols. We also recorded the numbers of membrane-inserted GluR1 and GluR2 and their state of phosphorylation and used <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 5</xref> for determining the maximal synaptic conductance.</p><p>In the 4xHFS protocol, which typically causes LTP in plasticity experiments, our model predicts a large increase in total synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) due to a radical increase in membrane-inserted GluR1 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and a decrease in GluR2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These changes in membrane-expression of AMPAR subunits were dependent on activations of many signalling proteins in the CaMKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–H</xref>), PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–M</xref>), and PKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N–R</xref>) pathways. First, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) caused a rapid increase in half-activated calmodulin (bound by two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), leading to a longer-lasting increase in active calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Calmodulin activation led to an increase in the concentration of phosphorylated CaMKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), which phosphorylated the GluR1-type receptors at S831 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The β-adrenergic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), in turn, bound to the β-adrenergic receptors and activated the Gs proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), which bound to the adenylyl cyclase AC1 to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). cAMP bound to PKA to release the catalytic subunits of PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>), which led to a phosphorylation of the GluR1-type receptors at S845 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>) and thus to increased membrane expression of GluR1 subunits and total synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Due to the simultaneous activation of the CaMKII pathway, a significant proportion of double phosphorylated GluR1-type receptors was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,M</xref>). As for the PLC–PKC pathway, glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>, blue) bound to mGluRs and acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>, green) bound to muscarinic receptors (M1), and the activation of these receptors contributed to the activation of Gq proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>).

We simulated a model of layer 2/3 pyramidal cell, stimulated with synaptic inputs from a 6xHFSt or LFS-1Hz protocol (see Materials and methods, section '<italic>Modelling the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs and neuromodulatory inputs</italic>'), to determine the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs entering the post-synaptic spine through NMDA receptors (NMDARs).

All pathways leading to GluR1 and GluR2 phosphorylation and the consequent exocytosis and endocytosis are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent: blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry completely abolished 4xHFS-induced LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) that followed GluR1 insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and GluR2 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Likewise, blocking β-adrenergic ligands had no effect on LFS-induced LTD (not shown). In contrast, LFS-induced LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) that followed GluR2 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) was reduced by blockade of mGluR activation while the number of GluR1 subunits at the membrane remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This reduction was strengthened by simultaneous blockade of cholinergic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>, yellow traces). Counterintuitively, blocking mGluR and M1-receptor activation also reduced the amplitude of the 4xHFS-induced LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) by disabling GluR2 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) while it had no effect on GluR1 insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The reason for this is that in the PKC pathway-blocked case there is a smaller post-4xHFS membrane-bound GluR1 ratio (fraction of GluR1 subunits over all GluR subunits at the membrane) than in the control case, and thus the probability of AMPARs being homomeric GluR1 tetramers (which had a very large conductance compared to other tetramers; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 5</xref>) is much smaller in the former case than in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Our model predicted that there is little change in the membrane expression of GluR1 and GluR2 type receptor subunits in this stimulation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>, purple). Consequently, our model reproduced the observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>) that this stimulation protocol led to little change in predicted synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, purple).</p><p>We next considered the paired synaptic-somatic stimulation in the presence of β-adrenergic ligand.

The predicted increase in GluR1 membrane expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and the consequent increase in synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, blue) were most prominent when the ISI was around 20–80 ms, and modest for large ISIs. These predictions are consistent with the experiments where an ISI-dependent potentiation of the EPSCs in the presence of β-adrenergic receptor agonists and absence of cholinergic agonists was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>When β-adrenergic neurotransmission was blocked but M1 receptors were activated by cholinergic ligands, the model predicted a prominent (up to 60%) decrease in GluR2 membrane expression, with little effect on GluR1 membrane expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–L</xref>, purple). Our model of synaptic conductance (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 5</xref>) predicted a decrease in total conductance in a GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapse for this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>, purple), which is in line with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>). The depression takes place throughout the tested ISIs, but the effect was smallest for ISIs very close to zero due to the counteracting effects of GluR1 membrane-insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, purple). Finally, when both β-adrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmission were active, our model predicted an increased GluR1 membrane expression and decreased GluR2 membrane expression, both of which were ISI dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–L</xref>, blue). In these simulations, the predicted synaptic conductance was increased for small and moderate pre-post intervals and decreased otherwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>, blue), which is qualitatively similar to experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>). These results are dependent on the availability of both GluR1 and GluR2 subunits at the post-synaptic spine: in simulations where GluR1 or GluR2 subunits were absent, only LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) or LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), respectively, was induced by the STDP protocol. In a similar manner as the HFS- and LFS-induced plasticity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, we could reproduce the STDP using the dimer-of-like-dimers tetramer formation rule with a GluR1 fraction of 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken together, our model with balanced numbers of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits reproduces the neuromodulator-gated STDP observed in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the visual cortex.</p><p>The combination of our biochemically detailed model with the biophysically detailed model of layer 2/3 pyramidal cell model provides a compelling means of hypothesis testing for cortical STDP in this cell type. We analyzed how the shape of the STDP curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref> is affected by the number of spikes in each post-synaptic burst stimulus. Our simulations suggest that decreasing the number of spikes per burst decreases the amplitude of both LTP and LTD in the STDP protocol and, in particular, brings the LTD for large post-pre ISIs close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These alterations are mediated by changes in both the level of membrane-insertion of GluR1 and endocytosis of GluR2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, insets). For small and moderate pre-post ISIs, the effects of decreasing the number of post-synaptic stimuli on the STDP curve are expected: both GluR1 insertion and GluR2 endocytosis are of smaller amplitude, and hence the dampened LTP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, for post-pre ISIs and large pre-post ISIs, decreasing the number of post-synaptic stimuli results in larger amplitude of GluR1 insertion and GluR2 endocytosis, which yields a dampened LTD for post-pre ISIs and strengthened LTP for large pre-post ISIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These counter-intuitive effects can be explained by the accumulation of small-conductance K<sup>+</sup> (SK) conductance in the post-synaptic neuron: the larger the number of post-synaptic pulses in the pairing burst, the larger the SK currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The SK current decays slowly (matching the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration decay), and remnants of the SK currents can be observed as long as 200 ms after the post-synaptic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> inset). For large post-pre ISIs, the number of spikes per burst has little effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during the post-synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> inset), but the SK currents activated by a large number of spikes per burst contribute to significantly decrease the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient caused by the pre-synaptic stimulus during the decay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). By contrast, for small pre-post intervals, the additional spikes in the post-synaptic stimulus significantly contribute to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To show that the effects of the number of spikes per post-synaptic burst are mediated by the SK current, we ran the simulation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> using a partial to complete blockage of the SK currents in the biophysically detailed simulations of the layer 2/3 pyramidal cell. The paired-pulse protocol of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref> (involving both β-adrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation) caused an STDP in all cases, but decreasing the SK conductance shortened the post-pre LTD window and decreased the amplitude of LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Similar effects were obtained with a decrease of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel conductances (not shown), which is in agreement with the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>. Our model predictions also agree with the observation that the plasticity outcome is not determined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>), instead, our model suggests that the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a better predictor of the plasticity outcome: the correlation coefficient between the post-STDP synaptic conductance and the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) was 0.53, while that between the post-STDP synaptic conductance and the mean Ca<sup>2+</sup> input during the inter-stimulus interval (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>) was 0.96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The STDP curve of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells is affected by the number of post-synaptic stimulus pulses associated with the pre-synaptic input.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The STDP curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref> when the number of spikes per post-synaptic burst was 1 (yellow), 2 (green), 3 (blue), or 4 (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; dark purple).

Low GluR1 ratio was needed for strong LTD and medium or high GluR1 ratio for strong LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, the strongest forms of LTP (classes 11–16) were induced only when GluR1 ratio was smaller than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), because a very low number of GluR2 subunits implied that the synapse has many homomeric GluR1 tetramers at a basal state, and thus stimulation-induced GluR1 exocytosis and GluR2 endocytosis did not radically increase the number of homomeric GluR1 tetramers (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 5</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For LTD and moderate LTP (classes 1–5), any NCX concentration and PKA-pathway coefficient could be used, but very strong LTP (classes 10–16) required a small to medium NCX concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and a medium to large PKA-pathway coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

To illustrate how these parameters affect the shape of the plasticity curves within class 6, we plotted the parameter sets that produced a BCM-type LTP/LTD curve similar to the one produced by our default model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> inset, black) or an LTP curve that was linear within this regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> inset, red). Moderate GluR1 ratios (0.40–0.57; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, black) and moderate NCX concentrations (0.7–1.4 times the default value; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, black) were needed for the default BCM-type plasticity, while for the linear LTP curve a larger GluR1 ratio (0.59–0.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, red) was needed but the NCX concentration was more variable (values ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 times the default value; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, red). The PKA pathway coefficients were generally larger in the default BCM-type plasticity parameter sets than in the parameter sets producing the linear LTP curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> shows the distributions of a set of coefficients, i.e. the PKC pathway, which were not correlated with the plasticity outcome within this group.</p><p>Our previous analysis showed that PKC-pathway-mediated GluR2 endocytosis was important in lower stimulation frequency protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or in protocols with large separation between pre- and post-synaptic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To further analyze the contribution of PKC-pathway proteins to plasticity outcomes, we repeated the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> by clustering the plasticity outcome based on the relative synaptic strength after a steady-state Ca<sup>2+</sup> input of low amplitude (50 particles/ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As observed with the previous clustering, the GluR1 ratio and NCX concentration differed across classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). However, in this classification, the PKA-pathway coefficient was not predictive of the plasticity outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) whereas the PKC-pathway coefficient varied across the classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Separation between BCM-like plasticity and gradual LTD was also evident within class 6’, and due to the same GluR1, PKA and NCX parameters as with the original classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). This shows our identification of critical parameters is robust to how the classification was performed.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that alterations of the concentrations of the proteins regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux or PKA/PKC-pathway signalling and the numbers of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits, ranging from complete absence to moderate increase (±100%), have a large effect both on the type of plasticity (LTP or LTD) and on the sensitivity of the plasticity outcome to the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. These data suggest that neocortical post-synaptic spines may exhibit a vast set of plasticity rules by downregulation or relatively mild upregulation of their protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A parametric analysis confirms the robustness of the model</title><p>We analysed the model responses to 4xHFS and LFS protocols (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) under small (±10%) changes in the parameters describing the initial concentrations and reaction rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As expected, most parameter changes led to small deviations from the predicted magnitudes of LTP/LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, grey bars). Alterations of the initial concentration of a number of species (10 out of 47) and reaction rates (12 out of 223) resulted in a notable (&gt;15%) amplification or attenuation of LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) or LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The parameters affecting the LFS-induced LTD were all related to GluR1 membrane insertion or total amount of GluR1 or GluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), while the parameters affecting the 4xHFS-induced LTP were related to NCX-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, PP1 concentration, production of cAMP by AC1, PKA buffering/deactivation, or GluR1 membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Importantly, none of the parameter changes completely abolished the LTP or LTD. Taken together, our model is robust to small alterations in initial concentrations and reaction rates, but parameters influencing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, GluR1 activity, or the PKA-pathway signalling can have relatively large effects on the model output.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The model predictions of LTP and LTD are robust to small changes in model parameters.</title><p>Values of initial concentrations (47 parameters) or reaction rates (223 parameters) were changed one at the time by −10% or +10%, and the resulting synaptic conductance 16 min after LFS (<bold>A</bold>) or 4xHFS (<bold>B</bold>) protocol was measured (NEURON RxD simulations).

Computational biochemically detailed models have been proposed as an absolutely reproducible tool that is particularly suited for unifying our understanding of LTP and LTD across cell types and brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Manninen et al., 2010</xref>. Here, we show that our model for intracellular signalling in a cortical post-synaptic spine — through the use of varying concentrations of different proteins — can be flexibly tuned to reproduce data from the experimental literature of cortical LTP/LTD. This allows one to make predictions for the differences in intracellular machineries underlying each of the experiments, leading to a more complete view of the plasticity-related signalling pathways in different cell types in the cortex and the effects of the stimulation protocol on the plasticity outcome across cortical areas.</p><p>To show the flexibility of our model, we aimed to reproduce a large amount of data on cortical plasticity across cortical areas and stimulation paradigms. We reviewed the literature of cortical plasticity, and picked eight studies where one or more types of neurons were tested using one or more stimulation protocols and the outcome was quantified using electrophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These studies comprised 11 data sets that described the response of a neuron population in entorhinal cortex (EC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), barrel cortex (BC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), visual cortex (VC), or auditory cortex (AuC) to plasticity inducing protocols (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For each experiment in each data set, we assigned an objective function that quantified the error between the predicted LTP/LTD outcome (measured in relative synaptic conductance) and the data (typically measured in fold change of field EPSP slope). The objective functions were averaged across different time instants (10, 15, and 20 min post-stimulus-onset). We then ran a multi-objective optimisation algorithm (see Materials and methods, section '<italic>Parameter alterations and model fitting</italic>') that aimed at finding the values for model parameters that minimised these objective functions. The fitted parameters included the amplitudes of pre-synaptic stimulation-associated fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, β-adrenergic ligand and glutamate in addition to GluR1 fraction and factors for the protein concentrations of different pathways. Here, both the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the neuromodulatory inputs were square-pulse injections that followed every pre-synaptic stimulation although some of the studies of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> used bath application of neuromodulatory agents; however, the temporal distribution of the neuromodulators has only a small effect in our model as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).We ran the optimiser for 20 generations. For data sets VC-1 and VC-2, we did not find parameter sets that would fulfil all four objective functions, and therefore, we re-fitted the model for these data sets excluding the CaMKII-blocked experiments (printed in grey in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>List of LTP/LTD experiments in the cortex.</title><p>The first column labels the experimental data set and names the underlying study.

The fourth and fifth columns show the frequency (in Hz) of stimulation and the number of pulses delivered, respectively: 10 × 4 means that 10 trains of 4 pulses with 10 ms interval (100 Hz) were delivered, and likewise, 25 × 5 means that 25 trains of 5 pulses with 10 ms interval were delivered.

This is reflected in the obtained parameter sets: the parameter controlling CaM and CaMKII concentrations (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>CaMKII</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) was significantly larger (U-test, p-value&lt;0.001) in the horizontal-pathway (data set EC-1) synapse models, while the parameter controlling upstream PKA-pathway proteins (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>PKA</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) was significantly larger in the models reproducing the data from the ascending pathway (data set EC-2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The GluR1-GluR2 ratio, in turn, was not significantly different between the two data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). As a contrasting example, our model predicts a large variety of parameters that reproduce the LTP and LTD of data sets AuC-1 and AuC-2 but, consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the GluR1 ratio was significantly larger in the model parameters fitted to the data from LTP-expressing neurons than from LTD-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).

Taken together, our model-fitting experiment shows that the model can be fit to many types of multi-condition plasticity data — without altering the reaction rates — and that the resulting predictions of the underlying protein concentrations reflect the mechanisms proposed by the experimental studies.</p><p>The models obtained by fitting the initial concentrations to data provide an important tool for predicting the outcome of plasticity under various stimulus protocols and chemical agents. We carried out additional simulations with the obtained models using HFS protocol. The models fitted for data from EC (data sets EC-1 and EC-2, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2008</xref>]), BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardingham et al., 2003</xref>), ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Song et al., 2017</xref>), and LTP-expressing auditory cortical neurons (data set AuC-1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kotak et al., 2007</xref>) predicted a steady increase in response to HFS, while models fitted for other cortical data predicted a mixture of LTP, LTD, and no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Furthermore, to obtain experimentally testable predictions for the dependency of the plasticity outcome in different cortical areas on the intracellular signalling, we simulated the models from each data set with the corresponding stimulus protocol with CaMKII, PKA, or PKC blockade. The inhibition of CaMKII impaired the LTP in data set EC-1 (horizontal pathway) but had little or no effect on the plasticity in other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The lack of effect of CaMKII blockade on the ascending pathway of EC — an experiment which was not included in the fitting of the model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) — validates the underlying models in this aspect since similar results were observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2008</xref>. Moreover, the similarities in the predicted effect of CaMKII-, PKA-, and PKC-pathway blockades between the two models of CC→PFC synapses (PFC-1 and PFC-2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B–D</xref>) serve as an additional validation of these models. The inhibition of PKA impaired LTP in all cortical areas, except for LTP in the horizontal pathway of the EC (EC-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Our models also predicted that LTP of the CC→PFC pathway and LFS-induced LTP in VC can be effectively weakened or even be transformed to a mild LTD by PKA blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Finally, our models predicted that PKC inhibition transformed all forms of LTD (LFS-induced LTD in VC-1 and VC-2; LTD in AuC-2) into LTP and impaired certain forms of LTP (LTP in EC-2; LTP in AuC-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that almost all forms of post-synaptic plasticity in the cortex are likely to be PKA-dependent, and that many types of cortical plasticity are also influenced by CaMKII and PKC activity. Our results highlight the need for additional chemical or genetic manipulations to be done when experimenting on cortical plasticity in order to correctly reveal the intracellular signalling cascades in the post-synaptic spine.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The models describing plasticity in different cortical areas predict diverse responses to modified stimulation protocol and stimulation under chemical blockers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The predicted responses of the 20 best models in each data set to HFS (100 pulses at 100 Hz) stimulation.

Our model explains how different forms of plasticity depend on the concentrations of PKA- and PKC-pathway proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We also showed that our model can be fit to explain the pathway dependencies of various types of neocortical LTP/LTD data published in the literature by altering the magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ligand fluxes and the concentrations of post-synaptic proteins regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux and PKA- and PKC-pathway dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our fitted models provide a powerful tool for testing hypotheses on the effects of chemical or genetic manipulations on the LTP and LTD in different cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of GluR2 in synaptic plasticity in the neocortex</title><p>GluR2 subunits are highly expressed in neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kondo et al., 1997</xref>), and their endocytosis mediates (or, at minimum, is correlated with) synaptic depression in many cortical regions such as ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Toyoda et al., 2007</xref>), VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heynen et al., 2003</xref>), and PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van den Oever et al., 2008</xref>). Previous intracellular signalling-based models of neocortical LTP/LTD exist, but they do not take into account the contributions of GluR2 subunit. For example, in three previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Alcantara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castellani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Honda et al., 2013</xref>), S831-phosphorylation-mediated LTP was described in a fashion similar to our model (although more approximations were made), but the phosphorylation site S845 was assumed to be basally phosphorylated and LTD was caused by modest Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs that led to PP1 or PP2B-mediated dephosphorylation of S845. Although there is support for this order of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee and Kirkwood, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diering et al., 2016</xref>), newer findings have confirmed the low degrees of phosphorylation of both S831 and S845 at a basal state in cortical cells, especially in synaptic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diering et al., 2016</xref>). A recent phenomenological model has also shed light on the dependency of cortical STDP on the pairing interval and location of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ebner et al., 2019</xref>), but their mechanisms are not specific to any particular AMPAR or NMDAR subunit. To analyse the contributions of GluR2 subunits to neocortical LTP/LTD, we included in our model the signalling pathways leading to both phosphorylation-mediated exocytosis of GluR1 and endocytosis of GluR2. Our model could thus be used to study not only PKA-mediated LTP or PKC-mediated LTD but also their co-effects and co-dependencies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of the study</title><p>The modelling results of the present work give rise to experimentally testable predictions. For example, our STDP model, when stimulated without β-adrenergic ligands, suggests that at near-zero pairing-intervals the magnitude of the depression may be decreased or even switched to mild LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). In many experimental studies (including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>), the type and magnitude of plasticity in this regime of STDP is not reported. We also predict that a mild LTP (24–60% LTP; class 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) can be obtained through many differently weighted interactions of PKA and PKC pathways and Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s7">7</xref>).Importantly, this is the regime of a wealth of experimental LTP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsumoto, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), which is consistent with the great diversity of LTP mechanisms observed in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feldman, 2009</xref>). Based on our simulated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), we suggest that in order to correctly characterise the mechanisms behind LTP of especially this magnitude, both experiments that activate the PKA pathway and experiments that block or activate the PKC pathway should be carried out. It is also important to know whether and to what degree GluR1 and GluR2 subunits are present in the synapse, since the balance of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits seems to be a determinant parameter permitting certain types of plasticity while prohibiting others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>A key challenge in the study of synaptic plasticity is the diversity of LTP/LTD observed across the cell types in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Granger and Nicoll, 2014</xref>). Differences in the transcriptome have been proposed as one of the sources for this variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lisachev and Shtark, 2018</xref>). We believe our model can be used to explain some of the discrepancies in the experimental data in this regard and expand the understanding of possible molecular contributors to LTP/LTD. For example, it is known that activation of PKA pathway by dopamine or noradrenaline in PFC pyramidal neurons increases the synaptic conductance through GluR1 membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Our model is in agreement with this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but it also proposes that the LTP can be impaired by over- or underexpression of many involved proteins, such as AC1, I-1 (inhibitor of PP1), PDE4, PDE1, GluR1, and CaM, and even alterations in ATP concentration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Small differences in the concentrations of a number of such contributing proteins are likely to cause significant alterations to LTP observed in different brain areas and cell types.</p><p>Due to the inclusion of three major LTP/LTD pathways in the neocortex, our model provides a more accurate means than earlier models for exploring how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the spine affects the plasticity outcome in many stimulation protocols, STDP in particular. Our model suggests that the plasticity outcome of the STDP protocol is strongly correlated with the total amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the post-synaptic spine, and less so with the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).The total amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx could thus provide a better biomarker for plasticity than the previously considered amplitude and duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evans and Blackwell, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Validity of the results and limitations of the study</title><p>Our model of total synaptic conductance of the post-synaptic spine is based upon a number of assumptions. First, the prediction of a large increase of conductance that follows the replacement of GluR2 subunits at the membrane by GluR1 subunits (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is based upon the findings on differences in single-channel conductances of different types of AMPAR tetramers in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oh and Derkach, 2005</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oh and Derkach, 2005</xref>, we assumed that CaMKII-phosphorylation of S831 only increases the conductance of GluR1 homomers and not that of GluR1/GluR2 heteromers, although also heteromers have been observed to increase their conductance in the presence of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>). Second, we assumed a random tetramerization procedure in which each of the four subunits in the tetramer may be either GluR1 or GluR2 subunit. Traditionally, AMPARs were thought to assemble as dimers of like dimers, that is, that first GluR1s and GluR2s assemble into homomeric R1-R1 and R2-R2 dimers and R1-R2 heterodimers and that these three types of dimers only assemble into tetramers with a dimer of its own kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gan et al., 2015</xref>). However, recent findings of heterotetramers with only one GluR1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) challenge this model. To show that our results were not dependent on the details of this process, we reproduced our results using the alternative (dimer of like dimers) tetramer formation rule. Using a slightly modified GluR1-GluR2 balance (35:65), this model reproduced HFS-induced LTP and LFS-induced LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) as well as the neuromodulator-gated STDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).In summary, our model predictions were not dependent on the assumptions on the tetramer formation rule.</p><p>Our model reproduced the qualitative results of STDP of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in visual cortex being gated by neuromodulators, but there were quantitative differences. When acetylcholine was present, our model predicted a prominent decrease in GluR2 membrane-expression regardless the pairing interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), which caused a notable LTD for very large pairing intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), whereas the experimental data showed attenuation of the depression for large inter-stimulus intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>). This discrepancy is likely caused by processes allowing slower time-scale (&gt;50 ms) interaction between the pre- and post-synaptic stimulus that are either not included (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or cAMP-dependence of HCN channels) or not adequately strong in the multi-compartmental model. For example, the contributions of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and SK channels to the neuron electrophysiology may be large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mäki-Marttunen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mäki-Marttunen et al., 2018</xref>) — to this end, we showed here that the SK currents are amplified by the subsequent pulses stimulating the post-synaptic neuron and that this is one factor increasing the LTD for large ISIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Note that this prediction of lowered synaptic strength for large absolute ISIs is not to be considered a basal synaptic state under spontaneous activity since the amplitude of the LTD is significantly decreased both by the removal of cholinergic neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) and a decrease of stimulating frequency (data not shown). On the other hand, mechanisms lacking from the biochemical model (e.g., voltage-dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-extrusion rate of NCX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weber et al., 2002</xref>) could also impede our results in this matter. Some aspects of cellular physiology could therefore be better represented if we incorporated both biochemical signalling and multicompartmental Hodgkin-Huxley-type modelling into the simulations, as done in modelling studies of persistent neuron firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Neymotin et al., 2016</xref>) and astrocyte electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Savtchenko et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The quality of the model fitting to experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is restricted by the fact that not all of the LTP/LTD data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> were confirmed to have a post-synaptic origin. This may be the key source of discrepancy in the fitting of the model to the CaMKII-blocked data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirkwood et al., 1997</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), since CaMKII activation at the pre-synaptic spine may lead to EPSC potentiation through an increase in neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ninan and Arancio, 2004</xref>).

Combining our biochemically detailed model with biophysically detailed models from different cortical areas will provide models with better predictive power in the future. Moreover, our model can be used for initial testing of hypotheses concerning dysfunctions (including chemical and genetic manipulations) of many intracellular signalling proteins and their role in impairments of cortical synaptic plasticity. By altering the initial concentrations or reaction rates of various species according to disease-associated functional genetics data, the model can be used to provide insights into the disease mechanisms of mental disorders that express both genetic disposition of post-synaptic signalling pathways and plasticity-related phenotypes, such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devor et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction and calibration of the biochemically detailed model of post-synaptic plasticity in the cortex</title><p>We created a model of pathways leading from Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs and activation of β-adrenergic receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to the phosphorylation and insertion of AMPARs into the membrane.

Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayer and Bhalla, 2005</xref>, we allowed the insertion and removal of GluR1 subunits to and from the membrane that depended on their state of S845 phosphorylation. We also allowed spontaneous membrane insertion of non-S845-phosphorylated GluR1; we chose the rate of this reaction so that on average one fifth of the (non-S845-phosphorylated) GluR1s were membrane-expressed in steady state, as suggested by experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oh et al., 2006</xref>). We adjusted the forward rate of GluR2 insertion to the membrane to decrease the proportion of membrane-inserted vs. internalised GluR2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), following experimental data according to which 45% of GluR2s were membrane-inserted at resting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashby et al., 2004</xref>).

In reality, some of the molecular species are prevalently present in the cytosol, some attached to the membrane, some in the extracellular medium in an immediate vicinity to the membrane, and others outside the cell further away from the synaptic cleft (free in the extracellular medium or sequestered to other cells). As commonly done in the field, we solved this problem by introducing species that represent a molecular species confined in a particular location: reactions 1–6 describe the extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the extracellular medium, reactions 8, 95, and 135 describe the escape of ligands from the vicinity of the synapse, and reactions 80–81 and 128–129 for the translocation of the AMPARs to/from the membrane (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). All stimulations start after 4040 s of simulation without inputs, which is sufficient for attaining a steady state for all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Statistical model for numbers of AMPAR tetramers at the membrane and the total synaptic conductance</title><p>AMPARs have different conductances depending on their subunit composition and phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oh and Derkach, 2005</xref>), but it is challenging to take this into account in models that include a large number of receptor subunits. In our model, AMPAR subunits GluR1 and GluR2 can be in one of 21 or five states, respectively, when counting all the different phosphorylation states and bonds with other molecules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), which leads to 28<sup>4</sup> possible types of tetramers. This makes it virtually impossible to model the dynamics of AMPAR tetramer assembly using the mass-action law-based approach where the concentration of each type of species is monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Michalski and Loew, 2012</xref>). To avoid this problem, we used a statistical model that estimated the numbers and types of different types of AMPAR tetramers given the numbers of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits located at the membrane.</p><p>We assumed that the composition of AMPAR tetramers is random such that there is no preference of one type of subunit being more likely to bind with any other type of subunit. Thus, the probability of a tetramer being a GluR1 homomer without any S831-phosphorylated subunits is approximately<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> are the numbers of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits bound to the membrane, respectively, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf225"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>phos</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of S831-phosphorylated GluR1 subunits at the membrane (note that the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf226"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>phos</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> subunits are included in all GluR1 subunits, that is, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf227"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>phos</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).

id="s4-3"><title>Modelling the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs and neuromodulatory inputs</title><p>We modelled the neurotransmission to the post-synaptic spine as fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, β-adrenergic ligand, glutamate, and acetylcholine (labelled as Ca, L, Glu, and ACh, respectively, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). We used various stimulation paradigms: In sections '<italic>Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates multiple pathways that regulate the post-synaptic plasticity in cortical PCs</italic>' and '<italic>The model predicts multimodal, protein concentration- and neuromodulation-dependent rules of plasticity</italic>', long-lasting, single pulses of input species were applied. In sections '<italic>High-frequency stimulation (HFS) causes LTP and low-frequency stimulation (LFS) causes LTD in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses</italic>' and '<italic>A parametric analysis confirms the robustness of the model</italic>', we used the following repeated stimulus protocols: HFS — 100 pulses of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (3 ms), repeated at 100 Hz; 4xHFS — 4 trains of HFS, separated by 3 s of quiescence; LFS — 900 pulses of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (3 ms), repeated at 5 Hz. Unless otherwise stated, each Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse was accompanied by a 3 ms pulse of β-adrenergic ligand, glutamate, and acetylcholine. The activation of cholinergic and noradrenergic terminals by electrical stimulation is supported by experimental data in, e.g., slices of mouse prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mundorf et al., 2001</xref>). In section '<italic>The model flexibly reproduces data from various cortical LTP/LTD experiments</italic>', the same approach was used, but the frequencies and numbers of repetitions of the inputs were taken from the experiments (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>In section '<italic>Paired pre- and post-synaptic stimulation induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses</italic>' (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> of section '<italic>High-frequency stimulation (HFS) causes LTP and low-frequency stimulation (LFS) causes LTD in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses</italic>'), we used a multicompartmental model of a layer 2/3 pyramidal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>) (L23_PC_cADpyr229_1) to determine the amplitudes and time courses of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs conducted by NMDARs when different stimulus patterns were applied.

We placed 10 post-synaptic spines, consisting of a 0.5 μm long and 0.1 μm thick neck and a 0.4 μm long and 0.4 μm thick head, to the proximal apical dendrite (250–300 μm from the soma). For an analysis of the effects of synapse location on Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and plasticity in cortical pyramidal cells, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ebner et al., 2019</xref>.

The ten synapses were synchronously stimulated but the glutamate release was probabilistic, the release events at different synapses being independent of each other as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hay and Segev, 2015</xref>). We set the maximal AMPAR conductance to 0.001 μS, a value typically used in computational neuron models. We set the maximal conductance of NMDARs to 0.0032 μS to compensate for the lack of the slow component in the model of the NMDA current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Markram et al., 2015</xref>) — a value significantly smaller or larger than this abolished the LTP or LTD, respectively, in our STDP model, while the AMPAR conductance was a less crucial parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2</xref>).We estimated the numbers of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering into the post-synaptic spine across time, and used these numbers as the input to the biochemical model. In section '<italic>Paired pre- and post-synaptic stimulation induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses</italic>', following the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>, we used extracellular [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] of 1.0 mM and a 1 Hz pre-synaptic stimulation, where each pulse was paired with a burst of post-synaptic stimulus currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seol et al., 2007</xref>).

We chose to fit protein concentrations instead of reaction rates, since the reaction rates can be considered to be the same across cell types while the protein expression is known to be cell-type and age-dependent. This is analogous to fitting maximal conductances that correlate with ion-channel densities in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models instead of the ion-channel activation and inactivation curve parameters as is usually done in the fitting of biophysically detailed neuron models.

For the multi-objective optimisation in section '<italic>The model flexibly reproduces data from various cortical LTP/LTD experiments</italic>', we used the Python implementation (published by the authors of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahl et al., 2012</xref>) of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deb et al., 2002</xref>) with population size 1000. To restrict to physiologically realistic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, we disregarded the data where free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations rose above 2 μM for one or more levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> input in section '<italic>The model predicts multimodal, protein concentration- and neuromodulation-dependent rules of plasticity</italic>'. In a similar manner, in section '<italic>The model flexibly reproduces data from various cortical LTP/LTD experiments</italic>', we introduced an objective function that penalised parameter sets that produced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients larger than 2 μM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Simulation software and code accessibility</title><p>For deterministic simulations of intracellular signalling, we used the NEURON simulator with the reaction-diffusion (RxD) extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McDougal et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Harel Z Shouval as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very ambitious project, that models many of the different molecular interactions that can affect synaptic plasticity. The inclusion of neuromodulators is important and relatively novel. The statistical model of AMPA receptors is interesting, novel and practical. The authors take seriously the role of data. It is quite a heroic effort, but on the other hand the model is hard to verify, it is hard to extract more general principles, and the predictions of the model are limited. This limits the overall impact of the work.</p><p>The model is very complex, and almost none of the reaction coefficients are known. There are so many parameter combinations that can yield the same results. What do we actually learn from this? This is an essential part of this model, not much can be done to address this.</p><p>Spine model should be used in all simulations of plasticity protocol. It is not clear and how the magnitude of the calcium currents through the NMDAR, and of efflux through diffusion and pumps are calibrated.</p><p>It is not clear if all initial conditions are at the fixed points.</p><p>The dynamics of the neuromodulators are odd and sometimes unclear. They should be justified, explained better or corrected if these dynamics cannot be justified. Does the application of neuromodulator to the bath on its own change the efficacies?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All simulations of plasticity protocols should use the spine model, and it should be explained how the NMDA currents in the spine model are calibrated.</p><p>2) All simulations should start from a fixed point of the model.</p><p>3) The neuromodulator dynamics should be better explained and justified. Does it make sense to have square neuromodulator pulses? What are the neuromodulator dynamics in the STDP experiments? Especially must take into account that in the Seol et al., 2007 paper neuromodulators are bath applied. Does bath application of neuromodulators, alone, without stimulation change the efficacies?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very ambitious project, almost heroic. The attempt is to carry out true quantitative modeling of many of the signal transduction pathways involved in LTP/LTD in neocortex. The work here is very detailed and extensive, and there are many interesting and novel components to this work. However, I am not yet convinced that this goal is feasible. The model is very complex, there is a huge number of unknown parameters and I am not sure that I understand all of the methods and therefore do not know if they are appropriate.</p><p>The good:</p><p>1) The inclusion of neuromodulators is important and relatively novel.</p><p>2) The statistical model of AMPA receptors is interesting novel and practical.</p><p>3) The authors take seriously the role of data.</p><p>The bad:</p><p>1) The model is very complex, and almost none of the reaction coefficients are known. There are so many parameter combinations that can yield the same results. What do we actually learn from this?</p><p>2) All simulation of plasticity including LFS and HFS should be carried out on the basis if the spine model in Neuron. It is not clear to me though how that was calibrated.</p><p>3) The neuromodulator dynamics, which are pulses for every Ca pulse, are problematic, and not justified. It is unclear to me what the NM dynamics are in the subsection “Paired-pulse stimulus protocol induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses”</p><p>Detailed points – Major:</p><p>The good:</p><p>4) The inclusion of neuromodulators and their effects on the PKC and PKA pathways is important. Most previous models have ignored these effects, but results in adult neocortical slices have proven that these pathways are essential for LTP and LTD.</p><p>Most previous models have ignored the role of the different subunits in the AMPA receptor heteromers. Modeling of these receptors directly as independent species in a mass action approach is nearly impossible due to the huge number of possible combinations. The statistical model proposed is a novel idea that has significant practical advantages. There are assumptions that go into this, which the authors acknowledge. Nevertheless, it is a novel and sensible approach. I think a separate work could simply be based on this model and the statistical testing of its validity.</p><p>These authors take seriously the role of data and test the model (with different parameters) against many different experimental results.</p><p>The major problems:</p><p>5) This is a very complex model with 140 reactions and 47 types of elementary molecules which could be in many states. A tiny fraction of the reaction coefficients have been measured, even if they have it might not be relevant for in vivo conditions. The determination of these coefficients in the paper does not seem to depend on measured coefficients, but instead seems to depend on these coefficients being appropriate for matching experimental results. As we know, and as is shown for example in Figure 7, there is a very large space of parameter combinations that can produce very similar experimental results. What do we actually learn from all of this then? This problem is actually made clear in Figure 7, what are the authors trying to clarify in this very complex figure?</p><p>6) The real complete model is the one that uses the Calcium transients from a Neuron simulation, subsection “Paired-pulse stimulus protocol induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses” and Figure 6. Only here there is a possibility that realistic calcium transients are used, and in principle this should have been used from all comparisons to data. Not only STDP protocols have real synapses, HFS and LFS stimuli also use real synapses. However, it is not clear to me how this synapse model was calibrated. Peak Ca influx rate here is much larger than for the other cases, more than an order of magnitude larger than in Figure 3 and much larger than in Figures 4, 5 as well. How was this calibrated? Was this based on the number of NMDAR and this influx through each? If so, what are these numbers? An alternative way of calibrating the spine model is to use estimates of calcium influx from Ca imaging, for example from Sabatini and Svoboda, 2002. A third option is to use whatever works, however then even this elementary component of the model is not based on biophysical realism. Several details and references are given in the subsection “Modelling the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs and neuromodulatory inputs”, but this is still not clear to me. It would also be useful to see what the spine voltages are and how they affect the Mg block. Why is there more calcium influx at -30 ms vs. only presynaptic stimulation? Is the -30 ms measured from the first or last spike in the 4-spike train? What is it about a spike that occurred 30 ms prior to the presynaptic stimulus that affects calcium influx?</p><p>7) Neuromodulator dynamics. It is important that neuromodulators have been included here. However, the assumptions about their dynamics do not make sense to me. In several sections neuromodulators pulses are assumed to follow the Ca pulses? What is the logic here, that stimulation of axons also causes neuromodulator release? This clearly does not seem to match experiments like Seol et al., 2007, where neuromodulators are bath applied and should just be at a constant level.

Furthermore, we have now simulated the same bath-application protocol as used in Seol et al., 2007.

The bath application of neuromodulators alone did not cause plasticity, as we now mention in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) The model is very complex, and almost none of the reaction coefficients are known. There are so many parameter combinations that can yield the same results. What do we actually learn from this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree with the reviewer that the model is complex when measured in numbers of reactions or equations. Nevertheless, all dynamics of the modeled molecular species follow the law of mass action, which gives the model an intrinsic modular property: if future modelers want to simplify parts of it or (as we believe to be more likely) extend it to take into account even more details, they will only have to replace a set of targeted species and their interactions with the rest of the model species without refitting the whole model. This is an important difference compared to simpler models with few parameters and non-mass-action-law type of interactions that have been particularly fitted to describe the plasticity-related phenomena.</p><p>It would be ideal to have all reaction rates explicitly fitted to data obtained from carefully constrained experiments, but such data are scarcely published. Nonetheless, rate constants for many of the reactions were constrained by data. We used off-the-shelf models of the biochemistry of PKA, PKC and CaMKII pathways where the reaction rates and initial concentrations were usually fitted directly to enzyme kinetic or FRET imaging data.</p><p>What we can learn from such a complex model is the interplay of different molecular species in the induction of post-synaptic plasticity in the neocortex. This is an important research topic in polygenic mental disorders, schizophrenia in particular, where subtle changes (due to common gene variants) in plasticity-related proteins can lead to pathological cellular and network physiology. Our model can provide biochemically detailed model predictions that are urgently needed in discovering mechanisms for these disorders. A step toward this direction is Figure 7, which, although it shows that various combinations of model parameters can result in similar plasticity curve, also pinpoints the most sensitive molecular species in different types of plasticity. Many of these sensitive species are indeed in the groups of proteins encoded by risk genes of schizophrenia (see Figure 1 in Devor et al., 2017). Like any model predictions, such biochemistry-based predictions on disease pathophysiology may be biased due to under-constrained model parameters (e.g., rate constants) and thus should be tested experimentally – until that happens, they can serve as useful and potentially ground-breaking proof-of-principle mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All simulation of plasticity including LFS and HFS should be carried out on the basis if the spine model in Neuron. It is not clear to me though how that was calibrated.</p></disp-quote><p>Using our biophysically detailed NEURON simulations, we have now calculated the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients resulting from HFS and LFS stimulation protocols. In particular, we showed that our model reproduced the LTP caused by a theta-HFS protocol (6xHFSt) and the LTD caused by a 1-Hz LFS protocol (LFS<sup>-1</sup>Hz) as described in Heusler et al., 2000. We have extended the description of the model calibration for this. We now write:</p><p>“In the above analyses, we used brief square-pulse fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup>to the synapse model, which is a simple representation of inputs during synaptic plasticity induction protocols. […] In accordance with Figure 3 and experimental data from somatosensory cortex [Heusler et al., 2000], our model predicted that 6xHFSt induced LTP whereas LFS-1Hz induced LTD (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>As both reviewers noted, the biochemical model is in itself rather complex, and we try to avoid bringing extra complexity to the manuscript when not absolutely necessary. Moreover, when we talk about the proposed “unified” model that can provide explanations for a range of forms of plasticity in the neocortex, we mainly refer to the biochemical network of the synapse, not the combination of the biochemical network and the multicompartmental biophysical model (the latter of which is known to vary between pyramidal cell types and cortical areas). For these reasons, we consider some of the simulation experiments added in response to the reviewer’s comments supplementary, and thus included these results in the supplementary material. We also believe it helps the reader that we start from generic HFS-induced LTP and LFS-induced LTD rather than a specific LTP and LTD in the somatosensory cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Neuromodulator dynamics, which are pulses for every Ca pulse, are problematic, and not justified. It is unclear to me what the NM dynamics are in the subsection “Paired-pulse stimulus protocol induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced”.</p></disp-quote><p>Little is known about the dynamics of neuromodulatory inputs during different stimulation protocols. We know that norepinephrinic projections span all layers of cortex (Simpson KL, Waterhouse BD, Lin RC. Anat Rec A Discov Mol Cell Evol Biol. 2006;288(2):166‐173), and that cholinergic projections, depending on the source, may span either all layers or only deep layers of the cortex (Obermayer J, Verhoog MB, Luchicchi A, Mansvelder HD. Front Neural Circuits. 2017;11:100). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that HFS and LFS, when applied to the cortex, also cause rhythmic neurotransmitter release. There indeed exists evidence that noradrenaline and acetylcholine are released in response to electrical stimulation in cortical slices (see e.g. Mundorf et al., 2001; Vizi ES, Zsilla G, Caron MG, Kiss JP. J Neurosci. 2004;24(36):7888‐7894). Thus, our model of short pulses that accompany the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses is justified experimentally. Nevertheless, the amplitude of this release may vary between cortical areas and slices prepared in different ways, as some experiments (such as Seol et al., 2007) indicate that bath application of neuromodulators (or corresponding agents) is required for activation of PKA or PKC pathways – this is why we allowed the amplitudes of the stimulus-associated neuromodulatory fluxes to vary in our model fitting to experimental data (Figure 9).</p><p>To justify these choices, we now write:</p><p>“Unless otherwise stated, each Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse was accompanied by a 3-ms pulse of β-adrenergic ligand, glutamate, and acetylcholine. The activation of cholinergic and noradrenergic terminals by electrical stimulation is supported by experimental data in, e.g., slices of mouse prefrontal cortex [Mundorf et al., 2001].”</p><p>To show that our modelling results are not dependent on the type of neuromodulator fluxes (pulse-associated or bath-applied), we have performed the HFS and LFS simulation experiments using the same amounts of neuromodulators but with different temporal distributions. We now write:</p><p>“The HFS-induced LTP and LFS-induced LTD of Figure 3 could also be reproduced with alternative durations of neuromodulator inputs, including 10-minute bath applications (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). These results indicate that our model can reproduce HFS-induced LTP and LFS-induced LTD also when using realistic NMDAR-conducted Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and that these forms of plasticity are robust to the temporal profile of the neuromodulatory inputs.”</p><p>We have now clarified the neuromodulator dynamics in the subsection “Paired pre- and post-synaptic stimulation induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses”. We now write:</p><p>“When added as bath application, the β-adrenergic and cholinergic ligands were simulated by prolonged injections of 50 particles/s for 10 min, starting 8 min before the STDP protocol – these neuromodulators alone (without the electric stimulation-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs) did not cause synaptic plasticity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The inclusion of neuromodulators and their effects on the PKC and PKA pathways is important. Most previous models have ignored these effects, but results in adult neocortical slices have proven that these pathways are essential for LTP and LTD.</p><p>Most previous models have ignored the role of the different subunits in the AMPA receptor heteromers. Modeling of these receptors directly as independent species in a mass action approach is nearly impossible due to the huge number of possible combinations. The statistical model proposed is a novel idea that has significant practical advantages. There are assumptions that go into this, which the authors acknowledge. Nevertheless, it is a novel and sensible approach. I think a separate work could simply be based on this model and the statistical testing of its validity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree that the validity of the statistical model for AMPAR conductance could be tested using detailed models of AMPAR assembly and transport, and that it should be a separate paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) This is a very complex model with 140 reactions and 47 types of elementary molecules which could be in many states. A tiny fraction of the reaction coefficients have been measured, even if they have it might not be relevant for in vivo conditions. The determination of these coefficients in the paper does not seem to depend on measured coefficients, but instead seems to depend on these coefficients being appropriate for matching experimental results. As we know, and as is shown for example in Figure 7, there is a very large space of parameter combinations that can produce very similar experimental results. What do we actually learn from all of this then? This problem is actually made clear in Figure 7, what are the authors trying to clarify in this very complex figure?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now simplified Figure 7 to transmit the main idea – that, despite the large number of model parameters (initial concentrations of proteins), the outcome of plasticity in the model is largely determined by 3-4 groups of species, namely, the GluR1 vs. GluR2 ratio, the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion proteins, and the concentrations of PKA and PKC pathway-related proteins. Understanding the contributions of different proteins to synaptic plasticity is important since there is a large diversity of reported types of plasticity in the cortex. Previously, we illustrated three classes of LTP/LTD curves in panels F-L, in part because not all experiments demonstrate both LTP and LTD; now, we have mainly focused on a single class, namely, the one (class 6) that produced the same LTP outcome as the model with the default parameters for a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> input. We have also removed panels I-L as they are not imperative for the main message of our manuscript. Instead, we added a supplementary figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) where the classification is based on plasticity outcome for small Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs, which better highlights the contribution of the PKC pathway.</p><p>We now write:</p><p>“The model results for the large parameter distributions of Figure 7B–E imply that there are manifestly different combinations of parameters that lead to the same LTP/LTD outcome. […] This shows our identification of critical parameters is robust to how the classification was performed.”</p><p>To highlight the model with the default parameters instead of any arbitrary parameter set, we write:</p><p>“Our model with the standard protein concentrations (GluR1 ratio 0.5, [NCX]=0.54 mM, f<sub>PKA</sub> = f<sub>PKC</sub> = 1.0) produced a BCM-type curve in class 6 (Figure 7A, black dashed curve).”</p><p>To further clarify the take-home message of this section, we now write:</p><p>“These data suggest that neocortical post-synaptic spines may exhibit a vast set of plasticity rules by downregulation or relatively mild upregulation of their protein expression.”</p><p>This conclusion is important, as the last Results section shows the implications of this hypothesis in synapse models fitted to real data – namely, we show that the particular types of post-synaptic plasticity can indeed be obtained by concentration changes of a similar magnitude as shown here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The real complete model is the one that uses the Calcium transients from a Neuron simulation subsection “Paired pre- and post-synaptic stimulation induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses” and Figure 6. Only here there is a possibility that realistic calcium transients are used, and in principle this should have been used from all comparisons to data. Not only STDP protocols have real synapses, HFS and LFS stimuli also use real synapses. However, it is not clear to me how this synapse model was calibrated. Peak Ca influx rate here is much larger than for the other cases, more than an order of magnitude larger than in Figure 3 and much larger than in Figures 4, 5 as well. How was this calibrated? Was this based on the number of NMDAR and this influx through each? If so, what are these numbers? An alternative way of calibrating the spine model is to use estimates of calcium influx from Ca imaging, for example from Sabatini and Svoboda, 2002. A third option is to use whatever works, however then even this elementary component of the model is not based on biophysical realism. Several details and references are given in the subsection “Modelling the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs and neuromodulatory inputs”, but this is still not clear to me. It would also be useful to see what the spine voltages are and how they affect the Mg block. Why is there more calcium influx at -30 ms vs. only presynaptic stimulation? Is the -30 ms measured from the first or last spike in the 4-spike train? What is it about a spike that occurred 30 ms prior to the presynaptic stimulus that affects calcium influx?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important that our model is responsive to realistic levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs. To complement the simple input protocols of Figure 3 (previously Figure 4), we have now implemented the HFS and LFS protocols using real synapses in addition to the previously shown STDP protocol. We now write:</p><p>“In the above analyses, we used brief square-pulse fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the synapse model, which is a simple representation of inputs during synaptic plasticity induction protocols. […] In accordance with Figure 3 and experimental data from somatosensory cortex [Heusler et al., 2000], our model predicted that 6xHFSt induced LTP whereas LFS<sup>-1</sup>Hz induced LTD (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>To introduce this extension of the study, we added details into the Materials and methods, where we now write:</p><p>“For Figure 3—figure supplement 3 of the subsection “High-frequency stimulation (HFS) causes LTP and low-frequency stimulation (LFS) causes LTD in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses”, following the experiments of [Heusler et al., 2000] we used [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] of 1.3 mM and solely pre-synaptic stimulation of one of the two stimulus protocols: 6xHFSt – 10 bursts of 4 pulses (at 100 Hz), repeated every 100 ms, and the whole train repeated 6 times every 10 sec; LFS-1Hz – 1800 pulses delivered at a frequency of 1 Hz.”</p><p>In the same section, we have now also added details on the calibration of the biophysical model. We write:</p><p>“In the subsection “Paired pre- and post-synaptic stimulation induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses” (and Figure 3—figure supplement 3 of the subsection “High-frequency stimulation (HFS) causes LTP and low-frequency stimulation (LFS) causes LTD in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses”), we used a multicompartmental model of a layer 2/3 pyramidal cell [Markram et al., 2015] (L23 PC cADpyr229 1) to determine the amplitudes and time courses of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs conducted by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) when different stimulus patterns were applied. […] We set the maximal conductance of NMDARs to 0.0032 μS to compensate for the lack of the slow component in the model of the NMDA current [Markram et al., 2015] – a value significantly smaller or larger than this abolished the LTP or LTD, respectively, in our STDP model, while the AMPAR conductance was a less crucial parameter (Figure 11—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>The calcium in Figure 2 (earlier Figure 3) was injected as a constant influx for long duration, and therefore, the amplitudes of the intracellular calcium responses were much smaller than in HFS and LFS protocols (where only 3-ms pulses of calcium were given). In Figure 3 (earlier Figure 4), the rates of the square-pulse calcium inputs in HFS and LFS experiments were indeed in line with the observations from one of the only publications of calcium in response to 100 Hz input (Regehr WG, Tank DW. J Neurosci 1992;12(11):4202-23). Note that the calcium response to 100 Hz is not 100 times the response to a single PSP, to avoid producing unrealistic peak responses. The calcium inputs of Figure 5 (earlier Figure 6) are of the same order of magnitude as in Figures 3-4. We have now plotted the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the spine (Figure 5E-G, Figure 6C-D) instead of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to make the comparison with experimental data easier. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and its dependence on the ISI in the STDP protocol are now illustrated in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We have also added panels Figure 5B-D showing the membrane potential time courses at the spine heads and the corresponding [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]-block factors. The inter-stimulus interval was indeed determined from the onset of the pre-synaptic stimulus until the onset of the first post-synaptic stimulus. We have now changed it to the interval from the onset of the pre-synaptic stimulus until the onset of the <italic>last</italic> post-synaptic stimulus, to use the same convention as experimentalists. This shifts the STDP curve 30 ms to the right. In the legend of Figure 5, we now write:</p><p>“Membrane potential at the dendritic spine when the pre-synaptic stimulation onset is 50 ms after (B), at the same time as (C), or 50 ms prior to (D) the onset of the last somatic stimulus. Inset (red): Mg<sup>2+</sup>-gate variable as a function of time, ranging from -80 ms to 140 ms in a similar manner as the data in the main panel.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Neuromodulator dynamics. It is important that Neuromodulators have been included here. However, the assumptions about their dynamics do not make sense to me. In several sections Neuromodulators pulses are assumed to follow the Ca pulses? What is the logic here, that stimulation of axons also causes neuromodulator release? This clearly does not seem to match experiments like Seol et al., 2007, where neuromodulators are bath applied and should just be at a constant level. Is there any evidence that in other slice experiments neuromodulators are indeed release at every pulse? What about the culture experiments? It is also not clear to me what is done with neuromodulators in the subsection “Paired-pulse stimulus protocol induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses” where Ca transients were taken from the spine model. Here it is clear to me that constant Neuromodulator levels should be used as in the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in the subsection “Paired-pulse stimulus protocol induces PKA- and PKC-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses” it makes sense to model the same bath application of neuromodulatory agonists as done in Seol et al. We reran the simulations for Figure 5 using the same protocol of neuromodulation (10 min bath application, starting 8 min before the onset of the pairing) and updated Figure 5 with those new results (which indeed are the same as before). We have also shown that the temporal dynamics of the neuromodulation do not play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the plasticity (see our response to point #2). As it is not known what the temporal dynamics are like in vivo, we keep the pulse-like neuromodulation previously implemented in Figure 4 (now Figure 3).</p><p>We now write:</p><p>“When added as bath application, the β-adrenergic and cholinergic ligands were simulated by prolonged injections of 50 particles/s for 10 min, starting 8 min before the STDP protocol”.</p><p>To clarify that M1 receptors were activated by cholinergic ligands and that the induced LTD was dependent on the pairing interval, we rephrased the sentence as follows:</p><p>“When β-adrenergic neurotransmission was blocked but M1 receptors were activated by cholinergic ligands, the model predicted a prominent (up to 60%) decrease in GluR2 membrane expression, with little effect on GluR1 membrane expression (Figure 5K–L, purple).”</p><p>On the question on neuromodulatory inputs in slices, please see our response to point #2. We are not aware of evidence of norepinephrine or cholinergic neurotransmission in cultured cortical neurons. However, the data we previously mentioned as being from cultured neurons from auditory cortex (Kotak et al., 2007) were in fact from slices, we apologize for this error in the text. Thus, all experimental data that we reproduce in the present work were from cortical slices, except from Flores et al., 2011, which recorded field responses in prefrontal cortex in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Are initial conditions steady at steady state for each parameter combination? It is not clear to me if all plasticity simulations are started at the steady levels of the system for the given parameter set? Are they?</p></disp-quote><p>We always simulated the model for more than 1 hour before stimulation onset. This is now clarified, where we write:</p><p>“All stimulations start after 4040 sec of simulation without inputs, which is sufficient for attaining a steady state for all species (Figure 11—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>The added supplementary figure (Figure 11—figure supplement 1) shows that after one hour the concentrations change by much less than 1 molecule/sec.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The authors develop a complicated model of the biochemical pathways underlying LTP and LTD. It is quite a heroic effort, but on the other hand the model is hard to verify, it is hard to extract more general principles, and the predictions of the model are limited. This limits the overall impact of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would like to point out that by mapping model entities to biological entities, the biochemical network model is straightforward to verify, because experimentalists can measure plasticity outcome while inhibiting specific molecules to test some of our predictions. A major goal of the proposed work is to make sense of the vast and confusing literature on synaptic plasticity, in which a diversity of induction protocols in a diversity of brain regions yields sometimes contradictory plasticity outcomes. Thus, a general principle extracted from our modeling study is that a relatively small number of key molecules can explain some of this diversity (as analyzed in Figure 7 and Figure 9). Another general principle is that the balance of GluR1/GluR2 subunits is important for determining the type of plasticity (see also our response to point #6 below). On the scarcity of model predictions: we have now performed additional simulations using our combination of biophysically detailed simulations of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells with the biochemically detailed post-synaptic spine model. Our results show that the shape of the STDP curve is radically affected by the number of post-synaptic stimuli per burst (Figure 6), fewer stimuli resulting in both weaker LTP and weaker LTD in an SK-channel dependent manner. This may explain why large number of stimuli per post-synaptic burst are often used in experimental settings. Our results also suggest that STDP is more correlated with the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the post-synaptic spine than with the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In the Results section, we now added a paragraph to present and discuss the abovementioned predictions:</p><p>“The combination of our biochemically detailed model with the biophysically detailed model of layer 2/3 pyramidal cell model provides a compelling means of hypothesis testing for cortical STDP in this cell type. […] Our model predictions also agree with the observation that the plasticity outcome is not determined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude [Nevian and Sakmann, 2006], instead, our model suggests that the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a better predictor of the plasticity outcome: the correlation coefficient between the post-STDP synaptic conductance and the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1E) was 0.53, while that between the post-STDP synaptic conductance and the mean Ca<sup>2+</sup> input during the inter-stimulus interval (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1F) was 0.96 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>We have also rewritten parts of the Discussion to better highlight the above-mentioned take-home messages. We now write:</p><p>“We also showed that our model can be fit to explain the pathway dependencies of various types of neocortical LTP/LTD data published in the literature by altering the magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ligand fluxes and the concentrations of post-synaptic proteins regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux and PKA- and PKC-pathway dynamics (Figure 9).”</p><p>Furthermore, we write:</p><p>“It is also important to know whether and to what degree GluR1 and GluR2 subunits are present in the synapse, since the balance of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits seems to be a determinant parameter permitting certain types of plasticity while prohibiting others (Figures 7B, 9E, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>We added a Discussion paragraph on the total amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> vs. peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in determining the outcome of plasticity:</p><p>“Due to the inclusion of three major LTP/LTD pathways in the neocortex, our model provides a more accurate means than earlier models for exploring how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the spine affects the plasticity outcome in many stimulation protocols, STDP in particular. […] The total amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx could thus provide a better biomarker for plasticity than the previously considered amplitude and duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient [Evans and Blackwell, 2015].”</p><p>To argue for the overall impact of the present work, we would like to point out that our study is the first one (as far as we are aware) to model the contributions of both GluR1 and GluR2 to synaptic plasticity in the neocortex. This is significant since both subunits are strongly expressed in the neocortex. Our statistical plasticity rule based on the numbers GluR1 and GluR2 at the membrane is an important step in this prediction pipeline. To further verify our model according to higher-level plasticity data, we have now implemented the HFS and LFS using Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from a biophysically detailed model (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) as previously done for the STDP experiment. On the lack of general principles, we have now simplified Figure 7 to better highlight the most central model parameters affecting the plasticity outcomes in our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some of the design decisions are hard to follow.</p><p>For instance, why was the CaM activation made steeper?</p></disp-quote><p>A steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation curve has been observed in experiments. We are now showing the calcium-sensitivity of our CaM model and that of the old CaM model, overlaid with experimental data of Hoffman et al., 2014, in Figure 11B. We believe that this property of steeper CaM activation may be important for bidirectional LTP/LTD so that small amounts of calcium activate PKC but not PKA pathway, while larger calcium inputs also activate the PKA pathway – however, analyzing this particular question is out of the scope of the present work. Note that the data used to adjust the reactions was independent of the synaptic plasticity experiments we were trying to emulate. We have now addressed this:</p><p>“The response curve for CaM activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was steeper in this model (Figure 11B), which was in better accordance with recent experimental data [Hoffman et al., 2014]”.</p><p>In Figure 11B, we replaced the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in a 4xHFS protocol on the x-axis by the steady-state Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This is explained in the legend of Figure 11:</p><p>“Steady-state concentration of activated (bound by four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions) CaM in response to a prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> input amplitude when the two-step (grey) or three-step (black) activation of CaM by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used.

Changing the reaction rates would be a more conventional way. I wonder how these concentrations develop in the absence of stimulation. Do they stay the same, or do they have to be clamped to certain values?</p><p>Yet in the subsection “The model flexibly reproduces data from various cortical LTP/LTD experiments” other variables are changed to fit the data (what are 'factors for the protein concentrations'?).</p></disp-quote><p>For the model construction (Materials and methods), we changed reaction rates because experimental measurements of protein concentration are less common. On the other hand, for fitting data from various cortical regions our reasoning is that the reaction rates should be relatively constant across cells of the same type, and even across cell types. However, we know that the numbers of proteins vary dramatically depending on the metabolic state of the cell, and there are also cell-type-specific and age-dependent differences in the levels of expression of different proteins. We therefore kept the rate constants fixed and varied the concentrations of different species in the subsection “The model flexibly reproduces data from various cortical LTP/LTD experiments” to show that our model can reproduce a number of experimental data sets with the same reaction rates. This could be compared to fitting of Hodgkin-Huxley-type models, where usually the same activation and inactivation parameters are assumed for an ion-channel species in many cell types, but the maximal conductance term, relating to the number of ion channels per membrane area, is varied.</p><p>We now write:</p><p>“We chose to fit protein concentrations instead of reaction rates, since the reaction rates can be considered to be the same across cell types while the protein expression is known to be cell-type and age-dependent. This is analogous to fitting maximal conductances that correlate with ion-channel densities in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models instead of the ion-channel activation and inactivation curve parameters as is usually done in the fitting of biophysically detailed neuron models.”</p><p>The concentrations of the species are in a steady state when we start the stimulation, this is now shown in Figure 11—figure supplement 1.</p><p>By factors for protein concentrations we mean parameters that control the number of a handful of proteins. We have now clarified this:</p><p>“The concentrations of upstream PKA-pathway proteins R (β-adrenergic receptor), Gs, AC1, and AC8 were varied in proportion using a factor parameter f<sub>PKA</sub> ∈ [0,2], and, likewise, the concentrations of upstream PKC-pathway proteins mGluR, M1, Gq, and PLC using a factor parameter f<sub>PKC</sub> ∈ [0,2].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The model's complexity make it difficult to understand it's properties. For instance, does CaMKII act as a switch, and is the expression essentially binary (O'Connor and Wang)? Does it fit the observations of Nevian and Sakmann?</p></disp-quote><p>Our CaMKII model is not bistable, but once activated, CaMKII slowly becomes dephosphorylated (see reactions 52 and 56). The rate of this deactivation is dependent on the rate of CaMCa4 unbinding from phosphorylated CaMKII (reaction 56, forward reaction rate). These rate constants for CaMKII were tuned in a previous model to match the data of (De Koninck P and Schulman H, Science 1998 Jan 9;279(5348):227-30). However, due to the autophosphorylation of CaMKII, CaMKII activation is very steep (Figure 2I).</p><p>Our STDP model agrees with the data from Nevian and Sakmann, 2006, on the effects of decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel conductivity on LTD, namely, that a blockade decreases the amplitude of LTD. Our model suggests that these effects are due to decreased SK currents for post-pre intervals. Our model also agrees with their observation that the peak of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient is a poor predictor of the plasticity outcome. As for the molecular dependence of the STDP, Nevian and Sakmann, 2006, showed that the STDP they observed was dependent on mGluRs – our predictions agree that it is PLC-pathway-dependent, but in our model and in Seol et al., 2007, the activation of the PLC pathway was driven by cholinergic receptors instead of mGluRs.</p><p>We now write:</p><p>“The paired-pulse protocol of Figure 5M (involving both β-adrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation) caused an STDP in all cases, but decreasing the SK conductance shortened the post-pre LTD window and decreased the amplitude of LTD (Figure 5E). […] Our model predictions also agree with the observation that the plasticity outcome is not determined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude [Nevian and Sakmann, 2006], instead, our model suggests that the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a better predictor of the plasticity outcome: the correlation coefficient between the post-STDP synaptic conductance and the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1E) was 0.53, while that between the post-STDP synaptic conductance and the mean Ca<sup>2+</sup> input during the inter-stimulus interval (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1F) was 0.96 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The STDP curves look odd, with no below baseline LTD for short negative intervals.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original report, we measured the ISI from the onset of the pre-synaptic stimulus to the onset of the first post-synaptic stimulus. We have now changed the measurement of the ISI to be consistent with experimental conventions – it is now the interval from the pre-synaptic stimulus onset to the onset of the <italic>last</italic> post-synaptic stimulus (i.e., fourth somatic pulse). This means that our STDP curve is now shifted 30 ms to the right when using the four somatic stimulus pulses, separated by 10 ms. This has the consequence of now exhibiting below baseline LTD for short negative intervals. In the legend of Figure 5 we now write:</p><p>“Membrane potential at the dendritic spine when the pre-synaptic stimulation onset is 50 ms after (B), at the same time as (C), or 50 ms prior to (D) the onset of the last somatic stimulus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does the last sentence of the subsection “High-frequency stimulation causes LTP and low-frequency stimulation causes LTD in GluR1-GluR2-balanced synapses” really imply a causal relation, so that GluR2 endocytosis leads to potentiation or depression? If so, the mechanism was not clear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Our model uses the data of Oh et al., 2005, which shows that homomeric GluR1 receptors have much larger conductance than heteromeric GluR1-GluR2 tetramers (and that the conductance of homomeric GluR1 receptors, unlike that of heteromeric GluR1-GluR2 tetramers, is further increased through S831 phosphorylation). As decreasing GluR2 subunits from the spine membrane through S880 phosphorylation can significantly increase the proportion of homomeric GluR1 tetramers, our model predicts that this can lead to increase in the total conductance although the total number of AMPAR tetramers is decreased. We have now illustrated this more clearly in panels D and H of Figure 4 (earlier Figure 5) by adding a third pair of bars showing the contribution of homomeric GluR1s to the total synaptic conductance. In the legend of Figure 4, we write:</p><p>“D, H: The fraction of membrane-inserted GluR1 over all membrane-inserted GluR subunits (left), the probability of an AMPAR tetramer being homomeric GluR1 (middle), and the relative contribution of homomeric GluR1 subunits to the total conductance (i.e., summed conductance of homomeric GluR1 tetramers divided by the summed conductance of all tetramers; right).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The y-axis labels on the plots are odd.
