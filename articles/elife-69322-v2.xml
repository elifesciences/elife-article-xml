Some mouse Rp mutations recapitulate DBA phenotypes, although others lack erythropoietic or skeletal defects. We generated a conditional knockout mouse to partially delete <italic>Rps1</italic>2. Homozygous <italic>Rps12</italic> deletion resulted in embryonic lethality. Mice inheriting the <italic>Rps12</italic><italic><sup>KO/+</sup></italic> genotype had growth and morphological defects, pancytopenia, and impaired erythropoiesis. A striking reduction in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors in the bone marrow (BM) was associated with decreased ability to repopulate the blood system after competitive and non-competitive BM transplantation. <italic>Rps12</italic><italic><sup>KO/+</sup></italic> lost HSC quiescence, experienced ERK and MTOR activation, and increased global translation in HSC and progenitors. Post-natal heterozygous deletion of <italic>Rps12</italic> in hematopoietic cells using Tal1-Cre-ERT also resulted in pancytopenia with decreased HSC numbers. However, post-natal Cre-ERT induction led to reduced translation in HSCs and progenitors, suggesting that this is the most direct consequence of <italic>Rps12</italic> haploinsufficiency in hematopoietic cells. Thus, RpS12 has a strong requirement in HSC function, in addition to erythropoiesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosomal protein</kwd><kwd>ribosomopathy</kwd><kwd>RpS12</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>erythropoiesis</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM104213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Nicholas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56DK130895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gritsman</surname><given-names>Kira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK130895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gritsman</surname><given-names>Kira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HL146119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ames</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2K12GH102779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ames</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007319</institution-id><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Human Genetics Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gritsman</surname><given-names>Kira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA196973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gritsman</surname><given-names>Kira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRACDA/BETTR training Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award 2K12GH102779-07A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ames</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The homozygous and heterozygous phenotypes of mouse Rps12 deletion are described, highlighting pancytopenia reflecting roles in hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the cell, protein synthesis is one of the most energetically expensive processes, and both the specificity and overall level of translation are tightly regulated. The ribosome is the macromolecular machine tasked with translating mRNAs into proteins and, as such, plays an essential role in the physiology of the cell. Ribosomes are evolutionarily conserved ribonucleoprotein complexes composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and Rp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yonath and Franceschi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson and Doudna Cate, 2012</xref>). They catalyze protein synthesis in all cell types, providing a supply line of steady-state levels of necessary cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson and Doudna Cate, 2012</xref>). The functional components of the ribosome are highly conserved, and in higher eukaryotes consist of a small subunit (SSU: 40 S) and a large subunit (LSU: 60 S). These ribosomal subunits contain a total of 79 ribosomal proteins in eukaryotes, including 34 ribosomal proteins that are also conserved in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petibon et al., 2021</xref>). In most cell types, ribosomal protein genes are among the most highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geiger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Most ribosomal proteins are essential for ribosome biogenesis and function, which makes them essential for cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de la Cruz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of ribosomes, mutations in components of the ribosome or the ribosome biogenesis pathway in humans result in a group of diseases known as ribosomopathies. Despite the essential role of the ribosome in all cell types, this group of diseases is characterized by the presence of defects in specific tissues. Heterozygous loss of function mutations in many <italic>Rp</italic> genes leads to DBA, a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by macrocytic anemia, skeletal defects, and increased cancer risk. In DBA patients, mutations have been identified in 21 out of the 79 existing <italic>Rp</italic> genes, along with the GATA1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ulirsch et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, in approximately 30–40% of DBA patient cases a mutation has not yet been identified. The fact that only a subset of all Rp genes has been found altered in DBA patients poses the question of whether mutations in any <italic>Rp</italic> gene can result in DBA and, if not, what would be the consequences for mutations in those <italic>Rp</italic> genes.</p><p>The generation and characterization of mice with mutations in <italic>Rp</italic> genes in recent years have begun to shed light on this question. Mutations in <italic>Rp</italic> genes of both the large and the small ribosomal subunits have been found to have similar phenotypes to those of DBA patients, such as impaired erythropoiesis, skeletal defects, and increased incidence of cancer, including some Rp not yet implicated in DBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oliver et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGowan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaako et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terzian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgado-Palacin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>). However, erythropoietic defects are not always reported for mutants in <italic>Rp</italic> genes, including some that are implicated in human DBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watkins-Chow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kazerounian et al., 2016</xref>). Skeletal defects, but not impaired erythropoiesis, have been reported in mutants of <italic>Rpl24</italic> or <italic>Rps7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oliver et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watkins-Chow et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition, a variety of other defects are reported in particular genotypes, ranging from embryonic lethality to brain defects, pigmentation defects, and defects in other aspects of hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGowan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terzian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watkins-Chow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgado-Palacin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Rps12</italic> gene, which is not yet implicated in DBA, reportedly has special functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that differ from those of most Rp. Heterozygous loss of 66 out of the 79 <italic>Drosophila Rp</italic> genes results in a ‘Minute’ phenotype, named for its small adult sensory bristles and also characterized by delayed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marygold et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, ‘Minute’ <italic>Rp<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> are eliminated by wild-type (WT) neighboring cells when they are found together in developing tissues, by a process known as cell competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clavería and Torres, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker, 2020</xref>). Remarkably, delayed development, reduced translation, cell competition, and other aspects of the ‘Minute’ phenotype depend on the Rps12 protein, which seems to be required for haploinsufficient effects of other <italic>Rp</italic> genes, suggesting that Rps12 acts as a sensor or reporter of deficits in other Rp. Accordingly, increasing the copy number of <italic>Rps12</italic> enhances these ‘Minute’ phenotypes caused by mutations in other <italic>Rp</italic> genes, whereas reducing the <italic>Rps12</italic> gene copy number suppresses them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boulan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Rps12 forms part of the beak region of the 40 S small ribosomal subunit (SSU), near to the mRNA entry channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Rps12</italic> is one of the few <italic>Rp</italic> genes whose null mutation does not present a ‘Minute’ bristle phenotype in heterozygosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marygold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kale et al., 2018</xref>). In mammals, it has been reported that <italic>Rps12</italic> deletions are frequent in diffuse large B cell lymphoma samples, and that Rps12 distribution in the ribosomes is altered under hypoxic conditions in the human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, resulting in changes of their translatome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Derenzini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brumwell et al., 2020</xref>). Human Rps12 has also emerged as a candidate regulator of Wnt secretion in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Katanaev et al., 2020</xref>). However, the phenotype of <italic>Rps12</italic> deletion in mammals has not been determined.</p><p>Protein synthesis regulation is important in stem cells. To maintain proper homeostasis, HSCs sustain the balance between a quiescent and an actively dividing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2017</xref>). Quiescent HSCs require low rates of protein synthesis, and even HSCs exiting quiescence still exhibit significantly lower translation rates than more differentiated progenitors. Both increases and decreases in protein synthesis levels can impair HSC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Signer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The AKT/MTORC1 signaling pathway is one of the best-known signaling pathways that regulate translation, in part through the expression of ribosomal proteins and translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>). Hyperactivation of AKT signaling is deleterious for normal HSC function, and results in increased HSC cycling, with depletion of the stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yilmaz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kharas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Magee et al., 2012</xref>). Activation of AKT by stem cell factor (SCF) and other growth factors leads to the activation of MTOR, which results in the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the protein initiation factor 4E binding protein1 (4EBP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gentilella et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphorylation of S6 by S6K1 at Serine 235/Ser236 is associated with increased protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krieg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roux and Topisirovic, 2018</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by MTOR at the Thr37 and Thr46 residues primes it for dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E, also activating translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schalm et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, another important pathway regulating growth and translation, the MEK/ERK pathway, has been shown to phosphorylate S6 at Serine 235/Ser236 promoting the translation preinitiation complex in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roux et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the specific functions of <italic>Rp</italic> genes, their potential involvement in DBA, and the regulation of translation, we determined the phenotype of <italic>Rps12</italic> deletion in mice. We generated a conditional knock-out mouse, <italic>Rps12<sup>flox/flox</sup>,</italic> which, when crossed to embryonically expressed Ella-Cre recombinase, allowed us to generate homozygous (<italic>Rps12<sup>KO/KO</sup></italic>) and heterozygous knock-out mice (<italic>Rps12<sup>KO/+</sup></italic>). We report that, while homozygous loss of <italic>Rps12</italic> is lethal early in embryogenesis, the viable heterozygous <italic>Rps12<sup>KO/+</sup></italic> phenotype includes reduced body size, morphological defects, and, in some cases, hydrocephalus. Similar to DBA patients, and some other previously published <italic>Rp</italic> mouse mutants, <italic>Rps12<sup>KO/+</sup></italic> mice present a block in erythroid maturation, lower red cell counts, and decreased spleen size. However, reduction in <italic>Rps12</italic> also leads to a striking reduction in the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, as well as significantly altered progenitor populations, leading to overall reduced bone marrow cellularity and a decreased ability of <italic>Rps12<sup>KO/+</sup></italic> BM cells to repopulate the blood system, uncovering an impairment in HSC and progenitor function. Inducible, conditional heterozygous deletion of <italic>Rps12</italic> in adult hematopoietic cells also led to decreased HSC and progenitor cell numbers and pancytopenia. Interestingly, global translation was decreased after acute deletion, but increased in mice heterozygous for <italic>Rps12</italic> from fertilization. Our work has uncovered important roles for RpS12 in translation and signaling in hematopoietic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Rps12</italic> haploinsufficiency results in a pleiotropic phenotype, including delayed growth and increased mortality</title><p>To test the role of the Rps12 protein in a mammal, we used CRISPR gene editing to generate a mouse line with <italic>LoxP</italic> sites flanking exons 2 and 3 of the endogenous <italic>Rps12</italic> locus (<italic>Rps12<sup>flox</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Excision of these two exons generates an allele that cannot produce functional RpS12 protein, since exon 2 contains the ATG translation initiation codon. We chose not to eliminate the entire <italic>Rps12</italic> locus, to avoid deleting the small nucleolar RNA genes <italic>Snord100</italic> and <italic>Snora33</italic>, which are located in introns 4 and 5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Such an increase would in fact be expected as a result of the striking activation of the AKT/MTOR and ERK pathways. <italic>Rps12<sup>KO/+</sup></italic> c-Kit+ hematopoietic progenitors also have lower phosphorylated eIF2α, which would also predict higher translation levels. Importantly, however, detailed studies of <italic>Rps12</italic> depletion from ribosomes in yeast clearly demonstrate a strong reduction in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martín-Villanueva et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Inducible, conditional post-natal deletion of <italic>Rps12</italic> in hematopoietic cells revealed a sequence of events over time (summarized in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>)). Loss of <italic>Rps12</italic> in adult hematopoietic cells led to decreased translation in HSPCs, and then a decreasing HSC pool over time, with decreased BM cellularity and pancytopenia, but no significant effects on HSC quiescence. Thus, it appears that initially Rps12 is required to maintain translation levels in the adult hematopoietic system. The more complicated phenotype of the full-body <italic>Rps12<sup>KO/+</sup></italic> mouse may reflect an earlier developmental effect on the BM, and a potential effect on the BM microenvironment. Furthermore, this phenotype could reflect compensatory changes due to loss of HSC maintenance, reflected in the observed increases in MTOR signaling, translation, and HSC cycling.</p><p>The fact that <italic>Rps12<sup>KO/+</sup></italic> mice exhibit fully-penetrant pancytopenia with a severe bone marrow failure phenotype, in addition to the erythropoiesis defect, raises the possibility that <italic>Rps12</italic> might not have been found mutated in DBA patients due to a more severe human phenotype of <italic>Rps12</italic> mutation that is not classified as DBA. Perhaps only a hypomorphic <italic>Rps12</italic> genotype would be associated with DBA. While caution is required extrapolating from mouse phenotypes to humans, our study nevertheless raises the possibility that <italic>Rps12</italic> could in fact be a candidate gene not only for DBA, but for a broader group of bone marrow failure disorders. One reason that genetic alterations in <italic>Rps12</italic> have not yet been reported in DBA or other bone marrow failure disorders could be that <italic>Rps12</italic> is not included in the most common targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels used in the diagnosis of these disorders, some of which report molecular diagnostic rates of only 44–59% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghemlas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muramatsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gálvez et al., 2021</xref>). We suggest that <italic>Rps12</italic> should be included in expanded NGS panels for bone marrow failure disorders or should be sequenced in patients in whom there are no molecular findings in the standard NGS panels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EIIa-Cre (FVB/N-Tg(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd/J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:003724">IMSR_JAX:003724</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.SJL-Ptprca/<break/>BoyAiTac (CD45.1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:002014">IMSR_JAX:002014</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RpS12<sup>flox/flox</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rps12<sup>em1Nbakr</sup> MGI:6388411</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated for this study</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Scl-Cre-ER</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:037466">IMSR_JAX:037466</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RpS12<sup>flox/+;</sup> Scl-Cre-ER</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated for this study</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rat monoclonal CD16/CD32</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BD biosciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

Unless indicated, these mice were kept as heterozygous by crossing them with C57BL/6 J, and the presence of the EIIa-Cre transgene was crossed out. In each case, the genotypes were confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from tails using a DNeasy kit from Qiagen (#69504). Peripheral blood samples were collected via facial vein bleeding under isoflurane anesthesia, and blood counts were obtained using the Genesis analyzer (Oxford Science). To generate growth curves, 5-day-old pups were genotyped and numbered by cutting toes. Pups’ weight was measured daily from day 5–21 of age.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of <italic>Rps12<sup>flox</sup></italic> knock-in mice</title><p>A pair of guide-RNAs (gRNAs) targeting intron 1 and intron 3 of the <italic>Rps12</italic> gene, respectively were designed by an online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu/</ext-link>) and generated by in vitro transcription.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to formally exclude the possibility that expression of the small nucleolar genes Snord100 and Snora33, located in Rps12 introns 4 and 5, respectively, is also perturbed by the deletion of Rps12 exon 2. Any change in the expression of these snoRNAs would confound the interpretation that all the described phenotypes map back to Rsp12 specifically. Along these lines, the authors should also provide data to assess the impact of the Rps12 mutation on Rps12 protein expression.</p><p>2) Northern blots and/or other molecular assays should be used to characterize the extent to which haploinsufficiency of RpS12 impacts overall ribosome biogenesis. In addition, polysome profiles in the Rps12 mutant animals should be analyzed to assess 40S/60S subunits, 80S monosomes and polysomes.</p><p>3) The authors need to devise experiments to distinguish between direct and indirect consequences of Rps12 loss. For example, the authors should examine the extent to which acute loss of Rps12 regulates HSPCs, ribosome biogenesis and assembly, and ribosome composition. Cell proliferation, survival, and protein synthesis rate assays require fewer cells than polysome profiling, and these experiments would begin to provide insights into the direct cellular consequences of Rps12 haploinsufficiency.</p><p>These three points cover many of the shared concerns of the reviewers. The authors should do their best to address the individual critiques of each of the reviewers (see below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The expression of both snoRNAs should be evaluated in the homozygous and heterozygous mutants. The expression levels of Rps12 protein should also be determined in the heterozygous mutants.</p><p>2) Rescue of Rps12 mutant phenotypes by a Rps12 transgene should be conducted, given the probability that the expression of the snoRNAs will be disrupted in the mutant.</p><p>3) Northern blots and/or other molecular assays should be used to characterize the extent to which haploinsufficiency of RpS12 impacts overall ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>4) Have the authors considered the possibility that loss of Rps12 triggers a feedback loop that promotes ribosome biogenesis? The authors could evaluate nascent rRNA transcription levels as one measure of how the loss of this RP gene impacts ribosome homeostasis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Key points</p><p>1. Have the authors formally excluded the possibility that expression of the small nucleolar genes Snord100 and Snora33, located in Rps12 introns 4 and 5, respectively, is also perturbed by the deletion of Rps12 exon 2 i.e. can they be sure that all the phenotypes are indeed Rps12-dependent?</p><p>2. Please provide data to assess the impact of the Rps12 mutation on Rps12 protein expression.</p><p>3. It is important to analyze the potential functional consequences of Rps12 deletion on ribosomal subunit assembly. Polysome profiles in the Rps12 mutant animals should be analyzed to assess 40S/60S subunits, 80S monosomes and polysomes. Is there any effect of Rps12 deletion on rRNA processing?</p><p>4. To what extent are the observed Rps12 mutant phenotypes indirect consequences of TP53 activation? What is the impact of the Rps12 mutation on TP53 stabilization in the different tissues affected by the mutation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few key experiments may help elucidate the mechanisms by which Rps12 regulates HSPCs.</p><p>1. Since this is a floxed allele, it is possible to induce acute loss of Rps12 (or Rps f/+) in vivo or ex vivo in HSPCs, to study the impact of the acute loss of Rps12. Does Rps12 haploinsufficiency reduce protein synthesis or really increase protein synthesis as shown in this manuscript?</p><p>2. Following up on point #1 experiment, polysome profiling will further dissect the role of Rps12 in ribosome biogenesis and assembly.</p><p>3. Has this (polysome profiling and signaling transduction) been done in hematopoietic cell line with Rps12 knockdown or CRISPR-mediated deletion of one allele of Rps12? If not, the authors should investigate the role of Rps12 in mammalian hematopoietic cell lines.</p><p>4. It is important to devise experiments to distinguish the direct and indirect consequences of Rps12 loss. The ERK/mTOR signaling activation and increases in protein synthesis were consequences, or negative feedback of Rps12 loss?</p><p>5. It is important to devise experiments to distinguish the ribosomal and extraribosomal function of Rps12 in mammalian cells.</p><p>6. The phenotypes presented in this manuscript showed a strong HSPCs and pan-hematopoietic effects. Erythropoiesis was actually less affected. The narrative and discussion should reflect that, and de-emphasize its role in or similarity to DBA. In particular, RPS12 is not found mutated in DBA? Thus, this mouse model is not really relevant to DBA.</p><p>7. It is interesting that Rps12 haploinsufficiency does not affect fetal liver hematopoiesis or erythropoiesis, but strongly impacts this process in adult. The explanation of this phenotype may not have anything to do with HSPC cycling rate difference between fetal liver versus bone marrow HSPCs, as speculated in the Discussion. It is important to note that a number of other mouse models such as MplKO mice, also have little phenotypes in fetal liver HSCs but strong phenotypes in adult bone marrow HSCs. Fetal liver and adult bone marrow HSPCs have different transcriptional programs, no coding RNAs, and epigenetic landscapes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69322.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to formally exclude the possibility that expression of the small nucleolar genes Snord100 and Snora33, located in Rps12 introns 4 and 5, respectively, is also perturbed by the deletion of Rps12 exon 2.

In any case, it would be technically difficult to perform polysome profiling from the reduced numbers of stem and progenitor cells available in the mutant.

To determine the direct acute effects of Rps12 deletion specifically in hematopoietic cells, we generated a new RpS12flox/+; SCl<sup>-</sup>CreER mouse model which allowed us to acutely delete the RpS12 in the bone marrow. This new data is included in the new Figure 8 and Suppl Figure 4., and in the text in the Results section on p16 lines 367 and in the Discussion on page 20, line 507-522. We observed that it takes some time to develop the loss of HSC maintenance and pancytopenia phenotype after Rsp12 hetorozygous excision. Interestingly, at 12-weeks post RpS12 deletion in the bone marrow, there were no changes in peripheral blood counts, total bone marrow cellularity, or in the bone marrow stem and progenitor cell populations (Figure 8C). However, at that timepoint we already observed a significant decrease in OPP incorporation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, consistent with decreased translation (Figure 8D). However, there were no significant differences in the cell cycle profile of these HSPCs at that time point (Supp Figure 2D). At 14-weeks post <italic>RpS12</italic> deletion, we started to observe mild pancytopenia (Figure 8E) and a significant decrease in bone marrow cellularity, along with a decrease in HSC numbers and a trend toward decrease in progenitor populations (Figure 8F). These data suggest that the immediate effect of acute loss of RpS12 in adult hematopoietic cells is actually decreased translation, leading to a decrease in HSCs, BM cellularity and pancytopenia. This also suggests that the increased cell cycling, AKT/ERK/MTOR signaling, and translation that we observed in Rps12 KO/+ mice with embryonic deletion were likely compensatory to this loss in HSC maintenance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The ERK/mTOR signaling activation and increases in protein synthesis were consequences, or negative feedback of Rps12 loss?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our new model we think that the direct effect of Rps 12 loss in hematopoietic cells is decreased translation, leading to impaired HSC maintenance (see the response to point 1 and results in Figures 8 and Supplementary Figure 4). Therefore, we think that the increased translation that was observed in Rps12 KO/+ mice with embryonic deletion was compensatory due to loss of HSCs. We discuss our current understanding in lines 441-445 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

RPS12 has not been included in any standard NGS panels for bone marrow failure syndromes. We think our report of hematopoietic phenotypes in Rsp12 KO mice should prompt the inclusion of RPS12 in future bone marrow failure NGS panels. We discuss this in lines 446-460.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
