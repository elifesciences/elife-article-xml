The absence of Srsf2 in MyoD + progenitors resulted in perinatal mortality in mice, accompanied by severe skeletal muscle defects. SRSF2 deficiency disrupts the directional migration of MyoD progenitors, causing them to disperse into both muscle and non-muscle regions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant alterations in Srsf2-deficient myoblasts, including a reduction in extracellular matrix components, diminished expression of genes involved in ameboid-type cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, mitosis irregularities, and premature differentiation. Notably, one of the targets regulated by Srsf2 is the serine/threonine kinase Aurka. Knockdown of <italic>Aurka</italic> led to reduced cell proliferation, disrupted cytoskeleton, and impaired differentiation, reflecting the effects seen with <italic>Srsf2</italic> knockdown. Crucially, the introduction of exogenous Aurka in <italic>Srsf2</italic>-knockdown cells markedly alleviated the differentiation defects caused by <italic>Srsf2</italic> knockdown. Furthermore, our research unveiled the role of Srsf2 in controlling alternative splicing within genes associated with human skeletal muscle diseases, such as <italic>BIN1</italic>, <italic>DMPK</italic>, <italic>FHL1</italic>, and <italic>LDB3</italic>. Specifically, the precise knockdown of the <italic>Bin1</italic> exon17-containing variant, which is excluded following <italic>Srsf2</italic> depletion, profoundly disrupted C2C12 cell differentiation. In summary, our study offers valuable insights into the role of SRSF2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions, thereby controlling their differentiation through the regulation of targeted genes and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SRSF2</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle development</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2021YFC2103001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007129</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2021QH151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008853</institution-id><institution>Jining Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JYHL2022MS26</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Huimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Scientific Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19JC1416000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31870819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31570818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic mouse models combined with single-cell RNA sequencing reveal the essential role of SRSF2 in directing MyoD progenitors to distinct skeletal muscle domains and controlling their differentiation through the regulation of targeted genes and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myogenic progenitors (MPCs) are a specialized type of precursor cell responsible for the formation of skeletal muscle cells during embryonic development. The process begins with the transformation of the dermomyotome into segmented structures known as somites, which serve as a reservoir for MPCs expressing essential transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Relaix et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). These MPCs acquire their myogenic identity by activating specific myogenic regulatory factors, including Myf5, MyoD, Myog, and Myf6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Braun and Gautel, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Among these factors, Myf5 + progenitors are key players in expanding the myogenic progenitor pool through extensive proliferation, as well as in the initial migration from somites to muscle-forming regions and the establishment of early muscle primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tajbakhsh et al., 1996</xref>). The absence of Pax3 and Myf5 results in the inactivation of MyoD, ultimately leading to the absence of skeletal muscles in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tajbakhsh et al., 1997</xref>). This highlights the hierarchical relationship between Myf5 and MyoD, with Myf5 acting as an upstream regulator of MyoD. Myf5 +progenitors serve as a source for MyoD + progenitors, these two populations collaborate in a coordinated manner to ensure the proper formation and growth of skeletal muscles during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rodriguez-Outeiriño et al., 2021</xref>). In the perinatal stages, MPCs play a crucial role in establishing the satellite cell (SC) pool, which serves as a reservoir of muscle stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). MyoD was not expressed in quiescent SCs but showed high levels of expression in activated and proliferative myoblasts, which are the progeny of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytoskeleton play vital roles in maintaining the structural integrity of cells and tissues, while also exerting a profound influence on cell behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csapo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Urso and Kurniawan, 2020</xref>). Specifically, the ECM serves as a scaffold for cell adhesion and migration, playing a critical role in regulating signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csapo et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the cytoskeleton is responsible for maintaining cell shape and polarity, facilitating intracellular transport, and aiding in cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Urso and Kurniawan, 2020</xref>). In the context of skeletal muscle development, interactions of MPCs with the ECM, as well as the dynamic rearrangements of the cytoskeleton, are critical for guiding the directional migration of MPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Actin filaments, a fundamental component of the cytoskeleton, undergo dynamic changes leading to the formation of protrusions like lamellipodia and filopodia, which assist in forward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lappalainen et al., 2022</xref>). Meanwhile, microtubules, another critical part of the cytoskeleton, contribute to cell polarity and play a role in establishing and maintaining direction during migration. The reduction of both ECM and cytoskeleton components has a significant impact on myoblast migration, cell division, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Osses et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It’s noteworthy that splicing and transcription regulator SRSF2 emerges as a critical regulator that inhibits apoptosis in My5 + progenitors and maintains their migratory capability during embryonic skeletal muscle development. The absence of Srsf2 in Myf5 + progenitors leads to a high rate of myoblasts apoptosis, as well as aberrant migration, ultimately resulting in the complete loss of mature myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). This emphasizes the essential role of Srsf2 in promoting the survival of Myf5 + progenitors and its significance in ensuring the successful progression of skeletal muscle development.</p><p>In this study, we observed that the absence of Srsf2 in MyoD + progenitors resulted in the perinatal mortality in mice, primarily due to respiratory failure. <italic>Srsf2</italic> deficiency markedly disrupted the directional migration capacity of MyoD + progenitors, causing them to disperse into both muscle and non-muscle regions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed notable changes in Srsf2-deficient myoblasts, including reduced ECM components, diminished expression of genes involved in ameboid-type cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, mitosis irregularities, and impaired differentiation. Significantly, Srsf2 regulates the expression of the serine/threonine kinase Aurka. Knockdown of <italic>Aurka</italic> resulted in decreased cell proliferation and impaired differentiation, resembling <italic>Srsf2</italic> knockdown effects. Aurka overexpression in <italic>Srsf2</italic>-depleted cells significantly rescued the differentiation defects, underscoring the critical role of Srsf2-regulated <italic>Aurka</italic> expression in myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated the involvement of Srsf2 in alternative splicing of genes linked to human skeletal muscle diseases, including <italic>BIN1</italic>, <italic>DMPK</italic>, <italic>FHL1</italic>, and <italic>LDB3</italic>. Specifically, targeted knockdown of the <italic>Bin1</italic> exon17-containing variant, skipped upon <italic>Srsf2</italic> depletion, severely disrupted myoblast differentiation. In summary, our study provides valuable insights into SRSF2’s role in directing MyoD progenitors to distinct muscle regions, thereby regulating their differentiation through targeted gene regulation and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inactivation of <italic>Srsf2</italic> in MyoD+ progenitors led to significant differentiation defects in skeletal muscle, resulting in perinatal death in mice</title><p>The absence of <italic>Srsf2</italic> in Myf5 + progenitors results in a significant increase in myoblasts apoptosis during embryonic development.

These muscle abnormalities were consistently observed in the tongue and diaphragm as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, bottom panel). In transverse sections of the diaphragm from KO mice, there was a noticeable reduction in diaphragm thickness and the presence of cavities within the muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

To gain deeper insights, we conducted transmission electron microscopy experiments to examine the sarcomere and Triad structures in the hindlimb sections. Sarcomeres are characterized by their highly organized structure, while Triads are specialized structures involved in the regulation of calcium ions required for muscle contraction. Our findings revealed well-organized sarcomere and Triad structures in the WT group. In contrast, these structures were substantially disrupted in the KO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Subsequently, these cells underwent proliferation and differentiation, ultimately culminating in their significant contributions to the development of a highly organized muscle structure. In <italic>tdT</italic>/KO sections, MyoD-derived cells not only migrated into the intended muscle region but also dispersed widely into numerous non-muscular territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, white arrows). This intriguing pattern strongly suggests migration defects of MyoD-derived cells resulting from the loss of Srsf2 at this stage. Moreover, even within the confines of the muscle region, <italic>tdT</italic>/KO embryos displayed a marked reduction in the degree of cellular differentiation when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This impaired differentiation ultimately led to a noticeable lack of precise co-localization between tdT and MHC signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the migratory defects observed in E14.5 KO sections, in the hindlimb sections of E15.5 KO mice, as well as the hindlimb and intercostal muscle sections of KO mice at the perinatal stage (P1), tdT staining also revealed a substantial presence of MyoD-derived cells distributed beyond the muscle regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>, white arrows). These findings further confirmed that the deficiency in SRSF2 profoundly impacts the capacity of MyoD-derived cells to undergo directed migration specifically into the skeletal muscle region.</p><p>Moreover, we conducted immunostaining on both longitudinal and cross-sections of the diaphragm in newborn mice (P1). In the control group, our examination of longitudinal sections revealed a remarkable co-localization between the tdT signals and the densely compacted muscle fibers stained with MHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Within the cross-sectional views, the tdT-stained regions exhibited a consistent and well-organized arrangement, surrounded by laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In contrast, the KO mice exhibited noticeable gaps between muscle fibers in the longitudinal sections of the diaphragm, with only tdT signals present within these loosely arranged fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, white arrows). Furthermore, the tdT-stained areas appeared disorganized within the cross-sectional views, characterized by numerous cavities within them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, white arrows).

Notably, Srsf2 emerges as a critical regulator that inhibits apoptosis in My5 + progenitors and maintains their migratory capability during embryonic skeletal muscle development. The absence of Srsf2 in Myf5 + progenitors leads to a high rate of myoblasts apoptosis at embryonic day E12.5, as well as aberrant migration, ultimately resulting in the complete loss of mature myofibers.</p><p>MyoD + progenitors contribute to additional migration within muscle primordia, as they move to their final destinations within developing muscle tissues. They exhibit high efficiency in differentiation into myotubes and muscle fibers. Deletion of <italic>Srsf2</italic> in MyoD + progenitors markedly disrupts their ability to migrate in a specific direction and subsequently impairs their differentiation process.</p><p>scRNA-seq analysis revealed substantial diversity within the fetal skeletal muscle cell population in the diaphragm. This diversity included non-cycling SCs, activated myoblasts, cycling myoblasts, committed myoblasts, and myocytes. Our findings aligned with the observed diversity in muscle progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nalbandian et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, the deficiency of <italic>Srsf2</italic> resulted in an increased number of myocytes while simultaneously reducing the population of committed myoblasts. In the context of skeletal muscle differentiation, Myh8, Ckm, and Acta1 are critical for the formation of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nowak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schiaffino et al., 2015</xref>).

However, the expression of <italic>Myh8</italic>, <italic>Ckm,</italic> and <italic>Acta1</italic> was significantly advanced at an earlier stage in the differentiation process, while there was a concurrent downregulation of <italic>MyoK</italic> and <italic>Myox</italic> in the absence of Srsf2. This suggests that enhanced differentiation was defective in the KO group.</p><p>scRNA-seq analysis further revealed significant effects of Srsf2 on the downregulation of ECM components, genes associated with ameboid-type cell migration, and cytoskeleton organization. The reduction of both ECM and cytoskeleton components has a significant impact on myoblast migration, cell division, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Osses et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, one of the targets regulated by Srsf2 is Aurka, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell division processes via the regulation of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2021</xref>). The chromosome passenger complex, which includes Aurka, inhibits the shrinkage of microtubules, thereby promoting cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Namgoong and Kim, 2018</xref>). Our data revealed that the knockdown of <italic>Aurka</italic> led to reduced cell proliferation, disrupted cytoskeleton, and impaired differentiation, which mirrored the effects observed with the <italic>Srsf2</italic> knockdown. Importantly, overexpression of HA-Aurka in <italic>Srsf2</italic>-knockdown cells substantially rescued the differentiation defects observed following SRSF2 knockdown. These findings provided evidence that Srsf2-regulated <italic>Aurka</italic> expression is critical for differentiation of C2C12 cells.</p><p>In addition to its role in transcription regulation, SRSF2 also has a significant impact on the alternative splicing regulation of genes related to human skeletal muscle diseases. Dysregulated alternative splicing of <italic>BIN1</italic> has been linked to T-tubule alterations and muscle weakness in myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fugier et al., 2011</xref>). BIN1 is involved in forming tubular of membrane invaginations and is critical for the development of muscle T-tubules, specialized membrane structures essential for excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the <italic>BIN1</italic> gene can lead to centronuclear myopathy, a condition that shares some histopathological features with myotonic dystrophy. MBNL1 binds the <italic>BIN1</italic> pre-mRNA and regulates its alternative splicing. Skipping of exon11 in BIN1 results in the expression of an inactive form of <italic>BIN1</italic> lacking phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate-binding and membrane-tubulating activities. Notably, the deletion of <italic>Srsf2</italic> resulted in centronuclear features in skeletal muscle, and induced exon17 skipping in <italic>Bin1</italic>, which resides within the Myc-binding domain of Bin1 protein. Targeted knockdown of the <italic>Bin1</italic> exon17-containing variant significantly disrupted C2C12 cell differentiation. Further investigation is imperative to comprehend the involvement of SRSF2 and its regulation of exon17 inclusion in <italic>BIN1</italic> in human skeletal muscle diseases.</p><p>In summary, our research provides valuable insights into the role of Srsf2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions, thereby controlling myogenic differentiation through the regulation of targeted gens and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of conditional knockout mice</title><p><italic>Srsf2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were obtained from Dr. Fu at Westlake University.

The raw data was processed using Cutadapt to trim 3’ adapter sequences and reads with an average quality score below Q20 were removed, resulting in clean data. The clean data reads were then aligned to the mouse transcriptome (GRCm38/mm10) using HISAT2, an updated version of TopHat2. Gene expression levels were calculated based on the alignment results. Further analyses, including differential expression, enrichment, and alternative splicing analyses, were performed on the samples. DESeq was used for differential analysis of gene expression and GO enrichment analysis was performed using topGO. The alternative splicing analysis was performed with rMATs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell culture, differentiation, transfection, and immunostaining</title><p>C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from the National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (Shanghai, China) and verified by STR analysis (Microread Genetics Co., Ltd, Beijing). Mycoplasma contamination was not detected in C2C12 cells. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of C2C12 cells were performed using siRNA or plasmids. The <italic>Aurka</italic> overexpression plasmid was constructed using the longest NM isoform and inserted into the <italic>pCDNA3.0-HA</italic> plasmid vector. Myogenic diﬀerentiation of C2C12 cells was activated by replacing the growth medium with a diﬀerentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum). The transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX or Lipofectamine 200, both from Invitrogen, following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 hr of transfection, or induction into differentiation for 3 days, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. Then, permeabilization was done using 0.1% Triton X-100, and the cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 hr. Subsequent staining was performed following the same protocol as tissue immunofluorescence staining.

The RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For differential expression analysis, qPCR was performed with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit (TaKaRa) with <italic>Rplp0</italic> serving as the internal control. For alternative splicing analysis, RT-PCR was conducted following the previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).

The diaphragms were cut to pieces, and then digested in a solution containing 0.2% (wt/vol) collagenase-type XI (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.4 U mL<sup>–1</sup> dispase ॥ (Invitrogen) in DMEM at 37℃ for 45 minutes. The digested tissue was filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer and a 70 μm cell strainer. The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in a 20% FBS/PBS buffer, and counted using an automated cell counter. The cells were loaded onto a droplet-based library prep platform Chromium (10 X Genomics) with a Chromium Single Cell Reagent Kit following the instructions provided in the protocol. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Nova 6000 using 150-base pair paired-end reads. The sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were carried out by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All statistical analyses, unless otherwise specified, were performed using R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>scRNA-seq data preprocessing</title><p>The Cell Ranger software pipeline (10 X Genomics, version 5.0.0) was utilized to assess data quality statistics on the raw data and map reads to the reference genome, resulting in a matrix of gene counts versus cells. Cells of low quality, such as double capture cells, multiple capture cells, or cells with more than 10% of counts from mitochondrial genes, were filtered out based on the nUMI, nGene, and percent. mito criteria using the R package Seurat (version 3.1.1). After applying these quality control measures, a total of 12,592 cells from the WT group and 14,875 cells from the <italic>Srsf2</italic>-KO group were available for further analysis. The library size was normalized using the NormalizeData function in Seurat, and dimensionality reduction was performed using the RunPCA function. Cell clusters were identified using the FindCluster in Seurat, and visualized using a two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm with the RunSNE function. Marker genes for each cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers function, and cell types were manually determined based on cluster-specific marker genes and known marker genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the FindMarkers function (test.use=MAST) in Seurat (p-value &lt;0.05 and | log2foldchange |&gt;0.58). Additionally, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were conducted using an R package based on the hypergeometric distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pseudotime analysis</title><p>The developmental pseudotime was determined using the Monocle2 package (version 2.9.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). The raw count was first converted from a Seurat object into a CellDataSet object using the importCDS function in Monocle. The differentialGeneTest function of the Monocle2 package was then used to select ordering genes (qval &lt;0.01) that were likely to be informative in the ordering of cells along the pseudotime trajectory. Dimensional reduction clustering analysis was performed using the reduceDimension function, followed by trajectory inference with the orderCells function using default parameters. Gene expression was plotted using the plot_genes_in_pseudotime function to track changes over pseudo-time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>For western blot analysis, proteins were collected from C2C12 cells using RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).

Deletion of SRFS2 in MyoD+ progenitor cells resulted in a defect in the directional migration of these cells and resulted in the presence of myoD+ progenitor in both nonmuscle and muscle tissues. The authors showed a defect in gene program regulation ECM, cell migration, cytoskeletal organization, and skeletal muscle differentiation by scRNA-seq. The authors further showed that many of these processes are regulated by a downstream target of SRFS2, the serine-threonine kinase Aurka. Finally, the authors showed that SRFS2 acts as a splicing factor and could contribute to differentiation by controlling the splicing of muscle-specific transcripts. This study addresses an important question in skeletal muscle development by focusing on the pathways and factors that regulate the migration of myoD+ progenitors and the impact of this process in skeletal muscle differentiation. This work is interesting but requires experimental evidence to support the findings.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The regulators of myod+progenitor migration during skeletal muscle development is not completely understood. This work demonstrates that SRFS2 and aura kinase are key players in the process. Combining knockout and reporter lines in mice, the authors perform a detailed analysis of skeletal muscle cells to demonstrate the specific defects in SRFS2 in skeletal muscle development.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>This work explores an interesting question on regulating myoD+ progenitors and the defects of this process in skeletal muscle differentiation by SRFS2 but spreads out in many directions rather than focusing on the key defects. A number of approaches are used, but they lack the robust mechanistic analysis of the defects that result in muscle differentiation. Specifically, the role of SRFS2 on splicing appears to be a misfit here and does not explain the primary defects in the migration of myoD+ progenitors. There are concerns about the scRNA-seq and many transcripts in muscle biology that are not expressed in muscle cells. Focusing on main defects and additional experimental evidence to clear the fusion vs. precocious differentiation vs. reduced differentiation will strengthen this work.</p><p>(1) The analysis of RNA-seq data (Figure 2) is limited, and it is unclear how it relates to the work presented in this MS. The Go enrichment analysis is combined for both up and down-regulated DEG, thus making it difficult to understand the impact differently in both directions. Stac2 is a predominant neuronal isoform (while Stac3 is the muscle), and the Symm gene is not found in the HGNC or other databases. Could the authors provide the approved name for this gene? The premise of this work is based on defects in ECM processes resulting in the mis-targeting of the muscle progenitors to the nonmuscle regions. Which ECM proteins are differentially expressed?</p><p>(2) Could authors quantify the muscle progenitors dispersed in nonmuscle regions before their differentiation? Which nonmuscle tissues MyoD+ progenitors are seen? Most of the tDT staining in the enlarged sections appears to be punctate without any nuclear staining seen in these cells (Figure 3 B, D E-F). Could authors provide high-resolution images? Also, in the diaphragm cross-sections in mutants, tdT labeling appears to be missing in some areas within the myofibers defined as cavities by the authors (marked by white arrows, Figure 3H). Could this polarized localization of tDT be contributing to specific defects?</p><p>(3) Is there a difference in the levels of tDT in the myoD&quot; muscle progenitors that are mis-targeted vs the others that are present in the muscle tissues?</p><p>(4) scRNA is unsuitable for myotubes and myofibers due to their size exclusion from microfluidics. Could authors explain the basis for scRNA-seq vs SnRNA-seq in this work? How are SKM defined in scRNA-data in Figure 4? As the myofibers are small in KO, could the increased level of late differentiation markers be due to the enrichment of these small myotubes/myofibers in scRNA? A different approach, such as ISH/IF with the myogenic markers at E9.5-10.5, may be able to resolve if these markers are prematurely induced.</p><p>(5) TNC is a marker for tenocytes and is absent in skeletal muscle cells. The authors mentioned a downregulation of TNC in the KO SKM derived clusters. This suggests a contamination of the tenocytes in the control cells. In spite of the downregulation of multiple ECM genes showed by scRNA-seq data, the ECM staining by laminin in KO in Figure 3 appears to be similar to controls.</p><p>(6) The expression of many fusion genes, such as myomaker and myomerger, is reduced in KO, suggesting a primary fusion defect vs a primary differentiation defect. Many mature myofiber proteins exhibit an increased expression in disease states, suggesting them as a compensatory mechanism. Authors need to provide additional experimental evidence supporting precocious differentiation as the primary defect.</p><p>(7) The fusion defects in KO are also evident in siRNA knockdown for SRSF2 and Aurka in C2C12, which mostly exhibits mononucleated myocytes in knockdowns. Also, a fusion index needs to be provided.</p><p>(8) The last section of the role of SRSF2 on splicing appears to be a misfit in this study. Authors describe the Bin1 isoforms in centronuclear myopathy, but exon17 is not involved in myopathy. Is exon17 exclusion seen in other diseases/ splicing studies?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98175.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study was aimed to study the role of SRSF2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions.
