Here, we provide novel insights into signals essential for both pluripotency and neural crest formation in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. We show that FGF signaling controls a subset of genes expressed by pluripotent blastula cells, and find a striking switch in the signaling cascades activated by FGF signaling as cells lose pluripotency and commence lineage restriction. Pluripotent cells display and require Map Kinase signaling, whereas PI3 Kinase/Akt signals increase as developmental potential is restricted, and are required for transit to certain lineage restricted states. Importantly, retaining a high Map Kinase/low Akt signaling profile is essential for establishing Neural Crest stem cells.

At gastrula and neurula stages, Neural Crest cells are found within the presumptive ectoderm at the neural plate border, and they will ultimately contribute to ectodermal derivatives, including much of the peripheral nervous system. However, despite their site of origin, neural crest cells also contribute many mesodermal cell types to the body plan, including cartilage, bone, and smooth muscle, and also make contributions to otherwise endodermal organs such as the thyroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Le Douarin and Kalcheim, 1999</xref>). Until recently, models for how neural crest cells acquire their remarkably broad potential proposed that inductive interactions orchestrated by BMP, FGF, and Wnt signals endowed these cells with greater potency than the cells they were derived from developmentally or evolutionarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Saint-Jeannet, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor and LaBonne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prasad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rogers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stuhlmiller and García-Castro, 2012a</xref>). Such a mechanism conflicts, however, with the generalized view of embryonic development as a progressive restriction of developmental potential.</p><p>We recently demonstrated that much of the regulatory network which controls the pluripotency of blastula inner cell mass/animal cap cells is shared with neural crest cells, shedding new light on the origins of the neural crest cells and the evolution of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we found that factors that have long been considered neural crest potency factors, such as Snail1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor and LaBonne, 2007</xref>) and Sox5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nordin and LaBonne, 2014</xref>), are expressed earlier, in blastula animal pole cells, and are required for their pluripotency. Together, these findings suggest that neural crest cells arise through retention of the transcriptional circuitry that controls the pluripotency of the blastula cells they are derived from, avoiding the lineage restriction that characterizes neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoppler and Wheeler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Douarin and Dupin, 2016</xref>). This revised model raises fundamental questions about how the cells that will become the neural crest escape lineage restriction in order to maintain broad developmental potential, and how this relates to signals that have previously been implicated in the genesis of these stem cells. For example, BMP signaling has been found to play an essential role in the pluripotency of both blastula stem cells and neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ying et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kléber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nordin and LaBonne, 2014</xref>), together with Sox5, which directs the target specificity of BMP R-Smads in both cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nordin and LaBonne, 2014</xref>). It will be important to build on these insights and further delineate the roles of other signaling pathways in the retention of pluripotency.</p><p>FGF signaling is used reiteratively throughout embryonic development to pattern multiple tissue types and germ layers. While FGF signaling has a well established role in the formation of mesoderm, it has also been linked to the formation of the neuroectoderm/neural plate, as well as to anterio-posterior patterning of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slack et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaya et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hongo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hardcastle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ribisi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fletcher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorey and Amaya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wills et al., 2010</xref>). While anterior neural induction mediated by BMP antagonists can occur independent of FGF signaling, FGFs clearly play a role in posterior neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wills et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, FGF signaling has also been implicated in the establishment of both neural crest stem cells and the neural plate border region more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaBonne and Bronner-Fraser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monsoro-Burq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stuhlmiller and García-Castro, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yardley and García-Castro, 2012</xref>). Although the precise role of FGF signaling in the establishment of these cell populations relative to BMP or Wnt signals is not fully understood, at least some enhancers for neural plate border genes have been shown to require FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, these same genes are also expressed in pluripotent blastula cells, making it important to re-examine the role of FGF-mediated signals at earlier times in <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, with a focus on understanding their role in the retention of blastula stage pluripotency proposed to underlie genesis of Neural Crest cells. Such studies might also help shed light on the highly context dependent role played by FGF signaling in the regulation of pluripotency in cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</xref>). Activation of FGF signaling in naïve mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) promotes lineage restriction of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kunath et al., 2007</xref>), whereas FGF activity maintains primed embryonic stem cells, also known as epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) in a pluripotent/undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>). Given our model that neural crest cells arise via retention of the attributes of pluripotent blastula cells, we wondered if FGF signaling might play a role in preventing premature lineage restriction of these cells.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the requirement for FGF signaling in the transient pluripotency of blastula animal pole cells, and the subsequent establishment of the neural crest state. We find that FGF signaling is essential for normal gene expression in pluripotent blastula cells, and for the capacity of these cells to respond properly to lineage restriction cues. We investigate which FGF-dependent signaling cascades mediate these effects, and find a striking switch in cascade utilization as cells transit from a pluripotent state to a lineage restricted state. We show that pluripotent blastula cells exhibit high Map Kinase signaling, whereas cells undergoing lineage restriction are characterized by increased PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling. Finally, we provide evidence that the balance of FGF-directed Map Kinase and PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling activity plays a role in the retention of blastula stage potential in neural crest cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FGF signaling is required for proper gene expression in pluripotent blastula cells</title><p>Because FGF signaling is known to play a role in the establishment of the neural crest cell population at the neural plate border in <italic>Xenopus,</italic> and is also linked to the control of pluripotency in mESCs, we sought to determine if these signals were required in the pluripotent animal pole cells of blastula stage embryos. Consistent with such a role, FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) is expressed throughout the animal hemisphere of blastula stage embryos, where the pluripotent stem cells reside. By gastrula stages (St. 12), <italic>FGFR4</italic> expression is heightened in the neural plate border region, and by neurula stages (St. 15) is strongly enriched in neural crest forming regions of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

At blastula stages, these explants are pluripotent and can be induced to give rise to any embryonic cell type. The pluripotency of these cells is transient in culture, however, as it is in the developing embryo. As explants age from blastula to gastrula then neurula stages, they lose pluripotency and become lineage restricted; in the absence of exogenous signals, they will transit to an epidermal state. We therefore examined expression of <italic>FGFR4</italic> in these explants as they aged. We found that at blastula stages, when explanted cells are pluripotent, they strongly express <italic>FGFR4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), however, as these cells transit to an epidermal state, <italic>FGFR4</italic> expression is lost. This expression pattern is consistent with a role for this receptor in events prior to the onset of lineage restriction. However, although <italic>FGFR4</italic> is the most abundant FGFR in these cells (unpublished data), other FGFRs are also expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lea et al., 2009</xref>) and thus could play roles in control of pluripotency and lineage restriction.</p><p>In order to determine whether FGF signaling plays a role in pluripotency and lineage restriction in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, we used a dominant-negative inhibitory receptor to carry out loss of function studies. We chose a dominant negative strategy because we were interested in the overall role of FGF-mediated signals, rather than role of any specific receptor. While we mainly deployed a dominant negative FGFR4 for these studies, dominant negative receptors frequently inhibit the activity of other related receptors and its effects should therefore be interpreted as effects on FGF signaling in general, not on FGFR4 signaling specifically. Embryos expressing a dominant-negative FGFR4 (dnFGFR4) were cultured to blastula stages and examined by in situ hybridization for genes expressed by pluripotent animal pole cells. We found that blocking FGF signaling led to a significant reduction in the expression of both <italic>Vent2</italic> (98%, n = 186) and <italic>Id3</italic> (96%, n = 84), but did not alter expression of other factors such as <italic>Myc</italic> or <italic>FoxD3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The requirement for FGF signaling for proper gene expression in pluripotent animal pole cells suggests an essential role for these signals in controlling the developmental state of these cells. We similarly found that cells expressing dnFGFR4 were deficient in their ability to give rise to neural crest cells in whole embryos, as assayed by expression of <italic>FoxD3</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Snail2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, we found that expression of a dnFGFR1 did not similarly lead to loss of neural crest formation, suggesting that these two dominant negative receptors have distinct activities. We thus utilized dnFGFR4 to block FGF signaling for subsequent experiments, while recognizing that it may block FGF receptors other than FGFR4.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Blocking FGF signaling in pluripotent blastula cells interferes with the adoption of an epidermal state</title><p>Since blocking FGF signaling inhibited expression of <italic>Vent2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> in pluripotent blastula cells, we hypothesized that FGF signaling might be required for the pluripotency of these cells, and/or for cells to exit pluripotency and transit to a restricted state. At blastula stages, when cells are pluripotent, animal pole explants express core pluripotency markers such as <italic>Sox2/3</italic>, and the Oct4 homologue, <italic>Oct60</italic> (<italic>pou5F3.3</italic>). These genes are subsequently down-regulated as explants age and become restricted to an epidermal state. To test the requirement for FGF signaling in this process, embryos injected with dnFGFR4 were allowed to develop until blastula stages, when animal cap explants were isolated, and then cultured until sibling embryos reached blastula (St.9), gastrula (St.11) or neural plate (St.13) stages. We found that explants blocked for FGF signaling exhibited prolonged, low level expression of <italic>Sox3 (</italic>95%, n = 97), and poorly expressed the epidermal marker <italic>Epidermal Keratin (EPK)</italic> (90%, n = 62), suggesting that FGF signaling was essential for pluripotent blastula cells to transit to an epidermal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>). Since <italic>Sox3</italic> expression is characteristic of both pluripotent cells and neuronal progenitor cells, we investigated whether explants expressing dnFGFR4 were being retained in a pluripotent state or instead were being biased toward a neuronal progenitor fate. We found that Stage 13 explants blocked for FGF signaling do not express the pluripotency factor <italic>Oct60</italic> (<italic>pou5F3.3</italic>), suggesting that they are not retaining pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). These explants do weakly express the definitive neural marker <italic>Nrp1</italic> (94%, n = 85), suggesting that they may be biased toward a neuronal progenitor state. However, the explants do not express levels of either <italic>Sox3</italic> or <italic>Nrp1</italic> associated with chordin-mediated neural induction, indicating that they are not adopting a definitive neural state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). It is possible that, as previously reported, FGF signals are later involved in the commitment of these cells to a neuronal state in response to neural-inducing cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hongo et al., 1999</xref>).

Animal pole explants were isolated at blastula stages and collected at blastula, gastrula, or early neural plate stages for western analysis. Unexpectedly, we detected a striking transition in cascade activation as cells transited from a pluripotent to a lineage-restricted state. Pluripotent cells of blastula-stage explants exhibited robust phosphorylated-Erk (pErk), which was lost as cells became lineage-restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). By contrast, pluripotent cells showed low or undetectable phosphorylated-Akt (pAkt), but activation of this kinase increased as cells lost pluripotency and transited to an epidermal state. Both the early pErk signal and the later pAkt signal were blocked in explants expressing dnFGFR4, confirming that both were FGF signaling-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>Because the above findings implicate two different signaling cascades in FGF-mediated regulation of pluripotency and lineage restriction, and because these signaling cascades appear to play temporally distinct roles in this transition, we wished to determine the contributions that each pathway makes to the developmental potential of these cells. To address this, we utilized reagents that can block the activation of each pathway. Map Kinase signaling was blocked using a chemical inhibitor of the upstream kinase Mek, RDEA119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iverson et al., 2009</xref>), (‘Meki’) or using a dominant negative form of Raf1 (‘dnRaf’). Activation of Akt signaling was blocked by over-expressing a dominant-negative PI3 Kinase subunit (Δp85, ‘dnPI3K’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carballada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nie and Chang, 2007</xref>) or using a chemical inhibitor of PI3 kinase, LY294 or Wortmannin (‘PI3Ki’). We confirmed that these inhibitors blocked the activation of its respective cascade without interfering with the other pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). We then compared the effects of each of these inhibitors to dnFGFR4 in animal pole explants.

We interpret these findings to mean that Map Kinase signaling is essential to the pluripotency of these cells. Consistent with this interpretation, qRT-PCR analysis of blastula stage explants treated with RDEA119 showed a significant reduction in expression of the pluripotency and blastula stage markers <italic>Snail1</italic>, <italic>FoxD3</italic>, <italic>Zic1</italic>, and <italic>Sox2</italic>, compared to control explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). By contrast, while inhibition of PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling prevents transit to a neural or mesodermal state, it has no effect on the ability of pluripotent blastula cells to form endoderm or epidermis. Thus, this signaling pathway appears to be essential for transit to a subset of restricted states . To further understand the role of PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling in these cells, we examined the changes in gene expression elicited by treatment of explants aged to stage 13 in the presence of the PI3 Kinase inhibitor LY294.

FGF-mediated Map Kinase activation is prominent in blastula stem cells prior to their exit from the pluripotent state, but then decreases as cells become lineage restricted. By contrast, FGF-mediated PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling is low in pluripotent cells, but increases dramatically as cells undergo lineage restriction. Importantly, both signaling cascades are blocked by dnFGFR4, showing that they are FGF mediated signals. However, although FGFR4 is the predominant FGF receptor expressed in blastula animal pole cells, it is not the only FGF receptor expressed there. It is possible that dnFGFR4 is also blocking the activity of other FGF receptors, such as FGFR1, as dominant negative proteins can sometimes inhibit the activity of related factors. We therefore interpret our findings using this receptor as demonstrating a role for FGF signaling in general, and not a specific role for FGFR4. Interesting, however, dnFGFR1 does not interfere with expression of neural crest markers in the manner that dnFGFR4 does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given the striking switch in cascade activation as cells move from pluripotency to lineage restriction, we chose to focus on the roles played by these signaling cascades. We show that Map Kinase signaling is essential for the pluripotency of blastula stem cells, whereas PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling appears to play a role in the ability of these cells to adopt a subset of lineage restricted states. Crosstalk between the Map Kinase and PI3 Kinase/Akt pathways is known to be highly context dependent, and can be cooperative or antagonistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksamitiene et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, antagonism between these pathways has been proposed to control the decision by angioblast progenitors to adopt artery versus venous fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2006</xref>). It will therefore be of great interest to investigate the mechanisms via which the observed switch in pathway utilization is achieved in blastula stem cells. Our preliminary analysis of the gene expression changes that occur as cells progress from a pluripotent to a lineage restricted state suggests that this might be mediated, at least in part, by a change in expression of intracellular adaptor proteins that scaffold the Map kinase vs. PI3 Kinase cascades (Geary and LaBonne, unpublished). We cannot rule out, however, that there could be a switch in the utilization of different FGF receptors that may contribute to the change in pathway utilization. Further studies may shed light on the very different effects that FGF signaling has on the pluripotency of naïve vs. primed embryonic stem cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kunath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We interpret the findings reported here as evidence that in this system, FGF-mediated Map Kinase activity is required for the pluripotency of blastula stem cells. An alternative interpretation might be that these signals are required for exit from pluripotency. We favor the first interpretation for a number of reasons including the observation that pMap Kinase is high when these cells are pluripotent and down-regulated as they exit pluripotency, and that activating MEK prolongs the expression of the pluripotency marker <italic>Sox3</italic>. Moreover, blocking Map Kinase signaling does not prevent transit to a neuronal progenitor state, which it might if these signals controlled exit from pluripotency.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, FGF signaling had previously been implicated in the adoption of both mesodermal and neural states, and our current work lends new mechanistic insights into these studies. For example, FGF signaling has been shown to be required for activin-mediated mesoderm formation, but its contributions to this process remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LaBonne and Whitman, 1994</xref>). Our findings that FGF-mediated Map Kinase activation is required for the pluripotency of blastula animal pole cells provides a long sought explanation for this requirement. Our work also sheds light on the role of FGF signaling in neural induction mediated by BMP-antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Launay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sasai et al., 1996</xref>). It has been shown that blocking FGF signaling with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5402 does not prevent adoption of a definitive neural state in response to noggin, even though it can alter <italic>Sox2/3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wills et al., 2010</xref>). We find similar effects when blocking Map Kinase signaling, with Chordin-mediated <italic>Sox2</italic> expression blocked, but not <italic>Nrp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Conversely, we find that blocking the PI3 Kinase/Akt cascade prevents transit to both a neural progenitor and definitive neural state., The latter finding confirms what has been described previously and attributed to PI3 Kinase/Akt regulating GSK3 and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peng et al., 2004</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility of cross-talk between these two signaling pathways, we report an earlier role for PI3 Kinase/Akt in mediating establishment of the neural progenitor state, prompting further exploration into a potential mechanism for its function during early ectodermal patterning. This could be linked to a recently described role for Akt in controlling progenitor cell progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pegoraro et al., 2015</xref>). The later role for PI3 Kinase/AKT signaling is consistent with the findings of Hongo and colleagues that a dominant negative FGFR4 inhibits commitment of animal cap cells to a neuronal state in response to neural-inducing cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hongo et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>FGF signaling has also been previously implicated in the genesis of the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaBonne and Bronner-Fraser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monsoro-Burq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nichane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>), although its role relative to BMP and Wnt signaling has remained unclear. Neural Crest stem cells are of central importance to the development and evolution of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Groves and LaBonne, 2014</xref>), and thus understanding the signals controlling their remarkable developmental potential is essential. Our recent work provides evidence that neural crest cells arise through partial retention of the regulatory network controlling the pluripotency of blastula ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is crucial to re-examine the roles of signals, such as FGF, which had previously been hypothesized to ‘induce’ developmental potential in these cells, and ask if they might instead be acting earlier in development to control whether blastula animal pole cells become lineage restricted or retain pluripotency. Our findings that FGF-mediated Map Kinase signaling is required for the pluripotency of blastula animal pole cells supports such a model.</p><p>These findings led us to ask whether the striking change in FGF effector pathway utilization, from Map Kinase to PI3 Kinase/Akt, as cells transit from a pluripotent to a lineage restricted state could be important for the establishment of the Neural Crest population. Specifically, we wanted to know if the relative levels of Map Kinase and PI3 Kinase/Akt signals displayed by cells could predict or instruct the Neural Crest state. Strikingly, we found that cells that had been reprogrammed to a Neural Crest state by expression of Pax3 and Zic1 retained high levels of Map Kinase activity and low levels of Akt activity even at neurula stages, when control explants had become lineage restricted and transitioned to a high Akt, low Map Kinase activity state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We found similar results when using an alternative regimen (Snail2 + Wnt signaling) for reprograming to a neural crest state (not shown) indicating that this signaling cascade signature correlates with the retention of pluripotency.</p><p>This correlation suggested that retaining a signature of high Map Kinase and low PI3 Kinase/Akt activity might be essential to establishing the Neural Crest stem cell population. We therefore asked if blocking Map Kinase activation and/or prematurely activating PI3 Kinase/Akt signals would interfere with reprograming animal pole explants to a Neural Crest state. Importantly, we found that the expression of <italic>FoxD3</italic> and <italic>Sox9,</italic> characteristic of the Neural Crest state established by Pax3/Zic1, was blocked by either inhibiting Map Kinase activity or prematurely activating Akt using a constitutively active PI3 Kinase subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b,c</xref>). These data support a model in which context dependent control of effector pathways activated by FGF signaling in blastula animal pole cells controls not only the timing of the progression from pluripotency to lineage restriction of these cells, but also the retention of pluripotency and protection from lineage restriction in the cells that will become the Neural Crest. Our findings further suggest that the retention of FGF-mediated Map Kinase signaling in a subset of pluripotent blastula cells may have been an important step in the acquisition of Neural Crest cells, and thus in the evolution of vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryological methods</title><p>Wildtype <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos were collected at the indicated stages and processed for in situ hybridization as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaBonne and Bronner-Fraser, 1998</xref>).

The reviewers found the paper to be potentially interesting and well-written. However, they also felt the authors need to strengthen biochemical characterization of the pathway and confirm that this proposed &quot;molecular switch&quot; is downstream of the receptor. To accomplish this the authors would have to collect persuasive evidence linking Akt to FGF by demonstrating dnFGFR4 specificity, using other means of interfering with pathways downstream of FGF, and using more markers to prove their point. In addition, they should better discuss previous literature on this topic as well as alternative interpretations of their data. In general, it was felt that the present manuscript is a description of a phenomenon rather than a molecular characterization of a new mechanism. Please see the individual reviews below for further details.</p><p>Given that these revisions are likely to take a significant amount of time and the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> is to reject papers that require more than two months for modifications, we have no choice but to decline the present version of the paper. That said, if you feel you can make the revisions, we will make every effort to return a new version of the manuscript to the same reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Geary and LaBonne describe differential activation of the downstream effector pathways of FGF-signaling in pluripotent and lineage-restricted <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells. They utilize animal cap assays to show that blastula stem cells have high levels of MAP Kinase signaling, while cells that are differentiating have prevalence of PI3 Kinase/Akt signals – both downstream of FGFs. The authors suggest that the transition between these two effector pathways, which takes place during gastrulation, is required for the establishment of distinct cell lineages. Furthermore, reprogramming experiments are employed to show that maintenance of high MAP Kinase signaling is required for the establishment of the neural crest population. In line with their previous work, the authors suggest that maintenance of FGF/MAPK signaling from blastula stages is necessary for specification of the neural crest and might underlie its multipotency.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the results are presented clearly. The switch in FGF effector deployment is an exciting phenomenon that holds important implications for the mode of action of signaling pathways during early development. Whereas the authors convincingly tie this molecular switch to cellular properties such as multipotency, the fact that virtually all experiments are performed in animal cap assays raises substantial concerns about the validity of the authors' findings in vivo. Thus, evidence of the presence of the MAPK-PI3K switch in developing embryos would be an important addition to the work.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Lack of in vivo experiments: The authors employ animal cap assays for both loss and gain of function experiments, and to test questions pertaining to cell potential of blastula and neural crest cells. Validation of the FGF effector switch in vivo would greatly enhance the work. In particular, I was puzzled by the reprogramming experiments – why not examine neural crest formation as it takes place in a developing embryo instead of artificially generating neural crest-like cells through overexpression?</p><p>2) On the central role ascribed to FGFR4: Throughout the text, the authors state that activation of the MAP Kinase and the PI3 Kinase/Akt pathways are downstream of FGFR4. This claim is based on the expression levels of FGF receptors in the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo (data not shown), and the use of a FGFR4 dominant negative construct, which causes loss of both Erk and Akt phosphorylation. Given the promiscuity of dnFGFR constructs and the presence of multiple FGF receptors in the blastula/neural crest, I am not convinced that FGFR4 is the main trigger of the MAPK and PI3 effector pathways. Instead, I am tempted to speculate that the switch occurs due to activation of a different FGFR type or isoform. The central role of FGFR4 in this process can only be confirmed by specific knockdown of this transcript.</p><p>3) Crosstalk between FGF effector pathways: Since intracellular effector pathways of signaling systems are very complex and known to intersect, how does activation/inhibition of PI3K affect activity of MAPK and vice versa? Are the effector pathways inhibiting each other as one might speculate from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Table 1?</p><p>4) Possible mechanisms of the molecular switch: While characterization of the molecular mechanism controlling the switch between effector pathways may be beyond the scope of the work, as I reader I expected to find this point addressed in the Discussion. What would be the factors that could tilt the balance between MAPK and PI3K, specifically during gastrula stages?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript makes advances in the understanding of pluripotency of the &quot;animal cap&quot; which here is referred to as pluripotent ectoderm, in line with the hypothesis that Neural crest is the retention of a pluripotent state. This case was made in a previous paper, and the current work builds on that.</p><p>This manuscript makes the case that FGF acting through FGFR4, and MAPkinase maintains pluripotency. In contrast, Akt/PI3Kinase terminate pluripotency.</p><p>The manuscript builds a circumstantial case for the importance of FGFR4 in maintaining pluripotency, but the results are based on a dominant negative receptor, whose specificity has not been proven. Therefore discussion regarding FGFR4 dominant negatives, and whether this manipulation implicated FGFR4 specifically in signaling needs to be tightened up or experimentally verified.</p><p>The results with FGFR4 appear to be very different from those from Hongo/Okamoto, who essentially argued the opposite, that DN FGFR4 blocks anterior neural induction. The precise experiments seem different, but it would be very useful to arrive at a coherent explanation if possible.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of the work is the distinction between Akt/PI3K activity in not being required for pluripotency, and Mapkinase activity requirement for pluripotency. One would expect that this would be more thoroughly documented, using independent inhibitors of the pathways, and assaying additional consequences of pluripotency, in addition to Epidermal Keratin. I don't think this would be an unusual request, but is in line with the general view that pharmacological manipulations, where possible should be backed up with additional drug or molecular manipulation.</p><p>With respect to the inhibition of progression of the cells to neural states with the PI3K inhibitor, it would be essential to know what the cells are doing instead (presumably retaining pluripotency markers?). It is important to rule out the possibility that this does not simply cause cell death, or general ill health of the cells, which would also prevent maturation of the cells, which some have argued accounts for the failure of neutralization when FGF is inhibited (Wills, Harland).</p><p>With respect to the requirement for both MapKinase and PI3Kinase pathways being required for mesoderm induction, the manuscript should refer to previous work on this, such as Umbhauer and Smith, and Carballada, Lemaire. Their results appear to be similar, so perhaps this is not new.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is not very compelling – the premature downregulation of Sox3 by p110-Caax and the retention of Sox3 by MAPK should be quantified more convincingly.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref> are not very compelling; again some quantification would be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the signalling requirements for <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal caps to remain in a multipotent state or to differentiate into different ectodermal derivatives (epidermis/neural) or other germ layers (endoderm/mesoderm). FGF signalling is well known to be important for the regulation of pluripotency in mouse and other species, hence they focus on FGF.</p><p>The authors show that FGF signalling via FGFR4 is required for early blastula animal caps to become epidermis, and that as animal caps age they switch from high MAPK to high Akt signalling, while losing MAPK activity. While the acquisition of epidermal fate depends on MAPK signalling, the acquisition of neural identity after Chordin injection requires Akt, thus, both pathways are required differentially. They then go on to show that the same is true for the acquisition of endodermal (MAPK dependent) and mesoderm (Akt dependent) fates.</p><p>Next, they aim to assess whether prolonged MAPK or premature Akt activation alters animal cap 'pluripotency' (only assessed by Sox3) and suggest that this indeed changes the retention of pluripotent character.</p><p>Finally, the authors have previously shown that neural crest cells have retained pluripotency rather than undergoing lineage restriction. They now assess whether induction of neural crest cells by a combination of transcription factors alters MAPK or Akt signalling and show that this indeed activates MAPK, but not Akt, and that MAPK inhibition or Akt overactivation prevents neural crest induction by these factors.</p><p>They conclude that MAPK is essential for the pluripotency state, while Akt is important for animal caps to adopt some lineages.</p><p>I am somewhat concerned about the novelty of their findings and about the final interpretation of the results with a central conclusion relying on a single marker. Modulation of FGF signalling during pluripotency and the loss thereof is well established, and in this sense the study adds detail to a well-established principle rather than revealing novel concepts. Of course it is interesting how different downstream pathways act differentially, however this in itself is not a new principle.</p><p>A central part of their conclusion is that MAPK mediated FGF signalling is required for cells to maintain pluripotency (e.g. Discussion, second paragraph). However, they never show that pluripotency makers depend on MAPK – they only ever examine Oct60 and Sox3 with Sox3 also being expressed in neural tissue. This is not sufficient to make a general conclusion about pluripotency. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> they show that prolonged MAPK activation leads to prolonged Sox3 expression, while activation of Akt does the opposite. They equate this to retaining pluripotency. However, as they themselves show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, they consider Sox3 as neural marker and argue that this is indeed neural tissue because it does not express Oct60.

Validation of the FGF effector switch in vivo would greatly enhance the work. In particular, I was puzzled by the reprogramming experiments – why not examine neural crest formation as it takes place in a developing embryo instead of artificially generating neural crest-like cells through overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were done in explants because in those you can monitor the progression from pluripotency to lineage restricted without influence from other tissues and signals, allowing the experiments to be more tightly controlled. This also allows separation from the confounded role of FGF signaling in posteriorization of the embryonic axes. In this work we were focused on how pluripotent blastula (ES) cells retain their pluripotency, and this was best explored by isolating them. Also, because pharmacological inhibitors lack spatial control, you cannot be certain that the phenotypic effects are direct on the tissue of interest when working with intact embryos. Nonetheless, in the revised manuscript we have now included whole embryo experiments as supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> confirming the effects of these pathways on neural crest endogenously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On the central role ascribed to FGFR4: Throughout the text, the authors state that activation of the MAP Kinase and the PI3 Kinase/Akt pathways are downstream of FGFR4. This claim is based on the expression levels of FGF receptors in the early Xenopus embryo (data not shown), and the use of a FGFR4 dominant negative construct, which causes loss of both Erk and Akt phosphorylation. Given the promiscuity of dnFGFR constructs and the presence of multiple FGF receptors in the blastula/neural crest, I am not convinced that FGFR4 is the main trigger of the MAPK and PI3 effector pathways. Instead, I am tempted to speculate that the switch occurs due to activation of a different FGFR type or isoform. The central role of FGFR4 in this process can only be confirmed by specific knockdown of this transcript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we have not ruled out the possibility that the dnFGFR4 does not block the activity of other FGFRs and we now discuss this in the text, and make clear that we are blocking FGF signaling, but not necessarily only FGFR4 signaling. We also include data showing that dnFGFR1 does not have the same effects on neural crest that dnFGFR4 does. We note that in response to the reviews we did attempt to morpholino deplete FGFR4 vs FGFR1 – we purchased four published MOs for these receptors listed on the Xenbase site, but we found they tended to crash out of solution and were not useful for loss of function assays. We asked Gene Tools to look at the sequences, and opined that they were poorly designed and predicted to be insoluble. Rather than spend more money on morpholinos, we have more recently been trying to use G0-CRiSPR mutagenesis to deplete these receptors. Unfortunately we have not been able to get early and uniform enough mutagenesis to do these experiments (plus the receptors are maternally provided) and we have delayed publication of this work as long as we can. We had never meant to emphasize the role of one particular receptor in this work (we used FGFR4 because this receptor is the predominant one expressed at blastula stages) – our focus has always been on the downstream effector pathways of FGF signaling and their functions and we make that clear in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Crosstalk between FGF effector pathways: Since intracellular effector pathways of signaling systems are very complex and known to intersect, how does activation/inhibition of PI3K affect activity of MAPK and vice versa? Are the effector pathways inhibiting each other as one might speculate from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Table 1?</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> now shows the specificity of the Mek and PI3K inhibitors for their own pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Possible mechanisms of the molecular switch: While characterization of the molecular mechanism controlling the switch between effector pathways may be beyond the scope of the work, as I reader I expected to find this point addressed in the Discussion. What would be the factors that could tilt the balance between MAPK and PI3K, specifically during gastrula stages?</p></disp-quote><p>We now address this point in the Discussion. We believe that the context/competency of the cells changes over time, and that changes in the expression of intracellular FGF pathway adaptors/modulators over developmental time likely underlies the switch in effector pathway utilization. We agree that experiments on this are beyond the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The manuscript builds a circumstantial case for the importance of FGFR4 in maintaining pluripotency, but the results are based on a dominant negative receptor, whose specificity has not been proven. Therefore discussion regarding FGFR4 dominant negatives, and whether this manipulation implicated FGFR4 specifically in signaling needs to be tightened up or experimentally verified.</p><p>The results with FGFR4 appear to be very different from those from Hongo/Okamoto, who essentially argued the opposite, that DN FGFR4 blocks anterior neural induction. The precise experiments seem different, but it would be very useful to arrive at a coherent explanation if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer refers to a 1999 DB paper that focused on a role for FGF signaling in anterior neural induction that used dnFGFR1 and dnFGFR 4 constructs. The reviewer is correct that the experiments in that paper are done quite differently than ours: explants were isolated at gastrula stages (stage 10), a number of the experiments were done with dissociated cells, and changes in gene expression were largely analyzed by RT-PCR assays at stage 25 with only two genes in common to our study. With so many differences it’s how to come up with a single explanation for why the results differ. We can only report the results of our experiments, which focused on earlier stages and which were all carried out numerous times with highly reproducible results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most interesting aspect of the work is the distinction between Akt/PI3K activity in not being required for pluripotency, and Mapkinase activity requirement for pluripotency. One would expect that this would be more thoroughly documented, using independent inhibitors of the pathways, and assaying additional consequences of pluripotency, in addition to Epidermal Keratin. I don't think this would be an unusual request, but is in line with the general view that pharmacological manipulations, where possible should be backed up with additional drug or molecular manipulation.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have repeated all of the experiments with at least one additional way of inhibiting each pathway. We now use dnRaf, in addition to the Mek inhibitors, for Mapk inhibition. We use Wortmanin and Ly294, in addition to dnPI3K, for Akt inhibition. We also use multiple markers for each cell fate examined (EpK and Trim29 for epidermis; Xbra and MyoD for mesoderm; Sox17 and endodermin for endoderm; <italic>Sox2</italic>/3 and Nrp1 for neural etc.). We examine pluripotency both by marker expression and by functional tests of pluripotency. We also now include qPCR data quantifying gene expression changes in response to inhibition of each pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to the inhibition of progression of the cells to neural states with the PI3K inhibitor, it would be essential to know what the cells are doing instead (presumably retaining pluripotency markers?). It is important to rule out the possibility that this does not simply cause cell death, or general ill health of the cells, which would also prevent maturation of the cells, which some have argued accounts for the failure of neutralization when FGF is inhibited (Wills, Harland).</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript includes qPCR data examining the changes in gene expression in explants inhibited for each pathway. In the case of the PI3K inhibitor there is an interesting up-regulation of a broad set of lineage markers, suggesting that the cells are poised for lineage decisions but impaired in their decision making. We were also very careful to use low doses of inhibitors such as LY294 as they can have off target effects at higher doses. For our studies we titrated our doses to the lowest level sufficient to completely block Akt activation, which is 3-10 fold lower than doses used in some studies and which can generate nonspecific effects, so we are confident that these changes in gene expression are specific to this pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to the requirement for both MapKinase and PI3Kinase pathways being required for mesoderm induction, the manuscript should refer to previous work on this, such as Umbhauer and Smith, and Carballada, Lemaire. Their results appear to be similar, so perhaps this is not new.</p></disp-quote><p>These papers are now cited/discussed. These pathways have indeed been implicated in mesoderm induction previously. What differs here is how that finding is interpreted. Those studies, and those of LaBonne and Whitman, focused on a single lineage decision. Our current work is focused on pluripotency and lineage decisions more broadly. We thus provide a new interpretation of those prior findings and put them in a broader context. For example, with respect to Mapk, we propose a general effect on pluripotency rather than a specific effect on mesoderm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is not very compelling – the premature downregulation of Sox3 by p110-Caax and the retention of Sox3 by MAPK should be quantified more convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have both replaced the images and included qPCR data here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref> are not very compelling; again some quantification would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided better images for these data. Other typos and references errors noted in the review have been corrected and we thank the reviewer for prompting these changes, which have improved the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] I am somewhat concerned about the novelty of their findings and about the final interpretation of the results with a central conclusion relying on a single marker. Modulation of FGF signalling during pluripotency and the loss thereof is well established, and in this sense the study adds detail to a well-established principle rather than revealing novel concepts. Of course it is interesting how different downstream pathways act differentially, however this in itself is not a new principle.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree about the novelty of these findings. First, a role for FGF in pluripotencyhad not been shown in this system, which is the system in which a lot of prior work on germ layer formation had been carried out. Indeed FGF had been ascribed very different roles in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system, which did not integrate very well with findings in mouse and human ES cells. We feel therefore that our results advance the field by showing the central role this signaling is playing in pluripotency is evolutionarily conserved. Our work also further advances the field by adding exciting and very novel data on a switch in effector pathways. This finding is not only important in its own right, but also may help explain differences in what FGF signaling does in naive vs. primed ES (and human vs. mouse) cells. Finally, we show a completely novel role for FGF dependent Map kinase signaling in the retention of pluripotency that led to neural crest formation, providing a significant mechanistic advance over our prior Science paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A central part of their conclusion is that MAPK mediated FGF signalling is required for cells to maintain pluripotency (e.g. Discussion, second paragraph). However, they never show that pluripotency makers depend on MAPK – they only ever examine Oct60 and Sox3 with Sox3 also being expressed in neural tissue. This is not sufficient to make a general conclusion about pluripotency. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> they show that prolonged MAPK activation leads to prolonged Sox3 expression, while activation of Akt does the opposite. They equate this to retaining pluripotency. However, as they themselves show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, they consider Sox3 as neural marker and argue that this is indeed neural tissue because it does not express Oct60.
