Touch-sensitive stamens, which are found in hundreds of flowering plants, are thought to function in enhancing pollen export and reducing its loss, but experimental tests are scarce. Stamens of <italic>Berberis</italic> and <italic>Mahonia</italic> are inserted between paired nectar glands and when touched by an insect’s tongue rapidly snap forward so that their valvate anthers press pollen on the insect’s tongue or face. We immobilized the stamens in otherwise unmodified flowers and studied pollen transfer in the field and under enclosed conditions. On flowers with immobilized stamens, the most common bee visitor stayed up to 3.6× longer, yet removed 1.3× fewer pollen grains and deposited 2.1× fewer grains on stigmas per visit. Self-pollen from a single stamen hitting the stigma amounted to 6% of the grains received from single bee visits. Bees discarded pollen passively placed on their bodies, likely because of its berberine content; nectar has no berberine. Syrphid flies fed on both nectar and pollen, taking more when stamens were immobilized. Pollen-tracking experiments in two <italic>Berberis</italic> species showed that mobile-stamen-flowers donate pollen to many more recipients. These results demonstrate another mechanism by which plants simultaneously meter out their pollen and reduce pollen theft.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>snapping stamens</kwd><kwd>plant–insect interactions</kwd><kwd>stimulated movement</kwd><kwd>pollen flow</kwd><kwd>male reproductive success</kwd><kwd>berberine in pollen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grants no. 31730012 and 32030071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Shuang-Quan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>no.

From the perspective of male reproductive success, nectar and pollen are entirely different rewards because paternity is maximized if pollen grains from one flower are deposited on multiple conspecific recipients, rather than ending up as food, while nectar is produced as pollinator food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Westerkamp, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Westerkamp and Classen-Bockhoff, 2007</xref>). A plant’s success as a father can depend on its temporal deployment of pollen and on the accuracy of pollen placement on the most effective pollen vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Harder and Thomson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armbruster et al., 2014</xref>, and studies cited therein). Flowers are therefore under selection to ‘pay’ visitors as much as possible by nectar, which can usually be replenished, and to meter out their non-replenishable pollen grains by placing them on multiple high-fidelity vectors. Two ways in which plants achieve this are by filtering their visitors, such that pollen consumers are repelled, or by encouraging pollinators to move on, resulting in less pollen and/or nectar consumption per flower while retaining pollen import and export (male and female fitness).</p><p>Biologists from Linnaeus (1755) onward have been aware of the forward-snapping movement of the stamens of <italic>Berberis vulgaris</italic> once the filament base of an individual stamen is touched by a nectar-drinking insect (or a pointed object). <italic>Berberis</italic> flowers have six petals and six stamens, each inserted between two nectaries. Nectar constitutes the main floral reward. The relatively few pollen grains produced remain hidden in the paired pollen sacs that open by apical valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; pollen/ovule ratios in <italic>Berberis</italic> are around 2380–3400; this study). Different species of <italic>Berberis</italic> and <italic>Mahonia</italic>, a close relative, vary in the rapidity of their stamen movements and also in the extent of recovery and repeatability, but the first movement of single stamen is generally completed in fractions of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Percival, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lechowski and Białczyk, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Lebuhn and Anderson, 1994</xref>; this study).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flower traits, foraging behavior of visitors, and manipulations of stamen movements in <italic>Berberis julianae</italic>, which has stamens characterized by a touch-sensitive rapid movement toward the flower center.</title><p>The major pollinators, workers of <italic>Apis cerana</italic> (<bold>A</bold>), and a long-tongued bee, <italic>Habropoda sichuanensis</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), sucking nectar while their tongues (arrow) may contact filaments, anthers, and/or stigmas.

Kirchner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Kirchner, 1911</xref>) furthermore suggested that insects hit by a stamen would be encouraged to leave the flower, but soon would land on another flower to resume their nectaring. Rapid succession of brief visits to many flowers in Kirchner’s view should enhance cross-pollination and reduce nectar costs per pollen grain transport. A third possibility would be the above-mentioned visitor filtering if different kinds of insects were to react differently to forward-snapping of the stamens. This is the case, for example, in species of <italic>Opuntia</italic>, where forward-moving stamens make the pollen almost inaccessible to generalist bees and near-exclusively accessible to specialized bees that pollinate the flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schlindwein and Wittmann, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we experimentally test these three hypotheses (filtering visitor species; metering out small numbers of pollen grains onto body parts likely to come in contact with conspecific stigmas; making pollinators leave more quickly) by immobilizing the stamens in the flowers of three species of <italic>Berberis</italic> and one species of <italic>Mahonia</italic>. Filament bending in <italic>Berberis</italic> relies on rapid changes in the calcium permeability of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lechowski and Białczyk, 1992</xref>), and we therefore explored treatments with calcium inhibitors and with alcohol. We discovered that immersion of flower pedicles in 75% alcohol for 35–45 min was effective at blocking the stamen movement. A test for possible effects of the alcohol treatment on foraging behaviors of the major floral visitors revealed no statistical effects. We then built experimental arrays with untreated and treated flowers in enclosed conditions to quantify pollen export and import from single visits of bees and flies and also used pollen staining to track pollen export distances from manipulated and control flowers.</p><p>Our experiments allowed us to address the following questions: (1) Are <italic>Berberis</italic> flowers with mobile stamens visited by the same types of insects and at the same rates as flowers with immobilized stamens? Different visitor types or visitation rates are expected under the filtering hypothesis, for instance, with flies reacting differently to touch-sensitive stamens than bees. (2) Do forward-snapping stamens make pollinators leave more quickly, reducing nectar costs per pollen grain transport? (3) Do flowers with touch-sensitive stamens export more pollen to more flowers and/or flowers further away? Lastly, we tested whether berberine, an alkaloid with antifeedant activity against herbivores found in <italic>Berberis</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schmeller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Manosalva et al., 2019</xref>), is also present in <italic>Berberis</italic> pollen or nectar.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Touch-sensitive stamen movements and experimental selfing and outcrossing</title><p>Flowers of <italic>Berberis</italic> and <italic>Mahonia</italic> have six petals and six stamens inserted between paired nectar glands (organ sizes are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

When a flower visitor (or a pointed object) contacts the adaxial surface of a filament base, the respective stamen rapidly moves toward the flower center, placing pollen grains on the visitor’s tongue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). The stamen movement takes 0.44 ± 0.02 s in <italic>Berberis julianae</italic>, 0.17 ± 0.02 s in <italic>B. jamesiana</italic>, and 0.23 ± 0.04 s in <italic>B. forrestii</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Within 1 min, the stamen moves back from the flower center, where the single style with its large stigma is located, to the petal, taking 227.70 ± 10.06 s, 110.37 ± 6.64 s, and 155.31 ± 14.07 s, respectively, to return its original position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

As far as we are aware, this is the first study to directly study visitor behavior and pollen import/export in flowers with experimentally immobilized stamens, using our discovery that an alcohol solution blocks stamen movement in <italic>Berberis</italic> and <italic>Mahonia</italic> flowers. We developed a simple protocol of immersion of pedicels in alcohol and then carefully inserted flowers with immobilized stamens in racemes with the same number of natural flowers (directly in the field) or exposed them to visitors in experimental arrays (under enclosed conditions). This allowed us to test three hypotheses explaining the adaptive value of touch-sensitive stamens in Berberidaceae: visitor filtering; making pollinators leave more quickly, thus reducing nectar costs per pollen grain movement; and precise metering out of few pollen grains per visitor, enhancing pollen export. We found support for the last two, but not for the filtering hypothesis, since flies and bees reacted similarly to stamen bending. In the following, we discuss these results in more detail.</p><p>To maximize pollen dispersal, the number of grains removed by each visitor should be limited so as to heighten the probability of pollen reaching different conspecific stigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Harder and Thomson, 1989</xref>), and where possible, visitors should be ‘paid’ by replenishable nectar rather than pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Westerkamp, 1996</xref>). In <italic>Berberis</italic>, such metering out of pollen is achieved by the individual stamens only bending forward once their adaxial filament base is touched by an insect’s tongue probing the nearby nectaries. Further protection of pollen grains from exploitation by pollen thieves or inefficient vectors is sometimes achieved by chemical defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Palmer‐Young et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and we therefore examined whether the pollen grains of <italic>Berberis</italic> contain berberine, an alkaloid with antifeedant activity against herbivores and pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schmeller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Manosalva et al., 2019</xref>). This is indeed the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), and in <italic>B. julianae</italic>, we observed bees cleaning off and discarding pollen grains that stuck to their tongues with their front legs. The syrphid flies, however, fed on the pollen despite its berberine content. There is therefore no support for a chemical defense against pollen thieves (here pollen-feeding flies) and some support for bees being discouraged from collecting <italic>Berberis</italic> pollen as food for their larvae. Importantly, the syrphids visiting <italic>B. julianae</italic> are only conditional pollen thieves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Hargreaves et al., 2009</xref>) since the species is self-compatible and even self-pollen deposited by flies or by stamens hitting the flower’s own stigma contributes to reproductive insurance.</p><p>The quantitative effect of stamen bending on the duration of bee visits per flower was large. Thus, in stamen-bending flowers, the bees typically stayed for five seconds and triggered 2–3 stamens per flower per visit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), a similar number as in <italic>Berberis thunbergii</italic> in North America, where the main visitors also are medium-size bees of in the genus <italic>Apis</italic> and the family Anthophoridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Lebuhn and Anderson, 1994</xref>). In stamen-immobilized flowers, bees stayed about 3× longer (on average 14.37 ± 1.53 s) and flies about 2× longer (on average 54.38 ± 7.53 s), and both visitor types therefore removed more nectar. The impact of longer stays on pollen removal, however, differed between the most common visitor, <italic>A. cerana</italic>, and the other three visitors: When immobilized stamens no longer smeared pollen grains on its tongue or face, <italic>A. cerana</italic> carried away fewer grains, while the pollen-feeding syrphid flies and the two anthophorid bees removed more grains, in the case of the flies because they ate more pollen and in the case of the anthophorids because they passively touched more open anthers, the longer they stayed. The quicker leaving of flowers not only reduced nectar costs/pollen grain transported but also greatly increased male reproductive success by dispensing more pollen to more recipients. This is evident from pollen dispersal distances in SM and SI flowers of <italic>B. julianae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and <italic>B. jamesiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), and from the proportions of pollen recipients that were reduced by 62.03% [=1 – (14/733 ÷ 50/994)] and 41.18% [=1–{(9+1)/(46+56) ÷ (13+7)/(60+60)}] in the two species.</p><p>While we found no support for touch-sensitive stamens filtering floral visitor types – all visitors left flowers more quickly after being hit by stamens– other studies on species with stamens triggered by flower visitors have found strong support for touch-sensitive stamens filtering out inefficient pollinators. Thus, in species of <italic>Opuntia</italic>, the stamens touched by bees move toward the flower center, creating a dense layer that effectively excludes generalist bees, while three specialized bee species are able to access the pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schlindwein and Wittmann, 1997</xref>). And in <italic>Meliosma tenuis</italic>, only nectar-seeking bumblebee drones are able to trigger the stamens and are then loaded with pollen (which males do not collect as larval food), while other insects are unable to access the pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wong Sato and Kato, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recent reviews of the adaptive significance of the movement of floral parts (including both styles and stamens) have distinguished four types of stamen movement: (1) slow movement triggered by a visitor, (2) quick or even explosive movement (sometimes via a catapult mechanism) triggered by a visitor, (3) simultaneous slow movement occurring without triggering by a visitor, and (4) a ‘cascade’ or staggered movement in which one stamen moves after the other, regardless of triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ren, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ruan and da Silva, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armbruster et al., 2014</xref>). The Berberidaceae, a family of some 700 species, exhibit aspects of two of these categories, namely, the staggered movement and the quick triggered movement, although not involving the sudden release of a built-up tension as, for instance, in <italic>Kalmia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Switzer et al., 2018</xref>) in which each filament is arched backward in a petal pocket. Experimental work on the costs and benefits all these types of stamen movements, which occur in hundreds of flowering plants, is still in its infancy, however, partly because it is so difficult to manipulate floral movements under field conditions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Even though botanists have speculated about the adaptive value of the visitor-triggered forcefully forward-snapping stamens of <italic>Berberis</italic> since 1755 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Linnaeus, 1755</xref>), this is the first experimental investigation of how this trait impacts the flowers’ pollen export and receipt. Our results demonstrate surprisingly large effects of stamen bending on pollen export (involving both quantity and distance) and nectaring times (involving lower nectar costs per pollen grain transfer) and reveal another mechanism by which plants meter out their pollen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant and insect study species</title><p>During each March between 2019 and 2022, we studied a natural population of <italic>B. julianae</italic> C.K.Schneider in a field located at 29°52′26″N, 105°30′32″E, 427 m above sea level, about 50 km southeast of Anyue County, Sichuan Province, China.

To examine the effects of stamen bending on foraging behavior and pollen transfer, floral visitors were allowed to interact with the above-described flower arrays (section ‘Alcohol as an inhibitor of the stamen movement, and tests for confounding the effects of the alcohol treatment on visitor behavior’) in the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and under enclosed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Under enclosed conditions, we compared visitation rates, handling times, numbers of stamens touched, nectar volume remaining, pollen removal, and pollen receipt on the stigma after single visits of the four species of visitors. We also quantified pollen transfer efficiency after single visits by harvesting flowers that had been visited a single time in the field and then counting pollen grains on their stigmas as well as pollen grains remaining in their stamens. To quantify pollen loads placed on insect bodies and stigmas of next-visited conspecific flowers, we held captured and anesthetized bees between forceps and made their tongues contact the filament bases in SI or SM flowers. Using this method, we carried out three trials with SM and SI flowers: trial 1, SM + SM; trial 2, SM + SI; and trial 3, SI + SI flowers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pollen-tracking experiments to quantify the effects of stamen forward-snapping on pollen export distances</title><p>To quantify pollen export from SM and SI flowers, we conducted four pollen-tracking experiments each in <italic>B. julianae</italic> in March 2022 and <italic>B. jamesiana</italic> in May 2021. Each trial was conducted on a sunny day and involved 60 flowers from 3 to 5 individuals whose pollen was stained as the pollen donor: 30 flowers were alcohol-treated (SI flowers) and the remaining 30 flowers were SM flowers. The manipulated flowers were carefully inserted among natural flowers on densely blooming racemes. The stigmas of &gt;100 flowers (126–260) on the same and on different individuals at varying distances from the donor were then examined for dyed pollen grains, these were counted, and the straight-line distance from donor to recipient recorded with a meter rule.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Visitation rates of visitor species in the field (not normally distributed) were examined with nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis tests. To compare visitor behavior on SM, SMA, FD, and SI flowers, we performed a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis with normal distributions and identity-link function to test for differences in visitation rates, handling time, and pollen transfer efficiency (log10-transformed) of the four main visitor species. Nectar volumes remaining after different visitors had visited were examined with a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. To compare the number of stamens touched in different flowers, pollen removal, and pollen deposition by each visitor species, and pollen export and import, we performed GLM analyses with a Poisson distributions and loglinear-link function. Floral traits among species were compared under a GLM with a normal distribution and identity-link function, while for numbers of pollen ovules per flower we used a Poisson distribution and loglinear-link function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Data of pistil height and stamen length were log10-transformed to achieve normal distribution. We used the G-test of independence to test whether stained pollen from SM or SI donors differs in the distances to which it is dispersed to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">McDonald, 2014</xref>). A GLM with binomial distribution and logistic-link function was used to detect the effects of the selfing and outcrossing on fruit set and seed set (with fruit/seed number as event variable, total treated flower/ovule number as trial variable, and different treatments as factors). The GLM analyses were performed in SPSS 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Floral traits (mean ± SE) and duration of stamen movements in <italic>Berberis jamesiana</italic>, <italic>B. julianae</italic>, <italic>B. forrestii</italic>, and <italic>Mahonia bealei</italic>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81449-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Foraging behaviors of two types of major insect visitors to <italic>Berberis julianae</italic>.</title><p>Behaviors of the bees and flies visiting <italic>Berberis julianae</italic>, focusing on visitation rates (visits per flower per hour, mean ± SE), visits per flower, handling time, number of stamens touched, nectar volume remaining per flower, pollen grains removed, pollen grains deposited, and pollen transfer efficiency.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81449-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>G-test of independence confirming that <italic>Berberis julianae</italic> flowers with mobile stamens (SM flowers) donated pollen to more recipient flowers at three distance classes than did flowers with experimentally immobilized stamens (SI flowers).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81449-supp3-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>G-test of independence confirming that <italic>Berberis jamesiana</italic> flowers with mobile stamens (SM flowers) donated pollen to more recipient flowers at two distance classes than did flowers with experimentally immobilized stamens (SI flowers).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81449-supp4-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Concentrations of berberine (mean ± SE) in different tissues of <italic>Berberis julianae</italic> under generalized linear models.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81449-supp5-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81449-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are shown in the main text and the tables at the end of the main text.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank lab members Q-M Quan, X-W Lv, and Z-X Tian for field assistance and Z-Y Tong, and Y-Z Xiong for methodological and statistical advice; Dr. Huan-Li Xu, Department of Entomology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, for the identification of flies and bees; Dr. Antti Haarto, Zoological Museum, University of Turku, Finland, for the identification of <italic>Meliscaeva</italic>; Dr. Michael Orr, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, for the identification of <italic>Habropoda</italic> cf<italic>. sichuanensis</italic>; Dr. Chih-Chieh Yu for confirming our plant identifications; Z-D Fang and staff of Shangri-La Botanical Garden for logistical support; Sarah Corbet, Steven Johnson, and Nathan Muchhala for providing helpful suggestions on early versions of this manuscript; and the reviewers Bernhard Schmid, Zong-Xin Ren, and Felipe Yon for their constructive comments.

For <italic>B. julianae</italic>, we tested 64 flowers, for <italic>B. jamesiana</italic> 100, and for <italic>B. forrestii</italic> 80.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Floral visitors and effect of stamen bending on their behavior and pollen export and import</title><p>Visitation rates (visits/flower/hour) of the different visitors to <italic>B. julianae</italic> were obtained on sunny days in March 2019, 2020, and 2021. Visitor were observed on fully flowering shrubs with over 100 open flowers, and each observation period lasted 1 hr, during 9:00–12:00 and 12:30–16:30. The sex and foraging behavior of each visitor were recorded, such a feeding on nectar or pollen or groomed pollen grains into pollen loads. Total observation times in the 3 years are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>To see whether floral visitors discriminated between SI and SM flowers, we compared visitation rates of the Asian honeybee <italic>A. cerana</italic> under open pollination and under enclosed conditions. The other insect species were only studied under enclosed conditions (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In March 2020, 72 flowers on different individuals of <italic>B. julianae</italic> were randomly bagged with mesh nets, before they opened. Also, 12 SI and 12 SM flowers were observed each day. When flowers were beginning to open, we gently cut off 36 flowers (12 flowers × 3 days) at the base of the pedicels and immersed the pedicels in 75% alcohol. All stamens in each alcohol-treated flower became touch-insensitive in 40 min. These SI flowers were carefully inserted into racemes of flowering individuals with the other 36 SM flowers on these racemes as controls, allowing the bees to visit in open pollination conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and H</xref>). The number of flowers visited per hour was recorded during 09:00–12:00 and 13:00–17:00 for 3 days. Visitation rates were calculated as the number of flowers visited per hour divided by the number of observed flowers, that is, visits per flower per hour.</p><p>In March 2021, a total of 160 floral buds from five individuals were randomly bagged. As above, 80 newly opened flowers were alcohol-treated and the remaining 80 flowers were free of alcohol as SM flowers. On each observation day, we set up four arrays each having four SM and four SI flowers. The visitation rates were recorded during 09:30–12:30 and 13:00–17:00 for 5 days each with 16 SI and 16 SM flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>).</p><p>To compare the handling time, pollen removal, and pollen transfer efficiency of the pollinator <italic>A. cerana</italic> in SM and SI flowers under open conditions, 100 flowers from different individuals of <italic>B. julianae</italic> were randomly bagged with mesh before the flowers opened in March 2020 and 2021. When the flowers were newly opened, 12 flowers per day were alcohol-treated for 5 days per year with fine weather. Four of the SI flowers were carefully inserted into each of three racemes with buds, but no open flowers (4 flowers × 3 racemes × 5 days = 60), and four bagged SM flowers from two racemes were uncovered per day (4 flowers × 2 racemes × 5 days = 40) for <italic>A. cerana</italic> visits. In the five arrays, each of four flowers per day, we recorded handling times of <italic>A. cerana</italic> during each visit to one flower. To estimate pollen transfer efficiency, 20 SI and 20 SM flowers visited once by <italic>A. cerana</italic> were harvested immediately in the field. Six anthers and the stigma of each flower were collected. We counted pollen grains remaining within anthers per flower and deposited per stigma under a light microscope. Pollen removal per flower was calculated as the mean number of pollen grains (see ‘Results’) minus the remaining grains. Pollen transfer efficiency was calculated as pollen deposition divided by pollen removal. In both years, we obtained 20 pairs of pollen removal and deposition data for SM flowers, and 20 pairs for SI flowers. In March 2021, we also compared the number of stamens touched and the remaining nectar volume left by <italic>A. cerana</italic> in SM and SI flowers that it had it visited just once. As visitor switched to collect nectar from another nectary, their bodies turned. Therefore, counting the visitor’s body turns allowed us to record the number of stamens touched by a visitor in SI flowers (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p><p>To estimate nectar collection by different visitors, we measured the remaining nectar volume within each SM and SI flower after one visit using a clean 10 µL microliter syringe (Agilent Technologies Inc).</p><p>To compare the foraging behavior of bees and flies on SM and SI flowers under enclosed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we set up floral arrays each consisting of five SM and five SI flowers. The flowers were fixed by inserting the pedicels into small holes on the surface of a paper box covered by a clear glass cover. We then allowed individual of the different insect species to freely interact with the floral array. We recorded the visitation rates (visits per flower per 10 min) and handling time of the visitor and the number of stamens touched by the visitor in each flower, measured the nectar volume left by the visitor, and assessed pollen removal and pollen deposition after one visit to calculate pollen transfer efficiency. It took four trials of ‘interviews’ (cafeteria experiments) over 2 days to yield 20 once-visited flowers for each insect species. Four individuals of each insect species were captured in the field and released within 2 hr after their visits to the SM and SI flowers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Pollen export/import after single visits</title><p>To estimate the effects of the stamen mobility on pollen placement on the pollinator and on stigmas, we simulated bee visits by to SI and SM flowers. In March 2021, we bagged 320+ flower buds from different individuals of <italic>B. julianae</italic>. When the flowers opened, we held anesthetized bees between forceps so that they probed the flower, pollen grains placed on the bee’s tongue (and occasionally on the head) were pasted onto a piece of tape. The tape was attached to a slide and pollen grains placed on the bee’s tongue in 20 SI and 20 SM flowers were then counted under a light microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Using this method, we also carried out three trials with simulated visits to flowers in specific sequence: Trial 1, SM + SM flowers; trial 2, SM + SI; and trial 3, SI + SI flowers. Each trial was repeated 20 times. After each trial, the stigma of the second-visited flower (the pollen recipient) was collected to count the pollen grains deposited on its stigma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>Pollen-tracking experiments to quantify the effects of stamen forward-snapping on pollen export distances</title><p>To examine the effects of stamen movements on the fate of pollen, we conducted four trials of pollen-tracking experiments in a transplanted population of <italic>B. jamesiana</italic> at Shangri-La Alpine Botanical Garden, where the interference of stained pollen with the sexual reproduction of wild plants could be minimal. Trials were conducted on sunny days and involved 60 flowers from 3 to 5 individuals whose pollen was stained as pollen donors: 30 flowers were alcohol-treated (SI flowers) and the remaining 30 flowers were used as SM flowers. Pollen grains in SM or SI flowers were stained with eosin (stained red) or aniline blue (blue). The two dyes were alternately used between SM and SI flowers in four trials. The dyes dried within 5–10 min, and all pollen-stained flowers were taken to the field and carefully inserted into racemes of two flowering individuals along the roadside for pollinators to visit. To track pollen flow, the two clusters containing either 30 SM or SI flowers were arranged separately (about 100 cm apart) on the flowering branches. Flowers of each cluster were within a 40 cm × 40 cm square on four erect racemes. Previous studies indicated that pollen flow mediated by generalist insects usually occurs within meters, with a highly leptokurtic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Williams, 2001</xref>). One day (24 hr) later, given that <italic>A. cerana</italic> visits were infrequent to <italic>B. jamesiana</italic> in May 2021, stigmas of 100 flowers from nearby racemes were collected. Dyed pollen grains deposited on each stigma were counted under a stereomicroscope.</p><p>To compare the distance of pollen dispersal from SM and SI flowers, we conducted two trials of pollen-tracking experiments to compare distance of pollen dispersal between SM and SI flowers of <italic>B. jamesiana</italic>. Each trial was the same as above. At 17:30 on the day of the experiment, stigmas of all flowers from nearby racemes were collected and we noted the straight-line distance within 25 cm and over 25 cm from the racemes with the sampled flowers to the racemes with pollen-stained SM or SI flowers. Dyed pollen grains deposited on each stigma were counted under a stereomicroscope.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13"><title>Measurement of chemical defense in pollen and nectar</title><p>To examine whether berberine is present in <italic>Berberis</italic> pollen and nectar, we collected leaves, petals, pollen, and nectar from 10 plants of <italic>B. julianae</italic>. Leaves, petals, and pollen grains were dried using an oven at 65°C, while the nectar was stored at –20°C before chromatographic analysis. The berberine content of the different samples was analyzed using HPLC. To extract berberine from leaves, a 0.1 g leaf sample was weighed with a balance (Sartorius BAS124S) and transferred to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. A steel bead was added to the tube. The leaves were ground using a tissue homogenizer (Tissuelyser, QIAGEN) at 30 Hz for 10 min, and then the leaf sample was transferred to a vial. Enzymolysis of the leaf sample was conducted by adding 2 mL pure water, 1 μL dilute sulfuric acid, and 6 mg cellulose at 50°C in a magnetic stirrer for 3 hr. The leaf sample was extracted for 2.5 hr in 5 mL pure water, and then transferred to a 5 mL microcentrifuge tube.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Bernhard Schmid as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Zong-Xin Ren (Reviewer #3); Felipe Yon (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The different experiments need to be described in more detail both with regard to the design, procedure, measurements, and analyses. Provide more biological description of the receptivity, fertility, perception, day-cycle, and snapping capacity of the flowers over the 5 days that they are assumed to be opened for all species, including potential auto-deposition by spontaneous snapping.</p><p>2) Of the four hypotheses the first two have been tested with good experimental designs and statistical power (pollen export from mobile vs. immobile stamens). However, this was not the case for the other two (pollinator filtering, presence or effect of berberine in pollen on pollinators). This should be acknowledged and discussed throughout the manuscript.</p><p>3) Check that the entomology is correct, including species identity and natural history. Also, be careful regarding the interpretation of pollen removal as indicative of berberine content in pollen.</p><p>4) The Discussion should be improved by better synthesizing the different experiments into a general narrative and referring more extensively to general theory and other work on pollination aspects considered in this paper. Also, point out limitations and what would have to be done next to get a more comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the function of mobile stamens (including pollinator behavior and niche separation as well as pollination results such as increased outcrossing rate or distance).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Besides the main results whether mobile stamens could &quot;filter&quot; visits according to pollinator species identity could not be confirmed and whether berberine affects pollinator behavior could only weakly be inferred from observation of pollen removal from bee tongues. It also remains to be shown whether mobile stamens additionally have a function in ensuring auto-deposition of pollen on stigmas for selfing and whether they increase seed production and offspring fitness of the plant.</p><p>While the experiments carried out are fine as far as they go, they are somewhat haphazardly planned using different species and places to test different partial questions relevant to the whole story. There is also some intrinsic confounding between different possible functions of mobile stamens, two mentioned by the authors (shorter visit time and more precise placement of pollen on insect body) and additionally the one of auto-deposition of pollen for selfing.</p><p>The experiments should be described in some more detail and using more precise wording. For example, there are places (e.g. line 257 and lines 295-299) where it is not clear if mobile vs. immobile stamen are compared on the side of the plant from which pollen is exported or on the side of the plant to which pollen is deposited (for example the latter is said in the legend to Figure 5, but from the text, the opposite seems to be the case). It is also not clear if self-pollen reception was tested in the absence or the presence of insects. Would stamens spontaneously snap in older flowers to ensure selfing in case they had not been visited?</p><p>The Discussion section is rather short, reflecting the relatively simple but interesting and novel results. Nevertheless, it seems there must be other literature about the effects of mobile stamens or at least the mechanism could be compared with other mechanisms assumed to reduce ineffective insect pollination in flowering plants or potentially enhance auto-deposition of pollen for selfing (relevant also because there was no difference in pollination success between hand-pollinating selfing and outcrossing treatments). Furthermore, the Discussion could point out where to go from the present &quot;natural history&quot; to more comprehensive studies in the model system. Finally, for this type of study, it would be useful to briefly discuss limitations.</p><p>Generally, the manuscript is well written and the analyses of the simple experiments are fine as far as it can be judged based on the brief descriptions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting report on the functional consequences and adaptive significance of a phenomenon scattered throughout the angiosperm clade: &quot;explosive&quot; snapping movement of stamens in response to being touched. Using four species of Berberidaceae, this study provides the first experimental evidence that rapid stamen movement and active pollen placement increase pollen dispersal to stigmas of other flowers. There is also evidence that the stamen-movement system results in pollen placement being more accurate with respect to sites of stigma contact and pollen being dispensed to a larger number of pollinators. These are all valuable insights into how natural selection has favored the evolution of complex floral behavior.</p><p>The writing is reasonably clear for the most part, although the sentence structure could be improved in many places. Analyses appear to be appropriate (although more information explaining and justifying the statistical approaches would be desirable). The results and conclusions appear to be valid.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1. Graphic-abstract caption and in main abstract: &quot;Stamens only snap forward if their filament basis is touched by an insect tongue&quot; implies that artificial stimulation (e.g. with a toothpick) doesn't trigger stamen movement. I don't think you mean this, and if not, rephrase.</p><p>2. Introduction line 5. &quot;intended&quot; must be in quotes or, better, not used at all.</p><p>3. Introduction, 1st paragraph. &quot;Flowers are therefore under selection to 'pay' visitors as much as possible by nectar&quot; is potentially misleading. Heinrich and Raven (Science 1972) argued that nectar production/standing crop would not be maximized, but rather optimized to promote pollinator movement.</p><p>4. Introduction, 2nd paragraph. I think you mean &quot;base&quot;, not &quot;basis&quot;.</p><p>5. Materials and methods a, paragraph 2. The preferred word is &quot;pinned&quot; not &quot;needled.&quot;</p><p>6. Materials and methods c, 1st sentence. Don't use both passive voice (&quot;were immersed&quot;) and active voice (&quot;this blocked&quot;) in the same sentence. Change to, e.g., &quot;all stamen movement was blocked…&quot;</p><p>7. Results a, last line. &quot;selfed&quot; is ambiguous. I think you mean &quot;manually self-pollinated&quot;.</p><p>8. Results f (and Statistical Methods section). I was unclear as to what assumptions and tests were used to assess the significance of differences in proportions of flowers receiving dyed pollen, e.g. &quot;Of 400 nearby flowers in B. jamesiana, 75 received pollen from SM flowers and 40 from SI flowers, again indicating that mobile stamens donated pollen to more flowers (75/400 vs 40/400, G = 27.81, p &lt; 0.001).&quot; G-test doesn't explain the model or the assumptions, just implies log-likelihood. Is this assuming Normal or Poisson distributions or some nonparametric goodness of fit? The first doesn't seem appropriate and the latter yields a P-value slightly &gt; 0.001 by my quick calculation. This needs a better explanation in the Method section. Because differential dispersal of pollen by motile vs. immobilized stamens is, arguably, the single most important result, its statistical validity should be made crystal clear.</p><p>9. The Discussion would benefit from editing and tighter organization. The language could be improved, removing awkward constructions. The discussion should perhaps start with a brief, well-organized summary of the major results (possibly enumerated), followed by comparisons with other species and studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Pollen, containing male gametes of flowering plants, functions in two roles, reproduction for plants and food resources for many insects, especially bees and hoverflies. From the plant aspect, the high fitness should achieve by dispersal pollen grains by the vector to the receptive stigmas of conspecific flowers; for the floral visitor aspect, the high benefit should collect more pollen grains by visiting fewer flowers. This is the pollen dilemma in pollination ecology. Many complex floral traits (concealed pollen grains, pollen/stamen mimicry) or floral behavior (floral part movement, pollen packaging/dispensing) could be driven by solving the &quot;pollen dilemma&quot;. In this study, Li et al., presented a well-written paper with well-designed experiments to test the behavior and function of stamen movement in Berberis. The clever experiment design by using alcohol to immobilize stamens made the control and manipulating experiments possible. They found after immobilized stamens, bees visited flowers longer, but removed and deposited fewer pollen grains lowering plant fitness. Therefore, stamen movement drove insects move among flowers, and removed and deposited more pollen grains to conspecific flowers. In my opinion, this is an excellent example to illustrate how &quot;floral trait/behavior&quot; evolves to solve the &quot;pollen dilemma&quot;.</p><p>The authors concluded that &quot;These results demonstrate another mechanism by which plants simultaneously meter out their pollen and reduce pollen theft.&quot; I partly agree with this. The evidence to support pollen meter out is very strong, but the evidence to support &quot;reduce pollen theft&quot; is not strong enough.</p><p>The authors asked four questions, &quot;(1) Are Berberis flowers with mobile stamens visited by the same types of insects and at the same rates as flowers with immobilized stamens? (2) Do flowers with mobile stamens have higher maternal and/or paternal success than those with immobilized stamens? (3) Do mobile stamens contribute to pollinator filtering by eliciting different behaviors in different insect taxa? And (4) is berberine, an alkaloid with antifeedant activity against herbivores that are found in Berberis leaves, also present in Berberis pollen or nectar?&quot;, in my opinion, questions (1) and (2) were well addressed in this research. Question (3) was not well addressed by the experiments. Question (4) was descriptive, there is a potential association with questions (1) and (2) but not well explained and tested.</p><p>Another weakness is the discussion selection. The authors did not fully discuss the novelty and application of key findings to floral trait/behavior evolution in a larger sense. The order of points of discussion also needs to be re-organized following questions and main results. For example, only one sentence talked about floral visitor filtering related to question (3).</p><p>Using alcohol to immobilize stamens is very important, should expand more to explain how alcohol immobilizes stamen movement in Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>The time of stamen movement should compare with the flower handling time. Is the time stamen movement always shorter than the time of flower handling by insects?</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that we still don't know if such floral behavior drive insects to move among individual plant. If such behavior only drives insects to move among flowers within the same plant, it cannot increase the diversity of paternal donors. Since a plant of Berberis can have many many flowers, it is not easy to test plant fitness at an individual plant level. Therefore, it is worth testing the function of stamen movement at individual plant level in the future using a model species producing countable numbers of flowers.</p><p>1.

Don't drop into the trap that &quot;nectar is for the goodness of floral visitor&quot;, nectar production is selected for the plant's own fitness, but such fitness is realized by floral visitation.</p><p>4. &quot;Replenishable nectar&quot;.

Ecol., 12, 52-62.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study brings attention to a long-standing and assumed function of snapping stamens in Berberis spp. It contains four objectives to which the methodological approach is standard and most are broadly supported in the literature, even though the suitability of some designs could be argued as suboptimal proof of concept for generalization of certain pollination conclusions. This works aims to prove that visitation doesn't differ when stamens are able or not of snapping, but that the snapping mechanism improves the pollen uptake and transfer to pollinators and thus improves fruit formation, while the signature alkaloid compound of Berberis julianae is not a detriment to the interaction.</p><p>The results support well the null hypothesis of pollination filtering as well as the exploration of berberine compound per tissue is supported by the data, although runs short on its discussion. The visitation objective is not fully supported as it is not well described if the reported insects are all the visitors or not, neither if there was time compartamentalization of their visits. The maternal/paternal success objective can be argued as it is a self-pollinating plant with a large pollen to ovule ratio and requires very little pollen for fertilization. The lack of identity of the plant offspring raises a question about the effectivity or necessity of pollinators when offspring genotyping is missing and not much known about zygotic barriers or pollen compatibility.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>By adopting a 4 species array of plants and insects, it brings strength to a more general function of snapping stamens.</p><p>The manipulation experiments to immobilize stamens are a good approach to test the snapping function, with creative methodological variations and additional experiments to discard possible confounding effects.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The selective in-depth testing of a pair of species makes it harder to generalize the pollen success at the multispecies level.</p><p>Although observed in the field (Table S2) provides no further inside observation of the pollinator interactions in nature, their time of activity, or any other insect visitation.</p><p>Lack of biological description of the receptivity, fertility, perception, day-cycle, and snapping capacity of the flowers over the 5 days that are assumed to be opened for all species.</p><p>No specification is given about some methods, such as the reattachment of manipulated flowers and their age.</p><p>Discussion is limited to plant aspects and overlooks insect aspects, such as basic avoidance behaviour (indirect evidence of berberine), possible optimal foraging theory, and learning behaviour (normally assumed in bees). The announced &quot;scarcity of pollen&quot; and self-pollination are lightly discussed and not necessarily based on robust premises. This last is a highly complex theme usually tackled with self-incompatible species due to the difficulty to assign which factor contributes more to forming offspring.</p><p>Arguable discussion about dispersal, measured just within the plant.

This should be acknowledged and discussed throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As we had written (page 9, lines 355-357, submitted version), “We also did not find a difference between flies and bees in their reaction to the snapping of stamens: Both visitor types left flowers more quickly after being hit by stamens, and stamen snapping therefore did not result in visitor filtering.” Our results thus do not support the hypothesis that mobile stamens contribute to pollinator filtering. We are now stating the three hypotheses tested more clearly in the Introduction and Discussion. Our Table S6 shows the berberine presence in <italic>Berberis</italic> pollen, but not nectar (cf. reply 43), however, any insects’ possible reaction to berberine is not one of the three hypotheses (as now stated more clearly), along with how our data address, support or reject them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Check that the entomology is correct, including species identity and natural history.

We asked Dr. Michael Orr, an Anthophora expert, to check all our bee photos, and he identified the bee shown in Figure 1B as very likely <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Habropoda_sichuanensis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Habropoda sichuanensis</ext-link> Wu, 1986.

We also consulted Dr. Antti Haarto, Zoological Museum, Section of Biodiversity and Environmental Science, Department of Biology, University of Turku, Finland, an expert on the syrphid genus <italic>Sphaerophoria</italic>, and he determined that the fly for which we had used that name is not a <italic>Sphaerophoria</italic> instead a species of <italic>Meliscaeva</italic>. Our other fly, <italic>Rhingia campestris</italic>, appears correctly identified.</p><p>Regarding the berberine in the pollen, please see Table S6 in our manuscript (cf. reply 43).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion should be improved by better synthesizing the different experiments into a general narrative and referring more extensively to general theory and other work on pollination aspects considered in this paper. Also, point out limitations and what would have to be done next to get a more comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the function of mobile stamens (including pollinator behavior and niche separation as well as pollination results such as increased outcrossing rate or distance).</p></disp-quote><p>We now start the Discussion with a short summary about our main findings, and we now end it with a paragraph placing our findings in the context of other work on mobile stamens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Besides the main results whether mobile stamens could &quot;filter&quot; visits according to pollinator species identity could not be confirmed and whether berberine affects pollinator behavior could only weakly be inferred from observation of pollen removal from bee tongues. It also remains to be shown whether mobile stamens additionally have a function in ensuring auto-deposition of pollen on stigmas for selfing and whether they increase seed production and offspring fitness of the plant.</p><p>While the experiments carried out are fine as far as they go, they are somewhat haphazardly planned using different species and places to test different partial questions relevant to the whole story. There is also some intrinsic confounding between different possible functions of mobile stamens, two mentioned by the authors (shorter visit time and more precise placement of pollen on insect body) and additionally the one of auto-deposition of pollen for selfing.</p><p>The experiments should be described in some more detail and using more precise wording. For example, there are places (e.g. line 257 and lines 295-299) where it is not clear if mobile vs. immobile stamen are compared on the side of the plant from which pollen is exported or on the side of the plant to which pollen is deposited (for example the latter is said in the legend to Figure 5, but from the text, the opposite seems to be the case). It is also not clear if self-pollen reception was tested in the absence or the presence of insects. Would stamens spontaneously snap in older flowers to ensure selfing in case they had not been visited?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, selfing in Berberis is an interesting topic. As we had stated (page 4, lines 166-168, in the original version; now line 180)</p><p>“To examine intra-flower selfing induced by the stamen movement, we counted pollen grains deposited per stigma under a light microscope in 16 bagged flowers in which we had triggered one stamen by a needle.”</p><p>As shown in Figure S4, spontaneous autogamy does occur in this species, but its fruit/seed sets were both much lower (around 50%) compared to open or outcrossed pollination. We also state clearly (line 253)</p><p>“Self-pollen receipt by stigmas of B. julianae after a single stamen movement (14 ± 3 grains, N = 16) was only 6% of the pollen receipt resulting from a single visit by the most common visitors, Apis cerana, which deposited between 230 and 260 grains (section (d)) and roughly 1% of the pollen grains of a single anther with its two pollen sacs (ca. 1220 grains), indicating that intra-flower self-pollination mediated by the stamen movements plays a minor role in total pollen receipt.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion section is rather short, reflecting the relatively simple but interesting and novel results. Nevertheless, it seems there must be other literature about the effects of mobile stamens or at least the mechanism could be compared with other mechanisms assumed to reduce ineffective insect pollination in flowering plants or potentially enhance auto-deposition of pollen for selfing (relevant also because there was no difference in pollination success between hand-pollinating selfing and outcrossing treatments). Furthermore, the Discussion could point out where to go from the present &quot;natural history&quot; to more comprehensive studies in the model system. Finally, for this type of study, it would be useful to briefly discuss limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above (reply 4), we now end it with a paragraph placing our findings in the context of other work on mobile stamens, some of it by professor Shuang-Quan Huang, for example, on <italic>Parnassia</italic> (Armbruster et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generally, the manuscript is well written and the analyses of the simple experiments are fine as far as it can be judged based on the brief descriptions.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting report on the functional consequences and adaptive significance of a phenomenon scattered throughout the angiosperm clade: &quot;explosive&quot; snapping movement of stamens in response to being touched. Using four species of Berberidaceae, this study provides the first experimental evidence that rapid stamen movement and active pollen placement increase pollen dispersal to stigmas of other flowers. There is also evidence that the stamen-movement system results in pollen placement being more accurate with respect to sites of stigma contact and pollen being dispensed to a larger number of pollinators. These are all valuable insights into how natural selection has favored the evolution of complex floral behavior.</p><p>The writing is reasonably clear for the most part, although the sentence structure could be improved in many places.

I was unclear as to what assumptions and tests were used to assess the significance of differences in proportions of flowers receiving dyed pollen, e.g. &quot;Of 400 nearby flowers in B. jamesiana, 75 received pollen from SM flowers and 40 from SI flowers, again indicating that mobile stamens donated pollen to more flowers (75/400 vs 40/400, G = 27.81, p &lt; 0.001).&quot; G-test doesn't explain the model or the assumptions, just implies log-likelihood. Is this assuming Normal or Poisson distributions or some nonparametric goodness of fit? The first doesn't seem appropriate and the latter yields a P-value slightly &gt; 0.001 by my quick calculation. This needs a better explanation in the Method section. Because differential dispersal of pollen by motile vs. immobilized stamens is, arguably, the single most important result, its statistical validity should be made crystal clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed our statistical approach with a colleague who is teaching biostatistics. He suggested that a G–test of independence (McDonald 2014) would be appropriate, and we now performed a G–test of independence in all comparisons of the effects of stamen movement on pollen flow. The results did not change from what we reported in the earlier version, but we now report the significance based on the G-test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The Discussion would benefit from editing and tighter organization. The language could be improved, removing awkward constructions. The discussion should perhaps start with a brief, well-organized summary of the major results (possibly enumerated), followed by comparisons with other species and studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We now start the Discussion with a paragraph enumerating our main results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Pollen, containing male gametes of flowering plants, functions in two roles, reproduction for plants and food resources for many insects, especially bees and hoverflies. From the plant aspect, the high fitness should achieve by dispersal pollen grains by the vector to the receptive stigmas of conspecific flowers; for the floral visitor aspect, the high benefit should collect more pollen grains by visiting fewer flowers. This is the pollen dilemma in pollination ecology. Many complex floral traits (concealed pollen grains, pollen/stamen mimicry) or floral behavior (floral part movement, pollen packaging/dispensing) could be driven by solving the &quot;pollen dilemma&quot;. In this study, Li et al., presented a well-written paper with well-designed experiments to test the behavior and function of stamen movement in Berberis. The clever experiment design by using alcohol to immobilize stamens made the control and manipulating experiments possible. They found after immobilized stamens, bees visited flowers longer, but removed and deposited fewer pollen grains lowering plant fitness. Therefore, stamen movement drove insects move among flowers, and removed and deposited more pollen grains to conspecific flowers. In my opinion, this is an excellent example to illustrate how &quot;floral trait/behavior&quot; evolves to solve the &quot;pollen dilemma&quot;.</p><p>The authors concluded that &quot;These results demonstrate another mechanism by which plants simultaneously meter out their pollen and reduce pollen theft.&quot; I partly agree with this. The evidence to support pollen meter out is very strong, but the evidence to support &quot;reduce pollen theft&quot; is not strong enough.</p><p>The authors asked four questions, &quot;(1) Are Berberis flowers with mobile stamens visited by the same types of insects and at the same rates as flowers with immobilized stamens? (2) Do flowers with mobile stamens have higher maternal and/or paternal success than those with immobilized stamens? (3) Do mobile stamens contribute to pollinator filtering by eliciting different behaviors in different insect taxa? And (4) is berberine, an alkaloid with antifeedant activity against herbivores that are found in Berberis leaves, also present in Berberis pollen or nectar?&quot;, in my opinion, questions (1) and (2) were well addressed in this research. Question (3) was not well addressed by the experiments. Question (4) was descriptive, there is a potential association with questions (1) and (2) but not well explained and tested.</p><p>Another weakness is the discussion selection. The authors did not fully discuss the novelty and application of key findings to floral trait/behavior evolution in a larger sense. The order of points of discussion also needs to be re-organized following questions and main results. For example, only one sentence talked about floral visitor filtering related to question (3).</p><p>Using alcohol to immobilize stamens is very important, should expand more to explain how alcohol immobilizes stamen movement in Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>The time of stamen movement should compare with the flower handling time. Is the time stamen movement always shorter than the time of flower handling by insects?</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that we still don't know if such floral behavior drive insects to move among individual plant. If such behavior only drives insects to move among flowers within the same plant, it cannot increase the diversity of paternal donors. Since a plant of Berberis can have many many flowers, it is not easy to test plant fitness at an individual plant level. Therefore, it is worth testing the function of stamen movement at individual plant level in the future using a model species producing countable numbers of flowers.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful for these many good suggestions! Regarding the time of stamen movement, it is 0.44 ± 0.02 s in <italic>Berberis julianae</italic>, while the flower handling time by <italic>Apis cerana</italic>, the most common pollinator, is 4.919 ± 0.301 s and 5.017 ± 0.661 s by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Habropoda_sichuanensis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Habropoda sichuanensis</ext-link> (as reported in the manuscript). So, in this species, the stamen movement is much faster than the time that these bee species spent inside a flower. Regarding the genetic consequences of stamen mobility on male fitness, our pollen staining experiments provide empirical evidence for the greater donor distances achieved in flowers with functioning stamens compared to flowers with immobilized stamens. We don’t have genetic data and have therefore removed the word ‘fitness’ from ths manuscript and replaced it with ‘pollen flow distances’ and similar phrases (cf. reply 27)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

This works aims to prove that visitation doesn't differ when stamens are able or not of snapping, but that the snapping mechanism improves the pollen uptake and transfer to pollinators and thus improves fruit formation, while the signature alkaloid compound of Berberis julianae is not a detriment to the interaction.</p><p>The results support well the null hypothesis of pollination filtering as well as the exploration of berberine compound per tissue is supported by the data, although runs short on its discussion. The visitation objective is not fully supported as it is not well described if the reported insects are all the visitors or not, neither if there was time compartamentalization of their visits. The maternal/paternal success objective can be argued as it is a self-pollinating plant with a large pollen to ovule ratio and requires very little pollen for fertilization.
