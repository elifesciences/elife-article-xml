autoinhibited until cargo is loaded. Regulatory mechanisms underlying this autoinhibitory conformation are not well understood. Here, we show that a NEver in mitosis Kinase NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates a flexible elbow region between two coiled-coil domains connecting the motor head and tail of an intraflagellar transport kinesin, OSM-3. The phosphor-dead (PD) mutation, but not phosphor-mimic (PM) mutation, induces constitutive motility of OSM-3 in vitro. Using knock-in animals, we discovered that both PD and PM mutations shorten the <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory cilia. The constitutively active OSM-3PD fails to enter cilia and abnormally accumulates in neurites, mimicking another hyperactive mutation, OSM-3G444E. Conversely, OSM-3PM enters cilia but moves at a reduced speed, indicating an inhibitory role of elbow phosphorylation in kinesin motility. These findings highlight the crucial role of elbow phosphorylation in regulating kinesin autoinhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>autoinhibition</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>elbow</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31991191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ou</surname><given-names>Guangshuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of the kinesin-2 motor proteinâs elbow region by NEKL-3 kinase maintains autoinhibition, enabling its transport to cilia for sensory function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin motor proteins, integral to intracellular transport along microtubules, are tightly regulated for precise cargo delivery within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burute and Kapitein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christensen and Reck-Peterson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou and Scholey, 2022</xref>). Dysregulation of kinesin activity is linked to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimerâs and Parkinsonâs diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brady and Morfini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sleigh et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is vital for elucidating disease mechanisms and developing potential therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms controlling kinesin activation involve protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cason and Holzbaur, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>). Protein phosphorylation is recognized for its regulatory role in a variety of proteins, yet its impacts on kinesin motility are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeBerg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Espeut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sato-Yoshitake et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">SchÃ¤fer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Cilia serve as a unique model for studying how microtubule-based motor proteins are regulated in specific cellular regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anvarian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nachury and Mick, 2019</xref>). The formation of cilia relies on bidirectional intraflagellar transport (IFT) along microtubules within the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klena and Pigino, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). At the ciliary base, kinesin-2 family proteins undergo conformational changes to transport IFT particles loaded with ciliary precursors to the axonemal tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou and Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). After unloading cargo, kinesin-2 is deactivated, while dynein-2 is activated to recycle the anterograde IFT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou and Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prevo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, kinesin-2 and OSM-3 collaborate to construct sensory cilia in chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou and Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). Initially, kinesin-2 transports IFT particles, building the middle ciliary segments, while OSM-3 is inactive and transported by kinesin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitra et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou and Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). Later, kinesin-2 transfers IFT particles to OSM-3, activating it to convey cargo molecules and assemble the distal axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitra et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou and Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that govern the activation and inactivation of kinesin-2 and dynein-2 along the cilia are still unclear. Additionally, the regulation of OSM-3âs regional motility presents an even greater mystery: Deleting OSM-3 only disrupts the distal axoneme without affecting the ciliary middle region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitra et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou and Scholey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prevo et al., 2015</xref>). It remains unclear how OSM-3 becomes enriched in the distal domain than the middle segment.</p><p>The âelbowâ of a kinesin refers to a flexible region situated between two coiled-coil domains, linking the motor head and tail of the kinesin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). This junction imparts necessary flexibility and facilitates interactions between the globular motor head and the rigid stalk-like tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). The elbow region is thus considered to serve as a pivotal regulatory center, governing the motorâs activity and facilitating precise spatiotemporal control of intracellular transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). However, the post-translational modification of the kinesin elbow and its physiological consequences have not been elucidated. In our previous study, a genetic screen targeting the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). This finding, combined with reports that NIMA kinases regulate ciliary processes independently of their canonical mitotic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chivukula et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiel et al., 2011</xref>), prompted us to investigate whether NIMA kinases modulate OSM-3-driven IFT. We hypothesized that NEKL-3/4, as paralogs within this family, might directly phosphorylate OSM-3 to regulate its motility. In this study, we demonstrate that the NEKL-3 kinase directly phosphorylates the elbow of OSM-3 kinesin. Our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that elbow phosphorylation exerts an inhibitory effect on OSM-3 motility. We show that elbow phosphorylation inhibits OSM-3 motility in the soma and dendrites of sensory neurons, while its dephosphorylation is necessary for activating OSM-3 in sensory cilia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NEKL-3 phosphorylates the OSM-3 kinesinâs elbow</title><p>To determine whether NIMA kinase family members could directly phosphorylate OSM-3, we purified prokaryotic recombinant <italic>C. elegans</italic> NEKL-3/NEKL-4 and OSM-3 protein in order to perform in vitro phosphorylation assays. We were able to obtain active recombinant NEKL-3 but not NEKL-4. The in vitro phosphorylation assays showed that NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates OSM-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis revealed phosphorylation at residues 487â490, which localize to the conserved âYSTTâ motif within OSM-3âs C-terminal tail region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To gain structural insights from this motif, we employed LocalColabFold based on AlphaFold2 to predict the dimeric structure of OSM-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>). The highest confidence model was selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>). These four phosphorylated âYSTTâ residues are situated at the end of the hinge2 region, linking coiled-coil1 and coiled-coil2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C, D</xref>). In kinesin-1, this inter-coiled-coil junction is known as the âelbowâ, essential for adopting a compact conformation for autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, we have designated the region comprising amino acids 487â490 as the âelbowâ of OSM-3. Although the elbow region is prevalent throughout the kinesin superfamily, the molecular regulation of the elbow conformation remains to be illustrated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM-3 at its âelbowâ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the full-length OSM-3.

Specifically, we replaced the amino acids 487â490 YSTT with FAAA for the PD mutation and DDEE for the PM mutation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> OSM-3::GFP genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The wild-type (WT) OSM-3::GFP facilitates anterograde IFT to construct the distal ciliary segments of sensory neurons, and OSM-3::GFP fluorescence localizes along the ciliary distal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). However, OSM-3PD::GFP was absent from cilia and excluded from cell bodies, instead forming bright puncta around the axons of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).

We demonstrate that NEKL-3 kinase phosphorylates the elbow region of OSM-3 kinesin in vitro. Fluorescence of OSM-3::GFP and NEKL-3::GFP was observed in the soma and dendrites of sensory neurons, indicating the sites of protein synthesis and potential regulatory activity. We propose that OSM-3 is synthesized in the soma, where its elbow region is subsequently phosphorylated by NEKL-3. This phosphorylation is critical to inhibit OSM-3 motility prior to its arrival at the cilia. Previous findings have shown that cytoplasmic dynein-1 facilitates the transport of centrioles from the soma along the dendrites to the dendritic tip, the site of ciliary base formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesize that inactive OSM-3 is similarly transported, possibly by dynein-1, to the ciliary base as a cargo molecule.

This constitutive activity might induce cellular responses that erroneously direct active OSM-3 to neurite tips rather than to cilia. Furthermore, OSM-3 harboring the G444E mutation within the hinge region exhibits constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imanishi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Our recent study revealed that this hyperactive form of OSM-3 was also absent from cilia and was instead expelled through membrane abscission at the tips of aberrant neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Adjacent glial cells subsequently engulf and degrade the extruded OSM-3G444E, a process mediated by the engulfment receptor CED-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2024</xref>).

However, intriguingly, genetic suppressor screens revealed that the A489T mutation fully restores OSM-3PD localization to the cilia. Although direct mass spectrometric analysis from OSM-3PD-A489T animals is pending, the genetic suppression strongly implicates the role of the T489 site in regulating elbow phosphorylation. Considering the previous proteomic study of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellar proteome identified protein phosphatases in cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pazour et al., 2005</xref>), we postulate that a protein phosphatase may dephosphorylate inhibitory phosphorylations on the OSM-3 elbow.

PD and PM mutations are confined to the elbow region, leaving the motor headâs mechanochemical properties intact. Upon tail immobilizationâwhich releases autoinhibitionâthe gliding speeds reflect motor head activity. Single-molecule assays, however, directly resolve their native regulatory states: PD mutants are constitutively active, whereas PM mutants persist in an autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâG</xref>). Although monomeric OSM-3 could theoretically mediate single-motor gliding, the previous size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) data demonstrate that OSM-3 purifies as stable dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, dimeric OSM-3 is perhaps the predominant functional species in our assays.</p><p>As demonstrated in our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2025</xref>), phosphorylation of OSM-3 by NEKL-3 at two distinct regionsâSer96 and the conserved âelbowâ motifâdifferentially regulates its activity and localization. Phosphorylation at Ser96 reduces OSM-3âs ATPase activity and alters its ciliary distribution from the distal segment to a uniform localization, while elbow phosphorylation induces autoinhibition, retaining OSM-3 in the cell body. Strikingly, in vitro phosphorylation of OSM-3 by NEKL-3 significantly reduces its microtubule-binding affinity, likely arising from combined modifications at both sites. We propose a model wherein elbow phosphorylation ensures anterograde ciliary transport, while Ser96 phosphorylation fine-tunes distal segment targeting. This multistep regulation may involve distinct phosphatases to reverse phosphorylation at specific sites, a hypothesis warranting further investigation.</p><p>It is plausible that additional kinases are involved in elbow phosphorylation.

NEKL-3 and its homolog NEKL-4 exhibit similar localization patterns in the soma and dendrites. While NEKL-3 is indispensable for OSM-3 regulation, NEKL-4 appears to have a redundant role in this process. Although our phosphorylation assays utilized recombinant NEKL-3 due to technical constraints that we could not generate recombinant NEKL-4 with activity, it remains possible that NEKL-4, akin to NEKL-3, may also phosphorylate the OSM-3 elbow.</p><p>This study primarily elucidates the inhibitory phosphorylation of OSM-3 prior to ciliary entry. Equally intriguing is the regulation of OSM-3 at the ciliary tip, where its activity must be curtailed to halt IFT, thus preventing excessive ciliary elongation. Previous studies have identified DYF-5, DYF-18 kinases, and other ciliary kinases as crucial regulators limiting ciliary length across various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burghoorn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maurya and Sengupta, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Omori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">OzgÃ¼l et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tucker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). It is plausible that elbow phosphorylation by these kinases serves as a regulatory mechanism restraining OSM-3 motility at the ciliary tip. Given the ubiquity of the kinesin elbow region across the superfamily, we propose that phosphorylation regulation of this region may represent a widespread mechanism governing kinesin motility. This suggests a fundamental role for elbow phosphorylation in modulating the activity of kinesins, potentially impacting a broad array of cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strain culture</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study were cultured on OP50 seeded NGM (nematode growth medium) plates at 20Â°C. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> summarizes the strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>The knock-in o<italic>sm-3-pm</italic> and <italic>osm-3-pd</italic> strains were generated by SunyBiotech in the <italic>osm-3::GFP KI (SYD0199)</italic> background by CRISPRâCas9-based methods and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.</p><p>For OSM-3 transgenic strains, point mutation constructs were generated by PCR, and the desired constructs were co-injected with <italic>rol-6[su1006]</italic> into the germ line of young adult hermaphrodites.

The phophorylated residue is the &quot;elbow&quot; of OSM-3. The authors introduced phospho-dead (PD) and phospho-mimic (PM) mutations by genome editing and found that the OSM-3(PD) protein does not form cilia, and instead, accumulates to the axonal tips. The phenotype is similar to another constitutive active mutant of OSM-3, OSM-3(G444A) (Imanishi et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2024). osm-3(PM) has shorter cilia, which resembles with loss of function mutants of osm-3 (Figure 2). The authors did structural prediction and shows that G444E and PD mutations change the conformation of OSM-3 protein (Figure 3). In the single molecule assays G444E and PD mutations exhibited increased landing rate (Figure 4). By unbiased genetic screening, the authors identified a suppressor mutant of osm-3(PD), in which A489T occurs. The result confirms the importance of this residue. Based on these results, the authors suggest that NEKL-3 induces phosphorylation of the elbow domain and inactivates OSM-3 motor when the motor is synthesized in the cell body.

Researchers in the motor protein field may firstly assume this paper focuses on kinesin-1, because the &quot;elbow&quot; domain was originally suggested in kinesin-1. This paper newly determines the elbow region of OSM-3 and shows its crucial role in autoinhibition. Therefore, a more specific title, &quot;Kinesin-2 Autoinhibition Requires Elbow Phosphorylation&quot; or &quot;OSM-3 Autoinhibition Requires Elbow phosphorylation&quot; may be better.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103648.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

This seems to come out of nowhere and prior evidence indicating that NEKL-3 may be phosphorylating OSM-3 is not even mentioned in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this important point. Our hypothesis that NEKL-3 phosphorylates OSM-3 stems from prior findings in our lab. In a previous study (Yi et al., Traffic, 2018, PMID: 29655266), we identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation. This discovery prompted us to explore the broader role of NIMA kinases in regulating OSM3. Subsequent genetic screens (Xie et al., EMBO J, 2024, PMID: 38806659) revealed that both NEKL-3 and NEKL-4 suppress multiple OSM-3 mutations, further supporting their functional interaction. Given the established role of NIMA kinases in phosphorylation-dependent processes (Fry et al., JCS, 2012, PMID: 23132929; Chivukula et al., Nat. Med., 2020, PMID: 31959991; Thiel, C. et al. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011, PMID: 21211617; Smith, L. A. et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 2006, PMID: 16928806), we hypothesized that NEKL-3/4 may directly phosphorylate OSM-3 to modulate its activity.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we expressed recombinant <italic>C. elegans</italic> NEKL-3 and OSM-3 proteins and conducted in vitro phosphorylation assays. While we were unable to obtain active recombinant NEKL-4 (limitations noted in the revised text), our experiments with NEKL-3 revealed phosphorylation at residues 487-490 (YSTT motif) in OSM-3âs tail region, as confirmed by mass spectrometry. These findings are now explicitly contextualized in the Introduction and Results sections of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Page #4, Line #11:</p><p>â...In our previous study (Yi et al., Traffic, 2018, PMID: 29655266), a genetic screen targeting the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of this phenotype. This finding, combined with reports that NIMA kinases regulate ciliary processes independently of their canonical mitotic roles (Fry et al., JCS, 2012, PMID: 23132929; Chivukula et al., Nat. Med., 2020, PMID: 31959991; Thiel, C. et al. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011, PMID: 21211617; Smith, L. A. et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 2006, PMID: 16928806), prompted us to investigate whether NIMA kinases modulate OSM-3-driven intraflagellar transport. We hypothesized that NEKL-3/4, as paralogs within this family, might directly phosphorylate OSM-3 to regulate its motility...â</p><p>Page #4, line #26:</p><p>â...

We were able to obtain active recombinant NEKL-3 but not NEKL-4. The in vitro phosphorylation assays showed that NEKL-3, directly phosphorylates OSM-3 (Fig. 1A-B, Appendix Table S1). Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis revealed phosphorylation at residues 487-490, which localize to the conserved &quot;YSTT&quot; motif within OSM-3âs C-terminal tail region ...â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors need to characterize the proteins they expressed and purified for in vitro ATPase and motility assays.

To confirm its oligomeric state, we analyzed recombinant OSM-3 by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS). As reported in Xie et al. (2024), OSM-3 (~80 kDa monomer) elutes with a molecular weight of 173â193 kDa under physiological buffer conditions, consistent with a homodimeric assembly. These findings confirm that the functional unit used in our assays is the biologically relevant dimer. This characterization has been added to the revised manuscript on Page #35, Line #7.</p><p>ââ¦OSM-3 was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) and purified for in vitro assays using established protocols (REFs). Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) (Xie et al., EMBO J., 2024) confirmed that recombinant OSM-3 forms a homodimer (173â193 kDa) under physiological conditions, ensuring its dimeric state remained intact....â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors primarily used PD and PM mutations, which affect all four amino acids in the region. This may or may not be physiologically relevant. Figure 5 indicates that T489 is a critical regulatory site. However, this conclusion is undermined by reliance on PD mutations, which affect all four amino acids. Creating PM (T489E) and PD (T489A) mutations based on WT OSM-3 would better reflect physiological relevance. In vitro assays with a single phosphomimic or phosphor-dead mutation at residue 489 are missing at the end of this story. This would better link Figure 5 with the rest of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive critique. Below, we address the concerns and integrate new data to strengthen the link between T489 and autoinhibition:</p><p>To probe the regulatory role of T489 phosphorylation, we generated osm-3(T489E) (phosphomimetic, PM) and osm-3(T489A) (phospho-dead, PD) mutant animals. Strikingly, both mutants formed axonal puncta (Figure S7), recapitulating the hyperactive phenotype of the OSM-3G444E mutant. While the similar puncta formation in PM and PD mutants initially appeared paradoxical, this observation underscores the necessity of dynamic phosphorylation cycling at T489 for proper autoinhibition. Specifically, the PD mutant (T489A) likely disrupts phosphorylationdependent autoinhibition stabilization, leading to constitutive activation, where as the PM mutant (T489E) may mimic a &quot;locked&quot; phosphorylated state, preventing dephosphorylation-dependent release of autoinhibition in cilia and trapping OSM-3 in an aggregation-prone conformation. These results highlight T489 as a structural linchpin whose post-translational modification dynamically regulates motor activity. While the precise molecular mechanismâsuch as how phosphorylation modulates tailmotor domain interactionsâremains to be elucidated, our data conclusively demonstrate that perturbing T489 (even in isolation) destabilizes autoinhibition, driving puncta formation and the constitutive activity.</p><p>We have integrated the above paragraph in the revised manuscript on page #8, line #27.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) There seems to be a disconnect between the MT gliding assays in Figure 4C and single molecule motility assays in Figure 4E. The gliding assays show that all constructs can glide microtubules at near WT speeds. Yet, the motility assays show that WT and PM cannot land or walk on MTs. The authors need to explain why this is the case. Is this because surface immobilization of kinesin from its tail disrupts autoinhibition? Alternatively, the protein preparation may include monomers that cannot be autoinhibited and cannot land and processively walk on surface-immobilized microtubules (because they only have one motor domain) but can glide microtubules when immobilized on the surface from their tail.</p></disp-quote><p>The surface immobilization of OSM-3 via its tail domain disrupts autoinhibition, a phenomenon previously observed in other kinesins such as kinesin-1 (Nitzsche et al, Methods Cell Biol., 2010, PMID: 20466139). In our assays, OSM-3 was nonspecifically immobilized on glass surfaces, enabling microtubule gliding by motors whose autoinhibition was relieved through tail anchoring. Critically, the PD and PM mutations reside in the tail region and do not alter the intrinsic properties of the motor head domain. Consequently, once autoinhibition is released via immobilization, the gliding velocities reflect the conserved motor head activity, which is expected to remain comparable across all constructs. While we cannot entirely rule out the presence of monomeric OSM-3 in solution, several lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, the mutations are located in the elbow region, which is dispensable for motor dimerization. Second, SEC-MALS analysis from prior studies confirms that purified OSM-3 exists predominantly as dimers in solution.</p><p>We have discussed these issues in the revised text on page #10, line #18:</p><p>ââ¦In our gliding assays, OSM-3PM has an increased gliding speed of 0.69 Â± 0.07 Î¼m/s (Fig. 4 C-D), similar to PD mutant. PD and PM mutations are confined to the elbow region, leaving the motor headâs mechanochemical properties intact. Upon tail immobilizationâwhich releases autoinhibitionâthe gliding speeds reflect motor head activity. Single-molecule assays, however, directly resolve their native regulatory states: PD mutants are constitutively active, whereas PM mutants persist in an autoinhibited state (Fig. 4E-G). Although monomeric OSM-3 could theoretically mediate singlemotor gliding, the previous SEC-MALS data demonstrate that OSM-3 purifies as stable dimers (Xie et al., EMBO J, 2024, PMID: 38806659). Thus, dimeric OSM-3 is perhaps the predominant functional species in our assaysâ¦â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) An alternative explanation for the data is that both PD and PM mutations result in loss-of-function effects, disrupting OSM-3 activity.

Phosphorylation at Ser96 reduces OSM-3âs ATPase activity and alters its ciliary distribution from the distal segment to a uniform localization, while elbow phosphorylation induces autoinhibition, retaining OSM-3 in the cell body.

In a previous study (Yi et al., Traffic, 2018, PMID: 29655266), we identified NEKL-4, a member of the NIMA kinase family, as a suppressor of the OSM-3(G444E) hyperactive mutation. This discovery prompted us to explore the broader role of NIMA kinases in regulating OSM-3. Subsequent genetic screens (Xie et al., EMBO J, 2024, PMID: 38806659) revealed that both NEKL-3 and NEKL-4 suppress multiple OSM-3 mutations, further supporting their functional interaction. Given the established role of NIMA kinases in phosphorylation-dependent processes (Fry et al., JCS, 2012, PMID: 23132929; Chivukula et al., Nat. Med., 2020, PMID: 31959991; Thiel, C. et al. Am. J.

While we were unable to obtain active recombinant NEKL-4 (limitations noted in the revised text), our experiments with NEKL-3 revealed phosphorylation at residues 487-490 (YSTT motif) in OSM-3âs tail region, as confirmed by mass spectrometry. These findings are now explicitly contextualized in the Introduction and Results sections of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Page #4, Line #11:</p><p>â...
