These inputs transit through the sensory trigeminal nuclei, which give rise to the ascending lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways. While lemniscal projections are somatotopically mapped from brainstem to cortex, those of the paralemniscal pathway are more widely distributed. Yet the extent and topography of paralemniscal projections are unknown, along with the potential role of these projections in controlling behavior. Here, we used viral tracers to map paralemniscal projections. We find that this pathway broadcasts vibrissa-based sensory signals to brainstem regions that are involved in the regulation of autonomic functions and to forebrain regions that are involved in the expression of emotional reactions. We further provide evidence that GABAergic cells of the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus gate trigeminal sensory input in the paralemniscal pathway via a mechanism of presynaptic or extrasynaptic inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trigeminus</kwd><kwd>kolliker fuse</kwd><kwd>paralemniscal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS107466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deschenes</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kleinfeld</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS097265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleinfeld</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Deschenes</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MT-5877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deschenes</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A predominant but less studied sensory pathway for both vibrissa self-motion and touch inputs is shown to broadcast broadly to brainstem regions involved in regulation of autonomic functions as well as forebrain regions involved in expression of emotional reactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most sensory systems comprise parallel pathways of sensory information that encode different features of a stimulus and also take part in the control of sensor motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merigan and Maunsell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lomber and Malhotra, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>). The vibrissa system of rodents is no exception (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleinfeld and Deschênes, 2011</xref>). Ascending signals in the vibrissa system travel along two main trigeminothalamic pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prescott et al., 2016</xref>): (1) a lemniscal pathway that arises from the trigeminal nucleus principalis (PrV), transits through the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus, and projects to the primary somatosensory cortex; (2) a paralemniscal pathway that arises from the rostral part of trigeminal nucleus interpolaris (SpVIr), transits through the posterior group (Po) of the thalamus, and projects to the somatosensory cortical areas and to the vibrissa motor cortex.</p><p>In contrast with PrV cells, which innervate principally VPM thalamus, SpVIr cells that project to Po thalamus also innervate a number of additional regions by means of branching axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pierret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veinante et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellavance et al., 2017</xref>). These include the superior colliculus, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the ventral division of zona incerta, and the dorsal lateral sector of the facial nucleus. Tract-tracing studies by means of classic tracers also reported interpolaris projections to the brainstem and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacquin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phelan and Falls, 1991</xref>). Whether the latter projections also arise from Po-projecting cells remains an open question.</p><p>While the lemniscal pathway conveys tactile information, as well as information about the relative phase of the vibrissae in the whisk cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khatri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isett and Feldman, 2020</xref>), the role of the paralemniscal pathway remains puzzling. It was proposed that this pathway conveys information about whisking kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golomb et al., 2006</xref>), but later studies found that encoding of whisking along the paralemniscal pathway is relatively poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Urbain et al., 2015</xref>). It was also proposed that the paralemniscal pathway is specifically activated upon noxious stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frangeul et al., 2014</xref>), but it has never been shown that interpolaris cells that respond to vibrissa deflection are also activated by noxious stimuli. Thus, the general function of the paralemnical pathway remains unresolved.</p><p>Here, we used virus-based tract-tracing methods and electrophysiology to document the full extent of the collateral projections of interpolaris cells that give rise to the paralemniscal pathway. We searched for new pathways of ascending information to forebrain regions, with a focus on pathways that include the Kölliker-Fuse/parabrachial complex (KF/PBc). The KF/PBc were previously described primarily in terms of their role in eliciting changes in respiration and cardiac function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saper and Stornetta, 2015</xref>). Yet the role of inhalation in either driving or pacing whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deschênes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2013</xref>) provides motivation to investigate if the KF/PBc has a broader role in orofacial motor actions. Further motivation comes from the projections of the KF nucleus to the trigeminal sensory nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geerling et al., 2017</xref>), which contains multiple pathways for the control of motoneurons involved in whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellavance et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, we searched for feedback projections from targets along the paralemnical pathways to brainstem nuclei as a means to uncover a potential role of this pathway in rat’s behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Collateral projections of interpolaris cells that project to Po thalamus</title><p>To map the collateral projections of interpolaris cells that innervate Po thalamus, we injected the retrograde virus G-pseudotyped Lenti-Cre in Po thalamus, and AAV2/8-hSyn-DIO-GFP in the vibrissa-responsive sector of subnucleus SpVIr (five juvenile rats; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This approach revealed an unexpected diversity of axonal projections across all animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>). In accordance with prior studies, terminal fields are found in Po thalamus, the ventral division of zona incerta, the anterior pretectal nucleus, the superior colliculus, the perirubral region, the dorsal lateral part of the facial nucleus, and in the other subdivisions of the sensory trigeminal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacquin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacquin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veinante et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellavance et al., 2017</xref>). As new results, profuse projections are also found in the ipsilateral dorsal medullary reticular (MdD) nucleus and further caudally in the dorsal horn of the cervical cord. An ascending projection terminates ipsilaterally in the intertrigeminal region (ITr) and in the KF/PBc. Whether individual interpolaris cells project to many or all of the above-mentioned target regions remains an open issue. What is clear, however, is that interpolaris cells that project to Po thalamus broadcast sensory messages to multiple midbrain and hindbrain regions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomical and electrophysiological evidence that vibrissa-responsive interpolaris cells have widespread axonal projections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viral method used for labeling paralemniscal projections.

Thus, one expects KF/PBc and MdD neurons to also respond to vibrissa deflection. We indeed found vibrissa-responsive neurons in the KF/PBc (latency: 8.0±1.2 ms; mean ± SD; 22 cells across 14 adult rats; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> K) and in the MdD nucleus (latency: 6.0±1.4 ms; 33 cells across three additional adult rats; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and M</xref>) of ketamine/xylazine anesthetized animals. The location of recorded units was assessed by single-cell juxtacellular labeling in the KF/PBc (eight cells in 8 of the 14 rats), and by iontophoretic deposit of Chicago Sky Blue in the MdD nucleus (three rats). Like interpolaris cells, the receptive field of KF/PBc and MdD cells includes multiple vibrissae. In the KF/PBc, vibrissa-responsive cells are intermingled with cells that discharge in phase with the respiratory rhythm. Yet the spontaneous activity of vibrissa-responsive cells displays no statistically significant spectral coherence with respiration (mean coherence&lt; C &gt; in the spectral band of breathing is |&lt; C &gt;|=0.16 for vibrissa-responsive cells versus |&lt; C &gt;|=0.72 for respiratory units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>)).</p><p>We did not investigate the parameters of vibrissa deflection that best drive KF/PBc and MdD cells. Our goal was to cross-check the tract-tracing results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which indicate that some KF/PBc and MdD cells receive input from vibrissa-responsive interpolaris neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Axonal projections of KF/PBc cells that receive interpolaris input s</title><p>Among the targets of the paralemniscal pathway, we focused on the KF/PBc because of the well-documented hodology of its axonal projections (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saper and Stornetta, 2015</xref>).

Although there is no reason to believe that vibrissa deflection per se is painful, an unexpected air puff directed toward the head of a rat elicits fear-related behavior such as a startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelmann et al., 1996</xref>), 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knapp and Pohorecky, 1995</xref>), and avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cimadevilla et al., 2001</xref>).

This conclusion is in line with that of the recent study, which reported that the MdD nucleus is part of a brainstem-spinal circuit to control escape responses to noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barik et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The brainstem medullary reticular formation comprises two main divisions: a ventral part (MdV) and a dorsal part (MdD).

Three additional lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, glutamatergic KF cells project to the cardio-respiratory medullary centers, the facial, hypoglossal, and ambiguous motor nuclei, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and to the preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous systems (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saper and Stornetta, 2015</xref>).

Yet the same study shows that spike rates are not significantly different between whisking and not whisking in subnucleus SpVI. This is an unexpected result, as primary vibrissa afferents discharge during whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Severson et al., 2017</xref>) and SpVI projection cells are typically driven by many more vibrissae than principalis neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furuta et al., 2006</xref>). The observation that whisking tends to reorganize spike times of neurons in interpolaris, rather than increase overall spike rates, supports the notion that the relay of vibrissa messages in the paralemniscal pathway is normally gated as part of fast, inhibitory feedback. The inhibition of the paralemniscal pathway by KF GABAergic neurons, together with the lack of a direct connection from KF neurons to interpolaris projections cells, suggests that proposed gating occurs by a mechanism of presynaptic or extrasynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>What drives the KF nucleus, consistent with the postulated involvement in orchestrating defensive reactions to aversive and threatening stimuli?

All signals were sampled at 10 kHz and logged on a computer using the Labchart acquisition system (AD Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Three weeks after injection of AAV2/1-hSyn-hChR2-eYFP in the KF/PBc (three rats), we used a carbon-tip optrode (Kation Scientific) to simultaneously stimulate labeled axons and record interpolaris cells. As a test for KF-induced inhibition, we drove background spiking by jiggling a single vibrissa with a piezoelectric stimulator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology</title><p>Following perfusion brains were postfixed for 1 hr, and cryoprotected overnight in 30% (w/w) sucrose in PBS. Brains were cut at thickness of 50 µm on a freezing microtome. Labeled material was processed for either fluorescence or brightfield microscopy. For fluorescence microscopy, sections were immunoreacted with a chicken anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Abcam), and a donkey anti-chicken Alexa 488 IgG (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs). NeuN immunostaining was carried out with a mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:1000; MilliporeSigma) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 594 (1:500; Abcam). For brightfield microscopy, sections were first counterstained for cytochrome oxidase (MilliporeSigma), and then immunoreacted with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Novus Biological), a biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector Labs), the avidin/biotin complex (Vectastain ABC Kit; Vector Labs), and the SG peroxidase substrate (ImmPACT SG Substrate; Vector Labs). In three rats, brainstem sections were first immunoreacted with a goat anti-choline acetyltransferase antibody (1:1000; MilliporeSigma) and a rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:500; Abcam), which was revealed with diaminobenzidine (brown reaction product). Sections were then immunoreacted with a mouse anti-GFP antibody (1:2000; Abcam), a biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Vector Labs), which was revealed with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector Labs) and the Ni-DAB substrate (black reaction product) (ImmPACT DAB Substrate; Vector Labs). Finally, the extent of electrolytic lesions was assessed on material stained with Neutral Red. Sections were scanned at a resolution of 0.5 µm/pixel (TissueScope LE; Huron Digital Pathology) and imported in Fiji or Photoshop for color and contrast adjustments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Three-dimensional maps of retrogradely labeled KF/PBc cells were constructed with the Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield).</p><p>Peristimulus time histograms were built using the LabChart 8.0 spike histogram module (AD Instruments), and the Matlab Chronux toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chronux.org">http://www.chronux.org</ext-link>) was used to compute the spectral coherence between respiration and the firing rate of KF/PBc cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data</title><p>‘Data sets (anatomical images and physiological time series) supporting this study, and an associated “read me” file, are deposited at Dryad, doi:10.6076/D15C7X.’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were carried out according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines.

A key target of interpolaris appears anatomically to be excitatory projection neurons of the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please increase clarity over some details of the G-pseudotyped Lenti-cre virus</p><p>Can the authors expand on aspects of this G-pseudotyped Lenti-cre virus? e.g, in Figure 1, are the authors certain that only monosynaptic projections are labelled? Is there a possibility of secondary jumping? If there is a possibility of secondary jumping, how did the authors choose the survival time of the rats?</p><p>Relatedly, Stanek is referenced several times, but there's no entry in the bibliography. If it's the JNeurosci paper from Fan Wang, those authors did not use the term &quot;G-pseudotyped&quot;, so I think the authors here need to fully explain what this means and how the virus works.</p><p>2) Paper framing and setup of the KF nucleus</p><p>While the starting point of this paper is about one pathway, the paper also includes substantial data related to an entirely different pathway and topic: namely, interpolaris and the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus. The background of these nuclei are only hinted at and only at the end. More to the topic, the authors do discuss a whisker-limbic pathway, which is interesting, but their data also suggest additional functions of these pathways other than avoidance and flight behaviors, which could be discussed. Similarly, the authors zero in on their results regarding KF GABA neurons, but never discuss what might even conceivably be driving these cells.

Although the authors of the current study focus on the role of MdD in fear and threat responses in their Discussion, one possibility is that the projections from SpVI to MdD may provide a short latency pathway to elicit a grooming sequence in response to potentially aversive stimuli on the whisker pad (e.g., dirt/mud on the whiskers).

Using sophisticated viral tracing methods, they show that individual interpolaris cells can diverge to target multiple midbrain and hindbrain structures, including MdD and the cervical spinal cord. They then show that Kolliker-Fuse neurons receiving interpolaris inputs project to numerous targets but do not feedback onto interpolaris. Physiological recordings from MdD, KF, and the central amygdala reveal responses to vibrissa deflection. Using optogenetics, they show that KF GABAergic interneurons, however, do project back to interpolaris and may gate sensory responses.

This major pathway's function remains relatively obscure, at least in comparison to the lemniscal pathway. The authors' focus is on the whisker system. Their main experimental objective therefore was to anatomically and physiologically map the collaterals of SpVi neurons that respond to whisker inputs and project to the PO thalamus. They use viral and conventional labeling methods together with electrophysiology in anesthetized rats.</p><p>Through difficult experiments, the authors show that these SpVi neurons have broad collateral projections to numerous midbrain and hindbrain targets, including to the dorsal medullary reticular nucleus (MdD) and the Kollicker-Fuse/parabrachial complex (KF/PB). They show that neurons in the MdD and KF/PB respond to whisker input at relatively short latency, implying drive from the projections from SpVi. They further trace projections emanating from the KF/PB neurons that receive input from SpVi, following the circuit downstream, and find that the areas previously known to receive KF/PB input do in fact receive such input from the SpVi-recipient neurons. Interestingly, they do not observe KF/PB feedback to the trigeminal nuclei. The authors show that the central amygdala responds to whisker input in rats, consistent with a projection from the PB and a possible role in mediating aversive responses to whisker input. The authors also find that KF/PB neurons are segregated into those projecting to forebrain and to lower brainstem targets. Finally, the authors provide physiological and anatomical evidence that KF neurons can gate sensory input flowing through the SpVi nucleus via a presynaptic or extrasynaptic mechanism.</p><p>The experiments and analyses are carefully performed and the overall quality of evidence for the authors' conclusions is strong. This is a substantial set of observations of value to the field. The authors succeed in their objective of mapping functional pathways originating from the SpVi neurons of the paralemniscal pathway. In so doing they shed light on the function of the paralemniscal pathway.</p><p>It is sometimes not clear how many rats the data shown in figures comes from, leading to a bit of a mismatch between the text, which describes findings across a population of rats, and the figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72096.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please increase clarity over some details of the G-pseudotyped Lenti-cre virus</p><p>Can the authors expand on aspects of this G-pseudotyped Lenti-cre virus? e.g, in Figure 1, are the authors certain that only monosynaptic projections are labelled?

We have added a section to the Discussion on &quot;Descending Projection to the MdD&quot;.</p><p>The brainstem medullary reticular formation comprises two main divisions: a ventral part (MdV) and a dorsal part (MdD). The MDV stands out as specifically targeting subpopulations of forelimb-innervating motor neurons.
