highly prevalent in women that is defined by growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and lacks adequate treatment. Medical use of cannabis derivatives is a current hot topic and it is unknown whether phytocannabinoids may modify endometriosis symptoms and development. Here we evaluate the effects of repeated exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a mouse model of surgically-induced endometriosis. In this model, female mice develop mechanical hypersensitivity in the caudal abdomen, mild anxiety-like behavior and substantial memory deficits associated with the presence of extrauterine endometrial cysts. Interestingly, daily treatments with THC (2 mg/kg) alleviate mechanical hypersensitivity and pain unpleasantness, modify uterine innervation and restore cognitive function without altering the anxiogenic phenotype. Strikingly, THC also inhibits the development of endometrial cysts. These data highlight the interest of scheduled clinical trials designed to investigate possible benefits of THC for women with endometriosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Endometriosis is a common disease in women caused by tissue that lines the uterus growing outside the uterine cavity on to other organs in the pelvis. This can cause a variety of symptoms including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and pain during menstruation or sexual intercourse. These symptoms may contribute to anxiety, depression, loss of working ability and a reduced quality of life.</p><p>Currently available treatments for endometriosis, including hormonal therapy and surgery, have a limited effect and can produce unwanted side effects. For example, women who undergo surgery to remove the growths may experience post-surgical pain or a recurrence. As a result, women with endometriosis often rely on self-management strategies like dietary changes or exercise. Although cannabis consumption has a large number of potential side effects and can lead to substance abuse, it has been shown to provide pain relief in some conditions. But it is unknown whether it could be useful for treating endometriosis.</p><p>Now, Escudero-Lara et al. have created a mouse model that mimics some of the conditions of human endometriosis: pelvic pain, anxiety and memory impairments. The mice were treated with moderate doses of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the main pain-relieving component of cannabis. The THC reduced pelvic pain and cognitive impairments in the mice with the endometriosis-like condition, but it had no effect on their anxious behavior. Escudero-Lara et al. also noticed that endometrial growths were also smaller in the treated mice indicating that THC may also inhibit endometriosis development.</p><p>These experiments suggest that THC may be a useful treatment for patients with endometriosis. Clinical trials are already ongoing to test whether these findings translate to patients with the condition. Although THC and cannabis are readily available in some areas, Escudero-Lara et al. discourage using unregulated cannabis products due to the potential risks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endometriosis</kwd><kwd>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</kwd><kwd>chronic pelvic pain</kwd><kwd>disease-modifying treatment</kwd><kwd>long-term memory</kwd><kwd>female</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD16/0017/0020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-84060-R-AEI/FEDER-UE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ICREA Academia 2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019FI_B2_00111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escudero-Lara</surname><given-names>Alejandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017 SGR 669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mouse model of endometriosis reveals that moderate doses of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol produce clear regression of ectopic endometrial growths, pronounced alleviation of pelvic pain and unexpected memory improvements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 1 in 10 women of childbearing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zondervan et al., 2019</xref>). It is characterized by the growth of endometrium in extrauterine locations, chronic pain in the pelvis and the lower abdomen, infertility, emotional distress and loss of working ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fourquet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Márki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zondervan et al., 2019</xref>). Current clinical management provides unsatisfactory outcomes. On the one hand, hormonal therapy has unwanted effects including contraception and emotional disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross and Kaiser, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skovlund et al., 2016</xref>), whereas surgical excision of the growths is associated with high-recurrence rates and post-surgical pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garry, 2004</xref>). Hence, clinical treatments are limited and women often unsatisfactorily self-manage their pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armour et al., 2019</xref>). In this context, marijuana legalization for medical purposes in American and European states has led to increased availability of phytocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuhasira et al., 2018</xref>). While cannabis may provide pain relief in certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>), it is unclear whether it may modify endometriosis symptoms or development.</p><p>Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive constituent of the <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> plant, and multiple animal and clinical studies suggest its efficacy relieving chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Vry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ueberall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams et al., 2008</xref>), although controversial results have been obtained in human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stockings et al., 2018</xref>). However, THC has important side effects including cognitive deficits and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Célérier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kasten et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puighermanal et al., 2013</xref>). This work investigates the effects of natural THC in a mouse model of endometriosis that reproduces the ectopic endometrial growths and some of the behavioral alterations of clinical endometriosis. Our data show that THC is effective inhibiting hypersensitivity in the caudal abdominal area without inducing tolerance, as well as reducing the pain unpleasantness associated with endometriosis. Notably, THC also prevents the cognitive impairment observed in mice with ectopic endometrium without modifying anxiety-like behavior at this particular dose. Interestingly, THC shows efficacy limiting the development of ectopic endometrium, revealing disease-modifying effects of this natural cannabinoid.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ectopic endometrium leads to pain sensitivity in the caudal abdomen, anxiety-like behavior and memory impairment</title><p>Our first aim was to characterize a novel experimental procedure to evaluate at the same time nociceptive, cognitive and emotional manifestations of endometriosis pain in female mice. Mice were subjected to a surgical implantation of endometrial tissue in the peritoneal wall of the abdominal compartment or to a sham procedure. Mice receiving ectopic endometrial implants developed persistent mechanical hypersensitivity in the caudal abdominal area, whereas sham mice recovered their baseline sensitivity and showed significant differences in comparison to endometriosis mice since the second week of implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether mechanical hypersensitivity of endometriosis mice was specific to this abdominal region, nociceptive responses were also measured in the hind paw. In this distant area, mechanical sensitivity remained unaltered, indicating that pain sensitization did not generalize to other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To discern whether increased nociception was accompanied by a component of negative affect, a measure of pain unpleasantness was taken on day 14 after the surgeries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Endometriosis mice showed increased nocifensive behaviors to mechanical stimuli when compared with sham mice. Similarly, endometriosis mice exhibited enhanced anxiety-like behavior reflected in lower percentages of time and entries to the open arms of the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Total arm entries were similar in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In line with these findings, previous rodent models of endometriosis found increased mechanosensitivity in the lower abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arosh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greaves et al., 2017</xref>) and affective-like disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Previous works associate nociceptive and emotional distress in chronic pain settings with cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushnell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">La Porta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">You et al., 2018</xref>), although this cognitive impairment has not yet been revealed in rodent models of endometriosis. We found in our model a dramatic impairment of long-term memory in endometriosis mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). While mnemonic effects of this pathology have not been thoroughly evaluated, a cognitive impairment may contribute to the loss of working ability consistently reported in women with endometriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sperschneider et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, mice with ectopic endometrium recapitulate in our model some of the symptomatology observed in the clinics, although manifestations of spontaneous pain could not be evaluated in this work.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral and histological alterations in female mice with ectopic endometrial implants.</title><p>Endometriosis mice showed (<bold>a</bold>) persistent mechanical abdominal hypersensitivity that (<bold>b</bold>) was localized in the caudal abdominal area but not detectable in distant areas (hind paw).

Repeated THC starting on day 1 could have exerted a preventive effect at endometriosis stages in which pain sensitivity may have not been fully developed. To discern whether the absence in loss of efficacy was due to an inhibition of endometriosis development or to an actual lack of tolerance, we assessed the persistence of THC efficacy once pain was already present. THC given for the first time on day 14 was as effective as THC given on the same day after a daily treatment starting on day 8 (7 days long, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, THC did not lose its efficacy when repeated administration started once painful symptomatology was established. The absence of tolerance to THC-induced antinociception is in contrast with the tolerance described at higher THC doses in other pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LaFleur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wakley et al., 2014</xref>).

Interestingly, the 7 day treatment with THC inhibited this component of negative affect, while the effects of an acute administration of THC were highly variable.

As in previous experiments, endometriosis mice showed a lower percentage of time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), revealing increased anxiety-like behavior. However, the percentage of entries to open arms was similar in endometriosis and sham mice. Therefore, the anxiogenic-like effect of ectopic endometrium in these experimental conditions was mild and the present model was not optimal to reveal the emotional component of this painful situation. No significant effects of repeated THC 2 mg/kg were observed on the percentages of time and entries, although THC-treated mice showed a subtle increase in anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, percentage of time in open arms). Previous studies described anxiogenic-like effects of slightly higher doses (3 mg/kg) in naïve male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Viñals et al., 2015</xref>), and anxiolytic-like effects when using lower doses (0.3 mg/kg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puighermanal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Viñals et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, possible effects of THC alleviating pain-related anxiety-like behavior in endometriosis mice could be hindered by intrinsic anxiogenic effects of this THC dose. Therefore, doses with less pain-relieving efficacy could potentially be effective promoting anxiolytic-like effects considering the intrinsic effects of THC on emotional-like behavior. Alternatively, the absence of clear effects of THC on anxiety-like behavior may be associated to the evaluation time point, which was 6 hr after administration to study the impact of pain relief on anxiety-like behavior, rather than to assess direct drug effects. Total arm entries were similar among groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Memory performance was also assessed the third week after starting the THC treatment. As expected, mice exposed to the chronic nociceptive manifestations of endometriosis showed a pronounced cognitive impairment, as well as sham mice exposed to THC, in accordance with previous reports in naïve males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kasten et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puighermanal et al., 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, endometriosis mice repeatedly treated with natural THC showed intact discrimination indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) suggesting protective effects of THC in this chronic inflammatory condition. In agreement, recent studies have shown cognitive improvements after THC exposure in old male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarne et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids have shown modulatory effects on the female reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the effects of THC on the ectopic and eutopic endometrium and on ovarian follicle maturation. Interestingly, endometriosis mice receiving THC 2 mg/kg for 32 days showed an evident inhibition of the development of endometrial cysts (cyst diameter and area of endometrial tissue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) without significant effects on cyst innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In agreement, a previous study showed antiproliferative effects of WIN 55212–2, a synthetic cannabinoid agonist, on endometrial cell cultures and in ectopic endometrium implanted in immunodepressed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leconte et al., 2010</xref>). The assessment of the uterine diameter and the area of eutopic endometrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>) showed no effects of the THC treatment, suggesting that the antiproliferative activity of THC on endometrial cells is restricted to ectopic sites. However, possible effects of THC on established endometriosis lesions were not evaluated. Repeated THC increased the expression of neuronal markers in the uteri of sham mice, similar to the increase provoked by the ectopic endometrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Interestingly, THC prevented this increase in endometriosis mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) indicating again that THC exposure may have different consequences under chronic inflammatory conditions. In agreement, recent studies showed differential effects of THC on the nervous system of rodents with and without chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarne et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate a possible estrogenic influence on these histological findings, we analyzed 17 β-estradiol plasma levels. As expected, 17 β-estradiol plasma levels depended on the phase of the estrous cycle: mice in proestrus had the highest concentration followed by mice in diestrus, and mice in estrus showed the lowest levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, left graph). We found that 17 β-estradiol was similar in all experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, right graph), although the levels of this estrogen were positively correlated with cyst diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, left), proving the estrogenic influence on ectopic endometrial lesions. 17 β-estradiol levels were not correlated with endometrial area of the cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, middle), or uterine innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, right), suggesting independent THC effects on these histological changes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effects of THC on the histological changes observed in mice with ectopic endometrium.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Ectopic endometrial growths of mice treated with THC were smaller (left graph) and had less endometrial tissue (right graph) than those of mice receiving vehicle.

Similarly, the presence of prominent symptoms of endometriosis such as dysmenorrhea or dyspareunia could not be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we show for the first time that chronic administration of a moderate dose of the phytocannabinoid THC relieves mechanical hypersensitivity of caudal abdominal area, pain unpleasantness and cognitive impairment associated with the presence of ectopic endometrial cysts. These behavioral manifestations correlate with a decrease in the size of ectopic endometrium in THC-exposed mice. However, the pain-relieving effects of this particular dose of THC were not accompanied by a modification of anxiety-like behavior associated with endometriosis and effects on spontaneous pain were not evaluated in this work. Interestingly, THC produced opposite cognitive effects in sham and endometriosis mice. THC also induced an increase in markers of uterine innervation in sham animals, but prevented such changes in endometriosis mice, suggesting again different effects of THC under chronic inflammatory conditions. Importantly, THC also inhibited the growth of ectopic endometrium without apparent consequences on the eutopic endometrium and ovarian tissues. Altogether, the present data obtained in a preclinical model of endometriosis underline the interest in conducting clinical research to assess the effects of moderate doses of THC on endometriosis patients. Based on our results, we (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03875261">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, #NCT03875261) and others (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gynica.com/">gynica.com</ext-link>) have planned the initiation of clinical trials to provide evidence on the translatability of these results to women with endometriosis. These novel clinical trials will evaluate this new possible endometriosis treatment under pathological human conditions. However, cannabis has a large number of potential side effects, as well as a high potential for abuse liability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curran et al., 2016</xref>), that have to be considered by physicians and patients. Therefore, the use of cannabis in unregulated scenarios should be discouraged taking into account these serious side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,</italic> female)</td><td>C57Bl/6J</td><td>Charles Rivers, Lyon, France</td><td>C57Bl/6J</td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>THC <break/>(Tetrahydrocannabinol)</td><td>THC-Pharm-GmbH</td><td/><td>Natural THC</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cremophor EL</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>C5135; Kolliphor EL</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>0.9%, NaCl physiological saline</td><td>Laboratorios Ern</td><td>Vitulia</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ethanol</td><td>Scharlab</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scharlab.com/catalogo-productos-detalle-referencia.php?r=ET00051000">ET00051000</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Vaporised Isoflurane in oxygen</td><td>Virbac</td><td>Vetflurane</td><td>4% V/V for induction; 2.5% V/V for maintenance</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Optimal cutting temperature compound</td><td>Sakura finetek</td><td>25608–930</td><td>Item code 4583</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Equus asinus</italic>)</td><td>Normal donkey serum</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>D9663-10ML</td><td>3% in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Capra aegagrus hircus</italic>)</td><td>Normal goat serum</td><td>Vector lab</td><td>S-1000</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-beta-III tubulin antibody</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab18207</td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Donkey polyuclonal anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor A488 antibody</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>A21206</td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor A555 antibody</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab150078</td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DAPI Fluoromount-G mounting media</td><td>SouthernBiotech</td><td>0100–20</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Calcium EDTA (Sodium calcium edetate)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sodium calcium edetate</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ELISA</td><td>Calbiotech</td><td>ES180S-100</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>NIH Image J software</td><td>Wayne Rasband</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism 8</td><td>GraphPad Software, Inc</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>IBM SPSS 23 software</td><td>IBM Corporation</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Smart 3.0 videotracking software</td><td>Panlab</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Female C57Bl/6J mice (Charles Rivers, Lyon, France) were used in all the experiments.

An observer who was blinded to treatment group assignment converted from 4 to 8 images per animal into negative black-and-white images and the threshold was manually adjusted. Images were then dilated, skeletonized and the mean percentage of immunoreactive area was obtained by running the ‘Analyze particles’ function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Determination of 17 β-estradiol plasma levels</title><p>Plasma samples were collected the day of euthanasia in tubes containing calcium EDTA. 17β-estradiol levels were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay - ELISA (ES180S-100, Calbiotech, El Cajon, CA, USA) according to manufacturer instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Ovarian follicle counting</title><p>Sections of ovaries were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and observed under an upright microscope (DM6000 B, Leica Biosystems). The number of pre-antral and antral follicles was determined in every nine sections. Only follicles containing an oocyte were counted and the total number of follicles was estimated by multiplying the raw counts by nine according to published criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Myers et al., 2004</xref>). The number of corpora lutea was determined by direct counting of every 18 sections according to the average corpus luteum diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Numazawa and Kawashima, 1982</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data obtained with the nociception model were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA (surgery as between‐subject factor), two-way repeated measures ANOVA (surgery and treatment as between‐subject factors) or mixed models (surgery and treatment as between‐subject factors and time as within-subject factor) whenever appropriate. Dose-response curve was fitted and ED50 determined using GraphPad Prism 8 (San Diego, CA, USA). Data obtained with the elevated plus maze test, novel object recognition task, histology, immunostaining and ovarian follicle counting were analyzed using a Student t-test (surgery) or a two‐way ANOVA (surgery and treatment). Post hoc Bonferroni analysis was performed after ANOVA when appropriate. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used whenever data did not have a normal distribution or equal variances, followed by Mann Whitney U when appropriate. Correlation between variables was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Data are expressed as individual data points and mean ± SEM, and statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 23 software (Chicago, IL, USA). The differences were considered statistically significant when the p value was below 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Mercè Vilaró Blay, Berta Güell Villena and Astoria Moores for their help and technical expertise.</p></ack><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Conducted the behavioral and molecular experiments, Performed immunohistochemistry and microscopy, Wrote the manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Performed immunohistochemistry and microscopy</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing, Conceptualized and supervised the project, Participated in the experimental design, Wrote the manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing - review and editing, Conceptualized, supervised and funded the project, Participated in the experimental design, Wrote the manuscript</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with standard ethical guidelines (European Communities Directive 2010/63/EU and NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition) and approved by autonomic (Generalitat de Catalunya, Departament de Territori i Sostenibilitat) and local (Comitè Èticd'Experimentació Animal, CEEA-PRBB) ethical committees.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-50356-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data supporting the findings of this study are available within the manuscript and its source data files.

that since approved treatments for endometriosis target either reproductive hormones or prostaglandin synthesis, current medications do not address the anatomical cause of pain and have limited efficacy. Your report showing that THC simultaneously inhibits endometrial cysts and ameliorates mechanical hypersensitivity suggests THC may be a promising treatment option worthy of a clinical trial.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Disease-modifying effects of natural Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol in endometriosis-associated pain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rebecca Craft (Reviewer #1).</p><p>As there was more enthusiasm for the pain component of the study, we suggest that you focus your revision plan on the concerns related to this, as well as to the influence of the estrous cycle. There was more concern regarding the neuroinflammation and anxiety measures. One option is to consider removing these experiments and instead focus this report on pain. If you choose to keep these components in the report, please comment on how you will address each of the concerns raised by the reviewers on these aspects of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes studies undertaken to characterize the effects of THC in a mouse model of endometriosis. For the most part, the experiments are well-designed, the approaches/measures are appropriate, the results are presented clearly and succinctly, and the conclusions are logical. Overall this is a very interesting study with compelling results that should be of considerable interest to the cannabinoid scientific (and medical cannabis using and prescribing) communities. Addressing the issues noted below would further strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1) Repeatedly administered THC was given starting on Day 1 (the day after surgical induction of endometriosis), but endometriosis symptoms as characterized in this model were shown to peak on Day 7. Thus, chronic THC may be attenuating the DEVELOPMENT of endometriosis than reducing established endometriosis. Additionally, the authors conclude that no tolerance develops to THC, but it appears they are basing this conclusion on the comparison of mice treated acutely with 2.0 mg/kg on Day 7 with those that were treated for 7 days leading up to Day 7 (i.e., during symptom development). A more appropriate test of tolerance (and a more valid model of human THC use for endometriosis) would be comparing acute THC on Day 14 in mice that had received vehicle for 13 days vs. those that had received THC daily starting on Day 7, when symptomatology is fully developed. These points should be noted in the discussion. THC may be much more effective at preventing development of pathology than reversing established pathology – which is what patients have.</p><p>2) The authors argue that the lack of effect of THC on the anxiety measure in contrast to its anti-allodynic effect reflects a dissociation between pain-induced anxiety and mechanical allodynia (or different potency of THC on these two endpoints, although that's implied rather than stated). What needs to be acknowledged as well is the possibility of different time courses of THC effect on allodynia vs. anxiety, since the former was assessed 45 min post-THC injection, and the latter was assessed 6 h post-THC injection. Do the authors have time course data using the s.c. route of THC administration for the plus-maze? Please revise the Discussion to acknowledge other possible interpretations.</p><p>3) No measures of spontaneous pain are shown, which is unfortunate because mechanical allodynia alone would seem to be a rather limited assessment of endometriosis pain. Can the authors use their plus maze data – specifically, total arm entries – to assess whether endometriosis suppresses activity in the maze, and whether THC reverses this effect? Otherwise, please acknowledge in the Discussion the potential limitation of measuring a single pain-related behavior, which may not translate well to the human experience of endometriosis pain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Escudero-Lara et al. uses a standard mouse model of endometriosis to study the effects of THC on pain behavior, learning, endometriotic growth/innervation, and hippocampal gene expression. This an important area of research since there is little other work on endometriosis, and it is essential to identify the therapeutic effects of molecules like THC. The study of multiple behavioral alterations in endometriosis with and without THC and even brain expression increases the potential widespread interest of their findings. Nevertheless, the inclusion of these additional modalities in this short-style paper gives short shrift to the explicit evaluation of pain other than von Frey responses.</p><p>The repetitive assessment of &quot;responses&quot; to von-Frey hairs throughout their protocol (to both acute with a dose-effect and chronic THC, endometriosis vs. sham) generates excellent confidence that their endometriosis model and reversal with THC has behavioral effects. However, there is a fundamental question whether this represents actual &quot;pain behavior&quot; or perhaps just anxiety at some experimenter poking near a prior incision site. The &quot;pelvic&quot; testing site is not clarified in the manuscript. Notably, the frequency of responsiveness is relatively consistent across a range force (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This is not allodynia. Does this &quot;hyperalgesia&quot; generalize to other sites? It is important to establish the pelvic specificity of their effects and relevance to endometriosis. (Keep in mind the model does not study the three most problematic symptoms of endometriosis: dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and infertility--This should be explicitly mentioned within the manuscript and is a major limitation). Therefore, it is absolutely critical to establish whether alterations in behavior in this model to a von Frey fiber reflect changes in pain sensitivity, responsiveness at a local or generalized level. Notably, studies for other pain models also use conditioned pain preference with an analgesic to establish levels of pain to verify pain behavior.</p><p>It is also imperative to verify that estrous cycle alterations do not contribute to potential differences between the group. It is possible that the authors already have data on estrous cycle effects (it was in their Materials and methods section), however the reviewer strongly encourages additional experiments confirming the model elicits endometriosis-like pain (location specific and indicative of actual pain not just responsiveness) which is reversed with THC.</p><p>In summary: If it were to be confirmed that endometriosis-related &quot;pain&quot; via a more specific assay and endometriosis cysts/ innervation were reduced accounting for any potential estrous cycle effects, this would be a remarkable paper. It is important to be particularly cautious as a high-impact publication of THC on a &quot;model of endometriosis&quot;, will be considered strong evidence and encourage the use of cannabis in unregulated scenarios.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This series of studies sought to determine if THC administration could ameliorate various pain-related, inflammatory and behavioral outcomes induced by experimental endometriosis. Endometriosis was experimentally induced by surgically implanting endometrium into the peritoneal wall of the pelvic cavity. This procedure resulted in pelvic hypersensitivity, anxiety and the generation of cognitive impairments, particularly in long term memory recall. Acute THC dosing was used to determine an effective dose of pain suppression and 2 mg/kg was sufficient to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity and was chosen for long term studies. Over 32 days of treatment, this dose of THC produced sustained alleviation of pain without tolerance and reversed memory impairments but had no impact on anxiety-like behavior. Endometriosis was also associated with elevated transcription of COX-2 and IL1b in the medial PFC, but not hippocampus, and this was also reversed by sustained THC administration. THC administration also reduced cyst size and uterine innervation. Overall, the data on THC effects on the endometriosis itself are interesting and compelling, but the behavioral and neuroinflammatory effects are moderate, at best, in magnitude and much less convincing relative to the tissue based changes.</p><p>The anxiety-like behavior analysis is incomplete, why is only closed arm entry data shown? Open arm entries and time as well as risk assessments, such as head dips, should also be displayed for the reader to be able to have a full understanding of the behavioral changes seen in this test as opposed to a selected outcomes. More so, this effect seems subtle at best given that it didn't even entirely replicate in the THC arm of the study where only% time, and not% entries, was found to still be elevated by endometriosis.</p><p>The neuroinflammatory changes are not very convincing. The effect seen from endometriosis alone is absent in Il1b and barely present in COX-2 expression, and THC does not have any impact on endometriosis itself as the THC endometriosis animals are virtually the same as the vehicle endometriosis animals, and these groups are not significantly different from one another. Almost all of these effects seem to be carried by the THC alone group, which is irrelevant for the endometriosis phenotype. The manner in which the manuscript is written is misleading as it makes it seem as if endometriosis alone produced a robust neuroinflammatory response that was reversed by THC, but inspection of the data clearly indicates this is not what was found. Also, the links made between this effect and the cognitive deficits seem highly improbable given the magnitude and lack of parallels in the directionality of the effects.</p><p>Could the authors provide the raw data on time spent interacting with the objects in the memory test, these effects can sometimes be very amplified by trivial differences in time interaction due to extremely low levels of interaction with the objects and this data will help to establish if this memory deficit is meaningful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>We very much appreciate the revisions to your manuscript. However, as you can see from the continuing comments of the Reviewers, further revisions are needed before the manuscript will be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We ask that you focus on your conclusions that are based on your most compelling results, which we believe are those that derive from the pain studies. It is also important to include caveats where the results are less convincing. In some areas, we strongly suggest that the studies be saved for a future report. All reviewers and editors agreed that with these revisions your manuscript will be very strong.</p><p>Eliminate the CPP data and related claims.</p><p>The reviewers did not find the CPP data to be convincing. They noted that you show mild CPA from THC in control conditions that is slightly muted in the endometriosis animals, largely because of a shift in baseline (the THC treatment groups in control and endometriosis are largely superimposable). This is difficult to interpret because of the alterations in baseline and the fact that the level of THC used is aversive. They also noted the lack of a dose-response curve for these data makes these data difficult to interpret.</p><p>Provide open arm time and entry data for the EPM data and temper conclusions regarding these data, being more honest about what these data are showing, which is a very mild anxiety phenotype.</p><p>The reviewers noted that open arm, not closed arm, measures are the typical convention in the field, and if not always representative of one another (if center time was also quantified, which is unclear). Additionally, the anxiety effect of endometriosis seems to be lost under conditions of repeated injections, making all of this data difficult to interpret.</p><p>As the dose of THC chosen appears to be anxiogenic in and of itself, please also highlight that since a dose-response curve was not done here.</p><p>The reviewers noted that you do not know if lower doses of THC would be able to impact this behavioral endpoint differently. Perhaps a lower dose of THC that would be ineffective for pain would be effective for anxiety.</p><p>Clarify that the primary tie to endometriosis is the anatomic similarly and abdominal sensitivity. Acknowledge that the evidence for spontaneous pain is weak and if it is present, it is not alleviated by THC, but that THC does reduce abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity and hyperalgesic behavior.</p><p>Acknowledge the limitations of this endometriosis model.</p><p>Clarify the interpretation of Figure 4B.</p><p>The reviewers noted that THC is associated with an increase in innervation in the sham, but not the endometriosis model.</p><p>Remove the display of coefficients in Figure 4.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50356.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript describes studies undertaken to characterize the effects of THC in a mouse model of endometriosis.

Data (Results and Discussion section, subsection “Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol alleviates pelvic pain, restores cognitive function and limits the growth of ectopic endometrium”, Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 2) showed that THC given for the first time on Day 14 was as effective as THC given on the same day after a daily treatment starting on Day 8.

The following sentence in the Results and Discussion section: “chronic THC showed an evident reduction in the size of endometrial cysts ….” was modified to “endometriosis mice receiving THC 2 mg/kg for 32 days showed an evident inhibition of the development of endometrial cysts” and the following sentence was added some lines below: “However, possible effects of THC on established endometriosis lesions were not evaluated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors argue that the lack of effect of THC on the anxiety measure in contrast to its anti-allodynic effect reflects a dissociation between pain-induced anxiety and mechanical allodynia (or different potency of THC on these two endpoints, although that's implied rather than stated). What needs to be acknowledged as well is the possibility of different time courses of THC effect on allodynia vs. anxiety, since the former was assessed 45 min post-THC injection, and the latter was assessed 6 h post-THC injection. Do the authors have time course data using the s.c. route of THC administration for the plus-maze? Please revise the Discussion to acknowledge other possible interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work using the elevated plus maze in our laboratory has shown significant modifications of anxiety-like behavior 30 min and 4 h after acute THC exposure (Célérier et al., 2006; Puighermanal et al., 2013). In our present work, the test was performed 6 h after THC to evaluate possible impact of pain alleviation on anxiety-like behavior, but not to evaluate direct drug effects. Hence, we did not explore the time course of anxiety-like behavior after THC in the endometriosis model. To acknowledge different interpretations of the results on anxiety-like behavior the following sentences were added to the Results and Discussion section: “This evaluation was conducted 6 h after THC administration to study the impact of pain relief on anxiety-like behavior, rather than to assess direct drug effects. Thus, the absence of THC effects could indicate that pain alleviation is independent of anxiety-like responses and may also be associated to the different evaluation time points since the intrinsic effects of THC on anxiety have been revealed in time intervals shorter than 6 h (Célérier et al., 2006; Puighermanal et al., 2013)” and to the Conclusions section: “The pain-relieving effects of THC were not accompanied by a modification of anxiety-like behavior associated with endometriosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) No measures of spontaneous pain are shown, which is unfortunate because mechanical allodynia alone would seem to be a rather limited assessment of endometriosis pain. Can the authors use their plus maze data – specifically, total arm entries – to assess whether endometriosis suppresses activity in the maze, and whether THC reverses this effect? Otherwise, please acknowledge in the Discussion the potential limitation of measuring a single pain-related behavior, which may not translate well to the human experience of endometriosis pain.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted a conditioned place preference experiment to investigate the efficacy of THC alleviating spontaneous pain. In a preconditioning session, sham and endometriosis mice were left in a box containing two main compartments separated by a triangular central division. Afterwards, the compartments were isolated, and mice received alternate injections of vehicle and THC paired to the different main compartments during a total of 8 conditioning sessions. In the test session, sham and endometriosis mice were left in the box with free access to the vehicle and the THC-paired compartments. The time spent in each compartment was compared to the time spent during the preconditioning session. Sham mice developed clear preference for the vehicle-paired compartment (p&lt;0.01 vs. Preconditioning values), revealing an aversive effect of the THC treatment (2 mg/kg) in these experimental conditions. Interestingly, this effect was abolished in endometriosis mice (N.S. differences vs. Preconditioning values) suggesting beneficial effects of THC associated with spontaneous pain relief. As previously mentioned in the revision plan, aversive effects of the THC treatment could be expected, since we and others described aversive effects of THC depending on the dose and experimental conditions (Braida et al., Eur J Pharmacol 2004; Valjent and Maldonado, Psychopharmacology 2000; Lepore et al., Life Sci, 1995). The results of these experiments were added to Results and Discussion (subsection “Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol alleviates pelvic pain, restores cognitive function and limits the growth of ectopic endometrium”, Figure 3D), and a new Conditioned place preference subsection has been added to Materials and methods. The conclusions have also been modified.</p><p>We also included a measure of pain unpleasantness (Corder et al., 2017; Corder et al., 2019) in response to a mechanical stimulus applied against the pelvic area, to provide an additional outcome of pain other than the increase in reflexive nociceptive responses. On day 14 after surgeries, a von Frey filament (4.08, corresponding to 1 g) was applied and the time spent protecting the area by guarding or seeking escape was measured for 30 s. Interestingly, untreated and vehicle-treated endometriosis mice showed a significant increase of the time displaying nocifensive behaviors when compared with untreated or vehicle-treated sham mice, respectively (Figures 1C and 3C). In this case, the subchronic treatment with THC (7 days of THC starting on day 8 after the surgery) was effective inhibiting this behavior, however the effects of acute THC administration given for the first time on day 14 were highly variable. This variable response could be associated to the aversive effects of the THC dose (2 mg(kg). Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that the first THC administration is particularly aversive and this behavioral response is modified after repeated THC exposure (Valjent and Maldonado, Psychopharmacology 2000). In agreement, THC treatments in unexperienced humans usually start with low doses and gradually increase until the effective dose is reached. Whenever adverse events are found, the patients return to the previous dose that was well tolerated. This procedure is followed in clinical settings (MacCallum and Russo, 2018), but could not be implemented in our model. Hence, it is likely that some of the exposed mice experienced aversive effects after the first THC exposure, in agreement with previous studies (Valjent and Maldonado, Psychopharmacology 2000). Methodology was included in the Materials and methods subsection Nocifensive behavior, and the Results and Discussion section was modified in subsection “Ectopic endometrium leads to pelvic pain sensitivity, anxiety-like behavior and memory impairment” and “Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol alleviates pelvic pain, restores cognitive function and limits the growth of ectopic endometrium”.</p><p>We also assessed the effect of endometriosis and the THC treatment on the total arm entries of the plus maze and no significant differences between groups were found. These graphs were included in Figure 1D and Figure 3—figure supplement 4, and data were included in Source Data Files 1 and 3. Comments were added to subsection “Ectopic endometrium leads to pelvic pain sensitivity, anxiety-like behavior and memory impairment” and “Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol alleviates pelvic pain, restores cognitive function and limits the growth of ectopic endometrium”. Absence of differences in total arm entries is an expected result since other mouse models of chronic pain lack alterations in this parameter (Benbouzid et al., Eur J Pain 2012; Chen et al., Neurosci Lett 2013; La Porta et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Escudero-Lara et al. uses a standard mouse model of endometriosis to study the effects of THC on pain behavior, learning, endometriotic growth/innervation, and hippocampal gene expression.

It is important to establish the pelvic specificity of their effects and relevance to endometriosis. (Keep in mind the model does not study the three most problematic symptoms of endometriosis: dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and infertility. This should be explicitly mentioned within the manuscript and is a major limitation). Therefore, it is absolutely critical to establish whether alterations in behavior in this model to a von Frey fiber reflect changes in pain sensitivity, responsiveness at a local or generalized level. Notably, studies for other pain models also use conditioned pain preference with an analgesic to establish levels of pain to verify pain behavior.</p><p>It is also imperative to verify that estrous cycle alterations do not contribute to potential differences between the group.

Mechanical sensitivity in the hind paw was not affected by the presence of ectopic endometrium (Figure 1B). Paw nociception also remained unaltered after THC treatment in endometriosis and sham mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Therefore, the mechanical hypersensitivity found in the pelvic area of endometriosis mice was not due to a generalized pain sensitization, but to local nociceptive responses in the pelvic zone.

To quantify this parameter, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ES180S<sup>-1</sup>00, Calbiotech, El Cajon, CA, USA). The correlation between 17 β-estradiol levels and phase of estrous cycle, uterine innervation and lesion size was investigated.

We found that levels of 17 β-estradiol were similar in all experimental groups (Figure 4C, right panel), although the estrogen levels were positively correlated with cyst diameter (Figure 4E, left), proving the estrogenic influence on ectopic endometrial lesions.

Endometriosis was experimentally induced by surgically implanting endometrium into the peritoneal wall of the pelvic cavity. This procedure resulted in pelvic hypersensitivity, anxiety and the generation of cognitive impairments, particularly in long term memory recall. Acute THC dosing was used to determine an effective dose of pain suppression and 2 mg/kg was sufficient to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity and was chosen for long term studies. Over 32 days of treatment, this dose of THC produced sustained alleviation of pain without tolerance and reversed memory impairments but had no impact on anxiety-like behavior. Endometriosis was also associated with elevated transcription of COX-2 and IL1b in the medial PFC, but not hippocampus, and this was also reversed by sustained THC administration. THC administration also reduced cyst size and uterine innervation. Overall, the data on THC effects on the endometriosis itself are interesting and compelling, but the behavioral and neuroinflammatory effects are moderate, at best, in magnitude and much less convincing relative to the tissue based changes.</p><p>The anxiety-like behavior analysis is incomplete, why is only closed arm entry data shown? Open arm entries and time as well as risk assessments, such as head dips, should also be displayed for the reader to be able to have a full understanding of the behavioral changes seen in this test as opposed to a selected outcomes.

The effect seen from endometriosis alone is absent in Il1b and barely present in COX-2 expression, and THC does not have any impact on endometriosis itself as the THC endometriosis animals are virtually the same as the vehicle endometriosis animals, and these groups are not significantly different from one another. Almost all of these effects seem to be carried by the THC alone group, which is irrelevant for the endometriosis phenotype. The manner in which the manuscript is written is misleading as it makes it seem as if endometriosis alone produced a robust neuroinflammatory response that was reversed by THC, but inspection of the data clearly indicates this is not what was found.

In addition, the Abstract and the Results and Discussion section was modified to temper the conclusions regarding these data and to give more accurate description of the anxiety-like phenotype as suggested:</p><p>– Abstract: “female mice develop pelvic mechanical hypersensitivity in the caudal abdomen, mild anxiety-like behavior and substantial memory deficits”</p><p>– Results and Discussion: “endometriosis mice exhibited enhanced anxiety-like behavior reflected in lower percentages of time and entries to the open arms of the elevated plus maze”</p><p>– Results and Discussion: “Additional experiments were conducted to assess the effects of THC on the anxiety-like behavior induced by endometriosis pain (Figure 3D). As in previous experiments, endometriosis mice showed a lower percentage of time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (Figure 3D), revealing increased anxiety-like behavior. However, the percentage of entries to the open arms was similar in endometriosis and sham mice. Therefore, the anxiogenic-like effect of the ectopic endometrium in these experimental conditions was mild and the present model was not optimal to reveal the emotional component of this painful situation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the dose of THC chosen appears to be anxiogenic in and of itself, please also highlight that since a dose-response curve was not done here.</p><p>The reviewers noted that you do not know if lower doses of THC would be able to impact this behavioral endpoint differently. Perhaps a lower dose of THC that would be ineffective for pain would be effective for anxiety.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion about the anxiogenic effects of THC has now been modified as follows:</p><p>“No significant effects of repeated THC 2 mg/kg were observed on the percentages of time and entries, although THC-treated mice showed a subtle increase in anxiety-like behavior (Figure 3D, percentage of time in open arms). Previous studies described anxiogenic-like effects of slightly higher doses (3 mg/kg) in naïve male mice (Viñals et al., 2015), and anxiolytic-like effects when using lower doses (0.3 mg/kg, Puighermanal et al., 2013; Viñals et al., 2015). Thus, possible effects of THC alleviating pain-related anxiety-like behavior in endometriosis mice could be hindered by intrinsic anxiogenic effects of this THC dose. Therefore, doses with less pain-relieving efficacy could potentially be effective promoting anxiolytic-like effects considering the intrinsic effects of THC on emotional-like behavior. Alternatively, the absence of clear effects of THC on anxiety-like behavior may be associated to the evaluation time point, which was 6 h after administration to study the impact of pain relief on anxiety-like behavior, rather than to assess direct drug effects. Total arm entries were similar among groups (Figure 3D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarify that the primary tie to endometriosis is the anatomic similarly and abdominal sensitivity. Acknowledge that the evidence for spontaneous pain is weak and if it is present, it is not alleviated by THC, but that THC does reduce abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity and hyperalgesic behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript was modified to emphasize that the mouse model mainly reproduces the histopathological features of endometriosis and the related abdominal hypersensitivity. Thus, the new version acknowledges a lack of evidence for THC alleviating spontaneous pain and highlights its effects reducing hypersensitivity of the caudal abdomen and the cognitive impairment associated with endometriosis. The terms “pelvic” or “pelvis” were changed to “abdominal” or “caudal abdomen / caudal abdominal area” thorough the manuscript to increase the accuracy of the terminology:</p><p>– Abstract: “In this model, female mice develop mechanical hypersensitivity in the caudal abdomen, mild anxiety-like behavior and substantial memory deficits associated with the presence of extrauterine endometrial cysts. Interestingly, daily treatments with THC (2 mg/kg) alleviate mechanical hypersensitivity and pain unpleasantness, modify uterine innervation and restore cognitive function without altering the anxiogenic phenotype”.</p><p>– Introduction section: “This work investigates the effects of natural THC in a mouse model of endometriosis that reproduces the ectopic endometrial growths and some of the behavioral alterations of clinical endometriosis. Our data show that THC is effective inhibiting hypersensitivity in the caudal abdominal area without inducing tolerance, as well as reducing the pain unpleasantness associated with endometriosis. Notably, THC also prevents the cognitive impairment observed in mice with ectopic endometrium without modifying anxiety-like behavior at this particular dose. Interestingly, THC shows efficacy limiting the development of ectopic endometrium, revealing disease-modifying effects of this natural cannabinoid”.</p><p>– Results and Discussion section: “Hence, mice with ectopic endometrium recapitulate in our model some of the symptomatology observed in the clinics, although manifestations of spontaneous pain could not be evaluated in this work”.</p><p>– Results and Discussion section: “Interestingly, we also found increased expression of the neuronal marker β-III tubulin in the uteri of endometriosis mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), mimicking not only some of the symptoms but also the histological phenotype observed in women with endometriosis (Miller EJ, 2015; Tokushige et al., 2006)”.</p><p>– Conclusions section: “chronic administration of a moderate dose of the phytocannabinoid THC relieves mechanical hypersensitivity of caudal abdominal area, pain unpleasantness and cognitive impairment associated with the presence of ectopic endometrial cysts. These behavioral manifestations correlate with a decrease in the size of ectopic endometrium in THC-exposed mice. However, the pain-relieving effects of this particular dose of THC were not accompanied by a modification of anxiety-like behavior associated with endometriosis and effects on spontaneous pain were not evaluated in this work”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Acknowledge the limitations of this endometriosis model.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, Introduction, Results and Discussion and Conclusions sections were modified to acknowledge that the model reproduces some of the symptoms observed in women with endometriosis, but the presence of spontaneous pain and other symptoms of endometriosis could not be revealed in the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarify the interpretation of Figure 4B.</p><p>The reviewers noted that THC is associated with an increase in innervation in the sham, but not the endometriosis model.</p></disp-quote><p>The distinct effects of THC on uterine innervation were discussed in the Results and Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Repeated THC increased the expression of neuronal markers in the uteri of sham mice, similar to the increase provoked by the ectopic endometrium (Figure 4B). Interestingly, THC prevented this increase in endometriosis mice (Figure 4B) indicating again that THC exposure may have different consequences under chronic inflammatory conditions. In agreement, recent studies showed differential effects of THC on the nervous system of rodents with and without chronic inflammation (Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2017; Sarne et al., 2017)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Remove the display of coefficients in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Coefficients were removed from Figure 4D and placed in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
