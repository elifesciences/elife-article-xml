family of adaptive immune systems that use small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases to protect prokaryotes from invading plasmids and viruses (i.e., phages). Type III systems launch a multilayered immune response that relies upon both Cas and non-Cas cellular nucleases, and although the functions of Cas components have been well described, the identities and roles of non-Cas participants remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> employs two degradosome-associated nucleases, PNPase and RNase J2, to promote crRNA maturation and eliminate invading nucleic acids (Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019). Here, we identify RNase R as a third ‘housekeeping’ nuclease critical for immunity. We show that RNase R works in concert with PNPase to complete crRNA maturation and identify specific interactions with Csm5, a member of the type III effector complex, which facilitate nuclease recruitment/stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RNase R and PNPase are required to maintain robust anti-plasmid immunity, particularly when targeted transcripts are sparse. Altogether, our findings expand the known repertoire of accessory nucleases required for type III immunity and highlight the remarkable capacity of these systems to interface with diverse cellular pathways to ensure successful defense.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>staphylococci</kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic></kwd><kwd>RNA degradosome</kwd><kwd>Type III CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas10</kwd><kwd>bacterial immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB/2054755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatoum-Aslan</surname><given-names>Asma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1020298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatoum-Aslan</surname><given-names>Asma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal that the bacterial nucleases PNPase and RNase R work in concert with a type III-A CRISPR-Cas immune system to process small CRISPR RNAs and ensure robust immunity against foreign nucleic acid invaders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-Cas (<underline>C</underline>lustered <underline>r</underline>egularly <underline>i</underline>nterspaced <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>p</underline>alindromic <underline>r</underline>epeats-<underline>C</underline>RISPR <underline>as</underline>sociated) systems are adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes that use small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) in complex with Cas nucleases to sense and degrade foreign nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jansen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hille et al., 2018</xref>). The CRISPR-Cas pathway generally occurs in three stages—adaptation, crRNA biogenesis, and interference. During adaptation, Cas nucleases clip out short sequences (known as ‘protospacers’) from invading nucleic acids and integrate them into the CRISPR locus as ‘spacers’ in between short DNA repeats. During crRNA biogenesis, the repeat-spacer array is transcribed as a long precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA), which is subsequently processed within repeats to generate mature crRNAs that each bear a single spacer sequence. Mature crRNAs combine with one or more Cas nucleases to form effector complexes, which, during interference, detect and cleave matching nucleic acid invaders. Although all CRISPR-Cas systems follow this general pathway, they exhibit striking diversity in the composition of their effector complexes and mechanisms of action. Accordingly, they have been divided into two classes, six types (I–VI), and over 30 subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Makarova et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koonin and Makarova, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Type III CRISPR-Cas systems are the most closely related to the ancestral system from which all class I systems have evolved and are arguably the most complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohanraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koonin and Makarova, 2022</xref>). Type III systems typically utilize multi-subunit effector complexes that recognize foreign RNA and coordinate a sophisticated immune response that results in the destruction of the invading RNA and DNA. Of the six subtypes currently identified (A–F), types III-A and III-B are the best characterized. In these systems, crRNA binding to a complementary transcript triggers at least three catalytic activities by members of the effector complex: target RNA shredding by Cas7/Csm3/Cmr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Staals et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>), nonspecific DNA degradation by Cas10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Estrella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>), and Cas10-catalyzed production of cyclic-oligoadenylates (cOAs), second-messenger molecules that bind and stimulate accessory nucleases outside of the effector complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nasef et al., 2019</xref>). Such accessory nucleases typically possess CRISPR-associated Rossman Fold (CARF) domains to which cOAs bind and are encoded within or proximal to the type III CRISPR-Cas locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shmakov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarova et al., 2020a</xref>). Indeed, recent studies have relied upon these two features to discover new cOA-responsive accessory nucleases and validate their contributions to type III defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athukoralage et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rostøl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). However, as the list of CRISPR-associated accessory nucleases continues to grow, the identities and contributions of non-Cas participants in type III immunity remain poorly understood.</p><p>Our previous work showed that the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (herein referred to as CRISPR-Cas10) employs the ‘housekeeping’ nucleases PNPase and RNase J2 during multiple steps in the immunity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). During crRNA biogenesis, Cas6 cleaves pre-crRNAs within repeats to generate 71 nucleotide (nt) intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2014</xref>), and these intermediates are processed on their 3′-ends by PNPase and one or more unidentified nuclease(s) to produce mature species of 43, 37, and 31 nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019</xref>). We also showed that PNPase helps prevent phage nucleic acid accumulation during an active infection, implying a direct role for PNPase during interference. While searching for additional maturation nuclease(s), we fortuitously identified RNase J2 as another player in the pathway; however, while it has little/no effect on crRNA maturation, RNase J2 is essential for interference against phage and plasmid invaders. Notably, PNPase and RNase J2 are members of the RNA degradosome, a highly conserved complex of ribonucleases, helicases, and metabolic enzymes primarily involved in RNA processing and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tejada-Arranz et al., 2020</xref>). Our original observation that these nucleases co-purify in trace amounts with the Cas10-Csm complex in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker et al., 2017</xref>) led to the discovery of their additional contributions to CRISPR-Cas defense.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNase R and PNPase are necessary for crRNA maturation in the cell.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The type III-A CRISPR-Cas system (herein referred to as CRISPR-Cas10) in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a encodes three spacers (colored squares), four repeats (light gray squares), and nine CRISPR-associated (<italic>cas</italic> and <italic>csm</italic>) genes (colored pentagons). (<bold>B</bold>) During crRNA biogenesis, the repeat-spacer array is transcribed into a precursor crRNA and processed into mature species in two steps. In the first step, the endoribonuclease Cas6 cleaves within repeat sequences to generate intermediate crRNAs of 71 nt in length. In the second step, intermediates are trimmed on their 3′-ends by PNPase and other unknown nuclease(s), which are the subject of this study. These activities generate mature crRNAs that range from 43 to 31 nt in length. (<bold>C</bold>) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas10, Csm2, Csm3, Csm4, and Csm5 in various stoichiometries to form the Cas10-Csm effector complex. Interference is initiated when the effector complex binds to invading transcripts that bear complementarity to the crRNA. During interference, invading DNA and RNA are degraded by CRISPR-associated (Cas) and non-Cas nucleases (see text for details).

Furthermore, we identified specific interactions between these ‘housekeeping’ nucleases and Csm5 (a member of the Cas10-Csm complex within the Cas7 group), which facilitate their recruitment and/or stimulation. Altogether, our findings expand the known repertoire of non-Cas nucleases that facilitate type III CRISPR-Cas defense and highlight the remarkable capacity of this system to interface with diverse nondefense cellular pathways to maintain robust immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNase R and PNPase are necessary for crRNA maturation in the cell</title><p>Previously, we showed that an in-frame deletion of <italic>pnp</italic> (which encodes PNPase) in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> causes loss of about half of the mature crRNA species and significant (approximately tenfold) accumulation of intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019</xref>), indicating that one or more additional nucleases contribute to crRNA maturation. We also showed previously that PNPase co-purifies with the Cas10-Csm complex in sub-stoichiometric amounts along with at least five additional cellular nucleases that serve as maturation nuclease candidates—RNase J1, RNase J2, Cbf1, RNase R, and RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Given that crRNA maturation relies upon 3′–5′ exonuclease activity, here we sought to investigate the two remaining nucleases in the list that possess this function—Cbf1 and RNase R. Unfortunately, repeated attempts to delete <italic>cbf1</italic> from <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> failed, suggesting that it may be essential for cell viability under standard laboratory growth conditions. However, <italic>rnr</italic> (which encodes RNase R) was readily deleted in the clinical isolate <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christensen et al., 1987</xref>) as well as in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680, a mutant variant of RP62a that has lost the CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). To determine the extent to which RNase R contributes to crRNA maturation in vivo, a plasmid that encodes the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system of RP62a, p<italic>crispr-cas/csm2<sup>H6N</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>) was introduced into <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680/Δ<italic>rnr</italic>. Importantly, this construct encodes a 6-histidine (6-His) tag on the N-terminus of Csm2, which allows for complex purification via Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography. Cas10-Csm complexes were subsequently purified from the wild-type (WT) and Δ<italic>rnr</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), crRNAs were further purified from the complexes and visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and fractions of intermediate species were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This experiment revealed that deletion of RNase R alone causes complete loss of precisely processed mature species and production of crRNAs with a range of aberrant lengths. To confirm that the loss of RNase R is responsible for this phenotype, we returned <italic>rnr</italic> to its native locus in the genome to generate <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680/Δ<italic>rnr::rnr*</italic>—in this strain, silent mutations were introduced into <italic>rnr</italic> to distinguish the knock-in strain from original WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). The same assays were then repeated and showed that crRNAs in the complemented strain have sizes similar to those found in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). These results demonstrate that RNase R is necessary for crRNA maturation in vivo.</p><p>In order to determine the extent to which other nuclease(s) may contribute to crRNA maturation in the absence of RNase R and PNPase, we created and tested a double-knockout. Specifically, <italic>rnr</italic> was deleted from the LM1680/Δ<italic>pnp</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019</xref>) to generate LM1680/Δ<italic>rnr</italic>Δ<italic>pnp</italic>, and crRNAs within the complexes were examined. The results showed a complete loss of mature species in the double mutant, with ~95% of crRNAs trapped in the intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). In addition, when <italic>rnr</italic> is returned to the double mutant (i.e., in LM1680/Δ<italic>rnr</italic>Δ<italic>pnp::rnr*</italic>), some mature crRNAs are recovered with significant accumulation of the 71 nt intermediates, similar to the phenotype observed in LM1680/Δ<italic>pnp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, 2019</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that RNase R and PNPase are likely the primary drivers of crRNA maturation in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNase R and PNPase are sufficient to catalyze crRNA maturation in a purified system</title><p>Given that the deletion of RNase R on its own causes complete loss of precisely processed mature species in vivo, while deletion of PNPase still allows for some maturation to occur, the possibility exists that RNase R alone might be sufficient to catalyze maturation to completion in a purified system (i.e., in the absence of nonspecific cellular RNA substrates). Conversely, it is also possible that other nucleases in the cell (such as Cbf1) might contribute to crRNA maturation. Indeed, Cbf1 (also called YhaM) is known to work together with other 3′–5′ exonucleases in the cell to help clear RNA decay intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broglia et al., 2020</xref>). To determine the extent to which these housekeeping nucleases catalyze crRNA maturation on their own, we performed nuclease assays with purified components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In these assays, Cas10-Csm complexes loaded with 71 nt intermediate crRNAs (Cas10-Csm (71)) were purified from LM1680/Δ<italic>rnr</italic>Δ<italic>pnp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and combined with purified RNase R, PNPase, and/or Cbf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). After 30 min of incubation with appropriate divalent metals, crRNAs were extracted from the complexes and visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). As expected, the Cas10-Csm (71) complex is unable to catalyze crRNA maturation on its own. Interestingly, Cbf1 is also incapable of cleaving intermediate crRNAs associated with the complex. In contrast, RNase R and PNPase each cause partial processing of crRNA intermediates on their 3′-ends, with cleavage patterns similar to those observed when one or the other nuclease is deleted from cells—addition of PNPase produces a pattern of crRNA lengths similar to that seen in LM1680/Δ<italic>rnr</italic> cells, and addition of RNase R into the reaction generates crRNA lengths similar to those extracted from LM1680/Δ<italic>pnp</italic> cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). Even when given up to 60 min in the in vitro assay, RNase R alone is unable to process about half of the intermediate crRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, when RNase R and PNPase are combined in the reaction, the majority of crRNA intermediates are processed to the appropriate mature lengths (43, 37, and 31 nt) with proportions bearing a striking resemblance to those observed when crRNAs are purified from WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that RNase R and PNPase are both necessary and sufficient to process intermediate crRNAs associated with the Cas10-Csm complex to achieve their final mature lengths.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RNase R and PNPase are sufficient to complete crRNA maturation in a purified system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of experimental flow of the crRNA maturation nuclease assay.

Previously, we showed that Csm5 (a member of the complex within the Cas7 group) directly interacts with PNPase in a purified system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker et al., 2017</xref>), and since deletion of <italic>csm5</italic> causes complete loss of crRNA maturation while allowing for the remainder of the complex to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>), we reasoned that RNase R recruitment is also likely to be facilitated by Csm5. To test this, RNase R and Csm5 were resolved alone and combined in a native polyacrylamide gel, which separates proteins on the basis of size and charge. As expected, Csm5 fails to enter into the gel at near-neutral pH due to its basic isoelectric point (pI, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and resulting positive charge in the native running conditions, while RNase R migrates into the native gel and shows up as a band following Coomassie staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, RNase R appears to self-associate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng and Deutscher, 2002</xref>), which accounts for its shallow migration into the gel. Nonetheless, we observed that the addition of increasing amounts of Csm5 to RNase R causes the band to shift upward, indicating that the two proteins interact. This interaction is likely weak/transient because Csm5 must be added in excess (up to 9:1) to observe a noticeable band shift. To confirm that the interaction is specific to RNase R, we repeated the same assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA), which also has an acidic isoelectric point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and no such shift was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To provide further support for a direct interaction between Csm5 and RNase R, we performed an affinity pulldown assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In this assay, Csm5-His10-Smt3 is loaded onto a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-agarose column, the column is washed to remove unbound protein, and then untagged RNase R (or protein buffer) is allowed to flow through the column. Following extensive washing of unbound proteins, proteins remaining in the column are eluted three times using a buffer containing imidazole. Consistent with the weak/transient interaction observed between the two proteins, non-stoichiometric amounts of RNase R were found to co-elute with Csm5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Importantly, untagged RNase R alone fails to stick to the column when subjected to the same wash and elution steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

One possibility is that the nuclease docking site(s) might be spread over multiple subunits of the Cas10-Csm complex, with Csm5 contributing to the bulk of the interaction(s). Another nonexclusive possibility is that both nucleases may be recruited by the same/overlapping binding site(s) on Csm5, with one or the other allowed to occupy the site at any given time. Such transient and dynamic interactions are known to occur with proteins bearing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), flexible polypeptides enriched with charged residues that have the capacity to bind multiple partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyson and Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakrabarti and Chakravarty, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bigman et al., 2022</xref>).

Specifically, nearly half of the residues in Csm5 (~44%) reside in loop/coil structures or were unresolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, magenta or not visible, respectively), and IDR 2 comprises a short loop and a short beta strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> D, cyan). Notably, IDR2 lies directly adjacent to 19 residues that are unresolved in the structure (amino acids 291–309).

In contrast, full complexes were recovered in the presence of three deletions spanning 18, 31, or 46 amino acids encompassing IDR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Interestingly, crRNAs bound to these complexes exhibited a range of aberrant lengths with significant (&gt;50%) accumulation of 71 nt intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), suggesting that IDR2 within Csm5 may facilitate interactions with RNase R and/or PNPase.</p><p>We further tested for direct interactions using gel shift assays, in which Csm5Δ46 was purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), combined with RNase R or PNPase in different proportions, and resolved on native polyacrylamide gels.

Previously, we showed that in addition to the physical interaction between Csm5 and PNPase, there is also a functional interaction in which Csm5 stimulates PNPase’s nucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). To determine the impact of IDR2 on PNPase activity, nuclease assays were performed in which a 31 nt ssRNA substrate was incubated with PNPase and/or Csm5 for increasing amounts of time. Consistent with previous results, we found that Csm5 alone has no impact on substrate length, PNPase (which is a dual polymerase nuclease) causes both RNA extension and degradation, and when the two proteins are combined, stimulation of PNPase’s nucleolytic activity occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, Csm5Δ46 fails to cause such stimulation, consistent with the loss of physical interaction between Csm5Δ46 and PNPase.

We began by testing immunity against diverse staphylococcal phages using various overexpression systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, immunity against siphovirus CNPx was tested in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680 bearing p<italic>crispr-cas/csm2<sup>H6N</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In this plasmid, the second spacer (<italic>spc2</italic>) targets the phage pre-neck appendage (<italic>cn20</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daniel et al., 2007</xref>), which is likely to be expressed late in the phage infection cycle. Phage challenge assays were performed by spotting tenfold dilutions of CNPx atop lawns of LM1680 cells bearing variants of the plasmid, incubating plates overnight, and enumerating phage plaques (i.e., clear zones of bacterial death) the next day. As expected, lawns of WT cells with the WT plasmid showed zero plaques, while lawns of WT cells bearing the empty vector allowed for tens of millions of plaques to form (measured as plaque-forming units per milliliter [pfu/ml]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of <italic>rnr</italic> alone or in combination with <italic>pnp</italic> caused no detectible defect in immunity. Surprisingly, even deletion of <italic>csm5</italic> from the plasmid had no impact on CRISPR function. In light of these observations, we wondered whether overexpressing the CRISPR-Cas system might compensate for mild defects. Thus, we tested another system that relies upon <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a (with an intact <italic>crispr-cas</italic> locus) bearing the multicopy plasmid p<italic>crispr</italic>, which contains a single repeat and spacer targeting phage(s) of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bari et al., 2017</xref>). Since CNPx cannot form plaques on RP62a, phage challenge assays with podophage Andhra and myophage ISP were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, the WT strain with the empty vector allows for the formation of millions-billions of plaques, while RP62a strains with p<italic>crispr</italic> and appropriate phage-targeting spacers allow for zero plaques to form. Interestingly, RP62a strains devoid of <italic>rnr</italic> and/or <italic>pnp</italic> maintained robust immunity against both phages. Since previous work has shown that type III-A immunity relies more heavily on the accessory nuclease Csm6 when phage late gene(s) are targeted owing to the lag in transcript/protospacer expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>), we explored the impact of targeting genes that are predicted to be expressed early vs. late in the infection cycle. Specifically, spacers targeting genes that encode Andhra’s DNA polymerase (early, <italic>spcA1</italic>), major tail protein (late, <italic>spcA2</italic>), and lysin-like peptidase (late, <italic>spcA3</italic>), as well as ISP’s lysin (late, <italic>spcI</italic>), were tested. Contrary to our expectations, robust anti-phage immunity was maintained in all strains. These results indicate that RNase R and PNPase may have little/no impact on immunity against diverse phages in these overexpression systems.</p><p>We next tested anti-plasmid immunity using a conjugation assay that relies entirely upon chromosomally encoded components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In this assay, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a recipients are mated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN4220 cells harboring the conjugative plasmid pG0400. The first spacer in RP62a’s <italic>crispr-cas</italic> locus (<italic>spc1</italic>) bears complementarity to the nickase (<italic>nes</italic>) gene in pG0400 and therefore mitigates the conjugative transfer of the plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, mating assays performed with <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN4220/pG0400-WT donor cells and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a WT recipients produced hundreds of transconjugants (i.e., <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> recipients that have acquired pG0400-WT); however, when <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a/<italic>Δspc1-3</italic> cells were used as recipients, &gt;10,000 transconjugants were recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

In light of these observations, we wondered whether the defect in anti-plasmid immunity in RP62a/<italic>ΔrnrΔpnp</italic> could be alleviated by targeting the more abundant <italic>nes</italic> transcript. To test this, we designed two spacers against the <italic>nes</italic> open-reading frame, <italic>spc-opt</italic> and <italic>spc-sub</italic>, which encode crRNAs that are complementary to (optimal) and identical to (suboptimal) the <italic>nes</italic> transcript, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, these spacers completely overlap and therefore share the same GC content. Furthermore, the corresponding protospacers are devoid of complementarity between the 5′-tag on the crRNA and corresponding anti-tag region on the targeted transcript, a necessary condition that signals ‘non-self’ and licenses immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2010</xref>).

Here, we demonstrate that two housekeeping nucleases, RNase R and PNPase, work in concert to trim the 3′-ends of intermediate crRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) and promote robust anti-plasmid immunity in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Since intermediate crRNAs can mediate a successful immune response under certain conditions, such as when the CRISPR-Cas system is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) or when a highly expressed transcript is targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), the functional value of crRNA maturation is likely nominal and may occur simply as a consequence of the preemptive recruitment of RNase R and PNPase to the effector complex to assist during interference.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for how diverse housekeeping nucleases are enlisted to ensure successful defense.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During Cas10-Csm complex assembly, Csm5 recruits and/or stimulates RNase R and PNPase through direct interactions.

Previous studies have shown that while highly expressed target RNAs elicit a robust and sustained immune response that results in the swift elimination of nucleic acid invaders, low-abundance targets evoke a weak immune response, and corresponding invaders are more difficult to clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rostøl and Marraffini, 2019</xref>). In the latter scenario, the Cas10-Csm complex requires the help of Csm6, an accessory nuclease encoded in the CRISPR-Cas locus that is not part of the complex. Csm6 has nonspecific endoribonuclease activity that is stimulated when bound to cOAs produced by Cas10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nasef et al., 2019</xref>), and Csm6-mediated degradation of transcripts derived from both the invader and host causes growth arrest until the foreign nucleic acids are cleared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rostøl and Marraffini, 2019</xref>). Once recruited by the complex, PNPase and RNase R likely degrade nucleic acids in the vicinity nonspecifically, similarly to Csm6. Interestingly, Csm6 is dispensable for immunity when targeted transcripts are highly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rostøl and Marraffini, 2019</xref>), similar to RNase R and PNPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Altogether, our observations support a model in which RNase R and PNPase are recruited as accessory nucleases to ensure a successful defense against nucleic acid invaders, particularly when targeted transcripts have low abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In spite of these similarities with Csm6, RNase R and PNPase have distinct functional roles in the cell and mechanisms by which they are enlisted for defense. Unlike Csm6, PNPase and RNase R are 3′–5′ exonucleases primarily involved in housekeeping functions—PNPase is a member of the RNA degradosome, a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes RNA processing and degradation, and RNase R performs similar/overlapping functions, but works independently of the degradosome in most organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bechhofer and Deutscher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tejada-Arranz et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to its RNase activity, PNPase has the capacity to degrade single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker et al., 2017</xref>), presumably to facilitate DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardenas et al., 2009</xref>). These activities are harnessed by the Cas10-Csm complex through direct interactions—Csm5 essentially borrows both nucleases through weak/transient interactions, and PNPase’s nuclease activity is further stimulated when bound to Csm5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). While the specific binding site for RNase R remains unknown, a predicted IDR on the C-terminus of Csm5 is responsible for recruitment and stimulation of PNPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since RNase R and PNPase are each about twice the size of Csm5, their association with the Cas10-Csm complex is likely mutually exclusive, and their docking site(s) may also overlap with other components in the complex. Regardless of the precise molecular requirements for recruitment, Cas10-Csm’s ability to interface with diverse cellular nucleases is remarkable and bears striking parallels to the assembly of prokaryotic degradosomes and eukaryotic granules, which rely upon ‘hub’ proteins to recruit multiple members of enzyme complexes through transient interactions with one or more IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tejada-Arranz et al., 2020</xref>). Given that most type III CRISPR-Cas systems possess Csm5 homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Makarova et al., 2020b</xref>), and RNase R and PNPase are evolutionarily conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zuo and Deutscher, 2001</xref>), their enlistment in type III CRISPR-Cas defense may be a common feature in diverse organisms.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Harnessing the activities of housekeeping nucleases and channeling their diverse activities toward defense may have evolved as a strategy to minimize the genetic footprint of complex immune systems while cutting the energetic costs associated with manufacturing enzymes with redundant functions. Supporting this notion, diverse CRISPR-Cas systems have been shown to tap into the pool of cellular housekeeping nucleases to perform different steps in their immunity pathways. The earliest example of this phenomenon was discovered over a decade ago in the type II CRISPR-Cas system of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, in which processing of both crRNAs and the trans-encoded small RNA (tracrRNA) was shown to rely upon RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>). RNase III-mediated crRNA/tracrRNA processing is now considered a universal feature of type II systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Makarova et al., 2020b</xref>). In addition, new spacer acquisition (i.e., adaptation) in type I and II systems has been shown to rely upon the DNA repair machinery RecBCD and AddAB in Gram-negative and -positive organisms, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Modell et al., 2017</xref>).

Beyond these more common systems, CRISPR-Cas variants in which one or more <italic>cas</italic> nucleases are missing were shown to rely upon degradosome nucleases to perform essential functionalities. In one such example, a type III-B variant in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 that lacks a Cas6 homolog relies upon RNase E to catalyze processing of pre-crRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behler et al., 2018</xref>).

Since housekeeping nucleases are needed on a daily basis and therefore less likely to be lost via natural selection, it is plausible that their enlistment in nucleic acid defense may be more widespread than currently appreciated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Corresponding media were supplemented with the following: 10 µg/ml chloramphenicol (to select for p<italic>crispr-spc</italic>-, p<italic>crispr-cas</italic>-, and pKOR1-based plasmids), 15 µg/ml neomycin (to select for <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> cells), 5 µg/ml mupirocin (to select for pG0400-based plasmids), 50 µg/ml kanamycin (to select for pET28b-His10Smt3-based plasmids), and 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol (to select for <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 [DE3]). Phages CNPx and ISP were propagated using <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680 as host, and phage Andhra was propagated using <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a as host. For phage propagation, overnight cultures of the corresponding hosts were diluted at 1:100 in BHI supplemented with 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and phage (10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37°C with agitation for 5 hr. One-fifth of the volume of host cells (grown to mid-log) was added into the bacteria-phage mixture and incubated for an additional 2 hr at 37°C with agitation. Cells were pelleted at 5000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant containing phage was filtered using a 0.45 µm syringe filter. Phage titers were determined using the double-agar overlay method as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cater et al., 2017</xref>. Briefly, a semisolid layer of 0.5× heart infusion agar (HIA) medium (Hardy Diagnostics, CA) containing 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and a 1:100 dilution of overnight host culture was overlaid atop a solid layer of Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) (BD Diagnostics) plates supplemented with 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Filtered phages were diluted in tenfold dilutions and spotted atop the semisolid layer, spots were air-dried, and plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. Plaques were then enumerated, and phage titers in plaque-forming units/ml (pfu/ml) were determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Construction of pKOR1-based plasmids and transformation into <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680</title><p>The pKOR1 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae and Schneewind, 2006</xref>) was used to create in-frame deletions of <italic>rnr</italic> (encodes RNase R) and to reinsert an <italic>rnr</italic> variant (<italic>rnr</italic>*, which has two silent mutations, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) into <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680 WT and Δ<italic>pnp</italic> strains, and RP62a WT and Δ<italic>pnp</italic> strains. The pKOR1 vector was used as a template to amplify the backbone for all pKOR1-based constructs with primers A481/L138 via PCR amplification. The plasmid, pKOR1-Δ<italic>rnr</italic>, was created using a three-piece Gibson assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>) and used to delete <italic>rnr</italic>.

archaea from infection of foreign genetic elements like phages and plasmids. The work presented here demonstrates that some CRISPR systems (i.e., type III-A) rely on host nucleases (i.e., RNase R and PNPase) for faithful processing of CRISPR RNAs into short mature CRISPR RNA (crRNAs) that are required for defense. Collectively, this work expands our fundamental understanding of degradosome-associated nucleases, and their contribution to the adaptive immune response in bacteria.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81897.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Wiedenheft</surname><given-names>Blake</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02w0trx84</institution-id><institution>Montana State University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.18.500432">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.500432v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Based on results in Figure 1E, the authors claim &quot;RNase R alone causes complete loss of precisely-processed mature species and production of crRNAs with a range of aberrant lengths, as well as moderate accumulation of 71 nt intermediates.&quot; However, the &quot;moderate accumulation of 71 nt intermediates&quot; is very weak, not quantified, and is not supported by the complementation assay of rnr, which has more 71 nt intermediates than either the WT or the deletion mutant. Quantify data and modify claims for accuracy.</p><p>2. Add the Ni-affinity purified Cas10-Csm complex from LM1680/(△pnp/△rnr) cells on the gel presented in Figure 2B.</p><p>3. The authors rely on gel shifts to show a physical association between RNase R and Csm5. However, Csm5 doesn't enter the gel for reasons explained by the π and RNase R oligomerizes in a concentration-dependent manner. These factors complicate the interpretation of the gel shift. The authors should complement the gel shift with an alternative method. One referee suggests adding a tag to Csm5 that can be detected by Western blot the other suggests isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Acceptance for publication does not require a physical interaction but testing this interaction using an alternative method is required.</p><p>4. The authors used the structure of S. thermophilus Csm5 to guide their design of truncations to probe potential intrinsically disordered regions (IDR1 and IDR2) that may be sites of interaction with PNPase or RNase R. Since the authors submitted their manuscript, an AlphaFold predicted structure of the S. epidermidis Csm5 has been released on the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. In this model, the IDR2 region is predicted by AlphaFold to be a β strand at the center of a β sheet, rather than a disordered region. If the prediction is accurate, deletion of this strand could cause Csm5 to misfold, making it difficult to interpret what causes loss of interaction with PNPase (i.e. deletion of a specific interaction surface versus misfolding of the overall tertiary structure). In light of this, the discussion surrounding these experiments should be altered to include more caveats about the truncations, and conclusions based on this experiment should be softened.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is possible with the AlphaFold structural model of S. epidermidis Csm5 (or using AlphaFold Multimer) that the authors may be able to design more conservative truncations or point mutations that block the interaction between PNPase and Csm5. While AlphaFold only provides a structural prediction and should be taken with a grain of salt, this particular sequence is predicted with high confidence, which has generally been found to provide highly accurate structural models. This may therefore be a better alternative to mapping potential interaction regions than comparing to an ortholog that could have gaps/insertions in comparison to the sequence of interest.</p><p>2. For the native gels testing an interaction between Csm5 and RNase R, have the authors tested whether Csm5 is present in the shifted band (e.g. by adding a tag to Csm5 and performing a Western blot)? This would substantially strengthen the conclusions that could be drawn from this experiment.</p><p>3. In the Discussion section, the authors compare PNPase and RNase R requirements to that of Csm6, stating that all three appear to be dispensable for phage defense when targeting high-abundance transcripts. Have the authors tested anti-phage activity upon deletion of RNase R and PNPase in a strain lacking Csm6? If the three nucleases act synergistically, it is possible that deletion of all three may reduce the anti-phage activity that is not affected in strains lacking csm6 or pnp/rnr. Although I understand this is a lot to ask using the strain with an endogenous CRISPR-Cas locus, this experiment could potentially be done using the Lm1680 strains bearing pcrispr-cas in which csm6 is deleted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Based on results in Figure 1E, the authors claim &quot;RNase R alone causes complete loss of precisely-processed mature species and production of crRNAs with a range of aberrant lengths, as well as moderate accumulation of 71 nt intermediates.&quot; However, the &quot;moderate accumulation of 71 nt intermediates&quot; is very weak, not quantified, and is not supported by the complementation assay of rnr, which has more 71 nt intermediates than either the WT or the deletion mutant. Consider revising these statements for accuracy. The addition of deep sequencing would help clarify the identity of these intermediate RNA species and explain the role of RNase R in moving these intermediate RNAs into the mature fraction.</p><p>The authors should consider adding deletions of pnp alone to Figure 1, so readers can make a direct comparison between rnr and rnr/pnp double mutants. A pnp complementation (△pnp:: pnp*), and pnp/rnr complementation (△pnp/△rnr:: pnp*/rnr*) should also be added for the same reasons (i.e., side-by-side comparisons).</p><p>The authors should consider running the Ni-affinity purified Cas10-Csm complex from LM1680/(△pnp/△rnr) cells on the gel presented in Figure 2B.</p><p>The authors rely on gel shift to show a physical association between RNase R and Csm5. However, Csm5 doesn't enter the gel for reasons explained by the π and RNase R oligomerizes in a concentration dependent manner. These factors complicate the interpretation of the gel shift. The authors should consider complementing the gel shift with an alternative method (i.e., ITC) that would enable a quantitative measure of the binding affinity.</p><p>The authors speculate &quot;that both nucleases may be recruited by the same/overlapping binding site(s) on Csm5, with one or the other allowed to occupy the site at any given time. Such transient and dynamic interactions are known to occur with proteins.&quot; In figure 2 the authors test either or both nucleases, but it may work testing one, then the other, to determine if the order of addition impacts RNA length or efficiency of processing.</p><p>&quot;The results showed that while Csm5△46 maintains its interaction with RNase R (Figure 5—figure supplement 1),&quot; The migration of the proteins is modest and complicated by the high PI. These experiments would benefit from another technique that provides a more quantifiable metric.</p><p>&quot;striking stimulation of PNPase's nucleolytic activity occurs (Figure 5C).&quot; I do not disagree that there is some stimulation, but it may not be as strike to some readers as it is to these authors. I recommend quantifying these data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81897.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

As described in the figure legend, the fraction of crRNA intermediates were quantified by dividing the density of the band comprising the 71 nt intermediate by the sum of densities of bands comprising the intermediate plus each processed mature species (43, 37, and 31 nt bands). Since the deletion of RNase R causes near complete loss of the precisely-processed mature species, the denominator in the ratio is much reduced, resulting in the apparent accumulation of intermediates.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that “accumulation of the 71 nt intermediates” is probably not the best way to describe the phenotype in the RNase R deletion mutant and likely detracts from the more obvious defect in the mutant (i.e. the production of crRNAs with a range of aberrant lengths). Thus, we have removed “moderate accumulation of 71 nt intermediates” from the revised manuscript as recommended by the reviewers. Also, we opted to keep the quantification in Figure 1F as is because we believe it is valuable to show the more prominent differences in 71 nt intermediates in the other mutant strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We now have added an affinity pulldown assay as an alternative method to demonstrate the interaction between Csm5 and RNase R (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In this assay, Csm5-His10-Smt3 is loaded onto a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-agarose column, the column is washed to remove unbound protein, and then untagged RNase R (or protein buffer) is allowed to flow through the column (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 A). Following extensive washing of unbound proteins, those remaining in the column are eluted three times using a buffer containing imidazole. Consistent with the weak/transient interaction observed between the two proteins, non-stoichiometric amounts of RNase R were found to co-elute with Csm5 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 B and C). Importantly, untagged RNase R alone fails to stick to the column when subjected to the same wash and elution steps (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 D). This new data has been added to the revised manuscript and described in the narrative (lines 196-205 in the marked-up revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors used the structure of S. thermophilus Csm5 to guide their design of truncations to probe potential intrinsically disordered regions (IDR1 and IDR2) that may be sites of interaction with PNPase or RNase R. Since the authors submitted their manuscript, an AlphaFold predicted structure of the S. epidermidis Csm5 has been released on the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. In this model, the IDR2 region is predicted by AlphaFold to be a β strand at the center of a β sheet, rather than a disordered region. If the prediction is accurate, deletion of this strand could cause Csm5 to misfold, making it difficult to interpret what causes loss of interaction with PNPase (i.e. deletion of a specific interaction surface versus misfolding of the overall tertiary structure). In light of this, the discussion surrounding these experiments should be altered to include more caveats about the truncations, and conclusions based on this experiment should be softened.</p></disp-quote><p>While this manuscript was under review, several cryo-EM structures of the Cas10-Csm complex from <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> were solved and reported (Smith <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022, <italic>Structure</italic>). In the unbound complex (PDB ID 7V02), IDR2 of Csm5 does indeed overlap with a short β strand, but it is flanked by loops/unstructured regions. In addition, of the 46 residues that we deleted in the Csm5D46 mutant, 20 residues are unresolved in the experimentally-determined structure, supporting the notion that this region is generally flexible. Also, it is unlikely that this and the other Csm5 deletion mutants are misfolded because they all retain the ability to associate with the complex (Figure 4B), and we were able to readily purify the mutant with the largest deletion (Csm5△46) without any issues (Figure 5).</p><p>To address this concern, we added panel D in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, which highlights the IDR regions in Csm5 from the recently-published <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Cas10-Csm complex structure and integrated the observations mentioned above in the narrative (lines 241-247 in the marked-up revised manuscript). We also softened the conclusions based on these experiments (lines 276-278 in the marked-up revised manuscript):</p><p>“Taken together, these results suggest that the IDR2 region of Csm5 likely plays a role in the recruitment and stimulation of PNPase, while the binding site for RNase R may reside elsewhere in Csm5”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

To bolster the claim of a direct interaction between Csm5 and RNase R, we performed an additional affinity pulldown assay (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).

This would be interesting to test in a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Based on results in Figure 1E, the authors claim &quot;RNase R alone causes complete loss of precisely-processed mature species and production of crRNAs with a range of aberrant lengths, as well as moderate accumulation of 71 nt intermediates.&quot; However, the &quot;moderate accumulation of 71 nt intermediates&quot; is very weak, not quantified, and is not supported by the complementation assay of rnr, which has more 71 nt intermediates than either the WT or the deletion mutant. Consider revising these statements for accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed under the essential revisions point number 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The addition of deep sequencing would help clarify the identity of these intermediate RNA species and explain the role of RNase R in moving these intermediate RNAs into the mature fraction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We feel that the genetic and biochemical data presented provide strong enough support for the main conclusion in this manuscript that RNase R is involved in crRNA maturation. However, we agree that RNA-seq could be informative to determine if RNase R is needed to process a specific subset of crRNAs with common 3’-end sequences/structures. This seems appropriate for a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider adding deletions of pnp alone to Figure 1, so readers can make a direct comparison between rnr and rnr/pnp double mutants. A pnp complementation (△pnp:: pnp*), and pnp/rnr complementation (△pnp/△rnr:: pnp*/rnr*) should also be added for the same reasons (i.e., side-by-side comparisons).</p></disp-quote><p>We intentionally excluded these data because most are already presented in the original paper (Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2019) and we did not wish to show redundant information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider running the Ni-affinity purified Cas10-Csm complex from LM1680/(△pnp/△rnr) cells on the gel presented in Figure 2B.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added as a separate panel, Figure 2B in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors rely on gel shift to show a physical association between RNase R and Csm5. However, Csm5 doesn't enter the gel for reasons explained by the π and RNase R oligomerizes in a concentration dependent manner. These factors complicate the interpretation of the gel shift. The authors should consider complementing the gel shift with an alternative method (i.e., ITC) that would enable a quantitative measure of the binding affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed under the essential revisions point number 4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors speculate &quot;that both nucleases may be recruited by the same/overlapping binding site(s) on Csm5, with one or the other allowed to occupy the site at any given time.

As explained in the essential revisions point number 4 above, we used a pulldown assay to confirm Csm5 WT-RNase R weak interaction, which manifests as a subtle shift in a native gel. We attempted ITC, but this has proven very challenging with demonstrating Csm5 interactions (with PNPase or RNase R) because the Csm5 prep readily precipitates when kept at room temperature for an extended period. We are actively pursuing other more quantitative assays to measure the interactions between Csm5 and PNPase/RNase R and hope to have such data available in a follow-up manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;striking stimulation of PNPase's nucleolytic activity occurs (Figure 5C).&quot; I do not disagree that there is some stimulation, but it may not be as strike to some readers as it is to these authors.

It is difficult to quantify this data because the stimulation manifests as a shift towards smaller band lengths rather than a faster disappearance of uncut substrate.
