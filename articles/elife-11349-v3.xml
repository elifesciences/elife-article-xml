We generated nanobodies against the vertebrate nuclear pore complex (NPC) and used them in STORM imaging to locate individual NPC proteins with &lt;2 nm epitope-label displacement. For this, we introduced cysteines at specific positions in the nanobody sequence and labeled the resulting proteins with fluorophore-maleimides. As nanobodies are normally stabilized by disulfide-bonded cysteines, this appears counterintuitive. Yet, our analysis showed that this caused no folding problems. Compared to traditional NHS ester-labeling of lysines, the cysteine-maleimide strategy resulted in far less background in fluorescence imaging, it better preserved epitope recognition and it is site-specific. We also devised a rapid epitope-mapping strategy, which relies on crosslinking mass spectrometry and the introduced ectopic cysteines. Finally, we used different anti-nucleoporin nanobodies to purify the major NPC building blocks – each in a single step, with native elution and, as demonstrated, in excellent quality for structural analysis by electron microscopy. The presented strategies are applicable to any nanobody and nanobody-target.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11349.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11349.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11349.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibodies not only protect humans and other animals against disease-causing bacteria and viruses. They can also be used as tools for medical diagnostics and basic research. Conventional antibodies consist of light and heavy protein chains, and both are required to bind to target molecules (or antigens). Alpacas, llamas and camels, however, possess simpler antibodies that lack light chains and bind to antigens via a single protein domain. Such domains can be produced in &quot;re-programmed&quot; bacteria and are then called nanobodies. Compared to normal antibodies, nanobodies are 10-fold smaller, which is of great advantage in virtually all practical applications.</p><p>Pleiner et al. made nanobodies against the nuclear pore complex (or NPC for short) – a nanoscopic machine for transporting large biological molecules in and out of the cell’s nucleus. These nanobodies can be linked to dyes called fluorophores and then used to stain NPCs so that they can be observed under a microscope.</p><p>When fluorophores were attached, in the traditional way, via the amino acid lysine, all tested nanobodies performed poorly in fluorescence microscopy - pointing to a systematic problem. Pleiner et al. therefore explored an alternative, namely to label nanobodies via engineered cysteines. This was counterintuitive, because nanobodies contain already two other cysteines that must not be modified and that normally form a stabilizing “disulfide” bond. Pleiner et al. found, however, that the labeling reaction is absolutely specific for the engineered surface cysteines when it is performed at low temperature. This strategy consistently yielded imaging reagents that could effectively deliver fluorophores as close as 1-2 nanometers to their antigens. Nanobodies labeled in this way are therefore ideal to exploit the full potential of super-resolution microscopy.</p><p>The engineered surface cysteines proved also useful as &quot;position sensors&quot; to report which region of an antigen is actually contacted by a given nanobody.</p><p>Nanobodies are also used to purify protein complexes from crude cell extracts by a method called affinity chromatography. Previously, nanobodies were chemically attached to an insoluble matrix, and bound protein complexes were released under conditions that destroy interactions between proteins. Pleiner et al. now replaced the destructive step with a step that uses an enzyme to cut a bond and gently detach the nanobody (along with any bound protein complex) from the matrix. Bound protein complexes thus stay intact and can be studied further. In the future, this strategy can be applied to nanobodies that recognize tags commonly added to proteins (i.e. GFP) to isolate virtually any protein complex for functional assays or structural analyses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11349.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11349.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd><kwd>label displacement</kwd><kwd>site-specific</kwd><kwd>native purification</kwd><kwd>epitope mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stark</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name><name><surname>Urlaub</surname><given-names>Henning</given-names></name><name><surname>Görlich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protocols that greatly simplify the use of nanobodies in fluorescence imaging and affinity purification have been developed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nanobodies represent antigen-binding domains of 'heavy-chain-only' camelid antibodies and are typically selected by phage display from an immune library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbabi Ghahroudi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muyldermans, 2013</xref>). Their small size (~13 kDa), monoclonal nature and high specificity are ideal for applications like affinity purification or protein detection and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Helma et al., 2015</xref>). Their utility as crystallization chaperones is also widely appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desmyter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Nanobodies are commonly expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and secreted into the oxidative periplasm, where their conserved internal disulfide bond can be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vincke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>). Periplasmic expression comes, however, with several drawbacks. For example, it often results in low final yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004</xref>), probably due to saturation of the secretion machinery and aggregation of precursor proteins in the cytoplasm. The limited set of chaperones and high proteolytic activity in the periplasm also restrict the choices of fusion tags that can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Marco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feilmeier et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the purification of periplasmic proteins involves considerably more hands-on time than purification from the cytoplasm.</p><p>In typical affinity chromatography applications, nanobodies are covalently attached to a resin, which later necessitates harsh conditions for the elution of bound target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rothbauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>). This is appropriate for an identification, but hardly for any further downstream structural or functional analysis of the purified target proteins. As a workaround, a native isolation of protein A-tagged protein complexes using a specific nanobody modified with a dithiothreitol (DTT)-cleavable crosslinker was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fridy et al., 2015</xref>). However, the achievable yield was modest, as most of the isolated complexes resisted release. Furthermore, the presence of any thiol-reducing agent (like DTT or glutathion) during binding is incompatible with this method.</p><p>In traditional indirect immunofluorescence, epitopes are initially decorated with a primary antibody and detected with a fluorophore-labeled secondary one, each around 12–15 nm in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris et al., 1998</xref>). The effective displacement between label and epitope can reach up to 24–30 nm and thus significantly deteriorate the achievable precision and accuracy of protein localization by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). Nanobodies (diameter: 4 nm) are an ideal solution to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szymborska et al., 2013</xref>). This, however, requires a direct nanobody labeling. Ideally, labeling should be site-specific, so that the remaining small displacement between epitope and fluorescent dye can be predicted and corrected for in the measurements.</p><p>So far, nanobodies were labeled at lysines by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>), which is random and rarely quantitative. As we show below, it also deteriorates signal-to-background ratios or even completely abolishes epitope recognition. A workaround to this basic problem was the addition of a C-terminal oligo-lysine stretch to divert labeling from nanobody framework lysine residues (described for the anti-GFP nanobody 'Enhancer' in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Platonova et al., 2015</xref>). This, however, increases the epitope-label distance again. Furthermore, fluorescent labeling of nanobodies using Sortase A was presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Witte et al., 2012</xref>). This strategy is limited to the N- or C-terminus and uses modified fluorophores that are not readily available. Adding an extra C-terminal cysteine (for subsequent maleimide modification) to a periplasmically expressed nanobody was also not a satisfying solution, because it led to a severe reduction in yield and caused extensive dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Massa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Hence, we explored solutions to the above-described limitations of the current nanobody technology. We demonstrate functional cytoplasmic expression of nanobodies with protease-cleavable tags for native affinity purification and with engineered cysteines for site-specific fluorescent labeling. We chose the <italic>Xenopus</italic> nuclear pore complex (NPC) as a model target and developed a toolbox of high-affinity nanobodies against its major constituent proteins, nucleoporins (Nups), which occur in large subcomplexes. Using specific nanobodies, we purified their target protein complexes from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract in a single step with native elution based on proteolytic matrix-release. This allowed a direct analysis of nanobody-purified endogenous Nup complexes by negative stain electron microscopy. Labeling these anti-Nup nanobodies with NHS ester fluorescent dyes for imaging often produced non-functional reagent or significant background staining. We therefore implemented a simple and generally applicable strategy for obtaining site-specifically fluorophore-labeled nanobodies of superior imaging quality. It involves engineered cysteines at the nanobody surface, their modification with maleimide fluorophores, and leaves the internal framework cysteines fully intact. This strategy allowed super-resolution imaging of NPCs with a negligible label displacement and very low background. A novel strategy for rapid mapping of conformational nanobody epitopes via crosslinking mass spectrometry involving the engineered surface cysteines is also presented here.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>NPCs are gateways for nucleocytoplasmic transport. Their very large size of ≈110 MDa not only places them amongst the largest molecular machines, but also poses formidable challenges for any structural and functional investigation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurt and Beck, 2015</xref>). Nucleoporins are organized in multiple subcomplexes around a central eightfold rotational symmetry axis.

As expected, we observed by differential scanning fluorimetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niesen et al., 2007</xref>) a decreased thermostability of fully reduced anti-Nup98 and anti-Nup93 nanobodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

First, the yield often exceeds 100 mg per liter of culture and can be up to 30 times higher as compared to periplasmic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Second, it saves hands-on time, because a cumbersome preparation of a periplasmic fraction is bypassed, and third, a far broader range of fusion modules can be used.</p><p>We exploited this for affinity purification of endogenous target protein complexes with nanobodies and native elution. For this strategy, we produced His<sub>14</sub>-Avi-(GlySer)<sub>9</sub>-SUMOStar-(GlySer)<sub>9</sub>-nanobody fusions and purified them by Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelate affinity chromatography and imidazole elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

It then mediates binding of the purified nanobody to streptavidin magnetic beads. The interspersed long unfolded Gly-Ser spacers minimize steric hindrance effects. The SUMOStar module is an engineered SUMO variant that cannot be cleaved by endogenous eukaryotic desumoylases but by an engineered SUMOStar protease (LifeSensors), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). In combination, these modules allow native elution of nanobody-bound target proteins or protein complexes by cleaving the tag with nanomolar concentrations of the SUMOStar protease. This strategy also provides a purer and more specific end product, because any protein species, which sticks non-specifically to the beads, will not be released. Thus, such highly specific protease elution makes the otherwise crucial control for matrix background-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marcon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>) essentially dispensable.</p><p>As a proof of principle, we purified five nucleoporin complexes from a <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>).

High background-staining was also observed with the Alexa Fluor 647 NHS-labeled anti-Nup98 nanobody TP377.

We therefore considered crosslinking nanobodies to their target followed by sequencing of the crosslinked target peptide via mass spectrometry as a rapid epitope mapping strategy. Here, a crucial aspect is that a shorter crosslinker will provide a better spatial resolution, provided crosslinkable groups are in reach. As cysteines are by far the best crosslinkable groups, and because we had already placed cysteines at the nanobody surface in close proximity to bound targets, we assessed their suitability for epitope-mapping.</p><p>As a proof of principle, we crosslinked two anti-Nup93 nanobodies, with or without an N-terminal cysteine, to Nup93 using either an NH<sub>2</sub>-to-NH<sub>2</sub> (Bis-NHS; BS3; 11.4Å) or an SH-to-NH<sub>2</sub> (Mal-NHS; BMPS; 5.9 Å) crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).

While these nanobodies will be very valuable to the nucleocytoplasmic transport field, we expect the presented strategies to be widely applicable to all nanobodies.</p><p>Nanobodies against a single epitope of a larger protein complex now allow a native single-step purification of the entire complex, and thus a subsequent structural and functional analysis. This is certainly especially useful for complexes that are not directly accessible to recombinant production. Furthermore, nanobody-purified endogenous complexes can be used as antigens for another round of immunization, and binders to all complex components can then be selected from the successive nanobody library. Mapping epitopes via crosslinking mass spectrometry will become especially important when selecting nanobodies against such complex antigens (like large subcomplexes, whole organelles or vesicles) that cannot be made recombinantly. Combining these strategies therefore has the potential to significantly increase throughput in the selection and identification of renewable binders to eukaryotic proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colwill et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we introduced a method for a reliable fluorescent labeling of nanobodies using surface cysteines and maleimide chemistry. This way, we obtained well-behaved imaging reagents that can bring fluorescent dyes as close as 1–2 nm to their target. Maleimide-labeled nanobodies consistently recognized their antigens far better and produced less background than the corresponding NHS-modified variants. NHS esters have the additional disadvantage that they react not only with amino groups, but also rapidly hydrolyze in aqueous buffers. This makes it difficult to adjust labeling densities and requires adding them in substantial molar excess. In contrast, maleimide-labeling of exposed cysteines is quantitative even with just stoichiometric amounts of labeling reagent and thus far more economical.</p><p>Site-specific and quantitative fluorescent labeling of nanobodies is going to be crucial for super-resolution microscopy aiming at a detailed structural analysis or determination of absolute protein copy numbers. It also allows predicting the effective label displacement, a fact that will be especially important when applying particle averaging techniques to localization microscopy data (precision of &lt;1 nm reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szymborska et al., 2013</xref>).

A fiber laser (MPB Communications, 2RU-VFL-P-1000-642) was used to generate 642 nm light. The laser illumination was configured such that the illumination angle could be varied between an epi-illumination geometry and a total internal reflection (TIRF) illumination mode. Typically, the sample was illuminated with oblique illumination (not TIRF) for reduced background signal. Fluorescence emission of Alexa Fluor 647 was detected using an EMCCD camera (Andor Ixon DU860). STORM data analysis was carried out using custom analysis software, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Crystallization and structure determination</title><p>The <italic>Xenopus</italic> Nup98<sup>716-866</sup> NPC anchor domain and the anti-Nup98 nanobody TP377 were expressed with an N-terminal His<sub>14</sub>-bdSUMO-tag and purified using Ni<sup>2+</sup> chelate affinity chromatography. Crystallization required an exchange of the surface-exposed cysteine 821 of Nup98 to serine. Highly pure untagged protein was cleaved off the column using 50 nM bdSEN1P protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frey and Görlich, 2014</xref>) in 20 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl. The complex was formed by incubating equimolar amounts of Nup98<sup>716-866</sup> and TP377 o/n at 4°C and then subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q HP 5 ml column (GE Healthcare). The eluted complex was then further purified using gel filtration on a Hi-Load Superdex 75 16/60 column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl. The complex was crystallized by the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops. 60 nl of a reservoir solution containing 45% (w/v) Pentaerythritol propoxylate (17/8 PO/OH; Jena Bioscience) and 100 mM Tris pH 8.5 was mixed with 60 nl of the prepared protein complex solution concentrated to 25 mg/ml. Crystals grew within 1 day at 20°C and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without additional cryo-protection. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K with a wavelength of 0.9787 Å on the beamline PXII at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland. Crystals belonged to the space group P4<sub>1</sub> and diffracted to 1.9 Å (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For structure determination, molecular replacement was performed in PHASER with a published nanobody structure (PDB 4KRN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmitz et al., 2013</xref>) as a search model. The resulting electron density map was used for automated model building in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Epitope mapping via crosslinking mass spectrometry</title><p>Anti-Nup93 nanobodies TP179 or TP324 and Nup93 (~20 µM each) were incubated on ice for 30 min in Maleimide labeling buffer to allow complex formation. After adding 40 µM of crosslinking agent, the pH was increased to 7.5 and the reaction was continued for 1 h on ice. The following crosslinkers were used 'Mal-NHS' = BMPS (3-[Maleimido]propionic acid NHS ester, Iris Biotech, CAS #55750-62-4) and 'Bis-NHS' = BS3 (Suberic acid bis[sulfo NHS ester], Life Technologies, CAS #82436-77-9). One-eighth of the reaction was loaded on a SDS–PAGE gel. The band corresponding to crosslinked products was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt and Urlaub, 2009</xref>). The peptide fragments were extracted in a solvent system containing 5% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% formic acid (FA) to a final volume of 20–30 µl and submitted to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.</p><p>For LC-MS/MS analysis, 6 µl of the sample solution was injected into a nano-liquid chromatography system (UltiMate<sup>TM</sup> 3000 RSLCnano system) including a 3 cm × 150 µm inner diameter C18 trapping column in-line with a 30 cm × 75 µm inner diameter C18 analytical column (both in-house packed with 1.9 µm C18 material, Dr. Maisch GmbH). Peptides were desalted on the trapping column for 3 min at a flow rate of 10 µl/min in 95% of mobile phase A (0.1% FA in H<sub>2</sub>O, v/v) and 5% of mobile phase B (80% ACN and 0.05% FA in H<sub>2</sub>O, v/v), eluted from the trapping column, and separated on the analytical column using a 43 min linear gradient of 15–46% mobile phase B at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Separated peptides were analyzed on-line with an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The 20 most intense precursor ions with charge states 3–8 in the survey scan (380–1580 m/z scan range) were isolated in the quadrupole mass filter (isolation window 1.6 m/z) and fragmented in the higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell with 30% normalized collision energy. A dynamic exclusion of 20 s was used. Both the survey scan (MS1) and the product ion scan (MS2) were performed in the Orbitrap at 120,000 and 30,000 resolution, respectively. Spray voltage was set at 2.3 kV and 60% of S-lens RF level was used. Automatic gain control (AGC) targets were set at 5×10<sup>5</sup> and 5×10<sup>4</sup> for MS1 and MS2, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Database search for crosslinked peptides</title><p>The raw data of LC-MS/MS analysis were converted to mascot generic format (mgf) files by Proteome Discoverer 2.0.0.802 software (Thermo Scientific). The mgf files were searched against a FASTA database containing the sequences of the nanobody and Nup93 by pLink 1.22 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) using a target-decoy strategy. Database search parameters included mass accuracies of MS1 &lt;10 ppm and MS2 &lt;20 ppm, carbamidomethylation on cysteine and oxidation on methionine as variable modifications. The number of residues of each peptide on a crosslink pair was set between 4 and 100. A maximum of two trypsin missed-cleavage sites were allowed. The results were obtained with 1% false discovery rate. The identified crosslinks were filtered with a threshold of at least two spectral counts and a pLink score &lt; 10e-4.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Ulrike Teichmann and Rolf Rümenapf for animal care and immunization; Jens Krull, Renate Rees, Heinz-Jürgen Dehne and Gabriele Hawlitscheck for excellent technical assistance; Volker Cordes for sharing the HeLa GFP-Nup153 cell line; Koray Kirli for help with sequence analysis; Alpacas Olga and Doris for kindly sharing their exquisite immune repertoire; the crystallization facility of our institute for providing the robotic screening infrastructure, Nataliia Naumenko and Cornelia Paz for critical reading of the manuscript and the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft as well as the DFG (SFB860) for funding this work.

The only suggestion we did not implement was to move <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> to the supplements, because we still believe that this is a very central piece of data (showing that maleimide labeling of nanobodies works through at least 6 different ectopic cysteine positions).</p></body></sub-article></article>
