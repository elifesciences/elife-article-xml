mechanism of action of these compounds in human cells often undermines their value as drug leads. Here, we used a loss-of-function genetic screen in human haploid KBM7 cells to discover the mechanism of action of the anticancer natural product ophiobolin A (OPA). We found that genetic inactivation of de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) mitigates OPA cytotoxicity by reducing cellular PE levels. OPA reacts with the ethanolamine head group of PE in human cells to form pyrrole-containing covalent cytotoxic adducts and these adducts lead to lipid bilayer destabilization. Our characterization of this unusual cytotoxicity mechanism, made possible by unbiased genetic screening in human cells, suggests that the selective antitumor activity displayed by OPA may be due to altered membrane PE levels in cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14601.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14601.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14601.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many of the medications that are available to treat cancer are either collected from natural sources or inspired by molecules existing in nature. While it is often challenging to understand how these natural compounds selectively kill cancer cells, characterizing these mechanisms is essential if researchers are to develop new anticancer drugs and treatments based on these compounds.</p><p>Ophiobolin A is a compound naturally made by a fungus in order to attack plant cells. It is also able to potently kill cancer cells from humans. In particular, ophiobolin A is a promising candidate for treatment of a type of brain tumor called glioblastomas, which are notoriously difficult to treat with existing medications.</p><p>Using a newly developed method, Chidley et al. have now tested which components of human cancer cells are important for ophiobolin A to exert its killing effect. The method revealed that ophiobolin A was less able to kill cancer cells if the cells had lower levels of a molecule called phosphatidylethanolamine in their surface membranes. This observation led Chidley et al. to show that ophiobolin A enters the membrane of human cancer cells and combines chemically with phosphatidylethanolamine to form a new composite molecule. Further experiments showed that the formation of this composite molecule disrupted a model membrane, which suggests that ophiobolin A kills cancer cells by breaking their membranes.</p><p>The next challenge is to understand exactly how the composite molecule kills cancer cells via membrane disruption. It also remains unclear if the anticancer activity of ophiobolin A results from cancer cells having a membrane composition that is different from normal cells, and why this difference arises in the first place.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14601.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14601.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chemical biology</kwd><kwd>mechanism of action</kwd><kwd>cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>covalent modification</kwd><kwd>drug development</kwd><kwd>genetic screen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chidley</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008273</institution-id><institution>Novartis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chidley</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PBELP3-135869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chidley</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unbiased genetic screen in human cells shows that the molecular target of a natural product with promising anticancer activity is a membrane phospholipid.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural products are an important source for the development of pharmaceutical drugs, especially in oncology; half of all anticancer drugs developed since the 1940s are natural products or derivatives of natural products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newman and Cragg, 2012</xref>). Compounds with anticancer activity can be readily identified in cytotoxicity assays and other phenotypic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harvey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eggert, 2013</xref>). To use these small molecules as anticancer drug leads or to identify new chemotherapy molecular targets, it is essential to characterize the molecular mechanism of action (MOA) that underlies cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schenone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bunnage et al., 2015</xref>). However, as unraveling the MOA of bioactive small molecules remains challenging and time consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schenone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ziegler et al., 2013</xref>), the MOA of many natural products that display promising anticancer activities in phenotypic screens remains uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shoemaker, 2006</xref>). An example of such a natural product is ophiobolin A (OPA), a plant toxin isolated from pathogenic fungi of the <italic>Bipolaris</italic> genus which displays cytotoxicity at nanomolar concentrations against a range of cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Au et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bury et al., 2013</xref>). OPA induces paraptosis, a form of non-apoptotic cell death, in glioblastoma cells and displays antitumor activity in a mouse glioblastoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasari et al., 2015</xref>). The toxicity of OPA to plants is believed to involve calmodulin inhibition via formation of a covalent adduct between OPA and specific lysine side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leung et al., 1984</xref>). More recently, it has been shown in synthetic studies that primary amines react with the 1,4-dicarbonyl moiety of OPA to form covalent adducts and that this moiety is critical for animal cell cytotoxicity, leading the authors to suggest that the MOA of OPA in animal cells is through covalent modification of an unknown intracellular target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasari et al., 2015</xref>). In conclusion, OPA represents an interesting candidate for the treatment of glioblastomas that are resistant to classical pro-apoptotic therapeutic approaches, but the lack of information on cellular targets of OPA impedes any further development.</p><p>Genetic screens represent an unbiased genome-wide approach to identify molecular targets involved in small molecule MOA but have been mainly limited to application in genetically tractable organisms such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roemer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Recent technical breakthroughs, such as insertional mutagenesis in haploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carette et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2011</xref>) and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smurnyy et al., 2014</xref>) have revolutionized the use of genetic screens in human cell lines to facilitate the study of the MOA of bioactive molecules in model systems more relevant to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nijman, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To unravel the MOA of OPA, we took advantage of a genome-wide strategy in human cells to identify genes that are required for OPA to exert its cytotoxic effect. We used insertional mutagenesis in the near-haploid human cell line KBM7 to generate loss-of-function mutants and then selected for growth of cell lines resistant to OPA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carette et al., 2011</xref>). We discovered that inactivation of the pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), also named the Kennedy pathway, confers resistance to OPA. Increased OPA resistance was correlated with decreased cellular PE levels. Surprisingly, we determined that the molecular target of OPA is PE itself; OPA forms a covalent adduct with PE in human cells. This work illustrates the power of unbiased genetic screens in human cells in discovering novel MOAs of compounds identified in phenotypic screens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of targets of anticancer drugs in human cells</title><p>Loss-of-function genetic screens in human KBM7 cells have been used to identify cellular factors that are necessary for entry of viruses and bacterial toxins, and transporters of small molecules, but rarely to identify the molecular targets of small molecule drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nijman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Winter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reiling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birsoy et al., 2013</xref>). Before applying the screen to studies of compounds of unknown MOA displaying anticancer activity, we first determined whether such screens can robustly identify genes involved in the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs with well-characterized MOAs. Briefly, we used a retroviral gene-trap approach to generate approximately 75 million insertions in the near-haploid human cell line KBM7, covering more than 95% of all expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carette et al., 2011</xref>). This library of loss-of-function cell lines was treated with a toxic dose of anticancer drug and resistant mutants were allowed to grow over 3 weeks. Retroviral insertion sites were identified by amplification of the genomic sequence flanking the insertion site, high-throughput sequencing, and mapping to the human genome. Insertions in exonic regions or in the sense orientation of intronic regions are typically expected to cause gene inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carette et al., 2009</xref>). For each gene locus, we calculated an enrichment p-value by comparing the number of inactivating insertions in the pooled drug-resistant cells to the number of such insertions in mutagenized cells before selection. This enrichment p-value allows the identification of genes whose inactivation renders cells resistant to the toxic effects of the small molecule tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We performed screens with anticancer drugs including topoisomerase inhibitors (topotecan, etoposide, and doxorubicin), a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib), an antimetabolite (gemcitabine) and a platinum-based DNA crosslinking agent (oxaliplatin). As expected, we observed enrichment of inactivating insertions in genes known to play a role in the MOA of these anticancer compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For instance, doxorubicin and etoposide induce cytotoxicity by forming a ternary complex with DNA and the enzyme topoisomerase IIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pommier et al., 2010</xref>). In both screens, we detected a significant enrichment of inactivating insertions in gene <italic>TOP2A</italic>, which encodes topoisomerase IIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>). Bortezomib kills cancer cells by proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 2004</xref>) and, accordingly, we observed a significant enrichment of inactivating insertions in genes encoding proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). In addition to targets of anticancer drugs, the screens also identified transporters and genes known to metabolize the drug tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, loss-of-function screens in KBM7 cells are a powerful way to initiate MOA studies of anticancer compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Kennedy pathway mutants are resistant to OPA</title><p>We then used the KBM7 screening platform to investigate the mechanism of cytotoxicity of OPA, isolating human cells containing insertions that rendered cells resistant to OPA treatment.

There is precedent for small molecules that target the Kennedy pathway: the antihistamine and antiemetic drug meclizine directly inhibits PCYT2, reducing the average flux through the Kennedy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gohil et al., 2013</xref>). To explore the possibility that OPA exerts cytotoxicity by inhibiting or activating one of the enzymes in the Kennedy pathway, we measured the activity of the pathway after OPA treatment in the two commonly used human cell lines, HEK293T and HCT116. Cells were treated with OPA (or vehicle) and then incubated with ethanolamine [1,2-<sup>14</sup>C], the substrate of the first enzyme in the Kennedy pathway. Interestingly, when either cell line was treated with concentrations of OPA that induced mild cytotoxicity, both the average flux through the Kennedy pathway (measured by accumulation of the radiolabel into PE) and the steady state level of PE were <italic>increased</italic> compared to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In contrast, when we treated cells with meclizine we observed the expected decrease in the flux through the pathway and reduced PE content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Since the change in enzyme activity induced by OPA treatment is small, we do not believe that OPA acts directly on an enzyme in the Kennedy pathway to cause cytotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>OPA is inactivated by exogenous PE in cell culture medium</title><p>The known reactivity of OPA with primary amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Au et al., 2000</xref>) and the observation that resistance to OPA toxicity correlates with lower PE content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2c</xref>) led us to propose that OPA might directly target PE through covalent modification of its ethanolamine head group. If this hypothesis is correct, adding exogenous PE along with OPA to the growth medium of cells should result in the formation of PE-OPA covalent adducts in the medium. The majority of these adducts should not partition efficiently into cells due to limited aqueous solubility, and thereby adding exogenous PE should reduce the number of OPA molecules available to react with endogenous PE and kill cells. In agreement with this prediction, addition of a commercial preparation of PE to cells treated with a cytotoxic amount of OPA rescued cell viability, whereas addition of the phospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylserine (PS) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). PE extracts from diverse sources were all similarly able to rescue cellular viability, suggesting that small quantities of impurities in these preparations are not likely responsible for OPA inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To provide additional evidence that the difference in the effects of PE and PC on OPA toxicity derive solely from differences in the head group (and not differences in fatty acid composition or impurities), we assayed a pair of commercial lipid preparations: one that consists of an extract of PC, and an identical PC extract in which the choline head group of PC has been exchanged for ethanolamine to yield a transphosphatidylated PE extract. When tested in the OPA inactivation assays, transphosphatidylated PE rescued cell viability whereas PC did not, substantiating the claim that PE is the molecule responsible for OPA inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In addition, we observed that constituents of the head group of PE, ethanolamine and <italic>O</italic>-phosphorylethanolamine, could inactivate OPA, although much less potently than PE, and that triethanolamine (lacking a primary amine) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14601.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ophiobolin A (OPA) reacts with the ethanolamine (Etn) head group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) via a Paal-Knorr reaction.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Exogenous PE, but not phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylserine (PS), added to growth medium quenches the cytotoxicity of OPA.

Based on the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr reaction and the specific reactivity of OPA, the reaction between PE and OPA is believed to proceed through two potential mechanisms: (i) elimination of a water molecule leading to formation of an imine and subsequent rearrangement to an enamine. Cyclization of the enamine followed by dehydration yields the final pyrrole-containing adduct. (ii) Cyclization of the hemiaminal leads to formation of a dihydroxypyrrolidine. A double elimination of water and double bond shift leads to the final pyrrole-containing adduct. In studies involving the formation of pyrrole adducts from the reaction of 4-oxohexanal and a primary amine, the reaction is known to proceed through the mechanism involving cyclization of the hemiaminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amarnath et al., 1995</xref>). Under certain conditions, pyrrole adducts are known to be oxidized and the two main expected products are the lactam and hydroxylactam derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>).

To determine whether OPA induces membrane leakiness due to adduct formation, we used artificial liposomes whose PE content we could modulate. We prepared large unilamellar lipid vesicles (LUVs) composed of a variable ratio of dioleoyl-PE to dioleoyl-PC and loaded with the fluorescent probe calcein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Cleland, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). As calcein fluorescence becomes dequenched upon release from LUVs, an increase in fluorescence can be used as an indicator of liposome leakage. We observed that OPA treatment caused extensive liposome leakage, and that the extent of leakage is directly dependent on both the PE content of the liposomes and on the OPA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Importantly, we observed that liposomes composed only of PC or with very low PE content remain intact even at high OPA concentration, indicating that the leakage is likely specifically due to the formation of PE-OPA adducts.

The Kennedy pathway genes identified in the screen of OPA led to the identification of a phospholipid molecule as the cellular target of OPA. This discovery was possible due to the unbiased nature of the screen and would have been difficult to achieve using alternative methods such as affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Few studies have yet taken advantage of the recent development of novel genetic tools in human cells to identify the target of small molecules, and this is the first study to uncover a non-protein based target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nijman, 2015</xref>). Here we show that OPA forms a pyrrole-containing covalent adduct with PE in human cells. Reduction of PE levels through inactivation of the Kennedy pathway results in a reduction in OPA cytotoxicity. We also show that PE-OPA adduct formation leads to destabilization of lipid bilayers in vitro. Collectively, this study indicates that PE is the main target of OPA in human cells and leads to the hypothesis that formation of PE-OPA adducts directly causes the observed cytotoxicity of OPA through membrane destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p><p>OPA is reactive towards primary amines, but the chemical reactivity of PE alone does not explain why OPA would selectively react with PE over ethanolamine, lysine side chains of proteins, or any other abundant primary amine in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasari et al., 2015</xref>). While we cannot exclude the possibility that covalent modification of cellular proteins contributes to the observed toxicity of OPA, our experimental results show that the concentration of PE required to inactivate OPA in vitro is at least 2000-fold lower than that of ethanolamine or lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This selectivity may arise because, at the concentrations tested, ethanolamine and lysine are freely soluble in aqueous buffers whereas PE forms insoluble lipid aggregates. Considering the lipophilic nature of OPA, it is likely that OPA accumulates in the lipid aggregates and efficiently reacts with PE due to high local concentrations or to the hydrophobic environment, or both. In a comparable way, we believe that the selectivity in living cells is the result of accumulation of OPA in lipid bilayers and efficient reaction with PE, the most abundant primary amine in human lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vance and Tasseva, 2013</xref>). The observation that OPA does not react with ethanolamine in human cells, despite efficient reaction with PE, supports this claim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>).</p><p>The increase in OPA resistance conferred by inactivation of the Kennedy pathway in our haploid genetic screen strongly suggests that PE-OPA covalent adduct formation is a major determinant of OPA cytotoxicity. We surmise that the observed cytotoxicity of OPA reflects the amount of covalent PE-OPA adducts formed in cells, which, based on the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr reaction, should be dependent on the concentrations of both OPA and PE. Accordingly, we observed that a mild reduction in PE levels (16–24%) was accompanied by a mild increase in OPA resistance (IC<sub>50</sub> from 43 nM in wild-type cells to 70–85 nM in the mutants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). As the amplitude of changes in the observed cytotoxicity of OPA can be accounted for by changes in PE levels, we believe that PE represents the main target of OPA in human cells.</p><p>Several members of the ophiobolin family of fungal metabolites have been isolated and evaluated for cytotoxicity in a panel of human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Au et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasari et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the C-6 epimer of OPA (6-<italic>epi</italic>-OPA) is 40-fold less cytotoxic than OPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasari et al., 2015</xref>), although both compounds would form the same pyrrole adduct upon reaction with PE, as the stereocenter at position 6 is lost with pyrrole formation. This observation must mean that the reaction of PE with 6-<italic>epi</italic>-OPA is on the order of 40-fold slower than the reaction of PE with OPA. The ring cyclization step is the rate limiting step of the Paal-Knorr reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and this step is strongly influenced by the stereochemistry of the 1,4 diketone; rates of pyrrole formation can be up to 57-fold different between stereoisomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Amarnath et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, the 40-fold difference in potency between OPA and 6-<italic>epi</italic>-OPA can likely be attributed to differences in the rate of pyrrole adduct formation, and this observation supports our model that cytotoxicity depends on the amount of PE-OPA adduct formed.</p><p>We hypothesize that formation of PE-OPA adducts disrupts the lipid bilayer of human cells to induce cell death. As seen in the LUVs leakage experiments, OPA induces strong membrane permeabilization in model membranes and the extent of permeabilization is dependent on PE content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, this observation is consistent with our expectation that the rate of adduct formation is dependent on PE content and suggests that OPA might display higher potency against cells or tissues containing high PE contents. Also, the dependence of membrane leakiness on PE content provides a mechanistic basis for our observation that Kennedy pathway KBM7 mutants are resistant to OPA due to lower PE levels. Cytotoxicity through modification of PE has previously been reported for polygodial, a 1,4-dialdehyde antifungal compound, which has been shown to form a pyrrole-containing adduct with PE on the cell surface that is directly linked to its antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujita and Kubo, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, it has been previously shown that covalent modification of PE with isoketals alters membrane curvature because the newly formed bulky hydrophobic head group partitions to the lipid bilayer and increases lateral pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). We believe such a mechanism may contribute to the ability of PE-OPA adducts to disrupt lipid bilayers, and suspect that the extent of lipid bilayer destabilization is highest in the plasma membrane as it is the first source of PE encountered by OPA.</p><p>We were initially surprised to find that treatment of human cells with OPA led to activation of the Kennedy pathway and an increase in PE content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). However, phospholipid homeostasis in mammalian cells is not well understood, but it is generally accepted that mechanisms are in place to tightly regulate membrane lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hermansson et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study investigates the basis of ophiobolin A (OPA) cytotoxicity using a genetic screening strategy and followed up with a multi-faceted analysis to reach the surprising conclusion that OPA kills cancer cells by covalently modifying phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The haploid insertion strategy outlined here is a powerful way to screen for small molecule targets by looking for gene inactivating mutants conferring resistance and it was nicely validated with topoisomerase inhibitors. It was also impressive that the three inactivated genes uncovered in promoting OPA resistance were all part of the PE biosynthetic pathway. Based on the literature and the tendency of OPA to undergo pyrrole formation with primary amines, the authors astutely postulated that PE could be interacting directly with OPA, and this was in fact observed. The authors also found that knockdown of the PE biosynthetic enzymes recapitulated the genetic screen findings about OPA resistance and that PE added exogenously could confer OPA resistance, presumably by titrating OPA out. Overall, this is a fascinating study with a very unusual proposed mechanism of action of a cytotoxic drug. However, it is believed that more compelling evidence is needed to support the conclusion that the PE reaction with OPA is the primary mechanism of action for OPA's cell killing.</p><p>Requested revisions:</p><p>It is somewhat surprising that these modest changes in the levels of PE (16-24%) in the genetic experiments could be so important for the influencing potency of the compound in light of the model for OPA action. In addition, the dose response curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>, shows only a very modest effect on OPA IC<sub>50</sub>, and this also leads to questions about the mechanism of action of OPA. It raises the concern that there still is one or more Lys containing protein targets that are of great importance for OPA pharmacology as the authors state has been suggested before. Loss of function screens may have difficulty in revealing the major target of antiproliferative small molecules such as OPA, because inactivation of the very target is expected to recapitulate the cellular phenotype of OPA and the mutant cells would not be viable.</p><p>A significant concern relates to a paper that they cite by Dasari et al. (2015) that notes that the 6-epi isomer of OPA is 40-fold less potent than the natural OPA across a panel of cell lines. Since the pyrrole OPA adduct would be the same regardless of the starting stereoisomer of OPA (as this 6-stereocenter is lost as it becomes sp2), one would then have to argue that the rate of pyrrole formation between PE and the 6-epimer is 40-fold slower than the reaction with the natural compound. While not impossible, this large difference in reactivity seems unlikely as there would not appear to be complex recognition involved in the two small molecules coming together. Nevertheless, the PE reactivity mechanistic model should be readily tested by getting some of the 6-epimer from Dasari et al., or some other supplier. If the chemical reactivity of the 6-epimer with PE is indeed slowed by ca. 40-fold as the above analysis predicts, this would be very reassuring for the authors' model. This model could also be tested by comparing a series of other analogs from Dasari et al. (or other suppliers) and determining the correlation between cell potency and PE reactivity.</p><p>If the PE-OPA adduct is indeed responsible for the cytotoxicy of OPA, one might have expected that the addition of exogenous PE could enhance, rather than reduce, the cytotoxicity of OPA. Perhaps the PE-OPA adduct needs to be embedded in the membrane to be toxic. It would be helpful if the authors could perform preparative quantities of the PE-OPA adduct and then add this adduct exogenously to the cell culture medium to explore its potential to be toxic to cell growth.</p><p>It is possible that the PE-OPA adduct has unique fluorescence compared with the PE and OPA as isolated molecules. If so, the authors could check to see if OPA addition induces the corresponding fluorescence change that might be detected by cellular imaging. Alternatively, perhaps the authors could check to see if OPA drives leakiness in the cell membrane by allowing normally cell impenetrant colorimetric dyes to accumulate in cells rapidly after OPA administration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14601.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Requested revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>It is somewhat surprising that these modest changes in the levels of PE (16-24%) in the genetic experiments could be so important for the influencing potency of the compound in light of the model for OPA action.

We found that genetic inactivation of the Kennedy pathway in KBM7 cells leads to a reduction in total cellular PE levels and a concomitant increase in OPA resistance. We also found that OPA reacts covalently with PE in human cells, leading us to hypothesize that the observed cytotoxicity of OPA reflects the amount of covalent PE-OPA adducts formed in cells.</p><p>Although the Kennedy pathway is genetically inactivated in the mutant cells detected as OPA-resistant in our screen, these cells are not devoid of PE, as PE can be synthesized via multiple pathways and cells employ mechanisms to maintain phospholipid homeostasis. As such, these mutant cells have only a 16-24% reduction in PE levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), and any phenotype associated with this reduction is therefore likely to be mild. The modest reduction in PE levels was accompanied by a modest increase in the IC<sub>50</sub> of OPA from 43 nM in wild-type KBM7 cells to 70-85 nM in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Based on the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr reaction, we surmise that the rate of covalent adduct formation is proportional to both the concentration of OPA and that of PE in the lipid bilayer. Accordingly, a modest reduction in PE levels (less than 2-fold reduction) translates into a modest decrease in the rate of deleterious adduct formation and thus a modest increase in OPA resistance (up to 2-fold). This slight increase in resistance manifests as a quantitatively detectable increase in proliferation rate of the mutants’ cells upon OPA treatment in a sensitive, sequencing-based genetic screen output. We used these subtle changes found in the mutant cells to form a hypothesis about the identity of the direct molecular target of OPA in human cells.</p><p>The reviewers raise the concern that &quot;there still is one or more Lys containing protein targets that are of great importance for OPA pharmacology as the authors state has been suggested before&quot;. If lysine-containing protein targets were the major determinants of OPA cytotoxicity rather than PE-OPA adduct formation, a mild decrease in PE content would likely have little or no effect on the resistance to OPA. The results obtained in the haploid genetic screen and the follow-up experiments are fully and quantitatively accounted for by our model of OPA cytotoxicity. We therefore believe that PE-OPA adduct formation is the main determinant of OPA cytotoxicity. We have edited the manuscript to clarify our interpretation of the genetic experiments.</p><p><italic>A significant concern relates to a paper that they cite by Dasari et al. (2015) that notes that the 6-epi isomer of OPA is 40-fold less potent than the natural OPA across a panel of cell lines.

This model could also be tested by comparing a series of other analogs from Dasari et al. (or other suppliers) and determining the correlation between cell potency and PE reactivity.</italic></p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, Dasari et al. observe a significant difference in potency between 6-<italic>epi</italic>-OPA and OPA across a panel of human cell lines despite the fact that both compounds would form the same pyrrole adduct upon reaction with PE (Dasari et al., 2015). Given our model that cytotoxicity depends on the amounts of PE-OPA adduct formed, this observation must mean that the reaction of PE with 6-<italic>epi-</italic>OPA is on the order of 40-fold slower than the reaction of PE with OPA. The reviewers suggest that this large difference in reactivity is improbable as the initial step in the reaction (hemiaminal formation) is unlikely to be influenced by the stereochemistry of OPA at position 6.</p><p>Although we agree with this point, the difference in reactivity between the OPA epimers can readily be explained by considering the rate-limiting step of this reaction. Amarnath et al. observed that the rate limiting step in the Paal-Knorr reaction is the ring cyclization step and not hemiaminal formation (Amarnath et al., 1991). Amarnath et al. also observed that the cyclization step is indeed influenced by the stereochemistry of the 1,4 diketone, and rates of pyrrole formation can be up to 57-fold different between stereoisomers (Amarnath et al., 1991). In light of this careful documentation of the effect of stereochemistry on the rate-limiting step in the Paal-Knorr reaction, the 40-fold difference in potency between OPA and 6-<italic>epi</italic>-OPA can be attributed to a reduction in PE-OPA pyrrole adduct formation.</p><p>Lastly, 6-<italic>epi</italic>-OPA cannot be obtained from a commercial supplier, and thus we hope that this theoretical explanation will suffice to satisfy the reviewers regarding this interesting aspect of the Paal-Knorr reaction.</p><p><italic>If the PE-OPA adduct is indeed responsible for the cytotoxicy of OPA, one might have expected that the addition of exogenous PE could enhance, rather than reduce, the cytotoxicity of OPA. Perhaps the PE-OPA adduct needs to be embedded in the membrane to be toxic. It would be helpful if the authors could perform preparative quantities of the PE-OPA adduct and then add this adduct exogenously to the cell culture medium to explore its potential to be toxic to cell growth.</italic></p><p>The reviewers state that &quot;one might have expected that the addition of exogenous PE could enhance, rather than reduce, the cytotoxicity of OPA&quot;. According to our model, the addition of exogenous PE could indeed lead to an increase in cytotoxicity if it results in an increase in the amount of cytotoxic PE-OPA adducts in the cell membrane. However, this result would only be obtained in hypothetical scenarios such as: (1) exogenous PE can efficiently partition to the cell membrane when added to aqueous culture medium and the increase in lipid bilayer PE content leads to an increase in PE-OPA adduct formation; or (2) covalent PE-OPA adducts formed in the cell culture medium can partition efficiently into the lipid bilayer in a manner which retains their cytotoxic potential.</p><p>Our experiments clearly show that addition of exogenous PE to the growth medium of HEK293T cells reduces the cytotoxicity of OPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To explain this data, we surmise that OPA reacts with the exogenously added PE in the growth medium and that the large majority of these adducts do not partition into the cell membrane, thereby reducing the number of OPA molecules available to partition into the cell membrane, react with endogenous PE, and induce cell death. Supporting this assertion is the fact that the solubility of PE in aqueous solutions is very low, and thus exogenous PE forms visible insoluble aggregates when added to cell culture medium. Thus, any OPA reacting with exogenously added PE will likely remain trapped in these aggregates as the PE-OPA adducts are themselves also very hydrophobic.</p><p>We edited the manuscript to clarify our prediction of the effect of exogenous PE addition to cells treated with OPA.</p><p>The reviewers suggest that we generate &quot;preparative quantities of the PE-OPA adduct and then add this adduct exogenously to the cell culture medium to explore its potential to be toxic to cell growth&quot;. This experiment is conceptually an outstanding way of proving the role of PE-OPA adducts in the observed cytotoxicity of OPA and would provide a strong validation of our mechanism of action. However, this experiment is technically challenging as hydrophobic PE-OPA adducts need to be delivered to cells in sufficient amounts, and their final membrane orientation must mimic that of endogenously generated adducts.</p><p>We attempted the suggested adduct delivery experiment using two approaches. We first synthesized preparative amounts of PE-OPA adduct and dissolved the synthesized molecule in DMSO. We then added the synthesized adduct to HEK293T cells at final concentrations of up to 100 μM but did not observe any cytotoxicity. As mentioned earlier, we believe that this is because the PE-OPA adduct is extremely hydrophobic and its solubility in aqueous solutions is accordingly low. We believe that upon addition to cell culture medium, the adduct forms insoluble aggregates and cannot partition into the cell membrane to a sufficient degree to cause toxicity.</p><p>In order to circumvent the problem of inefficient delivery of hydrophobic molecules to animal cells, we next attempted liposomal delivery of the adduct. We incorporated pre-formed PE-OPA adduct into fusogenic liposomes using Ibidi's Fuse-it-L commercial reagent and added the prepared liposomes to HEK293T cells, but were also not able to observe significant cytotoxicity. We believe this can be explained by the difficulty in delivering sufficient quantities of adduct using this system which is typically used to deliver analytical quantities of fluorescent probes. This difficulty is likely exacerbated by the strong lipid bilayer destabilization effect of the adduct as observed in the liposome leakage assay described above – any liposomes with significant quantities of PE-OPA adduct would likely be structurally unstable, perhaps impairing or reducing fusion with the cell membrane.</p><p><italic>It is possible that the PE-OPA adduct has unique fluorescence compared with the PE and OPA as isolated molecules. If so, the authors could check to see if OPA addition induces the corresponding fluorescence change that might be detected by cellular imaging. Alternatively, perhaps the authors could check to see if OPA drives leakiness in the cell membrane by allowing normally cell impenetrant colorimetric dyes to accumulate in cells rapidly after OPA administration.</italic></p><p>Unlike PE and OPA, the PE-OPA adduct contains a pyrrole moiety that weakly absorbs in the near ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, this weak absorption lies in a spectral region that is subject to significant cellular auto-fluorescence, and therefore is not suitable for fluorescence imaging. Additionally, it is unlikely that the fluorescence of the PE-OPA adduct will be distinguishable from that of OPA adducts formed by reaction with other primary amines, and therefore this experiment would not provide further evidence supporting PE as the primary molecular target of OPA.</p><p>According to our model of the mechanism of action of OPA, the formation of PE-OPA adducts leads to adverse structural effects on the lipid bilayer and ultimately to cell death. As suggested by the reviewers, we should therefore be able to detect cell membrane leakiness induced by OPA treatment. However, these experiments must be able to distinguish between cell membrane leakiness induced directly by PE-OPA adduct formation and leakiness due to downstream effects of cell death and lysis through an unrelated mechanism of action. In addition, it was important for us to prove that leakiness depends not only on OPA concentration but also on PE levels in the lipid bilayer, as this must be true if the increase in resistance to OPA we observed in Kennedy pathway mutants is due to reduced PE levels.</p><p>To address these points, we tested if OPA induces membrane leakiness in vitro using artificial liposomes. We prepared liposomes loaded with the fluorescent dye calcein using a variable ratio of dioleoyl-PE to dioleoyl-PC. As calcein fluorescence becomes dequenched upon release from liposomes and resulting dilution, an increase in the fluorescence of the aqueous solution containing liposomes can be used as an indicator of liposome leakage. Excitingly, we observed that OPA treatment caused extensive liposome leakage, and that the leakage was directly proportional to the PE content of the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Importantly, we observed that liposomes composed only of PC or with very low PE content remain intact even at high OPA concentration, indicating that the leakage is likely specifically due to the presence of PE-OPA adducts. These results clearly show that OPA destabilizes lipid bilayers and thereby support our conclusion that formation of PE-OPA adducts is a primary mechanism of cytotoxicity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
