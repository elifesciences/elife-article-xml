This inhibition is non-reciprocal, short-range (less than 200 μm) and is based on convergence of one to two Purkinje cells onto MLIs. During learning-related eyelid movements in vivo, the activity of a subset of MLIs progressively increases as Purkinje cell activity decreases, with Purkinje cells usually leading the MLIs.

Within the cerebellar cortex, Golgi, candelabrum, basket and stellate cells have been identified as inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hull and Regehr, 2022</xref>). While Golgi cells are found in the granule cell layer and candelabrum cells are in the Purkinje cell (PC) layer, basket and stellate cells reside within the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. These molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) form inhibitory synapses with each other, as well as with PCs, the only output cells of the cerebellar cortex. Whereas specific computational roles have been proposed for Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mauk and Donegan, 1997</xref>) and candelabrum cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osorno et al., 2022</xref>), proposals regarding the functions of MLIs generally have been limited to the relatively simplistic notion that they contribute to feedforward inhibition of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim and Augustine, 2021</xref>). Moreover, the function of stellate and basket cells generally is not considered separately in theories of cerebellar cortex.</p><p>Following up on suggestions that MLIs may receive inhibitory input from PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O’Donoghue et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>), we present evidence from optogenetic mapping of local circuits and paired recordings in cerebellar slices that some MLIs in the inner third of the molecular layer, but not stellate cells in the outer molecular layer, are inhibited by feedback from PCs. Because these MLIs, in turn, inhibit other PCs, our results suggest that PCs influence each other through disinhibition of MLIs. Consistent with this disinhibitory circuit, in vivo a subset of MLIs fire strongly anti-phasically with, and usually after, PCs during eyelid conditioning. Finally, large-scale computer simulations predict that PC feedback inhibition of MLIs enhances the ability of the cerebellum to learn and to facilitate more efficient information storage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Photostimulation of PCs</title><p>We used mice that express the light-activated cation channel, ChR2, exclusively in PCs to enable selective photostimulation of PCs in vitro. These mice were obtained by crossing transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase behind a PC-specific promoter (PCP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2000</xref>) with another transgenic mouse line expressing ChR2-H134R behind a floxed stop cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madisen et al., 2012</xref>).

In these mice, light pulses generate photocurrents sufficient to evoke action potentials in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asrican et al., 2013</xref>). We examined ChR2 expression by imaging the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused to the ChR2; virtually all PCs strongly expressed ChR2 in their somata and dendrites, with no fluorescence evident in MLI somata within the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in cerebellar slices from these double transgenic mice indicated that photostimulation reliably evoked action potentials in every PC examined (20/20), but was incapable of evoking any action potentials in MLI (0/406).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic interrogation of Purkinje cell (PC) to molecular layer interneuron (MLI) circuit.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Selective expression of ChR2 in cerebellar PCs.

We started by using relatively large spots of blue light (~0.2 mm<sup>2</sup> area) to photostimulate a large number of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, top), while measuring postsynaptic responses in MLIs. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were observed only in MLIs located in the inner one-third of the molecular layer, where basket cells are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, center). IPSCs were abolished by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockers, such as bicuculline and gabazine, but were unaffected by the glutamate receptor blocker kynurenic acid, indicating that the IPSCs are monosynaptic and mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Connectivity between PCs and MLIs was observed in 16% of the 371 MLIs examined in the inner third of the molecular layer, where basket cells are located, in mice aged 3 weeks or older. No connections were detected (<italic>n</italic>=35) between PCs and MLIs located in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer, where stellate cells are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, bottom). We refer to the subset of MLIs receiving PC inputs as ‘PC-MLIs’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, middle). The somata of PC-MLI were 60±2.9 μm (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic>=59) above the PC layer and thus are not candelabrum cells, interneurons whose somata reside within the PC layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lainé and Axelrad, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osorno et al., 2022</xref>). Inhibitory feedback from PCs to PC-MLIs was also observed in the lateral cerebellum: a total of eight connections were detected among 34 recordings in the inner molecular layer of simplex, crus I, and crus II lobules. This 24% rate of connections compares favorably to the ~16% observed in 371 recordings in the vermis. Therefore, the PC-to-PC-MLI feedback circuit seems widely distributed throughout the cerebellum and may play a general role in cerebellar computation. To determine how feedback from PCs affects the activity of PC-MLI, we photostimulated PCs with brief light pulses (5 ms) while depolarizing PC-MLIs to evoke rapid action potential firing. Light-evoked synaptic input from PCs was capable of completely suppressing PC-MLI activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>We then used recordings from pairs of connected PCs and MLIs for detailed characterization of the inhibitory feedback circuit. Although recordings from connected pairs were rarely obtained (see below), seven successful experiments (six whole-cell recordings and one cell-attached recording from PCs) allowed us to directly define the functional attributes of this circuit. Single action potentials (simple spikes) evoked in presynaptic PCs induced IPSCs in postsynaptic MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). IPSC latency was brief, with a mean of 1.15±0.02 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). IPSCs were quite variable in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, red), with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.39±0.08 and peak amplitude of 56.1±20.3 pA at –50 mV (<italic>n</italic>=7). This indicates a synaptic conductance of 2.13±0.61 nS. The mean amplitude of spontaneous (presumed miniature) IPSCs was 18.0±1.3 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, blue), indicating a quantal content (ratio of amplitudes of evoked/spontaneous IPSCs) of 3.0±0.9 for evoked IPSCs. Recalculating based on IPSC integral, rather than peak amplitude, raised the estimate to 6.7; this reveals a substantial contribution of asynchronous GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song and Augustine, 2016</xref>). These unitary synaptic properties are similar to those reported for synapses formed between PCs by PC axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orduz and Llano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). However, unlike PC-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>), the PC-to-PC-MLI synapse exhibited very few failures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This is a consequence of the relatively high quantal content and large readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles (99±16 quanta; <italic>n</italic>=15; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref> below). From the ratio of quantal content and RRP size, we estimate a release probability of 0.07.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Frequency-independent depression at PC-to-PC-MLI synapses.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Synaptic transmission at a connected PC and PC-MLI pair. 100 Hz firing in the presynaptic PC (bottom) produced a sustained inhibition of the postsynaptic PC-MLI (top).

Trains of presynaptic PC activity (10–100 Hz) initially caused synaptic facilitation, which was followed by a mild depression of IPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Depression followed an exponential time course, with the rate of depression depending upon stimulus frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). Remarkably, IPSC amplitude was sustained at approximately half of its initial strength even during prolonged activity, independent of stimulus frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). As a result, the steady-state amount of synaptic transmission – measured as total IPSC charge – paradoxically increased at higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). By measuring cumulative synaptic charge during repetitive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), we determined the size of the RRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>) and the rate of mobilization of synaptic vesicles from a reserve pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). This analysis revealed that while RRP size is independent of the rate of synaptic activity, PCs sustain their transmission via an activity-dependent acceleration of synaptic vesicle mobilization from the reserve pool to the RRP. This is similar to the behavior of synapses between PCs and deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, PCs can inhibit PC-MLIs even during high-frequency activity, thereby maintaining an inverse relationship between the activities of these two neuron types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping the spatial organization of the PC-MLI circuit</title><p>The circuit between presynaptic PCs and postsynaptic MLIs was mapped by scanning small spots of laser light (405 nm, 4 ms duration, ~1 μm diameter in the focal plane) to evoke action potentials in presynaptic PCs expressing ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).

IPSCs were evoked in PC-MLI only when the light spot was positioned within the molecular and PC layers, where PCs are located. Presynaptic PC inputs to PC-MLI were most often revealed (59%) as a single cluster of pixels similar in size to the light-sensitive area of a single PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d1</xref>), occasionally (12%) as two discrete input areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d2</xref>) or a relatively large contiguous input area (29%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d3</xref>).

Mean input field area was 1.5 times larger than the mean area of PC optical footprints, suggesting that on average a PC-MLI receives inhibitory input from only one or two converging PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). This is consistent with the observed spatial organization of input maps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. The spatial organization of the PC-to-PC-MLI circuit is different from that of the MLI-to-PC circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>): presynaptic PCs were largely found within 200 µm of their postsynaptic PC-MLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) and were asymmetrically distributed, with most presynaptic inputs originating from either juxtaposed PCs or PCs located toward the apex of the lobule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). These observations are consistent with the anatomy of PC axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Synaptic inputs from PCs to PC-MLI could be detected as early as postnatal day 14 (P14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), a time when MLIs are still developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pouzat and Hestrin, 1997</xref>). However, the rate of connectivity at ages earlier than P21 (7.5%) was somewhat lower than at later ages (16%), suggesting that the circuit is established during the time that MLIs mature. After P21, the probability of detecting functional connections between PCs and PC-MLI was relatively constant up to P77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), well after MLIs have fully matured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pouzat and Hestrin, 1997</xref>). Thus, this synaptic circuit is functional into adulthood. No feedback inhibitory connections were observed between PCs and stellate cells at any time between postnatal weeks 3 and 9.</p><p>The large number of IPSCs collected during our mapping experiments enabled further characterization of synaptic transmission at the PC-to-MLI synapse. Within the PC input fields, IPSC amplitude varied substantially from pixel to pixel but this variability was not due to variations in photostimulation of presynaptic PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The CV of light-evoked IPSCs was 0.28±0.02 in 18 experiments; this is similar to the CV of IPSCs observed in our paired recordings from PCs and PC-MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and provides a second indication of highly variable transmission at the PC-to-MLI synapse. Mean IPSC amplitude, measured at a holding potential of –40 mV, was 39.1±4.0 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>; 2128 IPSCs in 18 recordings). This corresponds to a synaptic conductance of 1.15±0.12 nS, which is not significantly different from that measured in paired recordings (p=0.17, Welch’s t-test). IPSC rise time (20–80%) was relatively fast (1.69±0.13 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>), similar to IPSCs produced at PC-to-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orduz and Llano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>) but more rapid than the MLI-to-PC connection (5.6±0.5 ms time-to-peak; see Figure 5c of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Non-reciprocal connections between PCs and MLIs</title><p>Given that MLIs provide feedforward inhibition to PCs, we next asked whether circuits between PCs and MLIs are reciprocal, that is, whether MLIs innervated by a given PC also inhibit the same PC. For this purpose, we combined paired electrophysiological recordings with optogenetic mapping. Due to the abundance of PCs, we used mapping to increase the probability of detecting functional PC-MLI connections: after finding a PC-MLI and identifying the location of its presynaptic PC by scanning the photostimulating laser spot, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>, recordings were made from the somata of PCs within the area where the light spot evoked IPSCs. Among 139 paired recordings made via this strategy, synaptic inputs from PCs to MLIs were detected in seven cell pairs. This 5% success rate is an underestimate of PC-to-PC-MLI connectivity; although our optogenetic mapping identified the volume in which presynaptic PCs were located, there was still a low likelihood of sampling the one or two presynaptic PCs within the dozens of PCs within this volume. The results from one successful experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. Action potentials evoked in the PC by depolarizing current pulses elicited IPSCs in the postsynaptic PC-MLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, upper traces). However, evoking action potentials in the PC-MLI did not elicit IPSCs in the PC, indicating that this pair did not have a reciprocal connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, lower traces).

Synaptic inputs from MLIs to PCs could be detected as IPSCs evoked in PCs in response to MLI stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, lower traces, 13/54 pairs). However, in such cases, action potentials in the postsynaptic PC invariably failed to evoke reciprocal IPSCs in the MLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, upper traces). In 13 experiments where stimulation of an MLI in the inner one-third of the molecular layer evoked IPSCs in a PC, in no case did stimulation of the PC produce IPSCs in the MLI partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This includes three MLIs that were confirmed to be PC-MLIs, because they exhibited IPSCs in response to PC photostimulation. Overall, in a total of 194 paired recordings, only unidirectional connections (either PC-to-MLI or MLI-to-PC) or unconnected pairs were detected; in no case were reciprocally connected PCs and MLIs observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of reciprocal connections, due to the limited number of recordings from connected pairs, our findings of no reciprocally connected cells in 10 connected PC/PC-MLI pairs indicate it is unlikely that these connections are reciprocal. Simulations indicate that our results would almost never be obtained (probability less than 0.001) if 50% of PC/PC-MLI connections were reciprocal, a 0.05 probability of observing no reciprocal connections in 10 trials if 20% of all connections are reciprocal and a probability greater than 0.9 if 1% or less of the connections are reciprocal. In summary, our data indicate that few, if any, PC/PC-MLI connections are reciprocal; thus, PCs will influence other PCs primarily through disinhibition, while not influencing their own behavior through recurrent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><p>To describe how an action potential in a presynaptic PC influences spiking in postsynaptic PC-MLIs, we examined the temporal relationship between spikes in PCs and PC-MLIs (four cell pairs).

Shuffling the timing of PC spikes eliminated this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), indicating that the inverse correlation normally observed after a PC action potential is genuine and is not an artifact of our analysis method.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cerebellar processing suggested by circuit simulation</title><p>To determine the role of this feedback circuit in cerebellar network function and behavior, we examined the activity of PCs and MLIs during eyelid conditioning, a cerebellar-dependent form of motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halverson et al., 2015</xref>). Eyelid conditioning involves pairing of eyelid stimulation, as an unconditioned stimulus (US), with a preceding tone that serves as a conditioned stimulus (CS). During repeated pairing of the CS with the US, the eyelid gradually produces a conditioned response (CR) to the CS. This paradigm allowed us to examine the relationship between PC and PC-MLI activity during a well-characterized and cerebellum-dependent behavioral task, both in silico and in vivo.</p><p>To provide a controlled experimental platform to predict how PCs and PC-MLIs interact in vivo – in the presence and absence of feedback inhibition from PCs to PC-MLIs (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) – we used a previously established large-scale computer simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Medina and Mauk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Medina et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Medina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalmbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khilkevich et al., 2018</xref>). The details of this simulation are provided in the Methods section. A variety of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) were used for training the simulation, to yield CRs that varied widely in their timing. After training, the activity of MLIs (stellate and basket cells) was not correlated with CRs in the absence of feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b1</xref>). However, providing PC feedback inhibition to a subset of MLIs, to match the PC-to-PC-MLI connectivity observed in our slice experiments, yielded a bimodal distribution of correlations: a subpopulation of MLIs had activity that was highly correlated with eyelid CRs (mean <italic>r</italic>=0.60 ± 0.06 SEM), while the activity of other MLIs had a minimal correlation with CRs (mean <italic>r</italic>=–0.02 ± 0.01 SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b2</xref>).

Further, if feedback inhibition of PC-MLIs is indeed responsible for the inverse activity of PCs and PC-MLIs, then the simulation also predicts that (3) decreases in PC activity should precede increases in MLI activity during CRs.

This criterion identifies MLIs with a 95% or greater probability of being within the high-correlation population (red curve) of MLIs that create the high skewness of the distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b3</xref>. Most of the 71 putative PC-MLIs identified in this way (8.7% of all MLIs) came from sessions where the activity of nearby eyelid PCs was recorded simultaneously, to ensure that the PC-MLIs were nearby the eyelid PCs (within the detection range of the recording tetrodes, which is approximately 120 µm). These connectivity rates and distances are comparable to our observations in cerebellar slices, where we found that approximately 5–6% of MLIs receive PC feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) that extends over 200 μm or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

These results are consistent with prediction (2) of the simulation. In many MLIs – both putative PC-MLIs and other cells identified as MLIs – an additional increase in activity was often observed at the beginning of the CS. Examples of such responses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c2 and c3</xref>. Such responses were also observed in PCs and were not correlated with the occurrence of a CR; thus, they are sensory responses associated with detecting the sound stimulus.</p><p>The activity of putative PC-MLIs was also correlated with the kinematics of conditioned eyelid movements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> compares the mean time course of the activity of all putative PC-MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) to the position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) and velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) of eyelid CRs, sorted according to the ISI used for training. Despite the loss of temporal precision imposed by averaging, the firing rate of putative PC-MLIs corresponded well to both average eyelid position and velocity at each ISI. These high correlations are likely a result of activity driven by feedback from eyelid PCs, whose activity highly anti-correlates with both measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halverson et al., 2015</xref>). Additional analyses revealed that the activity of putative PC-MLIs closely tracked both the onset latency and amplitude of CRs for each ISI tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A weaker effect of single PC spikes in vivo, compared to the effects observed in simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) and in slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), probably arises from the much larger number of spontaneous excitatory inputs to each neuron in vivo. Differences in the timescale of the responses between in vivo and brain slice data are likely due to the lower neuronal firing rate in slices (which yields longer time intervals between PC spikes) as well as temperature differences between the two experimental systems. In summary, cross-correlation analysis from all three data sets demonstrated an inverse relationship between PC and PC-MLI activities, which is consistent with prediction (3). This correspondence strengthens the conclusions that PCs provide inhibitory feedback to PC-MLIs in vivo and that putative PC-MLIs identified in vivo are equivalent to the PC-MLIs identified in cerebellar slices.</p><p>Because of the relatively modest effects of individual PC action potentials on PC-MLI activity observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), we extended our cross-correlation analysis to the larger bouts of PC activity occurring during action potential bursts, as well as the large reductions occurring during pauses in PC spiking. These analyses were restricted to recordings done between conditioning trials, to avoid the large changes in activity that occur during CRs (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref> and below). Pauses were defined as the largest 35% of inter-spike intervals, while bursts were the smallest 35% of inter-spike intervals (50% for simulations). When spikes for a PC/PC-MLI pair were aligned to the start of a pause in PC activity, we found that these pauses clearly increased activity in putative PC-MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>; average of 11/27 PC-PC-MLI pairs detected on same tetrode). Further, bursts of PC activity decreased putative PC-MLI activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>; average of 13/27 PC-PC-MLI pairs).

All these results are consistent with prediction (3) of the simulation. Collectively, our measurements of the activity of PCs and putative PC-MLIs – and their relationship to CRs – are in line with all three predictions of the simulation. Given that the computational predictions require the presence of PC-to-PC-MLI feedback inhibition, we conclude that this feedback circuit likely operates in the cerebellum during motor learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Further insights from circuit simulations</title><p>Given the success of the computational simulation in predicting the in vivo properties of PC-MLIs, we further interrogated the simulation to understand the role of feedback inhibition in cerebellar circuit performance during conditioning.</p><p>First, we determined the origins of the temporal relationship between changes in eyelid PC activity and PC-MLI activity during conditioning. Because both PC and PC-MLI activity changes during eyelid conditioning, plasticity likely occurs at parallel fiber (PF) synapses somewhere within the circuit; these synapses are known to be plastic and potentially involved in associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisberger, 2021</xref>). To deduce where this plasticity occurs, we tested simulations with different loci of learning-induced PF plasticity. Comparisons between the predicted and observed activity of PC-MLIs and PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicated that the presence of plasticity at PF synapses onto PCs yielded changes in PC activity that preceded changes in PC-MLI activity, as observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). However, if plasticity was present only at PF synapses onto MLIs, changes in firing rates of MLIs and PCs were approximately simultaneous, with changes in MLI activity slightly preceding changes in PC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). Including plasticity at both synapses produced too many MLIs that led PCs (data not shown), in clear contradiction to the in vivo data. In summary, only simulations with plasticity exclusively at PF excitatory synaptic inputs to PCs were capable of accurately predicting our observed results. Thus, it appears that learning-related plasticity may occur at the PF-to-PC synapse, rather than PF-to-MLI synapses.</p><p>Next, we considered the behavioral consequences of the feedback circuit from PCs to PC-MLIs via additional simulations that predicted the ability of the cerebellum to learn during eyelid conditioning. In these simulations, eyelid conditioning was mimicked by presenting mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs over a wide range of ISIs. Examples of virtual eyelid responses, produced by simulations trained at an ISI of 200 ms, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a</xref>. It can be observed that while simulations with or without PC feedback learned, the simulation that included PC feedback performed better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a</xref>, right). This was true at nearly all ISIs: for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11b and c</xref> only simulations with PC feedback were able to acquire CRs at the shortest (150 and 200 ms) and longest ISIs (ISI &gt;700 ms). Even at intermediate ISIs, where simulations were able to learn without PC feedback, the presence of PC feedback improved the rate of acquisition and final asymptotic performance. This is evident from comparison of CR amplitude acquisition curves at ISI 500 ms in simulations with (black) and without (red) PC feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11b</xref>). These results indicate that PC feedback can increase the rate of learning, particularly improving performance on the temporal margins, where stimulus patterns otherwise make learning difficult.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Simulation performance with and without Purkinje cell (PC) feedback to molecular layer interneurons (MLIs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Examples of virtual conditioned responses (CRs) from the last session of training at interstimulus interval (ISI) 200 for simulations without feedback from PCs to MLIs (conditioned stimulus [CS] is shown in red) and with feedback collaterals (CS is shown in black).

Subtraction of the results from the two simulations reveals the net decrease in learning-dependent LTD of PF synapses resulting from PC feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12d</xref>). To compare this effect across all 11 ISIs, we converted different histograms, such as the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12d</xref>, into cumulative distributions of changes in synaptic weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12e</xref>); the blue line (ISI 500) is derived from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12d</xref>. For all ISIs, PC feedback is predicted to cause fewer synapses to undergo LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12e</xref>). In summary, simulations with PC feedback learned better and required less net LTD of PF synaptic efficacy, indicating a more efficient distribution of learning-induced changes in synaptic strength.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Simulation of learning-dependent plasticity with and without Purkinje cell (PC) feedback.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Net changes in the strength of the 12,000 synapses between granule cells and PCs in a simulation with PC feedback to PC-MLIs and trained at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 500ms.

Our optogenetic circuit mapping enabled the first detailed analysis of the function and spatial organization of this circuit. A large-scale simulation of the cerebellum predicted that this interconnectivity should cause PC-MLIs to exhibit several unique properties during eyelid conditioning, a cerebellum-mediated form of motor learning. In vivo recordings from MLIs during delay eyelid conditioning, a well-established cerebellum-mediated task, tested and validated the predictions of the simulation. Finally, additional simulations suggested that inhibitory feedback from PCs to PC-MLIs increases cerebellar efficiency by permitting learning with less overall net synaptic plasticity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional organization of PC-MLI circuits</title><p>It has long been known that PC collateral axons bifurcate and extend along the PC layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hámori and Szentágothai, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larramendi and Lemkey-Johnston, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan-Palay, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O’Donoghue and Bishop, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>), to inhibit other PCs and to reach into the lower molecular layer and upper granule cell layer. In rodents, PC axon targets outside of the PC layer are mainly MLIs within the molecular layer as well as Lugaro cells and granule cells in specialized regions of the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larramendi and Lemkey-Johnston, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan-Palay, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we built upon this anatomical information, and limited physiological analysis done in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloedel and Roberts, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O’Donoghue et al., 1989</xref>) or in slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>), to functionally characterize the monosynaptic connection between PCs and MLIs.</p><p>Connections between PCs and MLIs are selective: PCs apparently connect to only a fraction of MLIs within the inner one-third of the molecular layer. It remains to be determined whether the MLIs that receive PC feedback inhibition are basket cells or some other type of interneuron. Our connectivity rate is lower than a previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>); this difference may arise from our more reliable (seven times larger) sample size. Although the fraction of MLIs receiving PC input could be underestimated, due to loss of connections during slicing of the cerebellum, our observations are consistent with anatomical observations of sparse representation of PC axons within the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan-Palay, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>). Our observation of no functional connectivity between PCs and stellate cells in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer is also consistent with anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hámori and Szentágothai, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemkey-Johnston and Larramendi, 1968</xref>). These connectivity features account for the difficulty in finding connected pairs of neurons, both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>We were able to characterize the fundamental properties of the PC-to-PC-MLI circuit. Inhibitory synaptic responses evoked by PC stimulation were sufficiently strong to prevent action potential firing in postsynaptic PC-MLIs. These responses had a short onset latency and were unaffected by a glutamate receptor antagonist, consistent with a monosynaptic connection. Other noteworthy properties of IPSCs at this synapse include variable amplitudes and fast rise times. These properties generally are similar to those of IPSCs at the inhibitory synapse formed between PCs via axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orduz and Llano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>), aside from a lower rate of failures at the PC-to-PC-MLI synapse. The latter property arises from a relatively large RRP of synaptic vesicles. A remarkable activity-dependent enhancement of mobilization of reserve pool synaptic vesicles allows this synapse to sustain transmission even at the high rates of activity typical of PCs.</p><p>Our high-speed mapping visualized the spatial organization of PC inputs onto a postsynaptic PC-MLI and revealed one or two discrete areas of input within the molecular and PC layers, where PCs are located. The presence of PC-MLI receiving two discrete areas of presynaptic PC input (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d2</xref>), as well as a mean presynaptic input area 1.5 times larger than the size of the optical footprint of a single PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), indicates that on average one or two PCs converge onto a postsynaptic MLI. This is in line with the relative abundance of PCs and PC-MLIs: our measurements indicate that approximately 1/18 of all MLIs receive PC feedback, while previous estimates suggest that the number of PCs is approximately 1/10 that of MLIs. Thus, PCs are 1.8 times more abundant than PC-MLIs, which is in reasonable agreement with the 1.5-fold convergence between PCs and PC-MLI that we observed. Because PCs are the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, any cell that influences PCs will influence behavior; the comparable numbers of PCs and PC-MLIs indicates high potential for such influences. The relative abundance of PCs and PC-MLI also suggests that nearly every PC provides feedback inhibitory drive to PC-MLIs. Our observation that PC-MLIs sometimes receive two convergent PC inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d2</xref>) contrasts with a previous suggestion that only single PCs innervate MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O’Donoghue et al., 1989</xref>). PC-MLI connections were mostly located within 200 µm from postsynaptic PC-MLI somata, consistent with the reported sagittal extent of PC axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O’Donoghue and Bishop, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). We also found that a majority of presynaptic PCs were located on either the apical or juxtaposed side relative to postsynaptic MLIs, verifying anatomical observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite using two experimental strategies that optimized detection of either PC-to-MLI or MLI-to-PC connectivity, in no case were reciprocally connected pairs of PCs and MLIs observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Although it was previously assumed that PC-to-PC-MLI circuits are non-reciprocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O’Donoghue et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guo et al., 2016</xref>), our results provide the initial experimental test of this important point. Such an arrangement allows feedback inhibition of PC-MLIs by PCs to disinhibit neighboring PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), which may help to synchronize PC activity in the sagittal plane. It will also serve to prevent network oscillations, which are often the outcome of reciprocal inhibitory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Satterlie, 1985</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>In vivo activity of MLIs</title><p>This interconnectivity between PCs and MLIs gave rise to specific and testable predictions about the activity of PC-MLIs in vivo. MLIs that receive input from PCs should fire inversely with PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) and, like PCs, their activity should correlate on a trial-by-trial basis with cerebellar-mediated behavioral responses. We tested these predictions using eyelid conditioning because: (1) the role of the cerebellum in this task is well established; (2) the activity of eyelid PCs is well characterized and appears to control the timing and amplitude of the behavioral CRs; and (3) computer simulations of the cerebellum allowed us to explore the plausibility of alternative explanations for why MLI activity correlates, on a trial-by-trial basis, with PC activity and behavioral responses.</p><p>Recordings from MLIs during conditioned eyelid responses supported these predictions. A small fraction of MLIs showed unusually high trial-by-trial correlations with the eyelid responses. Computer simulations predicted such high correlations only when PC-to-PC-MLI connections were included, even when these simulations were constructed to exaggerate contributions from other sources. Simultaneous recordings showed that changes in eyelid PC activity tended to precede, on a trial-by-trial basis, that of putative PC-MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9a–c</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Cross-correlation analysis revealed similar inverse activity correlations between PCs and PC-MLIs across all three platforms we examined: cerebellar slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), in vivo recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), and computational modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Finally, we observed that computer simulations trained with eyelid conditioning procedures learned better when PC-to-MLI connections were included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), despite these connections yielding less net synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Even though previous versions of our simulation that did not include PC-to-MLI feedback could exhibit learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Medina and Mauk, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2013</xref>), simulations that included PC-MLI connections performed better, particularly in difficult learning conditions.</p><p>These results suggest that in networks where PCs inhibit MLIs, each PC acts to make other PCs fire more like itself through disinhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). In this way, PC-MLIs can exert strong influence over cerebellar processing and learning despite being a small fraction of MLIs. Because PC-MLIs are both inhibited by PCs and inhibit other PCs, their connectivity confers upon them particularly strong influence over PC activity and thence over the output of the cerebellar cortex. We observed inverse activity between PCs and PC-MLIs during instances of large increases or decreases in PC activity, both during large pauses in PC activity controlling expression of CRs and during the largest changes in PC activity during the inter-trial interval (pause/burst-triggered averages). As a consequence, PC feedback to PC-MLIs could serve to selectively communicate large changes in PC activity within a parasagittal strip through PC-MLIs.</p><p>Inhibitory neurons are ubiquitous throughout the brain and are often connected to each other by inhibitory synapses. Therefore, our results suggest a computational principle: activation that involves disinhibition – as occurs between PCs and PC-MLIs – could synchronize the activity of inhibitory neurons. Here, we use ‘synchrony’ as a broad term that includes PC pause synchronization. Pause synchrony can be exerted as diverse forms (pause beginning, pause ending, pause overlapping synchrony) for several milliseconds, which results in a variety of forms of modulation of neuronal activity and may lead to a broad range of behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sudhakar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). A transient increase in PC synchrony recently reported to occur during saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2022</xref>) also occurs over a timescale that is compatible with our observations of PC feedback and feedforward inhibition.</p><p>One apparent consequence of disinhibition-based synchronization of learning-related activity in PCs suggested by our simulations is to require a smaller net change in excitatory synaptic input for PCs to decrease their activity to the level required to produce a well-timed CR in response to the CS. Such economy of plasticity could be greatly beneficial for faster learning, better learning at difficult ISIs, and increased capacity to store learned responses. While it is well established that plasticity occurs at PF synapses between GCs and PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisberger, 2021</xref>) (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), such plasticity cannot be directly proven based on measurements of learning-related changes in PC activity. For example, these changes could instead result from plasticity at synapses onto MLIs (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). However, such plasticity has only been inferred from learning-related changes in MLI activity and from MLI receptive field expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jörntell et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, previous evidence of learning-dependent changes in MLI activity during eyelid conditioning was also interpreted to result from plasticity at MLI synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>). Our results substantially limit such inferences by showing that learning-dependent changes in MLI activity could instead come from interactions between PCs and PC-MLIs. While our results do not completely exclude the possibility of learning-related changes at PF synapses innervating MLIs, they do demonstrate that learning-related changes in the activity of MLIs (or PCs) do not necessarily indicate changes in the strength of synapses onto MLIs (or PCs). Further work will be required to fully sort out the contributions of MLI synaptic plasticity to learning. Independent of detailed mechanism, we nonetheless conclude that feedback inhibition from PCs to PC-MLIs contributes to more efficient cerebellar-mediated motor learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pcp2-cre mice;

To perform high-speed circuit mapping, a laser-scanning microscope (FV1000MPE; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with 25×, NA 1.05 (Olympus XLPlan N) water-immersion objective lens was used to create small spots of laser light to photostimulate ChR2-expressing PCs. A 510×510 µm<sup>2</sup> area of the slice was scanned with a 405 nm laser spot (4 ms duration) in a 32×32 array of pixels, yielding a scanning resolution of 16 µm.

The same microscope was used for confocal imaging of neurons filled with Alexa 594.</p><p>In the course of our experiments, we used approximately 140 Pcp2-Cre Mpin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2000</xref>). In four of these mice (3%), we saw expression of ChR2 in MLI (and in other cells beyond PCs), readily evident as measurable photocurrents in response to light stimulation, consistent with a previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). These mice were discarded and were not included in our analyses. Even in these four mice, the laser intensity required to evoke action potentials in MLIs non-specifically expressing ChR2 was greater than 6 µW; because we used a laser intensity of 3 µW in our mapping experiments, there would have been no possibility of evoking action potentials in MLI. Among the remaining 136 mice that we did use for our experiments, we recorded from more than 400 MLI and never detected photocurrents. Thus, there was no ChR2 expression in MLIs under our experimental conditions. We also obtained similar results in another PCP2-cre Jdhu line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>), further indicating that our optical circuit mapping precisely detected the connectivity between PCs and PC-MLIs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Optogenetic mapping data were analyzed with custom software written in MATLAB by P Namburi as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Spatial maps of the light sensitivity of ChR2-expressing PCs (optical footprints) were created by correlating the location of the photostimulation spot with action potentials evoked between 0 and 14 ms after the start of a light pulse (4 ms duration). Due to the relatively high rate of spontaneous activity of PCs, typically two or three maps were averaged to reduce the influence of this background activity: only locations where action potentials were consistently evoked were included within optical footprints.</p><p>To generate synaptic input maps, the location of the light spot was correlated with the resulting IPSCs in MLIs. The minimum threshold amplitude for detecting IPSCs was 15 pA. The relatively high rate of spontaneous IPSCs created background noise; this was reduced by averaging together two to three input maps, with pixels having an IPSC detection probability of 0.5 or greater considered to arise from photostimulation of presynaptic PCs, rather than spontaneous activity. The area of the input field was measured by summing all pixels showing responses meeting these criteria. Single-pixel areas within input maps also result from spontaneous PC activity and also were excluded from analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). The peak amplitude and latency of IPSCs were determined from the maximum IPSC measured between 4 and 24 ms after the start of the light pulse. Onset times were estimated as the zero-crossing time of a line joining values measured from 20% to 80% of the IPSC peak.

Treatment of rabbits and surgical procedures were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and an institutionally approved animal welfare protocol. All rabbits were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Surgery</title><p>One week before the start of recording, rabbits were removed from their home cage and anesthetized with a cocktail of acepromazine (1.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (45 mg/kg). After onset of anesthesia, animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and maintained on isoflurane (1–2% mixed in oxygen) for the remainder of the surgery. Under sterile conditions the skull was exposed with a midline incision (~5 cm), and four holes were drilled for screws that anchored the head bolt in place. The animal’s head was then positioned with lambda 1.5 mm ventral to bregma and a craniotomy was drilled out at 5.9 mm posterior and 6.0 mm lateral to lambda. The skull surface was marked and skull fragments were carefully removed from the craniotomy along with the dura matter under visual guidance. A custom-made hyperdrive array (12 or 16 tetrodes, 2 references) fitted with an electronic interface board (EIB-54 or EIB36-16TT, Neuralynx) was implanted in the left anterior lobe of the cerebellar cortex at 17.8 mm ventral to lambda. Final ventral placement of tetrodes during surgery was between 1 and 2 mm above the target coordinate to allow advancement of the tetrodes to the target. Hyperdrives were positioned at a 40° angle caudal to vertical to avoid the cerebellar tentorium. This region of the cerebellum has been shown to be involved in acquisition and expression of well-timed conditioned eyelid responses in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalmbach et al., 2011</xref>). The bundle cannula of the hyperdrive was lowered to the surface of the brain and the craniotomy was sealed with low viscosity silicon (Kwik-Sil; World Precision Instruments). A screw attached to an insulated silver grounding wire (0.003” bare, 0.0055” coated, A-M Systems) was then screwed into the skull. The silver wire was also attached to the ground channel of the EIB with a gold pin. The head bolt, screws, and hyperdrive were secured with dental acrylic (Fastray Pink; The Harry J Bosworth Company), and the skin was sutured where the skull and muscle was exposed. Finally, two stainless steel stimulating electrodes were implanted subdermally caudal and rostral to the left eye. Rabbits were given analgesics and antibiotics for 2 days after surgery and monitored until fully recovered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Tetrode recording and unit isolation</title><p>Each independently movable tetrode was composed of four nichrome wires (12 µm diameter; Kanthal Palm Coast), twisted and partially melted together to form a tetrode. Individual wires of each tetrode were connected to the electronic interface board (EIB) with gold pins, all four wires of the reference tetrodes were connected to a single reference channel of the EIB. Each tetrode was gold plated to reduce its final impedance to 0.5-1.5 MΩ measured at 1 kHz (impedance tester IMP-1; Bak Electronics). Tetrodes targeting cerebellar cortex were placed over the left anterior lobe and advanced to within 2.0 mm of the target during surgery using stereotaxic guidance. Tetrodes were then lowered in 40–80 µm increments during turning sessions (~1 hr) until at least one stable single unit was identified; there were often multiple units on a single tetrode. After turning sessions, tetrodes were allowed to stabilize for at least 24 hr and units were checked again before recording and behavioral training commenced. Putative PCs were initially identified by their higher baseline firing rate relative to cerebellar cortical interneurons and later confirmed by identifying complex spikes during cluster cutting. PCs with complex spikes evoked by eyelid stimulation were operationally defined as eyelid PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halverson et al., 2015</xref>). MLI single units were often recorded simultaneously on the same or different tetrodes during recordings from PCs. Recordings were done once a single unit was identified and stable without knowledge of the origin of its climbing fiber input for PCs or identity of MLI type. Tetrodes in cerebellar cortex targeted the region containing PCs receiving evoked complex spikes from eyelid stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13a</xref>). The use of tetrodes allowed for simultaneous recording of multiple single units, including MLIs, during conditioning experiments. All PCs included in the analysis had confirmed spontaneous complex spikes and all single units were held throughout the entire session. Any recording that was lost during a recording session was not included in the analysis.</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Single-unit recordings in cerebellum and eyelid conditioning in the rabbit.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sagittal section of the cerebellum showing tetrode tracks and the final location (red points) of tetrodes that recorded eyelid molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) and eyelid Purkinje cells (PCs).

Signals that exceeded a channel amplitude threshold were digitized and stored at 32 kHz (Cheetah system; Neuralynx). Custom interactive cluster cutting programs were used to manually isolate and identify single units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13b</xref>). Waveform characteristics were plotted as a two-dimensional scatter plot of one wire of the tetrode versus another in terms of energy, peak, and valley measures. The energy measure represents the square root of the sum of the squared points for the entire waveform. The peak measure is the maximum height (positive amplitude) of the waveform. The valley measure is the maximum depth (negative amplitude) of the waveform. When possible, initial identification of a single unit was made using the peak as channel thresholds were set during recordings with that feature of the waveform. For recordings in cerebellar cortex a late peak measure, defined as the maximum peak during the last five points of the 32 points that make up each waveform, was also used to identify the later peak component of the complex spikes from the earlier peak of the simple spikes. From these cluster cutting analyses, a single PC recording would then yield two clusters, one containing simple spikes cut using peak, valley, and energy, and the second containing the complex spikes cut using the late peak parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halverson et al., 2015</xref>). Following cluster cutting, all subsequent data analysis was performed using custom-written scripts in MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Conditioning procedure</title><p>Conditioning experiments and recordings were done in custom training chambers (89 × 64 × 49 cm<sup>3</sup>). Rabbits were placed in a plastic restrainer and the ears were stretched over a foam pad and taped down to limit head movement. An adjustable infrared emitter/detector was secured in place with the head bolt and aligned to the middle of the left eye. The infrared emitter/detector measured eyelid position by converting to a voltage signal the amount of emitted infrared light reflected back to the detector, which increased as the eyelid closes. The signal was amplified to yield a signal that was linearly related to upper eyelid position (±0.1 mm). The eyelid position detector was then calibrated before each training session by delivering a test US to elicit maximum eyelid closure (6.0 mm). The corresponding voltage deflection (~6 V) was then divided by 6 mm to obtain a mm/V calibration. Each training chamber was also equipped with a speaker connected to a stereo equalizer and receiver which were connected to a computer that generated the tone CS. The CS used during training was either a 1 or 9.5 kHz sinusoidal tone (85 dB), which ramped at onset and offset with a 5 ms time constant to avoid audible clicks from the speaker. To deliver the US, leads from a stimulus isolator (Model #2100, A-M Systems) were attached to electrodes caudal and rostral to the eye. The US was eyelid stimulation, which consisted of trains of 1 ms current pulses delivered at 100 Hz for 50 ms. The intensity was adjusted for each animal to be just above threshold to elicit a full eyelid closure (between 0.8 and 1.5 mA, depending on the condition of the implanted wires).</p><p>Stimulus presentation was controlled by custom software operated on a Windows XP-based computer. To permit temporal alignment of neural and behavioral responses, digital timing pulses were generated by the computer controlling stimuli and measuring behavior and were sent to the digital input port on the Digital Lynx acquisition system (Neuralynx). During initial paired delay conditioning the tone CS was 550 ms which co-terminated with the 50 ms eyelid stimulation US which produced an ISI of 500 ms. All rabbits were initially trained and extinguished with delay conditioning at ISI 500. Further conditioning sessions involved either a 1 or 9.5 kHz tone at ISIs of 250, 700, or 750 ending with the same 50 ms eyelid stimulation US. Each training session consisted of 12 nine-trial blocks (108 trials) with each block starting with a CS alone trial followed by eight paired CS-US trials. The mean intertrial interval was 30 s with a range of 20–40 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Eyelid position analysis</title><p>For each trial, 2500 ms of eyelid position (200 ms pre-CS, 2300 ms post CS) were collected at 1 kHz and at 12 bit resolution. Data were stored to a computer disk for subsequent off-line analysis. Eyelid position data was passed through a low-pass filter. Response measures calculated for each trial included CR amplitude, latency to CR criterion, and latency to CR onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13c</xref>). CR amplitude was defined as the value of eyelid position from the baseline at the time of US onset. Latency to CR criterion was defined as the time point at which the CR reached the 0.3 mm criterion to be designated as a CR. Latency to CR onset was determined using a custom-written two-step algorithm. The first step was designed to detect the initial deflection away from the pre-CS baseline, while the second step used linear interpolation to determine the exact time of CR onset. For further analyses eyelid trajectories were truncated at US onset to exclude non-cerebellar influence on the eyelid movement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Single-unit recording analysis</title><p>Instantaneous firing rate of each single-unit recording was estimated on every trial using a one-sided Gaussian kernel with a 25 ms standard deviation window. We chose a one-sided Gaussian to prevent neural responses related to the US from contaminating unit activity during the CS. PCs firing rate was normalized by the value of the baseline firing rate during 1500 ms of pre-CS activity. Each MLI firing rate was normalized, however, to the maximum during the CS of the average firing rate through the session. Most putative PC-MLI had a similar baseline firing rates, but showed variable CR-related increases in activity, ranging from twofold increases to eight- to tenfold increases over baseline firing rates. Under these conditions, calculating the simple mean of all PC-MLI activity or normalizing it to the baseline firing rate would yield overrepresentation of PC-MLIs with the highest CR-related increases in activity. To avoid such bias, we normalized PC-MLI responses to the maximum mean firing rate during the CS.</p><p>For each MLI single unit, cross-correlations between firing rate and behavioral responses were calculated on every trial when the animal produced a CR. For every trial, starting from 150 ms before CS onset and through US onset, we calculated cross-correlations between the instantaneous firing rate profile and the time profile of the CR (eyelid position). Then, cross-correlation values were averaged through CR trials to produce an average single-trial correlation with behavior for a given MLI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For comparison of activity of simultaneously recorded eyelid PCs and MLIs, cross-correlations were calculated between firing rates then averaged through the session (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In all cases, mean values of arguments were subtracted before calculating the correlation value.</p><p>To address the temporal relationship between the activity of PCs and PC-MLIs, we developed the following analysis; this used only sessions with simultaneously recorded eyelid PCs and PC-MLIs. First, since both PC and MLI activity is precisely temporally connected with behavior, we calculated average firing rates, aligning each trial to the time of CR. This procedure reduced the influence of CS-related changes in activity on the results, phasic responses to the CS for example. Depending on ISI, we used either 100 ms (ISI 250) or 150 ms (ISIs 500, 700, and 750) after CR onset time. Trials with CR onsets occurring earlier that these values before the US were excluded from the analysis, as they would have contaminated the results with US-related responses. Second, for both PCs and MLIs we calculated the fraction of the full decrease or increase respectively that happened prior to CR onset. A value of 0 with this analysis indicates that there was no change in that cell’s response prior to CR onset, while a value of 1 indicates that the maximum change in firing happened prior to CR onset. Due to this measure being dimensionless it provides the same type of normalization for both cell types, thus, we used it to find whether PCs or MLIs typically change their activity first before CR onset.</p><p>For spike-triggered cross-correlogram analysis we aligned spike times of unit 1 within a ±window onto the spike times of unit 2 (1 ms bins, ±30 ms). The process was repeated for all spikes of unit 2 during 10 s before each trial onset, to produce a spike count of unit 1 as a function of time. The significance of modulation in cross-correlograms was assessed by performing the same analyses on shuffled spike times, making unit 1 and unit 2 independent, and computing the mean and standard deviation of cross-correlogram spike count of shuffled data. Normalized spike count, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, was computed by dividing spike count of unit 1 by the mean of the shuffled data. Z-scores were then computed to identify significantly modulated pairs of PCs and MLIs. Significantly modulated pair was defined as having at least 2 time bins, excluding <italic>t</italic>=0 bin, reaching above 95% significance thresholds (<italic>Z</italic> = ±3.34, corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction). The procedure of the pause/burst-triggered cross-correlogram analysis was similar to the spike triggered, except data was aligned only to the largest (or the smallest) 35% (50% for simulation) of PC inter-spike intervals, which were operationally defined as pauses and bursts of PCs activity, respectively. Significantly modulated pairs were defined as having by at least 2 significant bins more after <italic>t</italic>=0 compared to before <italic>t</italic>=0 epoch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Grouping</title><p>To further investigate how MLIs correspond to the onset and amplitude of conditioned eyelid responses, data from each ISI were divided into equal subgroups of trials by CR onset in relation to CS onset or by CR amplitude. Single-unit data were divided with respect to CR onset and amplitude in order to further differentiate unit activity during CRs with different onsets and amplitudes due to the differing amount of variability observed in each response measure. For each ISI, the data for each subgroup was divided equally so the same percentage of trials exists within each CR onset range or amplitude range. A few exceptions to dividing the data within each ISI equally were unavoidable and mostly involved the percentage of data in the group representing the non-CR trials within each ISI. Dividing the data with respect to CR onset involved aligning each trial by CS onset and sorting the behavioral data into equal groups with respect to the CR onset time. Subgroup eyelid CRs and MLI data was then averaged within each training paradigm along with non-CR trials and overlaid to investigate how MLI activity relates to differently timed CRs. Dividing the data with respect to CR amplitude involved aligning each trial by CS onset and sorting the behavioral data into equal subgroups with respect to CR amplitude above pre-CS baseline. Subgroup eyelid CRs and single-unit data were then averaged and overlaid to investigate how MLI activity relates to CRs with different amplitudes. The absence of overlap in 95% confidence intervals between groups of average single-unit activity indicated a significant difference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>Histology</title><p>After the conclusion of experiments, final tetrode placement was determined by making small marking lesions by passing 10 µA of anodal DC current for 10 s through tetrodes which yielded data.

Here, we will briefly summarize the simulation. As an approximation to the ratio of cell types within the cerebellum, the simulation implemented the following neuronal elements: 600 mossy fibers, 12,000 granule cells, 900 Golgi cells, 24 PCs, 8 deep cerebellar nuclei cells and 4 climbing fibers. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14a</xref>). Further, connections between PCs and MLIs were simulated via 96 basket cells (including 9 designated as PC-MLIs) and 240 stellate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14b</xref>). These neurons were interconnected to emulate a parasagittal stripe, where all PCs receive input from climbing fibers of the same type – that is, those activated by an eyelid US and that control eyelid responses with their output. Each neuron was represented as a conductance-based calculation of membrane potential, with spikes determined by thresholds that varied according to recent spiking activity to implement the net effects of active conductances. Using 1 ms time steps, the change in membrane potential was calculated according to synaptic and leak conductances and to membrane capacitance. Spikes were initiated when membrane potential exceeded threshold. Threshold increased for each spike and returned exponentially to the baseline value. All synaptic conductances were based on time constants derived from in vitro studies; the threshold properties of each representation was tuned to produce behavior that matched the in vivo characteristics of the target cell type.</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of connectivity in the cerebellar simulation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Indicates two inputs to the cerebellum -- mossy and climbing fibers -- and a schematic representation of the connectivity of four cerebellar neuron types.

For each type of connection an eligibility span was specified to represent the region of the array that the presynaptic neuron could potentially make contact with a postsynaptic target. These spans are based on published accounts of the spatial relationships of connections within the cerebellum. For example, since the axons of granule cells run transversely through the cerebellar cortex, the contact area for granule cells was a narrow rectangle. While this area constrained the range over which cells could make connections, the connections were determined randomly in a way that produced the known divergence and convergence ratios (e.g. each granule cell could only receive four mossy fiber inputs).</p><p>Separate rules for plasticity were implemented at two types of synapses within the simulation: (1) the granule cell-to-PC synapses and (2) the mossy fiber-to-DCN synapses. A granule cell-to-PC synapse underwent LTD or LTP every time it fired a threshold burst of spikes, LTD occurred when this burst fell within a window between 300 and 100 ms prior to a climbing fiber input to the PC, otherwise LTP occurred. Mossy fiber-to-DCN synapses active within a time window of an abrupt pause in PC activity underwent LTD whereas those active during strong Purkinje activity underwent LTP.</p><p>Eyelid conditioning was simulated by presenting to the simulation mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs based on empirical recordings during eyelid conditioning. Each mossy fiber was assigned a background firing rate between 1 and 40 Hz. To mimic activation of mossy fibers as a CS, a randomly selected 3% of the mossy fibers were designated phasic CS mossy fibers and were active for a brief 100 ms burst at CS onset. Another randomly selected 3% were designated tonic CS mossy fibers and were activate at a rate between 80 and 100 Hz throughout the duration of the CS. All mossy fiber activity was stochastic with the target firing rate for any given time used to determine the probability of activating an excitatory conductance in ways that made the actual activity noisy. The activation of an excitatory conductance for the four climbing fibers served to mimic the presentation of the US. The averaged and smoothed activity of the eight deep nucleus neurons was used to represent the output of the simulation and the predicted ‘eyelid response’ of the simulation. These simulations also included excitatory recurrent collaterals from the deep cerebellar nuclei, which deliver to the cerebellar cortex – as mossy fiber input – a copy of output that can be used for sequence learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khilkevich et al., 2018</xref>). These collaterals were included in the same proportion as mossy fibers representing the CS: 5.2% of all mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Houck and Person, 2015</xref>). To calculate the distribution of cross-correlations between PCs-basket cells activity, we repeated 1000 random draws of the same number of PC-BC pairs from the simulation, as we have total (64) in experimental data for ISIs 500, 700, and 750. These randomly drawn pairs were used to calculate cross-correlation values between PCs and basket cells average firing rates in the same fashion as with real data. For statistical comparison between correlation distributions of real data and simulations, we drew 1000 times from the simulation the same amount of PC-PC-MLI pairs as in real data and made a comparison using either paired Student’s t-test or two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for each draw.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mouse procedures were conducted according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of the Biopolis Biological Resource Center (AUP 120707) and the Nanyang Technological University (AUP 18095).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christian Hansel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Can the authors make the manuscript more concise, in particular, to better explain the functional role of PC-MLI interactions?</p><p>2. It would be helpful to see more comparisons between the experiments and simulation outcomes. Some have been suggested in the detailed comments.</p><p>3. The paired recordings are few in number. Can the authors specifically discuss the caveats from this?</p><p>4. Can the authors better substantiate the temporal order of PC and PC-MLI firing during CRs?</p><p>5. The methods section lacks details, even if parts have been published, there should be a summary. Some points are mentioned by the reviewers. Additionally, can the authors provide a schematic of the simulation?</p><p>6. It is journal policy to provide the entire simulation source code and configuration files on an open-source public platform, such as ModelDB, GitHub, or OpenSourceBrain. This should be done at submission time so that the reviewers can see it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Given the variability in IPSC amplitudes, how variable are the maps (Figure 3) from trial to trial? How were presynaptic PC somata located (Figure 3f)? If somata could be located, was the estimate of 1-2 PCs impinging on one MLI tested via somatic stimulation?</p><p>Figure 1c, bottom, and Figure 2c: Are the averages shown from different trials in the same cell or in different cells?</p><p>Figure 2a,b: Show representative traces for different frequencies of stimulation.</p><p>Figure 2 title: Can this be called 'Frequency-independent depression' when the extent of depression is maintained by frequency-dependent mobilization?</p><p>Figure 2e: Need a statistical test for a slope of 0.</p><p>Page 9: '…but this variability was not due to variations in photostimulation of presynaptic PCs' – This needs to be substantiated with AP probability data from light-stimulated PCs.</p><p>Page 11: Non-reciprocal connections- how many PC somata were located within the light spot that evoked IPSCs? The paired recordings are technically very challenging, yet, a sample size of 6 is too small to conclude that reciprocal connections do not exist, especially since PC-MLIs are also a small fraction.</p><p>Figure 4e: Was this analysis done on evoked or spontaneous spikes in PCs?</p><p>Figure 5b: What are the light grey and black bars?</p><p>Figure 5g and S3: The dip in MLI firing is symmetrical at about 0. This is not the case for the simulation.</p><p>Figure 5i,h: Are the curves showing averages of all the PC-MLIs recorded? If yes, show the error as well.</p><p>Figure 6: Wouldn't these results be expected given that PC-MLIs are identified based on a strong correlation to CR kinematics?</p><p>Figure 7: all data in this figure are representative. Need group data with appropriate statistics.</p><p>Page 23: &quot;These comparisons indicate that the anti-correlated activity of eyelid PCs and putative PC-MLI arises from inhibitory feedback from PCs to PC-MLI.&quot;</p><p>This is a strong statement. Data in Supp. Figure 4 are consistent with this interpretation but they do not indicate it.</p><p>Page 23: &quot;For trials with CRs, PCs reached 50% of their maximum response before PC-MLIs did&quot; – Why is this indicative of earlier PC response? Responses seem to start at about the same time, with similar slopes, but MLIs show a bigger modulation than PCs. Consequently, 50% max response occurs later in MLIs compared to PCs.</p><p>Figure 9: How does the presence of PC to MLI synapses lead to lesser overall plasticity between PFs and PCs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In the recordings from connected PC-MLI pairs, some parameters are pulled from very low numbers of recordings (n&lt;10). For example, conclusions discussed on p. 5 and illustrated in Figure 1d (and following panels) are based on 7 recordings. It is understandable that it is difficult to find connected pairs, yet as a result, the statistical power is low. This should at least be discussed as a caveat.</p><p>2) Figure 5: can the computer simulation predict how many PC-modulated MLIs need to be involved to enable optimal functioning of the feedback circuit (e.g. for one target PC)?</p><p>3) Figure 5b3: how is the Gaussian distribution peaking at an x-axis value of 0.5 determined? It seems that there is a separate, distinct peak at about 0.3.</p><p>4) Figure 7: This is a very interesting figure that shows that the onset of the PC pause occurs before the peak of MLI activity. If we assume that MLI firing contributes to prolonging the pause, what then mediates the early pause component? Is that PF-PC LTD? Along those lines, is there a necessity/involvement of LTP?</p><p>5) On p. 31, last paragraph, the authors state that '…..suggested by our simulations is to require a smaller net change in excitatory synaptic input for PCs to decrease their activity to the level required to produce a well-timed CR during the CS'. This observation resonates well with the recent finding that under realistic [ca<sup>2+</sup>]o and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]o conditions (1.2mM/1mM instead of the more classically used, but incorrect 2mM/2mM) plasticity conditions are less permissive for LTD (Titley et al., J. Physiol. 597, 2019). If correct, those findings suggest that there are plenty of activity conditions under which LTP is induced, but LTD requires a narrow range of specific temporal activity signatures. In light of this, the findings from the computer simulation are particularly meaningful. The authors might want to add this aspect to their discussion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Feedback Inhibition Underlies New Computational Functions of Cerebellar Interneurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The reviewers agree that the revision has been done well and most key aspects have been addressed.</p><p>2. There are a few small changes that the reviewers suggest to improve clarity and improve the discussion.</p><p>3. The provided GitHub link provides a source dump, which is good, but as presented does not make it easy for a reader to replicate or understand the analysis or figures. It needs documentation. Can the authors provide a systematic README which explains how a user may use their code to replicate their results? Ideally this should provide scripts and how they are invoked to replicate the relevant figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised version is a delight to read. Though longer than the original submission, the authors have done a fantastic job in interconnecting the various elements (slice physiology, in vivo physiology and computational simulations) and motivating one with the other. This manuscript is a rigorous and exciting dissection of the PC to PC-MLI pathway and its role in motor learning. This manuscript will be an important addition to the cerebellar circuits literature. The authors have addressed most of my comments to my complete satisfaction.</p><p>A few issues remain and once addressed, these can be checked at the editorial level for faster acceptance:</p><p>1. Line 326 – &quot;…timing of CRs (Figure 5b3)&quot; – but Figure 5b shows correlations with eyelid position and not with CR timing?</p><p>2. Figure 8a and corresponding results text – line 379 – the very small suppression window in vivo during conditioning is at odds with the other results (slice, simulation, in vivo intertrial intervals). Is this window in 8a wider than the duration of the merged signal at time 0?</p><p>3. Lines 401-406: This part is a little confusing as the authors state that the intertrial intervals were analyzed to avoid large changes in activity during conditioning. Then they also state that large changes in activity during pauses and bursts show the suppression. So why wouldn't that be seen during conditioning as well? Are pauses and bursts seen during the intertrial interval similar to those during the conditioning?</p><p>4. I couldn't locate the n for the number of PC-PC-MLI pairs analysed.</p><p>5. Figure colors: Perhaps indicate the CS window with a different color since the grey masks the grey of SEM in some cases (Figure 9-Figure suppl. 1 is one example). Also, in Figure 10, it is difficult to discern the dark blue and black. Red and green are not color-blind friendly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have only partially addressed my prior concerns and referred to potential future work when at least some discussion of these points would have been appropriate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77603.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Can the authors make the manuscript more concise, in particular, to better explain the functional role of PC-MLI interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that parts of the previous manuscript were cumbersome. In response, we have heavily edited the sections describing the computational modelling and in vivo recording experiments. We are confident that our efforts have improved the clarity of the text and now do a much better job of emphasizing the key points of our study. Hopefully all readers will now find it easy to comprehend the role of feedback inhibition from PCs to PC-MLIs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It would be helpful to see more comparisons between the experiments and simulation outcomes. Some have been suggested in the detailed comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Results section to make more comparisons between the model and the in vivo recording data and to clarify the relationship between these two types of analysis. In particular, we list several predictions that emerge from the simulation (p. 11, para. 2) and describe in vivo recording experiments that directly test (and confirm) these predictions (pp. 11-17). This new approach, entirely motivated by the reviewers’ comments, definitely improves the logical flow of the paper and strengthens our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The paired recordings are few in number. Can the authors specifically discuss the caveats from this?</p></disp-quote><p>We must begin by clarifying that we obtained a total of 193 paired recordings; this is by no means a small number! However, despite investing more than 2 years in this experiment, out of these 193 recordings only 10 demonstrated synaptic coupling between PCs and identified PC-MLIs: 7 PC → PC-MLI connections (Figure 4a) + 3 PC-MLI → PC connections (Figure 4b). In none of these 10 cases did we observe reciprocal coupling; presumably this is the point that this comment is addressing.</p><p>While the 0/10 cases provide strong evidence for a lack of reciprocal connectivity, we acknowledge that it is still possible there is a low rate of reciprocity that was missed by having only 10 synaptically-coupled pairs. We were unable to find any applicable statistical model to consider this possibility. Thus, we have addressed the issue by simulating the statistical probabilities involved, using a random number generator and a conservative assumption of 100 coupled PC and PC-MLI pairs in a slice. Our findings are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. In brief, a 0.5 rate of reciprocal connectivity between PC and PC-MLI pairs would almost never yield our observation of 10 pairs with no reciprocal coupling. If there is a 0.1 rate of reciprocal connectivity, then there is a 42% chance of observing no reciprocal connections out of 10; if the reciprocal connectivity is reduced to 0.01, there is a 93% chance of obtaining our observed results. A 5% chance of obtaining our results would occur at a rate of reciprocal connectivity of approximately 0.2.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77603-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In light of this analysis, we conclude that our current results indicate that there is, at most, a low probability that the inhibitory circuits between PCs and MLIs are reciprocal. It is much more likely that these connections are non-reciprocal.Therefore, we have addressed the reviewers’ concerns by revising our text (p 9, para. 2) as follows:</p><p>Overall, in a total of 193 paired recordings, only unidirectional connections (either PC-to-MLI or MLI-to-PC) or unconnected pairs were detected; in no case were reciprocally connected PCs and MLIs observed (Figure 4c). Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of reciprocal connections, due to the limited number of recordings from connected pairs, our findings of no reciprocally connected cells in 10 connected PC/PC-MLI pairs indicate it is unlikely that these connections are reciprocal. Simulations indicate that our results would almost never be obtained (probability less than 0.001) if 50% of PC/PC-MLI connections were reciprocal, a 0.05 probability of observing no reciprocal connections in 10 trials if 20% of all connections are reciprocal and a probability greater than 0.9 if 1% or less of the connections are reciprocal. In summary, our data indicate that few, if any, PC/PC-MLI connections are reciprocal; thus, PCs will influence other PCs primarily through disinhibition, while not influencing their own behavior through recurrent inhibition (Figure 4d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Can the authors better substantiate the temporal order of PC and PC-MLI firing during CRs?</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we have addressed this issue by creating a new section that is entirely devoted to analysis of the temporal relationship between PC and PC-MLI activity (pp. 14-17). In brief, here are the main lines of evidence that PCs fire prior to PC-MLIs, both in baseline conditions and during conditioned eyelid responses:</p><p>During baseline activity, we have provided 3 types of evidence that PCs fire prior to putative PC-MLIs:</p><p>1) A spike-triggered average of PC and putative PC-MLI activity during baseline firing showed a modest decrease in PC-MLI firing rate in response to a PC action potential (Figure 8a; see also Figure 8—figure supplement 1a and 1b).</p><p>2) A pause in PC activity caused a very substantial rise in activity in putative PC-MLIs (Figure 8c; see also Figure 8—figure supplement 1c).</p><p>3) A burst of PC activity caused a decline in putative PC-MLI activity (Figure 8d; see also Figure 8—figure supplement 1d).</p><p>We have an additional 3 lines of evidence showing that PCs fire prior to putative PC-MLIs during CRs:</p><p>1) Simultaneous recordings of the time course in changes in PC and putative PC-MLI activity during CRs indicate that PC activity usually declined prior to the activity of putative PC-MLIs. This is clearly visible in the examples shown in Figure 9c, and is discernible in the averaged data shown in Figure 9—figure supplement 1a.</p><p>2) We measured the delay between the time at which PC activity reached 50% of its minimum during the CS and the time at which the activity of putative PC-MLIs reached 50% of its maximum during single trials. Strikingly, whenever CRs were observed, PCs reached their half-maximal response before putative PC-MLIs did (Figure 9─figure supplement 1b).</p><p>3) We also measured the collective timing of changes in the activity of putative PC-MLIs and eyelid PCs during conditioning across all of our paired recordings. This was done by calculating a ratio representing the magnitude of changes in activity prior to CR onset, normalized to the peak amplitude of the change during the entire interval. The distribution of differences in the timing of changes in PC and PC-MLI activity has a mean that is greater than zero (Figure 10), indicating that eyelid PCs decreased their activity before putative PC-MLIs increased their activity in a majority of cases.</p><p>To make these points more clearly, we have significantly revamped the in vivo recording section of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The methods section lacks details, even if parts have been published, there should be a summary. Some points are mentioned by the reviewers. Additionally, can the authors provide a schematic of the simulation?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we have revised the Methods section to include much more detail about the simulation methods, including two schematic diagrams. The methods used for the non-computational work in the paper are already described in extensive detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

That is because the pixel-to-pixel variability derives from the inherent variability of transmission (but few failures) at the PC-to-PC-MLI synapse, rather than fluctuations in light-evoked firing of PCs. To obtain the most reliable estimate of IPSC amplitude, the maps shown in Figures 3b-d are averages of 3 trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How were presynaptic PC somata located (Figure 3f)?</p></disp-quote><p>The “estimated” location of PC somata in Figure 3f was based on the assumption that PC somata were located at the center of the input field, when projected down to the Purkinje cell layer. This was only an estimate, but is likely to be accurate to within 20-40 µm (i.e. less than the width of the histobars in Figure 4f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If somata could be located, was the estimate of 1-2 PCs impinging on one MLI tested via somatic stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>Recall that we successfully patched 7 presynaptic PC-postsynaptic PC-MLIs pairs in 2 years of recordings (pp. 8-9). This high degree of difficulty precluded determining whether there were additional presynaptic PCs, beyond the one that we were very fortunate to record from. More generally, the whole point of our optogenetic circuit-mapping technology is to avoid having to ferret out the location of presynaptic neurons via patching!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1c, bottom, and Figure 2c: Are the averages shown from different trials in the same cell or in different cells?</p></disp-quote><p>They are from different cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2a,b: Show representative traces for different frequencies of stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these traces in Figure2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 title: Can this be called 'Frequency-independent depression' when the extent of depression is maintained by frequency-dependent mobilization?</p></disp-quote><p>It is called “frequency-independent” because synaptic strength was maintained at approximately half of its initial strength – even during prolonged activity – independent of stimulus frequency. This differs from virtually every other type of synapse in the brain, where the degree (and rate) of depression strongly depends upon the frequency of activity. While apt, “frequency-independent” is not our original terminology: it was coined by Turecek et al. (2016), to describe identical behavior at the PC-to-DCN synapse.</p><p>Our contribution is to show that frequency-dependent vesicle mobilization enables the frequency-independence of depression. One way to view it is that two frequency-dependent processes – vesicle depletion (negative) and mobilization (positive) – cancel each other out to create frequency-independent synaptic transmission. This balance is remarkable and is remarkably important for PCs, which tonically fire at high frequencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2e: Need a statistical test for a slope of 0.</p></disp-quote><p>The slope of regression was not significantly different from 0 (p = 0.85, F-test).

Indeed, we state this on the last line of p. 3: “photostimulation reliably evoked action potentials in every PC examined (20/20)”. Further, this is documented in the time domain in Figure 1b and in the spatial domain in Figure 3a. Thus, we respectfully suggest that it is unreasonable for the reviewer to ask that we show additional – and fairly pedantic – data, particularly after complaining that there is already too much data in the paper!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 11: Non-reciprocal connections- how many PC somata were located within the light spot that evoked IPSCs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point at the bottom of page 8:</p><p>“although our optogenetic mapping identified the volume in which presynaptic PCs were located, there was still a low likelihood of sampling the 1 or 2 presynaptic PCs within the dozens of PCs within this volume”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paired recordings are technically very challenging, yet, a sample size of 6 is too small to conclude that reciprocal connections do not exist, especially since PC-MLIs are also a small fraction.</p></disp-quote><p>Out of 193 paired recordings of PCs and MLIs, only 10 demonstrated synaptic coupling between PCs and identified PC-MLIs: 7 PC → PC-MLI connections (Figure 4a) + 3 PC-MLI → PC connections (Figure 4b).

In summary, our data indicate that few, if any, PC/PC-MLI connections are reciprocal; thus, PCs will influence other PCs primarily through disinhibition, while not influencing their own behavior through recurrent inhibition (Figure 4d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4e: Was this analysis done on evoked or spontaneous spikes in PCs?</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis was done on both evoked and spontaneous spikes in PCs.

Probably the build-up of activity in the simulation during the few milliseconds prior to 0 represents PF EPSPs, which evoked action potentials in both PCs and MLIs. As discussed in the text, there is much less background activity in the simulation compared to in vivo conditions. This might cause the build-up to be more evident in the simulation. The main point is that no model is perfect and the simulation is intended to reproduce only qualitative aspects of the in vivo data, in this case showing that a single PC simple spike can impact MLI firing both in vivo and in simulation. We acknowledge the differences between the in vivo data and simulation data in the text (p. 15, para. 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5i,h: Are the curves showing averages of all the PC-MLIs recorded?

However, the analysis shown in the figure (now Figure 7) indicates that the tight relationship with PC-MLI activity includes not only eyelid position, but also eyelid velocity; it also applies at 3 different ISIs. Further, this relationship extends to other kinematic variables: sorting the data by CR onset and amplitude (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) shows that the relationship between PC-MLIs and eyelid CRs is consistent not only across ISIs, but also within each ISI we tested. Thus, PC-MLI activity is closely linked to conditioned eyelid movements. These results are also consistent with previous results grouping eyelid PC activity by CR onset and amplitude (Halverson et al., 2016; Halverson et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7: all data in this figure are representative.

Responses seem to start at about the same time, with similar slopes, but MLIs show a bigger modulation than PCs. Consequently, 50% max response occurs later in MLIs compared to PCs.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, CR-related changes in PC and PC-MLI activity are kinetically complex. 50% of the maximum response is a fairly standard way to quantify the timing of response onset. If the reviewer is using “bigger” to mean a larger response, the 50% criterion is explicitly intended to take into account differences in response amplitude. If the reviewer intends “bigger” to mean peaking at a later time, well that is consistent with our conclusion that PC responses begin earlier than PC-MLI responses. More importantly, 50% of maximum is not the only way we have compared the timing of PC and PC-MLI responses: we also have shown the latency of change in CR-aligned averages, trial-by-trial raster plots or 50% maximum response latency between simultaneous recordings of eyelid PC and PC-MLI. In nearly all cases, eyelid PC activity decreases before both CR onset and the increase in PC-MLI activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9: How does the presence of PC to MLI synapses lead to lesser overall plasticity between PFs and PCs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that we cannot answer yet. Clearly, future studies will be necessary to determine the specific role of the PC to PC-MLI connection in regulating cerebellar plasticity and learning. We have added a sentence to the Discussion (p. 24, para. 3) to make this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) In the recordings from connected PC-MLI pairs, some parameters are pulled from very low numbers of recordings (n&lt;10). For example, conclusions discussed on p. 5 and illustrated in Figure 1d (and following panels) are based on 7 recordings. It is understandable that it is difficult to find connected pairs, yet as a result, the statistical power is low. This should at least be discussed as a caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>Out of 193 paired recordings of PCs and MLIs, only 10 demonstrated synaptic coupling between PCs and identified PC-MLIs: 7 PC → PC-MLI connections (Figure 4a) + 3 PC-MLI → PC connections (Figure 4b). (Note that the number is 10, rather than 7, because we did additional data analysis.) In none of these 10 cases did we observe reciprocal coupling.</p><p>While the 0/10 cases provide strong evidence for a lack of reciprocal connectivity, we acknowledge that it is still possible there is a low rate of reciprocity that was missed by having only 10 synaptically-coupled pairs. We were unable to find any applicable statistical model to consider this possibility. Thus, we have addressed the issue by simulating the statistical probabilities involved, using a random number generator and a conservative assumption of 100 coupled PC and PC-MLI pairs in a slice. Our findings are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. In brief, a 0.5 rate of reciprocal connectivity between PC and PC-MLI pairs would almost never yield our observation of 10 pairs with no reciprocal coupling. If there is a 0.1 rate of reciprocal connectivity, then there is a 42% chance of observing no reciprocal connections out of 10; if the reciprocal connectivity is reduced to 0.01, there is a 93% chance of obtaining our observed results. A 5% chance of obtaining our results would occur at a rate of reciprocal connectivity of approximately 0.2.</p><p>In light of this analysis, we conclude that our current results indicate that there is, at most, a low probability that the inhibitory circuits between PCs and MLIs are reciprocal. It is much more likely that these connections are non-reciprocal.</p><p>Therefore, we have addressed the reviewer’s concern by revising our text (p 9, para. 2) as follows:</p><p>Overall, in a total of 193 paired recordings, only unidirectional connections (either PC-to-MLI or MLI-to-PC) or unconnected pairs were detected; in no case were reciprocally connected PCs and MLIs observed (Figure 4c). Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of reciprocal connections, due to the limited number of recordings from connected pairs, our findings of no reciprocally connected cells in 10 connected PC/PC-MLI pairs indicate it is unlikely that these connections are reciprocal. Simulations indicate that our results would almost never be obtained (probability less than 0.001) if 50% of PC/PC-MLI connections were reciprocal, a 0.05 probability of observing no reciprocal connections in 10 trials if 20% of all connections are reciprocal and a probability greater than 0.9 if 1% or less of the connections are reciprocal. In summary, our data indicate that few, if any, PC/PC-MLI connections are reciprocal; thus, PCs will influence other PCs primarily through disinhibition, while not influencing their own behavior through recurrent inhibition (Figure 4d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5: can the computer simulation predict how many PC-modulated MLIs need to be involved to enable optimal functioning of the feedback circuit (e.g. for one target PC)?</p></disp-quote><p>The simulation is capable of answering this and many other related questions about the inhibitory negative-feedback loop. This point is beyond the scope of the current manuscript (which is already 58 pages long), but is fertile ground for future simulation- based experiments.

It seems that there is a separate, distinct peak at about 0.3.</p></disp-quote><p>The distribution of MLI recording correlations with eyelid position was a single skewed distribution that we fit with two Gaussian distributions. The right-skewed component was fit to the data that peaked at 0.43, which was the cut-off point for our operational definition of eyelid PC-MLIs. The determination of the fit for the rest (majority) of the data was established after subtracting off the right-skewed component. Our fits suggest that the small peak around 0.3 is where the two components overlap maximally, though it is formally possible that this represents a small, third component.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7: This is a very interesting figure that shows that the onset of the PC pause occurs before the peak of MLI activity. If we assume that MLI firing contributes to prolonging the pause, what then mediates the early pause component? Is that PF-PC LTD? Along those lines, is there a necessity/involvement of LTP?</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s enthusiasm for this figure (now called Figure 9). The simulation includes both PF-PC LTP and LTD. The exact timing of the early portion of the pause is probably the balance between preceding LTP and LTD at synapses that become active just before that 400 ms window. The synapses that are activated earliest (furthest in time from US onset) likely undergo LTP, because the majority of their activity falls outside of the plasticity window and delays the PC pause. This LTP essentially delays CR onset by inhibiting deep nucleus activity shortly after CS onset (up to the plasticity window). In contrast, the synapses that are activated very close to the plasticity window will likely undergo LTD and influence the PC pause to happen earlier. We believe this LTD/LTP balance controls CR onset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) On p. 31, last paragraph, the authors state that '…..suggested by our simulations is to require a smaller net change in excitatory synaptic input for PCs to decrease their activity to the level required to produce a well-timed CR during the CS'. This observation resonates well with the recent finding that under realistic [ca<sup>2+</sup>]o and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]o conditions (1.2mM/1mM instead of the more classically used, but incorrect 2mM/2mM) plasticity conditions are less permissive for LTD (Titley et al., J. Physiol. 597, 2019). If correct, those findings suggest that there are plenty of activity conditions under which LTP is induced, but LTD requires a narrow range of specific temporal activity signatures. In light of this, the findings from the computer simulation are particularly meaningful. The authors might want to add this aspect to their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point and one that deserves a fuller treatment in a paper investigating (or reviewing) the necessary or optimal conditions for LTD vs. LTP. Since we have no data that directly address this point, we have not included it in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revised version is a delight to read.

The following paragraph (p. 15, para. 2) also contrasts the small suppression of individual spikes with the larger suppression of activity related to pauses/bursts of PC activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this window in 8a wider than the duration of the merged signal at time 0?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the brief decrease in PC-MLI activity after time 0 in Figure 8a is beyond the merged signal time window.

Also, the activity of each pair of PC and MLI recorded on the same tetrode would show a similar decrease in spike count after time 0 if this decrease in activity was the result of bleed-over from the merged signal. This relatively small decrease in activity was specific to the subset of PC/PC-MLI pairs we identified on the same tetrode. We have added a sentence to para. 2 on p. 14 to state this:</p><p>This relatively small and brief decrease in activity was specific to PC/PC-MLI pairs identified on the same tetrode.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Lines 401-406: This part is a little confusing as the authors state that the intertrial intervals were analyzed to avoid large changes in activity during conditioning. Then they also state that large changes in activity during pauses and bursts show the suppression. So why wouldn't that be seen during conditioning as well? Are pauses and bursts seen during the intertrial interval similar to those during the conditioning?</p></disp-quote><p>The pauses/bursts of PC activity during the inter-trial interval are fundamentally different from the pauses during conditioning trials. The pauses during conditioning trials are the result of temporally specific LTD that – together with other eyelid PCs – control the kinematics of the CR. The pauses/bursts during the inter-trial interval are not related to behaviour in the same way. The inter-trial activity has a range of PC pause/burst durations that occur independent of the pauses elicited during conditioning trials. The inter-trial interval data provided an opportunity to investigate the dynamics between PCs and PC-MLIs without the expression of the learned CR. If we only found an inverse relationship between PCs and PC-MLIs during the expression of CRs and not during the inter-trial interval it would suggest that direct connectivity (PC feedback inhibition) might not be mediating this dynamic. However, we found the inverse relationship between neurons during expression of CRs and during the inter-trial interval, which supports our hypothesis that this relationship is the result of PC feedback to MLIs. These results also cast doubt on the idea that PC-MLI correlations with CRs are due to PC-MLI learning-related plasticity since we observed the inverse relationship when CRs were not present.</p><p>To clarify things, we have revised para. 2 on p. 17 as follows:</p><p>In summary, the activity of PCs and putative PC-MLIs is anti-correlated. This is true both during CRs, as well as at other times, and is particularly evident during large changes in PC activity. Further, several different types of analysis all point to the conclusion that changes in PC activity precede both CR onset and changes in putative PC-MLI activity. All these results are consistent with prediction (3) of the simulation. Collectively, our measurements of the activity of PCs and putative PC-MLIs – and their relationship to CRs – are in line with all 3 predictions of the simulation. Given that the computational predictions require the presence of PC-to-PC-MLI feedback inhibition, we conclude that this feedback circuit likely operates in the cerebellum during motor learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
