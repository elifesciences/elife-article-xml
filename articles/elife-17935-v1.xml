We showed previously that SMOC inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling downstream of its receptor via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In contrast, the most prominent effect of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue, <italic>pentagone</italic> (<italic>pent</italic>), is expanding the range of BMP signaling during wing patterning. Using SMOC deletion constructs we found that SMOC-∆EC, lacking the extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain, inhibited BMP2 signaling, whereas SMOC-EC (EC domain only) enhanced BMP2 signaling. The SMOC-EC domain bound HSPGs with a similar affinity to BMP2 and could expand the range of BMP signaling in an in vitro assay by competition for HSPG-binding. Together with data from studies in vivo we propose a model to explain how these two activities contribute to the function of Pent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development and SMOC in mammalian joint formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17935.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17935.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17935.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During the development of an embryo, a group of proteins known as growth factors stimulate cells to divide and direct how organs and limbs form. One family of growth factors called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate the formation of bone and many other tissues in the embryo. BMPs are released from cells, diffuse away and are then detected by other cells. When BMPs attach to docking station-like structures on the cell surface, called receptors, they stimulate a signaling process inside the cell. In 2009, researchers found that a protein called SMOC blocks BMP activity in animals with backbones by triggering an interfering signal inside the cell. In flies, however, the equivalent protein can make BMP diffuse further from the cell that releases it.</p><p>To find out how SMOC can do both of these things, Thomas et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2009 study – conducted experiments to see which parts of SMOC are required to either block BMP signaling or encourage the diffusion of BMP. These experiments revealed that one end of SMOC can stick to molecules on the cell surface that are not receptors but are molecules where BMP can also bind. When this end of SMOC attaches to these sites, BMPs cannot bind and so diffuse further away.</p><p>Thomas et al. then produced complete or shortened versions of SMOC proteins to see how this affected BMP activity in frogs. These experiments indicated that the opposite end of SMOC is required for short-circuiting the BMP signal. The results also showed that, at lower concentrations, SMOC stimulates BMPs to diffuse, and that higher concentrations are required to block BMP signaling.</p><p>These findings suggest that similar to flies, SMOC can also stimulate BMPs to diffuse from the cell in animals with backbones. The next step will be to identify the cell surface receptor for SMOC to better understand the molecular mechanisms that inhibit BMP. The SMOC pathway could be targeted for therapeutic strategies to combat diseases associated with errors in BMP signaling like osteoarthritis, or in cell-based therapies where BMP signaling must be inhibited to produce cells needed to repair damaged tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17935.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17935.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>BMP Signaling</kwd><kwd>SMOC</kwd><kwd>skeletal joint</kwd><kwd>drosophila wing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000016</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>J Terrig</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrykovich</surname><given-names>Kristin R</given-names></name><name><surname>Stultz</surname><given-names>Brian G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hursh</surname><given-names>Deborah A</given-names></name><name><surname>Moos</surname><given-names>Malcolm</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FDA Commissioner's Fellowship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eric Dollins</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Tehyen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SMOC inhibits BMP signaling locally, but also expands the range of BMP signaling by competing for heparan sulfate binding sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), comprising at least twenty structurally-related members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, are involved in many growth and differentiation events essential for determining body structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu and Hill, 2009</xref>). Establishing temporospatial gradients or restricted distributions of BMP signaling is important for many of these processes, which are regulated by a number of mechanisms: ligand binding by extracellular BMP antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brazil et al., 2015</xref>), intracellular feedback inhibition downstream of the BMP receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massagué et al., 2005</xref>), spatially restricted proteolytic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>), and promotion or restriction of diffusion by interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen type IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Umulis et al., 2009</xref>) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, BMP signaling is also influenced via communication with other signaling pathways, particularly those that act through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPK-directed phosphorylation of BMP receptor-regulated Smad 1/5/8 in the linker region inhibits BMP signaling by blocking Smad translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sapkota et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We showed previously that SMOC, a matricellular protein associated with basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vannahme et al., 2002</xref>) and expressed in developing brain, branchial arches, eye, pronephros, limb bud cartilage condensations, and joint interzones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rainger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>), inhibits BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>); following the addition of BMP2 to NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with SMOC, downstream phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> ectodermal explants (animal caps), SMOC was shown to activate MAPK signaling and inhibit Smad 1/5/8-mediated BMP signaling downstream of the constitutively active BMP receptor, BMPR1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). Although the exact mechanism is not known, the activity was lost in the presence of non-phosphorylatable linker-mutant Smad, suggesting that BMP inhibition results from activation of MAPK signaling and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of Smad following linker Smad phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sapkota et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the SMOC orthologue <italic>pentagone (pent)</italic> is expressed in developing wing imaginal discs and has also been shown to inhibit BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>). However, Pent did not appear to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of the constitutively active zebrafish BMPR1 receptor, Alk8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>). Structurally, SMOC and Pent are similar, containing an N-terminal follistatin-like domain (FS), followed by two thyroglobulin-like domains separated by a non-homologous domain, and a C-terminal extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vannahme et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>). Although Pent contains an additional EC domain located between the two thyroglobulin-like domains, their phylogenetic conservation would predict similar functions.

While SMOC has also been shown to bind to HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klemenčič et al., 2013</xref>), there have been no reports of SMOC promoting BMP signaling at a distance from its source. Indeed, the dual function of SMOC/Pent as a BMP inhibitor and an expander of BMP signaling have not been reconciled. Here, we present the first evidence showing how different domains within SMOC function either to inhibit BMP signaling locally or expand its range of effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Pent can inhibit BMP signaling in <italic>Xenopus</italic> downstream of the BMP receptor</title><p>To support the applicability of functional information from Pent to the vertebrate SMOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we first confirmed that a <italic>pent</italic> cDNA construct was biologically active in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>), compared to controls, flies homozygous for <italic>pent</italic> mutations display a characteristic truncation of the L5 longitudinal vein of the adult wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Initial injections of <italic>pent</italic> mRNA into <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos produced no apparent effects (not shown); however overexpression of a synthetic <italic>pent</italic> mRNA (<italic>co-pent</italic>) optimized for codon usage and translation efficiency in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Villegas and Kropinski, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) produced a dorsalized phenotype indistinguishable from that observed following overexpression of <italic>Xenopus</italic> SMOC-1 (<italic>X</italic>SMOC-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The ability of Pent to inhibit BMP signaling downstream of the BMP receptor was analyzed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> ectodermal explants (animal caps) following co-injection of mRNAs for <italic>co-pent</italic> and constitutively active BMP receptor1B (caBMPR1B); the caBMPR1B, containing an intracellular activating mutation (Q203D), promotes phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 and subsequent BMP signaling events independent of ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al., 1997</xref>). As expected, <italic>XVent</italic>, a direct downstream target of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gawantka et al., 1995</xref>), was strongly expressed in animal caps from embryos injected with caBMPR1B alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>XVent</italic> was markedly reduced in caps from embryos co-injected with caBMPR1B and either <italic>co-pent</italic> or <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); these results suggested that, as we had shown previously for SMOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>), Pent can inhibit BMP signaling downstream of the BMPR1B receptor. It is unclear why, in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>), Pent was able to rescue ventralization caused by overexpression of Bmp2b in <italic>Zebrafish</italic>, but not following overexpression of the <italic>Zebrafish</italic> caBMPR1, Alk8. As both BMPR1B (Alk6) and Alk8 are type I BMP receptors that activate Smad 1/5/8, a possible reason could be the amounts of mRNA injected and/or the amounts of protein produced. In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>), SMOC transfected NIH3T3 cells were able to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of excess BMP2 (100 ng/ml); where the limiting factor would be the number of BMP receptors on the cells. Conversely, in order for SMOC/Pent to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of caBMPR1B, SMOC/<italic>pent</italic> needed to be overexpressed at a 2:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); SMOC was not able to inhibit BMP signaling in the presence of an excess of caBMPR1B (not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17935.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Xenopus</italic> SMOC-1 and <italic>Drosophila pent</italic> are orthologues that inhibit BMP signaling downstream of the BMP receptor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of vertebrate SMOC and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pent: SP- signal peptide, FS – Follistatin-like domain, Tg1 – Thyroglobulin type I-like domain, EC- Extracellular calcium binding domain (<bold>B</bold>) Dorsalized phenotypes of stage 35 <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos following overexpression of mRNAs for <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1 or codon-optimized <italic>pent</italic> (<italic>co-pent</italic>): <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos were injected bilaterally at the two-cell stage with 200 pg of mRNA for either GFP (control), <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1, or <italic>co-pent</italic>.

For these studies, the optimal concentration of SMOC was found to be 100 μg/ml, which appears relatively high. However, SMOC is a matricellular protein and though it is difficult to estimate the effective concentration in vivo, its affinity for HSPGs suggests that its diffusion will be restricted unless HSPG sites are saturated. Consequently, it may remain concentrated near the site of secretion and thus achieve high levels locally.

Whereas these data suggest that the FS and EC domains are not required for BMP inhibition overexpression of <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1Tg1, containing the Tg1-like domains only, did not inhibit BMP signaling in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); deletion of the Tg1-like domains (<italic>X</italic>SMOC-1∆Tg1) produced a similar result. While we believe the Tg1-like domains to be important for BMP inhibition, by process of elimination, the effects of large deletions on protein folding are difficult to predict; in experiments of this type, where protein function is lost, improper folding is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valastyan and Lindquist, 2014</xref>). Consequently, we consider misfolding of the protein produced by <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1∆FS∆EC as the most likely reason for the inability of this construct to block BMP signaling. Additional evidence for the importance of the Tg1-like domains in SMOC comes from studies of human Ophthalmo-Acromelic (Waardenburg Anophthalmia) Syndrome, an autosomal disorder caused by mutations in SMOC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rainger et al., 2011</xref>). The phenotype of anopthalmia, oligodactyly, and joint abnormalities was found to be the same in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations and those with missense mutations in the second Tg1-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rainger et al., 2011</xref>). As the nonsense and frameshift mutations were predicted to result in a complete loss of SMOC-1 function, the two pedigrees harboring two different single amino acid missense mutations in the Tg1-like domain suggests this domain is indeed essential for SMOC-1 function. Alternative approaches will be required to elucidate the exact role of the Tg1-like domains in BMP inhibition. Many proteins contain Tg1-like domains, including thyroglobulin, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) 1–6, the proteoglycan testican, and the basement membrane associated protein nidogen/entactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Novinec et al., 2006</xref>).

The conjugates were allowed to heal for two hours before the ectoderm from the entire animal half of the chimeric embryos was removed for immunostaining for phospho-Smad 1/5/8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–F</xref>). In non-injected controls, no pSmad signal was detected either in the host tissue or the mCherry mRNA-injected donor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). When host embryos were injected with a high concentration of BMP2 mRNA (300 pg), pSmad signaling was observed throughout the host and donor graft tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Following a series of titration experiments we found that injection of 30 pg BMP2 mRNA at the two cell stage (15 pg into each blastomere) was sufficient to induce BMP signaling in the host tissue, while pSmad was observed only at a few cell diameters into the donor graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This amount of BMP2 mRNA was used in subsequent experiments to test whether SMOC can extend the range of BMP signaling. Next, donor animal caps from embryos injected with different amounts of SMOC mRNA were grafted onto the animal poles of embryos injected with 30 pg BMP2 mRNA. Donor caps from embryos injected with a low amount of SMOC mRNA (10 pg) had an increased number of pSmad positive nuclei compared to non-SMOC injected caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Conversely, donor caps from embryos injected with a high amount of SMOC mRNA (300 pg) were devoid of pSmad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The results demonstrate that, in an intact tissue, low concentrations of SMOC can promote diffusion of BMP from its source of synthesis, thereby extending its range of effect, whereas high SMOC concentrations inhibit BMP signaling. These data would be consistent with low levels of SMOC binding to HSPGs, but not inhibiting BMP signaling, and high amounts of SMOC both binding HSPGs and inhibiting BMP signaling. Closer examination of the host tissue surrounding the donor grafts expressing the highest level of SMOC showed BMP signaling was both absent in the graft and decreased in the BMP2-expressing ectoderm immediately adjacent to the SMOC expressing graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This would be consistent with SMOC inhibiting BMP signaling within the graft and also diffusing into the immediate adjacent tissue at levels sufficient to inhibit BMP signaling.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17935.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>In vivo assay demonstrating that <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1 can expand the range of BMP2 signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the host/donor animal cap (AC) transfer assay.

During <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development, while <italic>dpp</italic> expression is restricted to a stripe of medial cells in the wing disc, the morphogenetic gradient expands across the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nellen et al., 1996</xref>). Long-range Dpp signaling in the wing has been shown to involve both <italic>pent</italic> and the cell membrane-anchored HSPG, <italic>dally</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujise et al., 2003</xref>); the absence of either causes severe contraction of the range of Dpp signaling, and wing patterning defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Pent and Dally cooperate to expand the range of Dpp signaling is not clear. It has been speculated that the Pent/Dally interaction may reduce the affinity of Dpp for its receptor, Thickveins, leading to an increase in Dpp diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Zvi et al., 2011</xref>). However, the results we obtained from cell culture studies suggest that this is not the case. When <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1EC is added to HEK293 cells at 50 μg/ml, in serum-free media it will bind to the many cell surface HSPG binding sites. Consequently, following the subsequent addition of BMP2, any impairment of BMP2/receptor affinity caused by SMOC/HSPG binding would result in a reduction of BMP signaling. Instead, a potentiation of BMP signaling was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

Indeed, we showed previously that SMOC can diffuse across many cell diameters in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). At the lateral border, Dpp signaling will be inhibited by a combination of the expression of <italic>pent</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the BMP repressor, <italic>brinker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minami et al., 1999</xref>). As Pent diffuses across the wing disc it will create a lateral-medial gradient and compete with Dpp for Dally binding. Dpp, diffusing in an opposing medial-lateral gradient, will encounter gradually increasing levels of Pent. At low levels, Pent will occupy some Dally binding sites, promoting further Dpp diffusion; at high levels, Pent will occupy many Dally binding sites and also inhibit Dpp signaling downstream of its receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This model is supported by the observations made either in the absence of <italic>pent</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>), or the absence of <italic>dally</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujise et al., 2003</xref>), where there is a contraction of the Dpp signaling gradient. In the absence of <italic>pent</italic>, medial-lateral diffusion of Dpp will be restricted by Dally because there is no Pent to compete for Dally binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The resulting high level of medially localized Dpp signaling, indicated by Mad phosphorylation (pMad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>), has been shown to induce expression of the inhibitory Smad, <italic>daughters against dpp</italic> (<italic>dad</italic>), promoting a negative feedback loop to limit the range of Dpp signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsuneizumi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogiso et al., 2011</xref>). In the absence of <italic>dally</italic>, Dpp diffusion will also be restricted as Dally-binding is required to establish both Dpp and Pent gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>). Medially, <italic>dally</italic> mutant discs show abnormally high levels of pMad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujise et al., 2003</xref>), which would promote a negative feedback loop in Dpp signaling similar to that observed in the absence of <italic>pent</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Our proposed mode of action of Pent in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc is consistent with the role of glypicans in the ‘restricted extracellular diffusion’ model for establishing a Dpp signaling gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwank et al., 2011</xref>); the inclusion of the Pent/glypican interaction provides for further diffusion of Dpp to expand the morphogenetic field. During the review of this manuscript a study was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Norman et al., 2016</xref>) showing that binding of Pent to Dally in <italic>Drosophila</italic> induces endocytosis of the complex, effectively reducing the amount of Dally on cell surfaces. Although it remains to be determined whether binding of SMOC to HSPGs also induces endocytosis, this finding is consistent with the model we propose: both competitive binding of SMOC/Pent to HSPGs and removal of HSPG binding sites for BMP/Dpp by endocytosis would promote BMP/Dpp diffusion. This idea is further supported by the observation that removal of the heparin binding site within BMP4 has also been shown to promote the BMP diffusion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohkawara et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The binding of Pent to Dally also modulates Wingless (Wg) signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where a reduction in Wg signaling is observed in the presence of high levels of Pent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Norman et al., 2016</xref>). The interaction of Wg with Dally is known to potentiate Wg binding to its receptor Frizzled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsuda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin and Perrimon, 1999</xref>); therefore, the sequestration of Dally by Pent would be consistent with a reduction in Wg signaling. These data could also provide an explanation for our previous observation that SMOC activates MAPK signaling and inhibits BMP signaling via a mechanism requiring phosphorylation of Smad in the linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). Linker Smad phosphorylation at MAPK sites has been shown to be followed by phosphorylation at Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuentealba et al., 2007</xref>), resulting in Smad ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sapkota et al., 2007</xref>). As the activity of GSK3 is inhibited by Wnt signaling, a reduction in Wnt signaling by Pent/SMOC could potentiate GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of linker Smad.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The potential function of SMOC during skeletal joint development</title><p>The spatial distributions and interactions of <italic>pent</italic>, <italic>dally</italic>, and <italic>dpp</italic> in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc can also be applied to explain the role of SMOC, HSPGs, and BMPs during development of vertebrate skeletal joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–F</xref>).

Joint development in the digits occurs by segmentation of existing cartilage anlagen in regions where BMP signaling is inhibited by the BMP antagonist Chordin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Francis-West et al., 1999</xref>) and, based on our studies, by SMOC. Once formed, the joint interzone acts as a signaling center to promote appositional growth of the opposing cartilage epipheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray et al., 2015</xref>). Based on information from existing in vivo mutational analyses and the data presented here, we propose the following model for the role of SMOC in promoting joint formation and subsequent appositional epiphyseal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>). Within the interzone, Chordin and SMOC will both bind to HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klemenčič et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jasuja et al., 2004</xref>) such as syndecan-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koyama et al., 1995</xref>), allowing diffusion of GDF5 and BMP2/4 into the epiphyses, where BMP signaling promotes chondrocyte proliferation and appositional epiphyseal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Francis-West et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray et al., 2015</xref>) via the BMP receptor BMPR1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baur et al., 2000</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with the skeletal and joint abnormalities observed in the absence of HS following conditional knockdown of the glycosyltransferase, Ext1, in joint interzones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mundy et al., 2011</xref>). Ext1 is essential for HS synthesis and binding of Chordin to HSPGs and is necessary for its BMP inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jasuja et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, in the absence of HS within the interzone, the BMP antagonist activity of Chordin will be reduced. While SMOC will still contribute to the inhibition of BMP signaling, the imbalance caused by the reduced Chordin activity is consistent with the increase in BMP signaling (pSmad) observed within the interzone in the absence of HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mundy et al., 2011</xref>); as a result, in response to BMP signaling, the interzone cells undergo chondrogenesis and the joint does not form (synostosis). In the absence of SMOC, we predict that the increased availability of HSPG binding sites will restrict diffusion of GDF/BMPs out of the interzone. In addition, the imbalance in BMP inhibition within the interzone will lead to an increase in BMP signaling resulting in chondrogenesis and failure of joint formation. This hypothesis is supported by oligodactyly and joint synostosis observed in patients with Ophthalmo-Acromelic (Waardenburg Anophthalmia) Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rainger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abouzeid et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, based on the data we present here together with existing literature, we propose a model to explain how vertebrate SMOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuilleumier et al., 2010</xref>) regulate BMP signaling. SMOC/Pent can inhibit BMP signaling locally, downstream of the BMP receptor, probably via the region containing the two Tg1-like domains. In addition, binding of SMOC/Pent to cell surface HSPGs via the C-terminal EC domain prevents BMP binding, promoting BMP diffusion, thereby expanding its morphogenetic field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> methods</title><p>UAS-<italic>pentagone</italic> (<italic>UAS pent</italic>) was constructed by PCR amplification (forward primer: ATCTCGAGCCGAAGCACAGTAACAGTT; reverse primer: TATCTAGACGACGACATCTAATGAGTTG) from a cDNA clone corresponding to CG2264 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center), and subcloned into pUAST using <italic>XhoI</italic> and <italic>XbaI</italic>.

Similarly, <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1EC containing the EC domain only (∆T2 to W308) was obtained using the same starting template, the forward primer 5’-GTGATC GGGACAGAGACAAAAATACGGACGCTGAAGACCC-3’, and the reverse primer 5’-GGGTCT TCAGCGTCCGTATTTTTGTCTCTGTCCCGATCAC-3’. Several <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were evaluated for <italic>X</italic>SMOC-1 expression and the ShuffleT7 Express strain C3029 (New England Biolabs), which allows the formation of disulfide bonds, was found to produce the highest yield of bioactive protein. For hSMOC-1 expression the host strain was BL21DE3, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Novinec et al., 2008</xref>). hSMOC-1 (pET28-SMOC-1-HT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Novinec et al., 2008</xref>)), kindly provided by B.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor and Hugo J Bellen as the Reviewing Editor.

Previously, the authors uncovered a role for Smoc in MAPK- dependent phosphorylation of the Smad linker, thus an indirect entry into the BMP signaling. However, data from vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> argue for a role for Smoc in modulating BMPs availability outside the cells. For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pent, appears to expand the range of BMP signaling and to promote signaling at a distance. In this manuscript, the authors test whether Smoc has dual activities onto the BMP signaling and address how different functional domains of Smoc inhibit BMP signaling at short-range while promoting long-range signaling. The authors take a biochemical approach and generate recombinant Smoc variants and refold biologically active proteins. Using these variants in multiple and creative experimental settings, they conclude that the EC domain of Smoc mediates its binding to glypicans and competes with BMPs for glypicans occupancy. From the data presented, it is less clear whether Smoc domain(s) could mediate glypican-independent inhibition of BMP signaling.</p><p>In order to understand the dual role of SMOC as an antagonist of BMP signalling and an expander of BMP spreading, the authors establish a protocol to express and refold recombinant wild-type (wt) and truncated versions of SMOC. Using recombinant wt and truncated SMOC, Thomas et.al. demonstrate that the C-terminal heparin sulphate(HS)-binding domain is dispensable for cell fate conversion and SMOC-mediated repression of BMP signalling. In contrast, the SMOC HS-binding domain is sufficient to promote BMP signalling and to compete with BMP2 for heparin sepharose binding. Furthermore, the authors show that competition for HSPG-binding between BMP2 and the HS-binding domain of SMOC can result in increasing range of BMP2 signalling in a cell culture assay. Based on the finding that SMOC potentially competes with BMPs for HSPG binding, the authors suggest a model for SMOC/Pent function.</p><p>The major novelty of this manuscript is the finding that SMOC can compete with BMP ligands for binding to heparin sulphates. Hence, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which SMOC/Pent would regulate the spreading of BMP ligands by competitive binding to extracellular HSPG.</p><p>The reviewers have some issues with the paper that need to be addressed, but which they believe can be addressed within the required 2-month time window.</p><p>The conclusions of this study are based on in vitro essays only, hence it does not provide evidence that SMOC indeed competes with BMPs under physiological conditions for binding with HSPG. Therefore providing in vivo data that supports the suggested mechanism would greatly enhance the conclusion of this manuscript. If providing such data is not possible, the authors should at least provide in vivo evidence that SMOC can indeed promote BMP signalling at a distance. This might be done by implanting SMOC-soaked beads close to a BMP source and monitor the effect on BMP signalling range.</p><p>While this is undoubtedly an important developmental question, this manuscript lacks several important controls and tends to over-interpret the structure-function analyses. Several major concerns need to be addressed before consideration for publication:</p><p>1) First, the authors argue that Smoc and delta-EC have equivalent effects, but from the data (without quantification) it seems that delta-EC has a reduced effect compared with full-length Smoc, for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>. This result needs to be clarified before the authors could uncouple the glypican-binding function of Smoc from other activities.</p><p>2) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are over-interpreted and do not demonstrate a role for the Tg domains in the inhibition of BMP signaling. The arguments regarding the role of EC in promoting BMP signaling are convincing, but the Tg experiment in 4D is incomplete and should present a full set of relevant Smoc and co-Pent truncations, including delta-FS and delta-EC together, as well as delta-Tg. The 4D panel is based on capped mRNA microinjection (and not purified and refolded proteins), thus a comprehensive set of truncations should be feasible and must be analyzed, quantified, and included here.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that EC, and not Smoc, can promote BMP signaling at a distance. Experiments with full-length Smoc are not shown or described.</p><p>This experiment is very creative and circumvents a tough technical problem in the field, the stickiness of BMP-type ligands. (Since BMP2 is very sticky, Smoc is unlikely to displace it from Heparin-Sepharose, so the converse experiment for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would not work.) Setting up a cell-based system to examine whether Smoc displaces BMP from HSPSs is a clever alternative. But it is unfortunate that the authors did not present the entire series, including Smoc, and delta-EC.</p><p>Importantly, better and more uniform fields of cells must be chosen to illustrate this result, since more cells (as apparent in 6B) will deplete the BMP2 pool faster than the fewer cells shown in 6C, muddying the data.</p><p>4) How do these new findings correlate with the previous report from this group that Smoc modulates MAPK-dependent Smad phosphorylation? The authors need to include a section in the Discussion in which their current results should be reconciled and tied together with their previous findings.</p><p>The recent <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pent paper (Norman et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2016), which shows that Pent also modulates the Wg/Wnt signaling via glypicans, together with previous results reported by Eddy De Robertis' group (Fuentealba et al., Cell 2007) may offer some explanations. For example, the interaction between Pent and Glypicans may play a key role in integrating patterning signals by controlling the interplay between MAPK, Wnt/GSK3 and BMP signaling, which seem to converge onto the phosphorylation state and duration of Smad-dependent signaling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17935.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The reviewers have some issues with the paper that need to be addressed, but which they believe can be addressed within the required 2-month time window.</italic> </p><p><italic>The conclusions of this study are based on in vitro essays only, hence it does not provide evidence that SMOC indeed competes with BMPs under physiological conditions for binding with HSPG.

We have designed and conducted experiments using <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos to address this issue, the results of which are presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos were injected at the two cell stage with mRNAs for BMP2, or SMOC and/or mCherry. Animal caps (ACs) from SMOC/mCherry-injected embryos (donor) were removed at stage 9 and conjugated to the animal poles of BMP2-injected embryos from which ACs had been removed (host). After two hours the entire animal hemispheres of the host/donor conjugates were fixed and immunostained for pSmad 1/5/8 to detect BMP signaling. mCherry was used to distinguish the SMOC-injected donor tissue from the BMP2-expressing host tissue. The use of ACs in this assay was supported by the observation that endogenous pSmad signaling is not present in stage 9 to 9.5 ACs (Faure et al., 2000, Development 127, 2917-2931). As background pSmad staining was absent in the control conjugates, cells positive for pSmad in the donor AC tissue would be indicative of diffusion of BMP from the surrounding host tissue.</p><p>A number of mRNA titration experiments were conducted to determine the optimal amounts of mRNA to inject and the time to incubate the conjugates prior to immunostaining for pSmad. It was found that injection of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos at the two cell stage with 30pg BMP2 mRNA was sufficient to obtain pSmad staining in the host tissue, but insufficient diffuse into the donor Wt caps after two hours. When higher amounts of BMP2 mRNA were used (300pg) pSmad was detected throughout the donor AC tissue, demonstrating that two hours was sufficient time for BMP to diffuse into the donor AC and induce pSmad. The ability of SMOC to extend the range of BMP signaling was tested by conjugating donor ACs from <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos injected with different amounts SMOC mRNA to hosts injected with 30pg of BMP2. We found that much lower amounts of SMOC mRNA were required (10 to 30pg) than that used previously to inhibit BMP signaling (300pg). When high amounts of SMOC mRNA (300pg) were used, there was no pSmad staining in the donor AC or within the first few cell diameters of the adjacent host tissue, indicating BMP inhibition. The results of these experiments have been incorporated into the revised manuscript and a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is provided.</p><p>We hope that this assay and the data obtained will be sufficient to address the reviewers’ request to show the ability of SMOC to promote BMP signaling at a distance from its source in vivo.</p><p>A question we have for the reviewers is whether including hatch marks to demarcate the host/donor tissue boundaries would be beneficial. We did not include these in the current figure as we did not want to obscure the data in any way.</p><p><italic>While this is undoubtedly an important developmental question, this manuscript lacks several important controls and tends to over-interpret the structure-function analyses. Several major concerns need to be addressed before consideration for publication:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) First, the authors argue that Smoc and delta-EC have equivalent effects, but from the data (without quantification) it seems that delta-EC has a reduced effect compared with full-length Smoc, for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>. This result needs to be clarified before the authors could uncouple the glypican-binding function of Smoc from other activities.</italic> </p><p>With regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, while we do not state or intend to imply that SMOC and SMOC-∆EC are fully equivalent. However, we do show and state that both are able to induce the expression of neural markers in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal caps (subsection “BMP Inhibition and Neural induction by SMOC does not require the EC domain”, first paragraph). Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, amended to show the effect of each deletion construct, clearly shows that SMOC and SMOC∆EC can inhibit BMP signaling.</p><p><italic>2) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are over-interpreted and do not demonstrate a role for the Tg domains in the inhibition of BMP signaling.

The 4D panel is based on capped mRNA microinjection (and not purified and refolded proteins), thus a comprehensive set of truncations should be feasible and must be analyzed, quantified, and included here.</italic> </p><p>Two additional SMOC truncation constructs were prepared; SMOC-∆FS∆EC (referred to as SMOC-Tg1), containing the signal peptide and the two Tg1-like domains separated by the non-homologous domain, and SMOC-∆Tg1, containing the FS- like domain and EC domains (subsection “<italic>X</italic>SMOC-1 deletion constructs for mRNA injection”). We conducted mRNA overexpression studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos with SMOC, SMOC∆FS, SMOC∆EC, SMOC-Tg1 only (SMOC∆FS∆EC), and SMOC-∆Tg1 in the presence of the constitutively active BMP receptor (caBMPR1B) to test their ability to inhibit BMP signaling. Overexpression of SMOC, SMOC-∆FS, and SMOC-∆EC inhibited BMP signaling in the presence of the caBMPR; SMOC-Tg1, SMOC-∆Tg1 and SMOC-EC did not (subsection “BMP Inhibition and Neural induction by SMOC does not require the EC domain”, last paragraph). We have replaced the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panel D with the RT-PCR results obtained from these experiments. We speculate, by process of elimination, that while we believe the BMP inhibition activity of SMOC resides in the Tg1 domains, the protein translated from the SMOC-Tg1 only deletion construct may be inactive due to misfolding. We have deleted any categorical statements we had made previously regarding the involvement of the Tg1 domains and replaced them with more speculative language. In addition, we haveincluded data from human genetic studies that support the involvement of the SMOC Tg1 domains in SMOC function (see the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p>We did not prepare truncation constructs for co-Pent as, although the domain structuresof SMOC and Pent are similar, there are also significant differences that would make truncation comparisons difficult to interpret. Consequently, apart from showing that SMOC and co-Pent can both inhibit BMP signaling, we feel this request is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows <italic>that EC, and not Smoc, can promote BMP signaling at a distance.

We did not assess the effect of full length SMOC or SMOC-∆EC in this assay as both could also potentially inhibit BMP signaling and mask the effect on BMP diffusion.</p><p>With regard to the comment on the fields of cells chosen to illustrate the results, we have quantified the percentage of luciferase-positive cells in each field obtained over four separate experiments and included this data in the figure legend. We consider the panels shown to be representative of the experimental results obtained for this assay and have stated this in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>4) How do these new findings correlate with the previous report from this group that Smoc modulates MAPK-dependent Smad phosphorylation?
