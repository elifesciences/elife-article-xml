However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates the folding and assembly of multi-subunit membrane proteins is poorly understood. Previous proteomics studies identified Hsp47 (Gene: <italic>SERPINH1</italic>), a heat shock protein in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, as the most enriched interacting chaperone for gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors. Here, we show that Hsp47 enhances the functional surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in rat neurons and human HEK293T cells. Furthermore, molecular mechanism study demonstrates that Hsp47 acts after BiP (Gene: <italic>HSPA5</italic>) and preferentially binds the folded conformation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors without inducing the unfolded protein response in HEK293T cells. Therefore, Hsp47 promotes the subunit-subunit interaction, the receptor assembly process, and the anterograde trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Overexpressing Hsp47 is sufficient to correct the surface expression and function of epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variants in HEK293T cells. Hsp47 also promotes the surface trafficking of other Cys-loop receptors, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and serotonin type 3 receptors in HEK293T cells. Therefore, in addition to its known function as a collagen chaperone, this work establishes that Hsp47 plays a critical and general role in the maturation of multi-subunit Cys-loop neuroreceptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hsp47</kwd><kwd>GABAA receptors</kwd><kwd>folding</kwd><kwd>assembly</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS105789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Ting-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS117176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Ting-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hsp47 positively regulates the functional surface expression of endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and plays a critical and general role in the maturation of Cys-loop neuroreceptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Initially, the term ‘molecular chaperone’ was coined to describe a nuclear protein that enables the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histone proteins and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laskey et al., 1978</xref>). Since then, the role of chaperones, including the heat shock proteins, in facilitating protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horwich, 2014</xref>) and maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis) at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels has been extensively explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sala et al., 2017</xref>). Proteostasis deficiencies have been recognized in a growing number of neurodegenerative, neurological, and metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferro-Novick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kelly, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). Strategies to restore proteostasis, including applying regulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, have been actively developed to ameliorate such protein conformational diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grandjean and Wiseman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tufanli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>). However, despite recent progress, the role of chaperones in regulating the folding and assembly of multi-subunit membrane proteins requires further elucidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hegde, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKenna et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Multi-subunit membrane protein assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is intimately linked to their folding and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The current limited knowledge about the assembly process was gained from studying various classes of membrane proteins, including dimeric T cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feige et al., 2015</xref>), trimeric P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boumechache et al., 2009</xref>), trimeric sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buck et al., 2017</xref>), tetrameric potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delaney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2017</xref>), and pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). We use γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors as a physiologically important substrate to study their biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in mammalian central nervous systems (CNS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Macdonald and Olsen, 1994</xref>) and provide most of the inhibitory tone to balance the tendency of excitatory neural circuits to induce hyperexcitability, thus maintaining the excitatory-inhibitory balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kirmse and Zhang, 2022</xref>). Functional GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are assembled as pentamers in the ER from eight subunit classes: α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1–3. The most common subtype in the human brain contains two α1 subunits, two β2 subunits, and one γ2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sequeira et al., 2019</xref>). To form a heteropentamer, individual subunits need to fold into their native structures in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder and Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skach, 2009</xref>) and assemble with other subunits correctly on the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connolly et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Only properly assembled pentameric receptors exit the ER, traffic through the Golgi for complex glycosylation, and reach the plasma membrane to perform their function. It was demonstrated that the α1 subunits fail to exit the ER on their own and are retained in the ER; after their assembly with β subunits, the α1β complex can exit the ER for subsequent trafficking to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connolly et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 1996b</xref>). The inclusion of a γ2 subunit to form the pentamer further increases the conductance of the receptor and confers sensitivity to benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olsen and Sieghart, 2009</xref>). Recently, it was reported that the synaptic localization of γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors requires the LHFPL family protein LHFPL4 and Neuroligin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamasaki et al., 2017</xref>). However, many of the fundamental questions about how the proteostasis network regulates the multi-subunit membrane protein assembly process remains to be determined.</p><p>Elucidating the proteostasis network for the subunit folding and assembly process of multi-subunit membrane proteins and their biogenesis pathway in general is important to fine-tune their function in physiological and pathological conditions. Loss of function of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is one prominent cause of genetic epilepsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hernandez and Macdonald, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hirose, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, numerous variations in a single subunit cause subunit protein misfolding in the ER and/or disrupt assembly of the pentameric complex, leading to excessive ERAD, decrease cell surface localization of the receptor complex, and result in imbalanced neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). The elucidation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor proteostasis network will guide future efforts to develop strategies that restore proteostasis of variant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to ameliorate corresponding diseases, such as genetic epilepsies.</p><p>Recently, our quantitative affinity purification mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis identified Hsp47 (Gene: <italic>SERPINH1</italic>) as the most enriched GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-interacting chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). Hsp47 is an ER-resident protein with a RDEL (Arg-Asp-Glu-Leu) ER retention signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nagata et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saga et al., 1987</xref>). Among the large Serpin (<italic>ser</italic>ine <italic>p</italic>rotease <italic>in</italic>hibitor) superfamily, Hsp47 is the only one reported to show a molecular chaperone function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dafforn et al., 2001</xref>). Current literature describes Hsp47 as a collagen-specific chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nagata, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taguchi and Razzaque, 2007</xref>). However, its broader role has been indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito and Nagata, 2019</xref>), such as interacting with the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) to regulate the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>) as well as interacting with amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that Hsp47 enhances the functional surface expression of endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and other Cys-loop receptors in the CNS. Furthermore, a mechanistic study reveals that Hsp47 promotes the folding and assembly of multi-subunit neuroreceptors in the ER. Consequently, our results support a general role of Hsp47 in the protein quality control of multi-subunit Cys-loop receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hsp47 directly interacts with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits</title><p>Since we previously identified Hsp47 as the most enriched GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-interacting chaperone in HEK293T cells using quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>), here we evaluated the interaction between Hsp47 and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in more detail. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using mouse brain homogenates showed that the endogenous Hsp47 binds to endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1 subunits in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, to test a direct interaction between Hsp47 and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits, we carried out an in vitro binding assay using recombinant GST-tagged α1 or β2 subunits and recombinant His-tagged Hsp47. The anti-His antibody pulldown detected the α1 subunit in the GST-α1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 5) and the β2 subunit in the GST-β2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 10). No α1 or β2 bands were detected in the GST control complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 4 and 9), indicating that Hsp47 directly binds to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1 and β2 subunits in vitro. Moreover, recombinant Hsp47 did not interact with recombinant hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related) potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vandenberg et al., 2012</xref>), or recombinant ZIP7 (gene: <italic>SLC39A7</italic>), an ER membrane zinc efflux transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that Hsp47 has certain selectivity to bind membrane proteins in vitro.

A MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) assay reported strong interactions between Hsp47 and the ERD of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits: Kd (Hsp47-α1(ERD))=102 ± 10 nM; Kd (Hsp47-β2(ERD))=127 ± 15 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We used an endoglycosidase H (Endo H) enzyme digestion assay to monitor the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, also as a surrogate to determine whether GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are folded and assembled properly in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the heterogeneity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in neurons, we employed HEK293T cells to exogenously express the major subtype of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing α1, β2, and γ2 subunits for the mechanistic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). The Endo H enzyme selectively cleaves after asparaginyl-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) in the N-linked glycans in the ER, but it cannot remove this oligosaccharide chain after the high mannose form is enzymatically remodeled in the Golgi. Therefore, Endo H resistant subunit bands represent properly folded and assembled, post-ER subunit glycoforms, which traffic at least to the Golgi. Since the α1 subunit has two N-glycosylation sites at Asn38 and Asn138, Endo H digestion generated two Endo H-resistant α1 bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 2 and 4, top two bands), corresponding to singly and doubly glycosylated α1 proteins, which were observed in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2015b</xref>). The Endo H digestion assay showed that Hsp47 overexpression increased the Endo H resistant band intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 4 to lane 2) and the ER to Golgi traffic king efficiency, represented by the ratio of the Endo H resistant α1 band / total α1 band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 4 to lane 2; quantification shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> bottom panel). This result indicated that Hsp47 enhanced the folding and assembly of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the ER and thus their ER-to-Golgi trafficking.

We perturbed α1 subunit folding both genetically and chemically in HEK293T cells expressing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. We then evaluated the correlation between the relative folding degree of the α1 subunits and their interaction with Hsp47 using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Individual GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits have a signature disulfide bond in their large N-terminal domain. Adding dithiothreitol (DTT), which is cell-permeable, to the cell culture media for 10 min destroyed the signature disulfide bond between Cys166 and Cys180 in the α1 subunit, thus compromising its folding. This operation did not change the total α1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 2–4 to lane 1) possibly because, during such a short time, degradation of the misfolded α1 subunit was not substantial. In sharp contrast, adding DTT significantly decreased the α1 protein that was pulled down by Hsp47 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 7–9 to lane 6, quantification shown in the bottom panel). This indicates that eliminating the signature disulfide bond in the α1 subunit decreased its interaction with Hsp47 and supports the hypothesis that Hsp47 preferentially binds to the folded α1 subunit conformation.</p><p>In addition, we genetically disrupted the signature disulfide bond in the α1 subunit either by introducing a single C166A mutation or C166A/C180A double mutations. The co-immunoprecipitation assay clearly demonstrated that both the single and double mutations led to a decreased interaction between the α1 subunit and Hsp47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 6 and 7 to lane 5, quantification shown in the bottom panel). To evaluate the relative conformational stability of the α1 subunit variants, we examined the Triton X-100 detergent soluble fractions and the Triton X-100 detergent-insoluble fractions. The percentage of the insoluble fractions in the C166A single mutation and the C166A/C180A double mutations is significantly greater than that in the WT receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, quantification shown in the bottom panel), indicating that disrupting the signature disulfide bond induces aggregation. Notably, the C166A single mutant is more prone to aggregation than the C166A/C180A double mutant since the single C166A mutant subunit retains an unpaired Cys180 in the ER lumen that remains available for cross-linking.</p><p>During the biogenesis in the ER, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors need to interact with a network of chaperones and folding enzymes, such as BiP, to acquire their native structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). BiP, which binds the hydrophobic patches of unfolded proteins and prevents their aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flynn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Otero et al., 2010</xref>), interacts with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connolly et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di et al., 2013</xref>). We reasoned that if Hsp47 preferentially binds the folded conformation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits, it would act after BiP because BiP is expected to act early in the protein folding step in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knittler and Haas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melnick et al., 1994</xref>). We therefore evaluated how disrupting appropriate α1 subunit folding influenced their interaction with BiP. As hypothesized, the interactions between the α1 subunits and BiP were significantly enhanced when the signature disulfide bonds were chemically destroyed by adding DTT to the cell culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, lanes 7, 8, and 9 to lane 6, quantification shown in the bottom panel). Genetic destruction of the α1 subunit disulfide bonds in the C166A single mutant or the C166A/C180A double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> lanes 6 and 7 to lane 5, quantification shown in the bottom panel) produced similar results. Collectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> indicates that inducing misfolding of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors compromises their interactions with Hsp47, whereas, in sharp contrast, enhances their interactions with BiP. Therefore, BiP preferentially binds the unfolded/misfolded states, whereas Hsp47 preferentially binds the properly folded states of the α1 subunits. Hsp47 must therefore acts after BiP to enhance the productive folding of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hsp47 enhances the subunit-subunit assembly of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</title><p>A cellular environment is required for the assembly of the majority of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green, 1999</xref>), indicating that factors other than ion channel subunits themselves are necessary in this process. We next tested our hypothesis that Hsp47 promotes efficient GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit assembly. We used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to evaluate the cellular interactions between GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits. We incorporated enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (donor) into the TM3-TM4 intracellular loop of the α1 subunit and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (acceptor) into the TM3-TM4 intracellular loop of the β2 subunit. The addition of CFP/YFP into the large intracellular loops of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors did not change the function of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors since dose response to GABA was indistinguishable between α1β2γ2 receptors and (CFP-α1)(YFP-β2)γ2 receptors according to patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The absence of reducing reagents in the protein gel’s sample loading buffer preserves the intra- and inter-subunit disulfide bonds, which is expected to enable the detection of subunit oligomerization. In HEK293T cells expressing α1β2 receptors, distinct bands around 480 kDa were visible for both α1 subunit and β2 subunit in non-reducing gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 2–5), indicating that the 480 kDa complex corresponds to the α1β2 hetero-oligomers. Moreover, the apparent molecular weight of the 480 kDa complex agrees with the molecular weight of the detected native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors obtained from the cerebellum using blue native protein gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamasaki et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the 480 kDa complex probably corresponds to the correctly assembled receptor complex. Strikingly, overexpression of Hsp47 increased the intensity of the 480 kDa bands for both α1 and β2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 3–5 to lane 2, quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that Hsp47 promotes the formation of the properly assembled oligomers. In addition, reducing protein gels showed that overexpressing Hsp47 increased the band intensities for α1 and β2 subunits at 50 kDa in HEK293T cells expressing α1β2 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 8–10 to lane 7, quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, we carried out control experiments using HEK293T cells expressing only α1 subunits because α1 subunits alone cannot exit the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 1996b</xref>). Non-reducing gels revealed that the majority of the detected α1 protein was in the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 12), and overexpression of Hsp47 did not change the intensity of α1 subunit band on the non-reducing gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 13–15 to lane 12) or using reducing gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 18–20 to lane 17). This probably occurred because α1 subunits alone cannot assemble to form a trafficking-competent complex to exit the ER. Collectively, these results indicated that Hsp47 promotes the assembly of the native pentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes for their subsequent ER exit and trafficking to the Golgi and plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Overexpressing Hsp47 rescues functional surface expressions of trafficking-deficient, epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variants</title><p>We next evaluated the effect of Hsp47 on the function of pathogenic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors harboring trafficking-deficient variations in the α1 subunit.

The UPR is the major cellular signaling pathway that monitors the ER proteostasis by using three arms, namely, the IRE1/XBP1s arm, ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) arm, and PERK (protein kinase R-like ER kinase) arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). IRE1, ATF6, and PERK are all ER transmembrane proteins. IRE1 activation leads to its oligomerization and the splicing of XBP1 mRNA. Spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) is then translocated into the nucleus, acting as a transcription factor to regulate ER proteostasis. ATF6 activation leads to its translocation from the ER to the Golgi and the release of the active 50 kDa N-terminal fragment of ATF6 (ATF6-N), which will then be translocated to the nucleus to act as a transcription factor to enhance the ER folding capacity. PERK activation leads to its oligomerization and the ultimate induction of CHOP, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Knocking down Hsp47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or overexpressing Hsp47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) did not change the protein levels of XBP1s, ATF6-N, or CHOP in HEK293T cells expressing WT α1β2γ2 or α1(A322D)β2γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whereas application of thapsigargin, a pan-UPR activator, increased the protein levels of XBP1s, ATF6-N, and CHOP significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, depleting or overexpressing Hsp47 did not influence the protein levels of BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), a prominent ATF6 downstream target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>).

Therefore, since genetic manipulations of Hsp47 did not induce the activation of the UPR, the positive effect of Hsp47 on enhancing the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor assembly and trafficking was not likely through the alteration of the global ER proteostasis network.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Genetic manipulations of Hsp47 do not activate the UPR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells expressing WT α1β2γ2 or α1(A322D)β2γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were transiently transfected with non-targeting (NT) control siRNAs or siRNAs against <italic>SERPINH1</italic> (#1 or #2).

The Cys-loop receptors, including nAChRs and serotonin type 3 receptors (5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs), are pentameric ligand-gated neuroreceptors, sharing a common structural scaffold, including a β-sheet-rich ER lumen domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nemecz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morales-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). We chose to evaluate the effect of Hsp47 on nAChRs and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs. Heteropentameric α4β2 nAChRs and homopentameric α7 nAChRs are the major subtypes in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nashmi and Lester, 2006</xref>). Overexpressing Hsp47 significantly increased the total protein levels of α4 and β2 subunits in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Previously, FRET experiments were developed to evaluate the assembly of α4β2 and α7 nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nashmi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Son et al., 2009</xref>). Here, FRET assays demonstrated that overexpressing Hsp47 significantly increased the mean FRET efficiency of (CFP-β2)(YFP-α4) nAChRs from 27.7±16.4% to 40.9 ± 18.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that Hsp47 positively regulates the assembly of heteropentameric α4β2 receptors. In contrast, FRET experiments showed that Hsp47 overexpression did not influence the mean FRET efficiency of homopentameric α7 nAChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, Hsp47 overexpression did not change α7 total protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggested that the capability of Hsp47 in the regulation of the biogenesis of α4β2 and α7 nAChRs is different. Furthermore, Hsp47 overexpression increased the nicotine-induced peak current from 57.9±28.6 pA (n=9) to 134±84 pA (n=9) in HEK293T cells expressing α4β2 nAChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

It is worth noting that it is expected that Hsp47’s chaperoning role is not required for the assembly of hERG channels since they lack large ER luminal domains.

BiP and calnexin assist the subunit folding early in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di et al., 2013</xref>). Hsp47 operates after BiP and binds the folded states or late folding stage of the α1 and β2 subunits in the ER lumen. Hsp47 binding enhances the interactions among adjacent subunits. As a result, Hsp47 promotes the formation of the assembly intermediates and the native pentameric receptors in the ER. It is unclear whether Hsp47 targets certain subunit-subunit interfaces, such as α1-β2, α1-γ2, or β2-γ2 interfaces. In addition, the assembly intermediates that Hsp47 promotes, such as dimers and trimers, require future investigation. Properly assembled receptors will traffic to the Golgi and onward to the plasma membrane for function. Regarding the impact of Hsp47 on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor proteostasis, Hsp47 overexpression increases total protein levels of WT α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and α1(A322D) proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), but does not change their apparent degradation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Therefore, the effect of Hsp47 on enhancing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor proteostasis is not likely through the alteration of the global ER proteostasis network. In addition, activating ATF6 or IRE1/XBP1s does not change Hsp47 protein levels in HEK293T cells expressing a misfolding-prone GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, the effect of ATF6 or IRE1/XBP1s activation on enhancing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor proteostasis is not through Hsp47 upregulation. Moreover, we showed that Hsp47 interacts with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Taken together, our data strongly support that the effect of Hsp47 on promoting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor assembly and trafficking is direct.</p><p>In addition, we demonstrated that Hsp47 positively regulates the assembly and function of α4β2 nAChRs, but not the assembly of α7 nAChRs. Interestingly, it was reported that RIC-3, an ER transmembrane protein, is important for the assembly of α7, but not α4β2 nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Millar, 2008</xref>), whereas NACHO (gene symbol: <italic>TMEM35</italic>), an ER transmembrane protein in the ER, can promote the assembly and function of both α4β2 and α7 nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the differential role of chaperones on the assembly of various subtypes of multi-subunit ion channels requires further investigation. Nonetheless, it appears that Hsp47 acts as a chaperone that promotes the assembly process of heteropentameric Cys-loop receptors, including GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, nAChRs, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs. This supplements the canonical function of molecular chaperones that serve to assist protein folding and prevent protein aggregation. The assembly of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits is mediated by their N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>). For example, residues 86–96 within α1 subunits, especially Gln95, play an important role in their assembly with β3 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we showed that an ER lumen localized chaperone, Hsp47, enhances the oligomerization of heteropentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</p><p>Our results expand the client protein pool and function of Hsp47. Hsp47 was identified and is currently recognized as a collagen-specific chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nagata et al., 1986</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that Hsp47 has a general effect in proteostasis maintenance of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, nAChRs, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. In addition, it was previously reported that Hsp47 physically interacts with amyloid precursor protein and regulates the secretion of Aβ-peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, Hsp47 could have diverse functions in the CNS. Here, we show that Hsp47 binds the ER luminal domain (ERD) of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1 and β2 subunits with high-affinity. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor ERD domain is rich in β-sheets containing ten β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>), whereas for its known substrate collagen, Hsp47 preferentially binds to the folded conformation of the collagen triple helices with a 2:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ono et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tasab et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Widmer et al., 2012</xref>). It is also known that Hsp47 interacts with the ERD of IRE1α, a major transducer of the UPR, with a Kd of 73.2±8.4 nM, to regulate the IRE1α oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sepulveda et al., 2018</xref>); the ERD of IRE1α also adopts a β-sheet-rich structure with a triangular assembly of β-sheet clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it appears that Hsp47 can interact with both the β-sheet-rich structure and triple helix structure. How Hsp47 adopts these structurally diverse client proteins needs future investigations. As a pentameric channel, each GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor has five potential binding sites for Hsp47. However, each GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor only has two agonist binding sites in the N-terminal domain for GABA. Therefore, the binding stoichiometry between Hsp47 and the pentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors merits future effort.</p><p>Recent advances in genetics identified mutations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that are associated with idiopathic epilepsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hernandez and Macdonald, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Achkar et al., 2021</xref>). One mutation can compromise the receptor function by influencing the protein biogenesis pathways (transcription, translation, folding, assembly, trafficking, and endocytosis), ligand binding, channel gating, or their combinations. Recently, we showed that enhancing the ER folding capacity is a viable way to restore the surface expression and thus function of pathogenic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors carrying misfolding-prone mutations in the α1 and γ2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Han et al., 2015a</xref>). Numerous disease-causing mutations disrupt their folding and/or assembly, leading to reduced trafficking to the plasma membrane. These trafficking-deficient mutant subunits are retained in the ER and degraded by the ERAD pathway. Since we envisage that Hsp47 interacts with proteins in the folded states or late-folding states and stabilizes the assembly intermediates and assembled receptor complex, overexpressing Hsp47 can ‘pull’ more mutant subunits into the folded/assembled receptors that can engage the trafficking machinery for transport to the plasma membrane. Consequently, the function of the mutant receptors would be restored after Hsp47 overexpression. The rescuing mechanism of Hsp47 is similar to that of pharmacological chaperones, which bind to folded/assembled mutant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to stabilize their conformation to enhance their surface transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, we showed that Hsp47 overexpression as well as application of pharmacological chaperones, such as Hispidulin and TP003, enhanced the functional surface expression of a variety of trafficking-deficient α1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). A promising therapeutic approach to treat genetic epilepsy resulting from GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking deficiency would be using small molecules to adapt the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor proteostasis network, including Hsp47, to restore the surface trafficking and thus function of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variants. Therefore, this strategy serves as a proof-of-principle case for promoting the multi-subunit assembly process to ameliorate diseases resulting from membrane protein folding/assembly deficiencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lead Contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Ting-Wei Mu (tingwei.mu@case.edu).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>All plasmids generated in this study will be made available on request but we may request a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Plasmids and siRNAs</title><p>The pCMV6 plasmids containing human GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1 subunit (<italic>GABRA1</italic>) (Uniprot #: P14867-1) (catalog #: RC205390), β2 subunit (<italic>GABRB2</italic>) (isoform 2, Uniprot #: P47870-1) (catalog #: RC216424), γ2 subunit (<italic>GABRG2</italic>) (isoform 2, Uniprot #: P18507-2) (catalog #: RC209260), 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A subunit (catalog #: SC122578, <italic>HTR3A</italic>, NM_000869), C-terminal FLAG-tagged 5-HT<sub>3</sub>B subunit (catalog #: MR206966, <italic>HTR3B</italic>, NM_020274), C-terminal FLAG-tagged hERG potassium channel (catalog #: RC215928, <italic>KCNH2</italic>, NM_000238, human), and pCMV6 Entry Vector plasmid (pCMV6-EV) (catalog #: PS100001) were obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA).

The neurons were then incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher, catalog #: A11032) (1:500 dilution), or Alexa 405-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (ThermoFisher, catalog #: A31556) (1:500 dilution), diluted in 2% goat serum in DPBS, for 1 h. The coverslips were then mounted using fluoromount-G (VWR, catalog #: 100502–406) and sealed. An Olympus IX-81 Fluoview FV1000 confocal laser scanning system was used for imaging with a 60×objective by using FV10-ASW software.

Briefly, the glass electrodes have a tip resistance of 3–5 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution. For GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor recording, the intracellular solution was composed of (in mM): 153 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 5 Mg-ATP (adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH); the extracellular solution was composed of (in mM): 142 NaCl, 8 KCl, 6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 120 nM fenvalerate (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH).

For GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor recordings, coverslips containing cells were placed in a RC-25 recording chamber (Warner Instruments) on the stage of an Olympus IX-71 inverted fluorescence microscope and perfused with extracellular solution. Fast chemical application was accomplished with a pressure-controlled perfusion system (Warner Instruments) positioned within 50 µm of the cell utilizing a Quartz MicroManifold with 100 µm inner diameter inlet tubes (ALA Scientific). The whole-cell currents were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV in voltage-clamp mode using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). The signals were acquired at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices). For nAChR recordings, cells were visualized with an upright microscope (Axio Examiner A1, Zeiss) equipped with an Axiocam 702 mono camera.

There are questions regarding the directness of the effect of HSP47 on GABAA folding and trafficking. While it is clear from the evidence presented that HSP47 binds to GABAA subunits, the specific importance of these interactions on changes to GABAA assembly and trafficking was not entirely clear. For example, does genetic manipulation of GABAA subunits globally alter ER proteostasis through mechanisms such as UPR activation? This type of global ER remodeling could indirectly impact GABAA receptor assembly and trafficking. In our reviews, we suggest a number of experiments that could help clarify this point, which we feel would strengthen the overall findings.</p><p>2. The second point centers on the proposed mechanism by which HSP47 is proposed to influence GABAA ER quality control and trafficking. In the manuscript, the authors propose that HSP47 binds to folded GABAA subunits after BiP-mediated chaperoning to facilitate assembly. However, there are questions related to the impact of HSP47 on GABAA ER proteostasis, specifically whether HSP47 leads to GABAA ER accumulation or degradation. Additional clarification on the specific impact of HSP47 on GABAA within the ER would also improve the overall manuscript in the opinion of the reviewers.</p><p>We encourage you to address these, and other comments brought up in the below reviews, in follow-up work to continue to define the important role of HSP47 in the folding, assembly, and trafficking of Cys-loop receptors such as GABAA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As indicated above, an important unanswered question is 'how does HSP47 genetic manipulation influence overall ER proteostasis and function in neurons and HEK293T cells?' While it's clear that HSP47 directly binds GABAA, it isn't clear that the observed phenotypes can be attributed to this binding. For example, does knockdown or overexpression of HSP47 influence stress-responsive signaling pathways such as the UPR in the presence of GABAA overexpression? It is known that HSP47 regulates IRE1 signaling and the authors have previously demonstrated that altered UPR signaling can influence GABAA trafficking and activity. The authors should monitor the expression of ER stress-responsive genes to determine the potential impact of depletion/overexpression of HSP47 on ER function.</p><p>2. Along the same lines, do stress-induced increases in HSP47 influence the assembly, trafficking, and activity of GABAA receptors in the context of a UPR? In other words, does increase HSP47 contribute to improved ER proteostasis of GABAA receptors observed upon the activation of UPR signaling pathways?</p><p>3. It would also be useful to show that ER proteostasis (i.e., folding, trafficking) of another protein is unaffected by HSP47 overexpression. This doesn't necessarily need to be a membrane protein but could give support to the idea that the observed effects are selective for Cys loop membrane proteins.</p><p>4. It wasn't clear to me how the BiP binding to the GABAA subunit described in Figure 1C was performed. Was this in the presence of nucleotide? How can one compare the relative binding affinities of BiP and HSP47 without considering the nucleotide-dependent binding affinity of BiP. I'd more be careful with that comparison in the text.</p><p>5. The authors convincingly demonstrate the importance of HSP47 in promoting the assembly of the GABAA receptors, but it isn't clear if HSP47 specifically is important for the assembly of a single interface or if all receptor interfaces require HSP47 for assembly. In other words, if HSP47 is depleted/overexpressed are specific assembly intermediates identified? It isn't clear from Figure 4C, although higher levels of HSP47 do appear to increase a band in the alpha1 blot (not observed in the beta2 blot) of ~120 kDa that could reflect a specific interaction.</p><p>6. With the mutant GABAA subunit, the authors show increased trafficking and activity in response to HSP47 overexpression. How does this improved trafficking/activity compare to the wild-type protein?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Wang and colleagues provide evidence that the ER-resident HSP47 chaperone promotes the folding of GABA receptor subunits and the assembly of GABA subunits into multimeric ion channels. They demonstrate HSP47 can rescue the folding and function of a missense mutant A332D epilepsy-associated GABA subunit. They also demonstrate similar enhanced folding/function for acetylcholine receptor assembly. Overall, the experimental data in mouse brain lysates, cultured rat neurons, and HEK293 cells are well-presented and provide insight into new ion channel clients of the HSP47 chaperone and suggest that HSP47 expression can target disease-associated ion channel mutations.</p><p>1. Authors show in Figure S1 model that unassembled or misfolded GABA subunits are degraded. Is HSP47 knock-down leading to degradation of GABA subunits, either for wild-type or the A332D mutant subunit, or are the GABA subunits trapped in a BiP-bound state without HSP47? Conversely, is over-expression reducing ubiquitination and ERAD of the GABA subunits?</p><p>2. Authors show that HSP47 enhances folding and assembly for wild-type and A332D mutant GABA subunits. Authors show that, in the case of A332D, HSP47 overexpression enhances ion channel function. What about wild-type GABA subunits? Are there functional consequences for HSP47 overexpression on wild-type channel ion conductance, since they show improved folding and assembly?</p><p>3. Authors propose that HSP47 preferentially binds the correctly folded conformation of GABA subunits. But for the A332D mutation, how can it adopt a correctly folded conformation given the inherent amino acid substitution? Can authors provide more insight into the consequences and A332D on GABA, and how HSP47 is overcoming the mutation?</p><p>4. The functional studies of HSP47 overexpression are performed in HEK293 cells. Is it feasible to evaluate HSP47 overexpression in the native rat neurons on GABA ion channel conductance?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In Figure 1B, it would be good to include a control of Hsp47 pull-down with another membrane protein to indicate specificity.</p><p>– Overall, very little alpha1 appears to be EndoH resistant under EV conditions in HEK293 cells. Does this low trafficking efficiency track with rat primary neurons or brain tissue more broadly?</p><p>– Can the authors explain what the middle band is between EndoH resistant and sensitive (Figure 3A, 5A)?</p><p>– For Figure 4B and 5A, a blot should be added to quantify Hsp47 overexpression.</p><p>– Please provide additional details for the FRET measurements of the homopentameric alpha7 nAChR complex assembly. Since alpha7 subunits are tagged with a mixture of fluorophores this would produce heterogenous complex mixtures. This should lower the sensitivity of the assay to detect changes in the assembly efficiency. How does the LOD change relative to heteromeric complexes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84798.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>All three reviewers were enthusiastic about this manuscript and the evidence supporting a new role for HSP47 in promoting the assembly and trafficking of membrane protein receptors including GABAA.

We summarized these results on pages 16-18 under a new subtitle “Depleting or overexpressing Hsp47 does not activate the UPR”.</p><p>In addition, on pages 21-22, in the discussion, we added, “Our data demonstrated that knocking down Hsp47 (Figure 6A, 6C) or overexpressing Hsp47 (Figure 6B) does not activate IRE1/XBP1s, ATF6, or PERK pathway of the UPR in HEK293T cells expressing GABAA receptors or neurons. Therefore, the effect of Hsp47 on enhancing GABAA receptor proteostasis is not likely through the alteration of the global ER proteostasis network. In addition, activating ATF6 or IRE1/XBP1s does not change Hsp47 protein levels in HEK293T cells expressing a misfolding-prone GABAA receptor variant (Figure 6D). Therefore, the effect of ATF6 or IRE1/XBP1s activation on enhancing GABAA receptor proteostasis is not through Hsp47 upregulation. Moreover, we showed that Hsp47 interacts with GABAA receptor subunits in the mouse brain (Figure 1A), in vitro (Figure 1B), and in cells (Figure 3B, 3C). Taken together, our data strongly support that the effect of Hsp47 on promoting GABAA receptor assembly and trafficking is direct.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In addition, Hsp47 overexpressing enhances the ER-to-Golgi trafficking efficiency of WT α1 (Figure 3A) and α1(A322D) proteins (Figure 5A). Taken together, our data support that the critical effect of Hsp47 is due to the shift of GABAA receptor population toward the trafficking-competent states.”</p><p>The mechanism of Hsp47 on GABAA receptors is similar to that of pharmacological chaperones. On page 24, in the discussion, we added, “Since we envisage that Hsp47 interacts with proteins in the folded states or late-folding states and stabilizes the assembly intermediates and assembled receptor complex, overexpressing Hsp47 can “pull” more mutant subunits into the folded/assembled receptors that can engage the trafficking machinery for transport to the plasma membrane. Consequently, the function of the mutant receptors would be restored after Hsp47 overexpression. The rescuing mechanism of Hsp47 is similar to that of pharmacological chaperones, which bind to folded/assembled mutant GABAA receptors to stabilize their conformation to enhance their surface transport [65,90]. Indeed, we showed that Hsp47 overexpression as well as application of pharmacological chaperones, such as Hispidulin and TP003, enhanced the functional surface expression of a variety of trafficking-deficient α1 variants (Figure 5D, 5G) [65]. Therefore, this strategy serves as a proof-of-principle case for promoting the multi-subunit assembly process to ameliorate diseases resulting from membrane protein folding/assembly deficiencies.”</p><p>In addition, we performed new experiments to determine the effect of Hsp47 on various ion channels and ERAD substrates (Figure 5E-G, Figure 7D, and Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Our new experiments (Figure 5E-G) demonstrated that overexpressing Hsp47 rescues functional surface expressions of a number of trafficking-deficient, epilepsy-associated GABAA receptor variants, including α1(S76R), α1(D219N), and α1(G251D). Please see page 16 in the manuscript for details.</p><p>Our new experiments (Figure 7D, see page 19 for details) showed that Hsp47 overexpression increased the surface proteins of serotonin type 3 receptors, another member of Cys-loop receptors. Given Hsp47’s positive effects on heteropentameric GABAA receptors (Figure 2) and nAChRs (Figure 7A-C), it appears that Hsp47 has a general role in increasing the surface expression of heteropenatmeric Cys-loop receptors.</p><p>Moreover, we tested the influence of Hsp47 on other ion channels that have different structural scaffolds compared to Cys-loop receptors, including NMDA receptors and hERG potassium channels, and an ERAD substrate, L444P β-glucocerebrosidase. New results demonstrated that Hsp47 did not positively regulate the protein levels of NMDA receptors (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A), hERG channels (Figure 7—figure supplement 2B), or L444P β-glucocerebrosidase (Figure 7—figure supplement 2C) (see pages 19-20 for detail).</p><p>Taken together, on page 20, we stated, “Therefore, our results indicated that Hsp47 had a general role in increasing the surface expression of heteropentameric Cys-loop receptors, including GABAA receptors, nAChRs, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs. Furthermore, Hsp47 had certain selectivity for Cys-loop receptors since Hsp47 did not enhance the biogenesis of other structurally diverse ion channels, such as NMDA receptors and hERG channels, or an ERAD substrate in the ER lumen, L444P β-glucocerebrosidase.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We encourage you to address these, and other comments brought up in the below reviews, in follow-up work to continue to define the important role of HSP47 in the folding, assembly, and trafficking of Cys-loop receptors such as GABAA.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed each comment below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Our results demonstrated that depleting Hsp47 or overexpressing Hsp47 did not activate the three arms of the UPR in HEK293T cells expressing WT α1β2γ2 or α1(A322D)β2γ2 GABAA receptors (Figure 6A, Figure 6B). In addition, depleting Hsp47 did not activate the UPR in primary cortical neurons (Figure 6C). Therefore, it appears that genetic manipulations of Hsp47 did not change the ER proteostasis environment globally, and thus the effect of Hsp47 on enhancing GABAA receptor assembly and trafficking is not likely an indirect effect through the UPR activation.</p><p>On page 16-18, we stated, “Depleting or overexpressing Hsp47 does not activate the UPR.</p><p>Since the ER proteostasis network orchestrates the folding, assembly, degradation, trafficking of GABAA receptors [40] and adapting the proteostasis network by activating the UPR, such as the ATF6 arm, rescues misfolding-prone GABAA variants [15], we determined how genetic manipulations of Hsp47 influenced overall ER proteostasis. The UPR is the major cellular signaling pathway that monitors the ER proteostasis by using three arms, namely, the IRE1/XBP1s arm, ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) arm, and PERK (protein kinase R-like ER kinase) arm [66]. IRE1, ATF6, and PERK are all ER transmembrane proteins. IRE1 activation leads to its oligomerization and the splicing of XBP1 mRNA. Spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) is then translocated into the nucleus, acting as a transcription factor to regulate ER proteostasis. ATF6 activation leads to its translocation from the ER to the Golgi and the release of the active 50 kDa N-terminal fragment of ATF6 (ATF6-N), which will then be translocated to the nucleus to act as a transcription factor to enhance the ER folding capacity. PERK activation leads to its oligomerization and the ultimate induction of CHOP, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Knocking down Hsp47 (Figure 6A) or overexpressing Hsp47 (Figure 6B) did not change the protein levels of XBP1s, ATF6-N, or CHOP in HEK293T cells expressing WT α1β2γ2 or α1(A322D)β2γ2 GABAA receptors, whereas application of thapsigargin, a pan-UPR activator, increased the protein levels of XBP1s, ATF6-N, and CHOP significantly (Figure 6B). In addition, depleting or overexpressing Hsp47 did not influence the protein levels of BiP (Figure 6A, 6B), a prominent ATF6 downstream target [67]. These results indicated that genetic operations of Hsp47 did not substantially induce the activation of the UPR in HEK293T cells. Moreover, we used primary cortical neurons to determine the effect of depleting Hsp47 on UPR activation and endogenous GABAA receptors. Clearly, knocking down Hsp47 reduced the protein levels of endogenous GABAA receptors, including the major α1, β2/β3, and γ2 subunits, without activating the UPR in cortical neurons (Figure 6C). Therefore, since genetic manipulations of Hsp47 did not induce the activation of the UPR, the positive effect of Hsp47 on enhancing the GABAA receptor assembly and trafficking was not likely through the alteration of the global ER proteostasis network.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Along the same lines, do stress-induced increases in HSP47 influence the assembly, trafficking, and activity of GABAA receptors in the context of a UPR? In other words, does increase HSP47 contribute to improved ER proteostasis of GABAA receptors observed upon the activation of UPR signaling pathways?</p></disp-quote><p>We determined the effect of activating ATF6 or IRE1/XBP1s on Hsp47 protein levels. Interestingly, in HEK293T cells expressing α1(A322D)β2γ2 receptors, activating ATF6 or XBP1s did not change Hsp47 protein levels, but increased α1(A322D) protein levels significantly (Figure 6D). Therefore, it appears that the effect of UPR activation on enhancing GABAA proteostasis was not through Hsp47 upregulation.</p><p>On page 18, we stated, “Furthermore, we determined the effect of activating the UPR on the expression of Hsp47 in HEK239T cells expressing misfolding-prone GABAA receptors carrying the α1(A322D) variant. Activating the ATF6 arm genetically by overexpressing the active ATF6-N fragment or pharmacologically by the application of two ATF6 activators, namely AA147 and AA263 [68], did not significantly change Hsp47 protein levels (Figure 6D), whereas as expected, such operations increased α1(A322D) and BiP protein levels (Figure 6D) [15,69]. In addition, activating the IRE1 arm genetically by overexpressing XBP1s did not increase Hsp47 protein levels (Figure 6D). These results indicated that activating the UPR did not change Hsp47 expression in HEK293T cells expressing a misfolding-prone GABAA receptor variant. Therefore, the effect of UPR activation on enhancing GABAA receptor proteostasis was not through Hsp47 upregulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would also be useful to show that ER proteostasis (i.e., folding, trafficking) of another protein is unaffected by HSP47 overexpression. This doesn't necessarily need to be a membrane protein but could give support to the idea that the observed effects are selective for Cys loop membrane proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the influence of Hsp47 on other ion channels that have different structural scaffolds compared to Cys-loop receptors, including NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related) potassium channels. In addition, we determined the effect of Hsp47 on an ERAD substrate using L444P β-glucocerebrosidase, the most common disease-causing variant in neuropathic Gaucher diseases, as a example. Our results indicated that Hsp47 did not positively regulate the protein levels of NMDA receptors (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A), hERG channels (Figure 7—figure supplement 2B), or L444P-β-glucocerebrosidase (Figure 7—figure supplement 2C).</p><p>Moreover, we tested the effect of Hsp47 on the biogenesis of another Cys-loop receptor family member, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors, which are assembled from 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>B subunits. Indeed, our results demonstrated that Hsp47 positively regulates the surface expression of both 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>B subunits (Figure 7D). Therefore, it appears that Hsp47 has certain selectively for Cys-loop receptors.</p><p>These new results were included on pages 19-20: “In addition, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs are assembled from 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>B subunits into heteropentamers in HEK293T cells [76]. Clearly, overexpressing Hsp47 increased the surface expression of both the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>B subunits according to surface biotinylation assay as well as their total protein levels in HEK293T cells (Figure 7D). These results indicated that Hsp47 has a general role in promoting the surface presence of the heteropentameric Cys-loop receptors.</p><p>Furthermore, we tested the influence of Hsp47 on other ion channels that have different structural scaffolds compared to Cys-loop receptors, including tetrameric NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and hERG potassium channels. NMDA receptors, assembled from two obligatory GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 subunits, play a critical role in mediating synaptic development and plasticity in the central nervous system [77]. Overexpressing Hsp47 did not change or decreased the total or surface protein levels of WT GluN2A subunits (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A, lane 2 to lane 1) and those of misfolding-prone M705V GluN2A subunits [78] (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A, lane 4 to lane 3) in HEK293T cells, indicating that Hsp47 did not positively regulate NMDA receptor proteostasis. Moreover, hERG potassium channels regulate cardiac action potential repolarization in the heart, and loss of their function leads to type 2 long QT syndrome [49]. Knocking down Hsp47 did not change the protein levels of the mature (Figure 7—figure supplement 2B, top 155 kDa bands) and immature (Figure 7—figure supplement 2B, bottom 135 kDa bands) protein levels of WT hERG as well as trafficking-deficient hERG variants (N470D and T65P) in HEK293T cells, indicating that Hsp47 did not influence biogenesis of hERG channels. Furthermore, we determined the effect of Hsp47 on an ERAD substrate, L444P β-glucocerebrosidase, the most common disease-causing variant in neuropathic Gaucher diseases [79]. Knocking down Hsp47 did not change the total protein levels of folding-deficient L444P β-glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher patient-derived fibroblasts (Figure 7—figure supplement 2C), indicating that Hsp47 did not influence the biogenesis of an ERAD substrate in the ER lumen.</p><p>Therefore, our results indicated that Hsp47 had a general role in increasing the surface expression of heteropentameric Cys-loop receptors, including GABAA receptors, nAChRs, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs. Furthermore, Hsp47 had certain selectivity for Cys-loop receptors since Hsp47 did not enhance the biogenesis of other structurally diverse ion channels, such as NMDA receptors and hERG channels, or an ERAD substrate in the ER lumen, L444P β-glucocerebrosidase.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It wasn't clear to me how the BiP binding to the GABAA subunit described in Figure 1C was performed. Was this in the presence of nucleotide? How can one compare the relative binding affinities of BiP and HSP47 without considering the nucleotide-dependent binding affinity of BiP.

Since this manuscript focuses on characterizing Hsp47 for its role in the biogenesis of Cys-loop receptors, we removed the BiP MST binding data for future, more systematic study. Instead, in addition to showing the binding affinity of Hsp47 to α1(ERD) domain of GABAA receptors, we added the binding affinity of Hsp47 to β2(ERD) domain of GABAA receptors in Figure 1C.</p><p>On page 7, we stated, “we determined the binding affinity between Hsp47 and α1(ERD) or β2(ERD).

Therefore, Hsp47 binds to GABAA receptor subunits with high affinity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors convincingly demonstrate the importance of HSP47 in promoting the assembly of the GABAA receptors, but it isn't clear if HSP47 specifically is important for the assembly of a single interface or if all receptor interfaces require HSP47 for assembly. In other words, if HSP47 is depleted/overexpressed are specific assembly intermediates identified? It isn't clear from Figure 4C, although higher levels of HSP47 do appear to increase a band in the alpha1 blot (not observed in the beta2 blot) of ~120 kDa that could reflect a specific interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for pointing it out. Currently, we cannot conclude which assembly intermediates or receptor interfaces that Hsp47 acts on, which merits further investigations.</p><p>We added a discussion about this on page 21, “It is unclear whether Hsp47 targets certain subunit-subunit interfaces, such as α1-β2, α1-γ2, or β2-γ2 interfaces.

They also demonstrate similar enhanced folding/function for acetylcholine receptor assembly.

Authors propose that HSP47 preferentially binds the correctly folded conformation of GABA subunits.

Can authors provide more insight into the consequences and A332D on GABA, and how HSP47 is overcoming the mutation?</p></disp-quote><p>We added more discussions about how Hsp47 overexpression could promote the functional surface expression of GABAA receptor variants.</p><p>On page 24, we discussed, “Since we envisage that Hsp47 interacts with proteins in the folded states or late-folding states and stabilizes the assembly intermediates and assembled receptor complex, overexpressing Hsp47 can “pull” more mutant subunits into the folded/assembled receptors that can engage the trafficking machinery for transport to the plasma membrane. Consequently, the function of the mutant receptors would be restored after Hsp47 overexpression. The rescuing mechanism of Hsp47 is similar to that of pharmacological chaperones, which bind to folded/assembled mutant GABAA receptors to stabilize their conformation to enhance their surface transport [65,90]. Indeed, we showed that Hsp47 overexpression as well as application of pharmacological chaperones, such as Hispidulin and TP003, enhanced the functional surface expression of a variety of trafficking-deficient α1 variants (Figure 5D, 5G) [65]. Therefore, this strategy serves as a proof-of-principle case for promoting the multi-subunit assembly process to ameliorate diseases resulting from membrane protein folding/assembly deficiencies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
