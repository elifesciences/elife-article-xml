Uso1/p115 contains a globular-head-domain (GHD), a coiled-coil (CC) mediating dimerization/tethering, and a C-terminal region (CTR) interacting with golgins. Uso1/p115 is recruited to vesicles by RAB1. Genetic studies placed Uso1 paradoxically acting upstream of, or in conjunction with RAB1 (Sapperstein et al., 1996). We selected two missense mutations in <italic>uso1</italic> resulting in E6K and G540S in the GHD that rescued lethality of <italic>rab1</italic>-deficient <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>. The mutations are phenotypically additive, their combination suppressing the complete absence of RAB1, which emphasizes the key physiological role of the GHD. In living hyphae Uso1 recurs on puncta (60 s half-life) colocalizing partially with the Golgi markers RAB1, Sed5, and GeaA/Gea1/Gea2, and totally with the retrograde cargo receptor Rer1, consistent with Uso1 dwelling in a very early Golgi compartment from which ER residents reaching the Golgi recycle back to the ER. Localization of Uso1, but not of Uso1<sup>E6K/G540S</sup>, to puncta is abolished by compromising RAB1 function, indicating that E6K/G540S creates interactions bypassing RAB1. That Uso1 delocalization correlates with a decrease in the number of Gea1 cisternae supports that Uso1-and-Rer1-containing puncta are where the protein exerts its physiological role. In S-tag-coprecipitation experiments, Uso1 is an associate of the Sed5/Bos1/Bet1/Sec22 SNARE complex zippering vesicles with the Golgi, with Uso1<sup>E6K/G540S</sup> showing a stronger association. Using purified proteins, we show that Bos1 and Bet1 bind the Uso1 GHD directly. However, Bet1 is a strong E6K/G540S-independent binder, whereas Bos1 is weaker but becomes as strong as Bet1 when the GHD carries E6K/G540S. G540S alone markedly increases GHD binding to Bos1, whereas E6K causes a weaker effect, correlating with their phenotypic contributions. AlphaFold2 predicts that G540S increases the binding of the GHD to the Bos1 Habc domain. In contrast, E6K lies in an N-terminal, potentially alpha-helical, region that sensitive genetic tests indicate as required for full Uso1 function. Remarkably, this region is at the end of the GHD basket opposite to the end predicted to interact with Bos1. We show that, unlike dimeric full-length and CTR∆ Uso1 proteins, the GHD lacking the CC/CTR dimerization domain, whether originating from bacteria or <italic>Aspergillus</italic> extracts and irrespective of whether it carries or not E6K/G540S, would appear to be monomeric. With the finding that overexpression of E6K/G540S and wild-type GHD complement <italic>uso1∆</italic>, our data indicate that the GHD monomer is capable of providing, at least partially, the essential Uso1 functions, and that long-range tethering activity is dispensable. Rather, these findings strongly suggest that the essential role of Uso1 involves the regulation of SNAREs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic></kwd><kwd>tethering</kwd><kwd>SNAREs</kwd><kwd>RAB1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BES-2016-077440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bravo-Plaza</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI2018-093344-B100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peñalva</surname><given-names>Miguel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S2017/BMD-3691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peñalva</surname><given-names>Miguel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peñalva</surname><given-names>Miguel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004895</institution-id><institution>European Social Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peñalva</surname><given-names>Miguel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2021-124278OB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peñalva</surname><given-names>Miguel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Uso1 critically regulating traffic in the ER/Golgi interface is a coiled-coil protein traditionally regarded as a tether, but a forward genetic screen revealed that its essential role appears to involve its ability to interact with SNAREs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vesicular traffic at the ER/Golgi interface is the cornerstone of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barlowe and Miller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weigel et al., 2021</xref>). In current models, in which traffic across the Golgi is driven by cisternal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019</xref>), COPII vesicles generated at specialized domains of the ER fuse homotypically and heterotypically to form and feed the earliest Golgi cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rexach et al., 1994</xref>). As straightforward as this step might seem, it involves a sophisticated circuitry of regulation. Actual fusion is in part mediated by compartmental-specific sets of four-membered SNARE protein complexes (SNARE bundles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malsam and Söllner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pelham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>). Most SNARES are type II single TMD proteins, whose N-terminal cytosolic domain contains nearly all the polypeptide, except a few lumenal residues. Like any other transmembrane proteins, SNAREs are synthesized in the ER. This implies that they have to travel to compartments of the cell as distant as the plasma membrane in a conformation that precludes them from catalyzing what would be a calamitous fusion of non-cognate donor and acceptor compartments. Achieving the strictest specificity is particularly challenging in the ER-to-Golgi stage that, as the first step in the secretory pathway, represents an obligate point of transit for each and every transmembrane SNARE. Therefore, the only SNARES acting in this first step are the Qa Sed5, the Qb Bos1, the Qc Bet1, and the R-SNARE Sec22, which form the bundle mediating fusion of carriers that coalesce into cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNew et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Given the central role played by the secretory pathway in the physiology of every eukaryotic cell, it is unsurprising that this step involves regulatory factors which are essential for cell survival. One is the SM (<underline>S</underline>ec1, Munc-18) protein Sly1, which promotes SNARE bundle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracher and Weissenhorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng and Gallwitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>) Another is the TRAPPIII complex, which interacts with the external coat of COPII carriers and acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracher and Weissenhorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galindo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joiner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lord et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng and Gallwitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pinar and Peñalva, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riedel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>). This small GTPase is a key player that transiently recruits protein effectors from the cytosol to donor and acceptor membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Søgaard et al., 1994</xref>) and regulates SNARE assembly through an as yet undefined mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lupashin and Waters, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sapperstein et al., 1996</xref>). One RAB1 effector is a fungal protein denoted Uso1, whose highly conserved metazoan homolog is p115. These are homodimers with a globular N-terminal head and a long C-terminal coiled-coil region characteristic of tethering proteins, which bring donor and acceptor membranes into the distance at which v- and t-SNAREs can engage into the productive <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex that mediates membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakajima et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sapperstein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sapperstein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seog et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yamakawa et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Despite most Golgi tethers are non-essential, Uso1 is unique in that it is required for viability. <italic>uso1-1</italic>, an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> amber mutation truncating most, but not all the coiled-coil region is viable, yet further upstream truncation removing the complete coiled-coil is lethal, which was taken as evidence that tethering is the essential function of Uso1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seog et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, as the coiled-coil is predicted to mediate dimerization, it is broadly accepted that Uso1 is ‘just’ an essential homodimer that tethers vesicles to the acceptor membrane. However, genetic evidence stubbornly indicates that Uso1 plays additional functions related to SNAREs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sapperstein et al., 1996</xref> showed that SNAREs function downstream of Uso1. Notably, the view that Uso1 is a mere RAB1 effector was challenged by the observation that overexpressing Ypt1 (yeast RAB1) rescues the lethality of <italic>uso1∆</italic>, whereas the reciprocal is not true, indicating that Uso1 acts upstream of or in conjunction with RAB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sapperstein et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Our laboratory is interested in deciphering the domains of action of RAB GTPases in the genetic and cell biological model organism <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pinar and Peñalva, 2021</xref>). We have previously gained mechanistic insight into the activation of RAB11 by TRAPPII by exploiting a forward genetic screen for mutations bypassing, at the restrictive temperature, the essential role of the key TRAPPII subunit Trs120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pinar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pinar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pinar and Peñalva, 2020</xref>). In this type of screen, a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) mutation in the gene-of-interest is mutagenized and strains bypassing lethality at the restrictive temperature are identified and characterized molecularly. A well-characterized, conditionally lethal <italic>rab1</italic> mutation is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinar et al., 2013</xref>), enabling us to investigate pathways collaborating with RAB1 in anterograde traffic. We isolated two <italic>uso1</italic> missense mutations causing substitutions in the GHD. When combined together, these rescued the lethality resulting from <italic>rab1∆</italic> and promoted the localization of the protein to early Golgi cisternae by increasing Uso1 binding to the cytosolic region of the Qa SNARE Bos1. Importantly, we show that endogenous expression of a protein consisting solely of the double mutant GHD, or overexpression of double mutant or wild-type GHD, rescues the lethality resulting from <italic>uso1∆</italic>, even though data strongly suggest that the GHD is monomeric. Our results show that one essential role of RAB1 is recruiting Uso1 to membranes, and strongly suggest that the essential role of Uso1 is not tethering membranes, but rather regulating the formation of the cognate SNARE bundle, almost certainly placing Uso1 as a component of the SNARE fusion machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Missense mutations in <italic>uso1</italic> rescue the lethality resulting from <italic>rab1</italic>∆</title><p><italic>rab1<sup>A136D</sup></italic> (hereby <italic>rab1<sup>ts</sup></italic>) mutants do not grow at 37 °C.

Thus, prompted by co-association experiments, we predicted that Uso1 would bind directly to Bet1, Bos1, and perhaps other SNAREs implicated in the biogenesis of the early Golgi. We anticipated that binding to Bet1 and Bos1 would be insufficient to recruit Uso1 to membranes in the absence of RAB1, but that once reinforced by E6K/G540S, Uso1 would not require RAB1 for its recruitment. To test this possibility, we searched for direct and E6K/G540S-enhanced interactions between the GHD and SNAREs with pull-down assays carried out with purified SNARE-GST fusion proteins as baits and Uso1-His6 constructs as preys. In all cases, the GST fusion proteins included the whole cytoplasmic regions of the SNAREs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the AlphaFold2 predicted structure of the tetra-helical SNARE bundle.</p><p>Full-length Uso1 bound, weakly, to the Sec22 R-SNARE and to the Qb Bos1, and very efficiently [with <italic>circa</italic> 70% of the prey being pulled down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>)] to the Qc Bet1. In contrast, Uso1 did not bind the Qa syntaxins tested, Sed5 and Sso1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). The absence of interaction between Sed5 and Uso1, be it the wild-type or the E6K/G540S mutant version, strongly indicated that the association detected with S-tag pull-downs between Uso1 and Sed5 is bridged by other protein(s). This absence of binding cannot be attributed to Sed5-GST being incompetent for binding because Sed5-GST was competent in pulling-down highly efficiently its cognate SM protein Sly1, an interaction that did not occur with Sso1-GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Notably, the presence of the E6K/G540S double substitution in Uso1 (indicated with ** for simplicity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) increased five times the amount of protein retained by the Qb Bos1 bait, whereas interaction with Bet1 did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>). The double substitution in Uso1 did not promote interaction with Sed5 either. Thus, under normal circumstances, Uso1 is able to bind directly to three of the four SNAREs in the ER/Golgi interface, with binding to Bet1 being the strongest. The double E6K/G540S substitution increases binding to Bos1 very markedly and specifically, bringing it up to the levels of Bet1 without affecting, for example, binding to Bet1 or Sec22. Consistently, the GHD is sufficient to mediate interaction with Bet1 and Bos1, as well as, if E6K G540S-substituted, the increased binding of Bos1 to Uso1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D and E</xref>). The GHD did not interact with Sec22, suggesting either that this R-SNARE is recruited by other parts of the protein or that binding is dimerization dependent.</p><p>Besides the Sed5/Bos1/Bet1/Sec22 combination, across cisternal maturation, Sed5 forms SNARE bundles in Golgi compartments located downstream of Uso1 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pelham, 1999</xref>). In fungi, membrane fusion in the medial Golgi involves the Sed5 partners Gos1 (Qb) and Sft1 (Qc) substituting for Bos1 and Bet1, respectively, but neither Gos1 nor Sft1 bound wild-type or E6K/G540 Uso1 GHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>), demonstrating that interaction of Uso1 with Bos1 and Bet1 is highly specific. Therefore, it seems fair to conclude that increased binding for a SNARE receptor underlies the mechanism by which mutant Uso1 bypasses the need for RAB1 in the ER/Golgi interface.</p><p>Lastly, we tested the contribution of each substitution individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11, G and H</xref>). Both E6K and G540S increased GHD binding to Bos1 markedly, relative to wild-type, but E6K was threefold less efficient in our pull-down assay, consisting with the respective ability to rescue <italic>rab1</italic> deficiency, and thus reinforcing the idea that increased Uso1-SNARE binding underlies the mechanism of suppression. However, we did not detect additivity in our pull-down assay, which is possibly attributable to the fact that Bos1-GST beads already pulls-down a substantial amount of the single G540S mutant. In any case, these data establish that the mechanism of suppression by E6K is unlikely to involve a role of the Glu6Lys-containing amphipathic alpha-helix in binding membranes.</p><p>In summary, Uso1 is an essential protein acting in the ER/Golgi interface, and we report here several important findings. We show that (i) the Golgi GTPase RAB1, which is essential for viability, becomes dispensable if there is an alternative method to recruit Uso1 to Golgi membranes; (ii) the coiled-coil region of Uso1 is dispensable to sustain viability, implying that the tethering role of the protein is not essential either, consistent with the non-essential roles of other Golgin tethers; (iii) the Uso1 GHD is essential for viability; (iv) the Uso1 GHD monomer, if present at suitably high levels, is sufficient to maintain viability; (v) that the Uso1 GHD is a direct and specific binder of the Qb SNARE Bos1, and a strong binder of the Qc Bet1; (vi) the mutations bypassing the need for RAB1 increase the affinity of the GHD for Bos1, indicating that <italic>rab1∆</italic> viability rescue by E6K/G540S Uso1 occurs because SNARE anchoring provides an alternative mode of recruitment to Golgi membranes to that provided physiologically by RAB1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Interpretation of the mutations guided by AlphaFold2 predictions</title><p>To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which E6K and G540S increase the affinity of the Uso1 GHD for Bos1 we used AlphaFold2 to model the Uso1<sup>GHD</sup> domain alone, or together with each of the individual SNAREs, with both Bos1 and Bet1 simultaneously, and with RAB1.</p><p>Consistent with biochemical data, in the predicted model Bet1 and Bos1 interact with a medial and a C-terminal region, respectively, of Uso1<sup>GHD</sup>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">2</xref>). Bet1 docks against a region of the GHD that is not affected by the mutations. In contrast, Gly540 and its environs dock against the N-terminal, triple α-helical Habc domain of Bos1. AlphaFold2 predicts that Uso1<sup>GHD</sup> interacts with Bos1 through a surface composed of the N-terminal part of the first Bos1 Habc α-helix and the loop between α-helices 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A and B</xref>). The binding surface in Uso1<sup>GHD</sup> predictably involves the second α-helices of the ARM10 and ARM11 repeats, (α-helices 26 and 29), and the loop connecting the first two α-helices of ARM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). In AlphaFold2 models, Uso1 Gly540 (wild-type) is located at the beginning of Uso1<sup>GHD</sup>α-helix 29, at the heart of the interaction surface, contributing to the Uso1-Bos1 interaction by coordinating the amide group of the Uso1 backbone with the Bos1 Glu58 carboxylate to create a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). According to the most confident prediction, Gly540Ser results in the hydroxymethyl side chain protruding into a small pocket rimmed by the side chains of Bos1 Leu59 and Ile60, such that the Uso1 Ser540 hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonds the amide group of Bos1 Glu58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). Besides creating a new hydrogen bond, PISA calculations indicate that Gly540Ser increases the surface of interaction ~10 Å<sup>2</sup>, from ~824 Å<sup>2</sup> to ~831 Å<sup>2</sup>. While this increase is not translated in a commensurate decrease in the solvation-free energy (Δ<sup>i</sup>G), which in fact it is slightly higher in the mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), this estimation does not consider the effect of satisfied hydrogen bonds and salt bridges across the mutant’s interface. Predicted rearrangements induced by Gly540Ser involved the formation of three additional hydrogen bonds, besides that between Ser540 and Glu58. Assuming that each of the four-newly formed hydrogen bonds contributes approximately 0.5 kcal per mole to the free energy and that each of the four salt bridges in each model contributes approximately 0.3 kcal/mol, a total binding energy of –8.4 kcal/mol, and –9.6 kcal/mol was estimated for wild type and G540S Uso1 binding to Bos1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>AlphaFold2 models provide insight into the mechanisms of suppression by E6K and G540S.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

However, all structural models depicting Bet1 interacting with Uso1<sup>GHD</sup> (e.g. in the context of the whole SNARE complex, Bet1 alone, or the isolated Bet1 N-terminal) consistently show a region where the pLDDT is higher. This region is predicted to form a kink in this N-terminal part of Bet1 that protrudes into the surface created by the α-helices 13 and 16 of Uso1 ARM4 and ARM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Surface representations show that this section of the Bet1 polypeptide covers ~1300 Å<sup>2</sup> of the GHD, docking against the same side of the boomerang-shaped solenoid as Bos1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which is consistent with the orientation that these SNAREs should take during the formation of the SNARE pin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which Glu6Lys contributes to increasing the recruitment of Uso1 to the Golgi is unclear. This glutamate is located in a region with a low pLDDT score, which shows different conformations depending on the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>, boxed), indicating that it is flexible. Models concur in predicting the formation of a potentially amphipathic N-terminal α-helix containing Glu6, whose substitution by Lys (as in E6K) reinforces the positive charge of the polar face. However, the fact that E6K increases the binding of the GHD to Bos1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G and H</xref>) strongly argues against the possibility that E6K acts by increasing the recruitment of this amphipathic helix to membranes. Thus, an important question was whether this region represents a functional element that is required for the full function of Uso1. The N-terminal extension of <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> Uso1 is 13 amino acids long. Its sequence is highly conserved among 196 Uso1 homologs of members of the class Eurotiomycetes, with several positions including GLU6 being invariant —In fact, sequence conservation across Eurotiomycetes in this region is even higher than in the first armadillo repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>). This sequence similarity suggests that this extension plays a physiological role. Paradoxically, this conservation is lost in other classes of Ascomycota (including Saccharomycetes) and Basidiomycota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B and C</xref>). However, circumstantial evidence supporting that this region contains a previously unnoticed and potentially functional secondary structure element is provided by AlphaFold, which predicts the presence of an N-terminal alpha-helix in equivalent position of Uso1 proteins from model organisms such as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1</xref>), buttressing the idea that this structural element plays a physiological role.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>The N-terminal region of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> Uso1 containing Glu6 is required for full function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence comparison of N-terminal regions up to the second helix of the first armadillo repeat including 196 Uso1 proteins of Eurotiomycetes available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app">https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app</ext-link> (<bold>B</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of the Fungi with the indication of species that were used for the alignment in panel (<bold>C</bold>).

Equipped with wild-type and (∆1–13) single-copy transgenes integrated at the <italic>inuA</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">Figure 13—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we first demonstrated that the (∆1–13) N-terminal deletion impaired complementation of a deletion allele of <italic>uso1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13D</xref>).

Notably, Uso1(E6K) was an even stronger suppressor than the wild-type, permitting growth at 26°C and 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14D</xref>, lane 5 and 6). Thus, according to these tests, the N-terminal deletion allele is a weak hypomorph, whereas the E6K-substituted allele is a weak hypermorph.</p><p>We additionally modeled RAB1 binding to the GHD in the absence and presence of Uso1 binders Bos1 and Bet1. AlphaFold2 predicts that the GHD interacts with RAB1 through a binding surface formed by the ARM3-5. repeats. On the other hand, the interactive region of RAB1 conforms to canons, as Uso1 α-helices 8 and 9 (ARM3) is predicted to interact with the Switch II region while α-helices 11 (ARM-4) and 14 (ARM-5) interact with the (Switch I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Importantly, the model indicates that within the Uso1-GHD jai alai basket, RAB1 binds to the opposite (convex) side of the Bet1 interacting area at the concave side, and away from the C-terminal helix where the Bos1 Habc domain predictably binds, which would allow Uso1 to bind these three interactors simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2C</xref>) (AlphaFold structures colored by confidence are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s3">Figure 12—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, the predicted models supported a highly suggestive but as yet speculative implication: Uso1-RAB1 would be in an orientation that facilitates the docking of RAB1-loaded ER-derived vesicles with an acceptor membrane where SNARE zippering occurs (see discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>RAB1 regulates transport at the ER/Golgi interface. Using an unbiased forward genetic screen to identify subordinated genes accounting for its essential role, we isolated two extragenic mutations resulting in single-residue substitutions in the RAB1 effector Uso1, usually regarded as a tether. The single-residue substitutions lie at opposite ends of the jai alai basket-shaped GHD; both are individually able to rescue the viability of <italic>rab1∆</italic> strains at 30 °C and, when combined, even at 42 °C.</p><p>Subcellular localization experiments hinted at the mechanism by which the double mutation rescues <italic>rab1</italic>∆ lethality. Uso1 plays its physiological role in an early Golgi compartment, characterized by containing the Golgi-ER receptor Rer1. Uso1 delocalizes to the cytosol in a RAB1-deficient background. Under normal circumstances, the Uso1 CTR acts in concert with RAB1 to recruit the protein to the Golgi. Genetic evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) showed that this contribution requires the Golgi-localized tether composed of the membrane anchor Grh1 and its associated golgin BUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behnia et al., 2007</xref>), homologs of human GRASP65 and GM130, respectively. In the absence of RAB1, engagement of the CTR with BUG1 is insufficient to stabilize wild-type Uso1 on membranes. However, the double E6K/G540S restores Uso1 to Golgi structures, suggesting that mutant Uso1 GHD had gained an affinity for another element.</p><p>Inspired by cross-linking studies that identified Sed5, membrin (Bos1) and mBet1 as weak p115 interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2000</xref>), directed S-tag co-precipitation analysis of cell extracts showed that E6K/G540S increases association of Uso1 with four SNAREs, Sed5, Bos1, Bet1, and Sec22, mediating fusion events at the ER/Golgi interface, and with the SNARE regulator Sec18, indicating that Uso1 is a component of the SNARE fusion machinery. Pull-down assays using purified proteins showed that wild-type Uso1 binds directly to Bet1, Bos1 (weakly), and Sec22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The RAB1 suppressor mutations markedly increase the binding of Uso1 to Bos1, and we note that the magnitude of this increase correlates strictly with the degree of <italic>rab1∆</italic> suppression. For example, E6K binds better than wild-type to Bos1, and G540S binds even better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The latter is a better suppressor than the former; Uso1 overexpression suppresses weakly <italic>rab1</italic>∆, whereas an analogous construct carrying E6K suppresses more strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). While the most parsimonious interpretation of our data is that Uso1 mutants suppress the loss of RAB1 by binding more tightly to SNAREs, we acknowledge that this conclusion is not formally established, as we cannot rule out that the mutations result in additional changes in the Uso1/RAB1/SNARE module that represent the primary cause for suppression.</p><p>The Uso1/p115 family has been previously implicated in the regulation of SNARE complexes by ‘catalyzing’ the formation of the SNARE bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shorter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). These models rely on the identification of a region in the CCD that resembles a SNARE domain and that is capable of pairing with actual SNAREs to form intermediates that would precede the formation of the tetra-helical complex. These models did not reveal a role of the GHD, and indeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shorter et al., 2002</xref>) discuss that ‘intriguingly, the GHD of p115 seems to play no direct role... in the assembly of the SNAREpin.’ Our results add another layer of complexity by showing that the GHD plays a positive role in an as yet undefined manner in the machinery that mediates the fusion of ER-derived vesicles with the Golgi, such that increased binding of the GHD to SNAREs compensates for even the complete loss of RAB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>). We notice, however, that our conclusions do not discard the possibility that the GHD and the CCD cooperate in the assembly of the SNARE bundle.</p><p>The ability of Uso1 to mediate long-distance tethering of vesicles was initially considered the essential role of this protein. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>uso1-1</italic> truncates the protein after residue 950, leaving approximately one-third of the CCD. These 950 residues are sufficient to retain some function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seog et al., 1994</xref>). Truncation further upstream results in a complete loss-of-function, which was taken as evidence that the coiled-coil domain is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seog et al., 1994</xref>). However, this work did not address whether severe truncation of the protein affected stability. Our data show that levels of a protein deleted for the CCD are markedly reduced, and that elevating levels by forced expression, or introducing E6K/G540S in the truncated gene by allele replacement substantially rescues the Uso1 function. These data support our contention that the essential function of Uso1 involves SNARE-mediated fusion, rather than long-distance tethering.</p><p>Genetic interactions between Uso1/p115, RAB1, and SNAREs have been studied in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dascher et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sapperstein et al., 1996</xref>). These studies were based on rescuing lethality resulting from a deficit of Uso1 or RAB1/Ypt1. Suppressors can be classified into two classes. Class I are alleles overexpressing SNAREs, which suppress <italic>Uso1</italic> and <italic>RAB1</italic> hypomorphic alleles and, weakly, <italic>uso1∆</italic> and <italic>rab1∆</italic>; notably the two SNAREs suppressing <italic>uso1∆</italic> are Sec22 and Bet1, i.e., those bound by <italic>Aspergillus w</italic>ild-type Uso1; Class II, involving a mutant protein expressed at normal levels, had only one representative, <italic>SLY1-20</italic>, a modification-of-function allele in the gene encoding the ER/Golgi SM protein that rescues viability of <italic>rab1∆. SLY1-20</italic> promotes the open conformation of Sed5, thereby enhancing the formation of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Demircioglu et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Aspergillus</italic> E6K/G540S Uso1 is the second member of this class, substantially rescuing <italic>rab1∆</italic> at physiological levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>What regions of Uso1 are required for its function? We exploited the modification-of-function associated with E6K/G540S to address this question: Analytical ultracentrifugation studies on the oligomerization status of the different domains of the protein expressed and purified from bacteria strongly indicated that the ability of Uso1 to dimerize resides in the CCD, and that the GHD is monomeric. While results with bacterially-expressed proteins should be interpreted cautiously, we note that the GHD in extracts of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> hyphae also behaves as a monomer in gel filtration experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our data show that a GHD polypeptide carrying E6K/G540S is sufficient to support viability when expressed as the only source of Uso1, and that it appears to do so as a monomer. These conclusions shift the central role in the Uso1 function attributed to the CCD towards the globular domain, or in mechanistic terms from tethering to SNARE regulation.</p><p>AlphaFold2 modeling of the regions of the interaction of the GHD with Bos1 and Bet1 predicted that, of the two Uso1 residue substitutions, only Gly540Ser maps to the region mediating the interaction with Bos1 whereas, as indicated by GST pull-downs, neither affected the Bet1-interacting region, which is predicted to involve a large surface, consistent with its strong ‘constitutive’ binding and its likely role as the major physiological receptor for Uso1. In the case of substitutions affecting Bos1 binding, Gly540 substitution by Ser in the GHD results in the formation of four additional hydrogen bonds, of which one involves the side-chain of Ser540 and the remaining three result from rearrangements in the pocket in which this residue is inserted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As for the Glu6Lys substitution, pull-down experiments clearly show that it increases the avidity of the GHD for Bos1, yet it lies at the opposite end of the GHD where the SNARE is predicted to bind. AlphaFold models Glu6 in the charged surface of an amphipathic alpha helix located in the 13-residue N-terminal extension that precedes the first armadillo repeat. Sequence conservation within this extension is restricted to the closest fungal relatives. However, genetic evidence strongly indicates that it is required for the full function of Uso1, and AlphaFold predicts that this region contains a small alpha-helix in organisms as distant as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> and <italic>Schyzosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. How this substitution affects Uso1-Bos1 binding at a distance will require further investigation. At present, the interpretation, based on minor changes in the spatial arrangement of armadillo helices suggested by the predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>), that Glu6Lys might affect Bos1 binding at a distance remains highly speculative.</p><p>In summary, our work establishes that the essential role of Uso1 resides not in its CCD domain tethering donor and acceptor membranes, but in the GHD. When expressed at sufficient levels, or when its activity is boosted by E6K/G540S, the GHD is capable of substantially complementing <italic>uso1</italic>∆, which we take as definitive evidence that the tethering function of Uso1 is not required for the protein to play its essential function. Therefore, our conclusions add another layer of evidence supporting the view that Uso1 critically cooperates with SNAREs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>While the molecular details of this mechanism will be addressed in the future, it is tempting to speculate that the GHD contributes, with Sly1, to orientate SNAREs to form a productive bundle, acting as chaperones, similarly to the HOPS SM component Vps33, which appears to align SNAREs in a pre-zippering stage, facilitating their assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang and Hughson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang and Yang, 2020</xref>). Sec39, a subunit of the Dsl1 tethering complex, like the GHD an α-solenoid, binds the Qc-SNARE Ufe1, whereas Tip20, the other ‘leg’ of Dsl1, binds the Habc domain of the Qb SNARE Sec20. The authors hypothesize that Dsl1 arranges the Qb and Qc in an open conformation, presenting them to Sly1 already associated with syntaxin Ufe1 and R-SNARE Sec22, thus acting as a chaperone of the whole trans-SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Travis et al., 2020</xref>). The Uso1 GHD could behave in a similar manner to Dsl1 facilitating the interplay between paired Bos1-Bet1 with the Sed5-Sec22-Sly1 cluster.</p><p>A second, also speculative interpretation is that tethering occurs in two steps, with golgins acting at long distances, approximating vesicles to the vicinity of SNAREs. Then SNAREs would engage RAB1–Uso1 to serve as short-range tether preceding the zippering up of membranes. The &gt;700 Å-long Uso1 CCD would cooperate with Bug1 in the first step, whereas the Uso1 GHD would cooperate with RAB1 and Bet1/Bos1/Sec22 in the second, exploiting the fact that GHD binders use surfaces located at opposite sides of the α-solenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>). Such arrangement implies that RAB1 C-terminal isoprenoids inserted into the donor vesicle membrane would be <italic>circa</italic> 220 Å apart from the C-termini of the SNAREs inserted in the acceptor membrane. Two-step tethering might impose one additional level of specificity, preventing unproductive fusion events mediated by other SNARES circulating through the ER/interface and directing, by way of Uso1 interactions, incoming vesicles to fusion-competent areas enriched in target SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bentley et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Aspergillus</italic> techniques</title><p>Standard <italic>A. nidulans</italic> media were used for growth tests, strain maintenance, and conidiospore harvesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cove, 1966</xref>).

This homogenization step was repeated two times before clarifying the extract by centrifugation at 4 °C and 15,000 × <italic>g</italic> in a microcentrifuge. Total protein concentration of the extracts was determined by Bradford. Bovine Serum-Albumin (BSA) was then added as a blocking agent to the cell extract (final concentration 1% (w/v)). Binding reactions were carried out in 0.8 ml Pierce centrifuge columns (#89869, ThermoFisher): 9 mg of protein were mixed with 20 µL of S-protein Agarose beads (#69704, Novagen), that had been previously washed in extraction buffer with 1% (w/v) BSA. This buffer was also added to complete the final reaction volume of 0.6 ml. The mix was incubated for 3 hr at 4 °C in a rotating wheel. Columns were then opened at the bottom and gently centrifuged to remove the supernatant and collect the protein-bound beads. These were resuspended in the extraction buffer without inhibitors and incubated in rotation for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by two more washing steps in the extraction buffer without detergent and inhibitors. To elute proteins bound to the beads, 30 µl of Laemmli loading buffer [62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.0), 6 M urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol] were added and the columns incubated at 90 °C for 2 min. The columns were centrifuged to collect the eluate, of which a 40% of the final volume was resolved in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose for α-HA (#3F10, Roche) western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Purification of Uso1 constructs tagged with His6x</title><p>Full-length His6-tagged Uso1, Uso1ΔCTR, Uso1 GTD, and Uso1 CCD constructs, wild-type and mutant versions, were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET21b-His6 derivatives and pRIL.

DLS autocorrelation functions, an average of at least 18 replicates, were collected with Dynamics V6 software. Analysis evidenced in most cases the presence of two diffusing species, one with faster diffusion corresponding to a discrete major species and a second with substantially slower diffusion, corresponding to higher order species, with a minor contribution to the whole population within the sample. Exceptions were the globular domain GHD that appeared as a single species, and the coiled-coil construct with a larger contribution of the higher-order species. Dynamics software was also employed to export the data as text files for parallel analysis using user-written scripts and functions in MATLAB (Version 7.10, MathWorks, Natick, MA). A double exponential decay model was fit to the data <italic>via</italic> nonlinear least squares, using as starting values the translational diffusion coefficients and relative amounts of the two different species, using as starting values those from the regularization analysis and their masses (those of the discrete species as estimated by the Svedberg equation).

vesicle tethering at the ER-Golgi interface. By investigating a Uso1 mutant that allows Aspergillus cells to survive in the absence of Rab1, the authors conclude that the essential role of Uso1 is not actually tethering, but rather SNARE complex assembly mediated by the globular head domain. This convincing analysis significantly advances our understanding of Uso1 and also prompts a reevaluation of long-standing assumptions about coiled-coil proteins involved in vesicular transport.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85079.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Glick</surname><given-names>Benjamin S</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024mw5h28</institution-id><institution>The University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Glick</surname><given-names>Benjamin S</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024mw5h28</institution-id><institution>The University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zanetti</surname><given-names>Giulia</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mb95055</institution-id><institution>Birkbeck, University of London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.30.518472">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.30.518472v1?rss=1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin S Glick (Reviewer #1); Giulia Zanetti (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this study is well executed and that it represents a significant advance. The text does not express it this way, but a reasonable interpretation is that for the ER-Golgi SNARE complex, Uso1 plays a role analogous to those of the multi-subunit tethers that promote the assembly of other SNARE complexes. If the authors agree, perhaps this point could be emphasized.</p><p>The reviewers have a number of concerns and recommendations. Among the suggestions are simple experiments, improvements to the presentation, and more cautious interpretations of some of the modeling and experimental data.</p><p>Rather than stipulating which revisions are essential, please go through the reviews carefully and either address each point or explain in a cover letter why that aspect of the manuscript should remain unchanged. Issues the reviewers considered important included:</p><p>1) The Coy1/Rud3 section adds little and is distracting.</p><p>2) The novelty of the conclusions should be explained more clearly in light of previous evidence that Rab1 and Uso1 can be bypassed by enhancing SNARE assembly.</p><p>3) The evidence that the globular head domain is a monomer in vivo is not definitive, so this conclusion should be tempered.</p><p>4) Modeling the coiled coil is not beneficial and may be misleading.</p><p>5) Evidence should be provided that Golgi structures are normal in rab1-ts cells until restored by Uso1 E6K/G540S.</p><p>We look forward to seeing a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In line 108: I'm not sure it's accurate to state that &quot;most Golgi tethers are functionally redundant.&quot; Most of them are nonessential, but each one probably has a unique role.</p><p>2. Does &quot;CCD&quot; stand for a coiled-coil domain? If so, it's incorrect to write &quot;CCD domain&quot; (e.g., line 216).</p><p>3. The analysis of Coy1 and Rud3 is a digression that does not seem to add to the story. This section disrupts the flow of the narrative and could be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>Line 178: remove: 'uncoated&quot;. This is not what the cited paper claims and other work (e.g. Ferro-Novik lab) showed uncoating happens after uso1 is recruited, at least in fungi.</p><p>Figure 2: showing a domain diagram would be helpful (like that in Figure 3), but with the correct colours.</p><p>Figure 2: I don't see the point in modelling the coiled-coil. It suggests a particular overall architecture and positioning of the various segments that have similar chances of being right as well as wrong. Showing the model of the coiled-coil region does not add anything to the story and might just be misleading. I'd be more comfortable with models made with the N-terminal and GDH domains only. The fact that the C-term is forming coiled coils can be shown diagrammatically without proposing an atomic model.</p><p>Section: &quot;coiled-coil mediated dimerization of Uso1: the globular head is monomeric&quot;:</p><p>The authors suggest a conformational switch in Uso1 that is mediated by the positive head interacting with the negative tail, but +ve charges on the head domain are not shown/mentioned.</p><p>Also, the potential role of his tag (which is not cleaved in these experiments) is not discussed. The authors discount the possibility that Uso1 adopts a closed conformation that is disrupted by the mutations, but the His tag could very well be inhibiting 'closure' as it would imply proximity of positive with positive regions. It cannot be excluded that this is the reason why they don't see changes unless the experiment is done after his-tag cleavage.</p><p>In general, I think experiments around Figure 3 are useful for checking monomer versus dimer conformation but the interpretation in terms of conformational change is less clear. As I don't think it is a crucial argument to their story it would probably strengthen the paper to remove reference to conformational changes.</p><p>Figure 3 would benefit from a schematic diagram in each panel rather than the current top panel.</p><p>Line 339-341: &quot; in view of this…&quot;. I actually don't see why the data discussed indicates that Uso1 puncta originate downstream of COPII. Either clarify or remove.</p><p>Line 346: likewise, the data discussed above does not indicate Uso1 is on a membrane with Golgi identity. This is established later in the paper, so it isn't wrong, but the logical flow is poor.</p><p>Section: &quot;the globular head domain of Uso1 carrying the double E6K/G540S substitution supports cell viability&quot;</p><p>Regarding the absence of dimerization of GDH domain: the data is convincing and valid, but does not allow us to definitely conclude that GDH is a monomer in situ. It could be dimerising transiently/weekly, not allowing detection in vitro. In fact, alphafold seems to suggest a dimerization interface with high confidence.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, the statements that dimerization is not happening/not needed in vivo should be toned down as it might still occur at the site of GDH binding to vesicles.</p><p>Figure 9: It is surprising that overexpressed WT Uso1 supports viability more than the mutant. The authors suggest it is due to the toxicity of mutants due to high expression and tight binding. But if this was the case, why would the same effect not be seen in the Uso+ background?</p><p>Section: &quot;Golgi SNAREs bind directly to the Uso1 GHD; effects of Uso1 E6K/G540S&quot;</p><p>The authors nicely show that G540 is at the interface between Uso1 and Bos1, providing a nice complementation between alphafold2 models and their experimental results. They also show how the G540S mutant affects the interface. It would nicely complete the analysis if the models obtained with WT and G504S mutants could be run through the PISA PDB server to calculate binding energies and confirm the tighter binding predicted for the mutant.</p><p>Figure 12: the alphafold2 structures coloured by confidence seem to be missing for the Uso1-Bos1 complexes. They should be added as they are the basis for a main conclusion.</p><p>The colour code in figures is poorly chosen: the same proteins, especially the main focus of the paper should be depicted with a consistent colour throughout. Even when not possible, at least self-consistency within the same figure should be obtained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions to strengthen:</p><p>1. Figure 7 shows that expression of GFP-tagged Uso1 E6K/G540S restores localization of Uso1 to Golgi punctate structures in rab1ts cells. But it was not clear if the Golgi punctate structures are normal in rab1ts cells. Or are Golgi structures dispersed in rab1ts cells until restored by Uso1 E6K/G540S? Imaging a Golgi marker (e.g. Sed5) in rab1ts cells would strengthen the proposal that the E6K/G540S mutations increase Uso1 localization to normal Golgi structures in rab1ts cells.</p><p>2. On Page 19, regarding AlphaFold predictions, it is stated that &quot;Lys (as in E6K) reinforces the positive charge of this a-helix, which would be inserted into the vesicle membrane, potentially contributing to Uso1 recruitment to COPII vesicles.&quot; This statement would be strengthened if it could be shown that the single E6K mutant displays increased levels of membrane association compared to the wild-type protein. Presumably, this association would be SNARE protein independent.</p><p>3. Based on the AlphaFold model in Figure 12, can it be demonstrated that the single G540S mutant is sufficient for increased binding to Bos1-GST? Similarly, do mutations in specific residues of Bos1 and Bet1 that are predicted to interact with surface residues of Uso1 GHD decrease binding? This could strengthen the proposed molecular model.</p><p>4. It would be helpful to explain why the Bet1-GST protein used in these studies deletes the SNARE motif while the other SNARE-GST proteins include their full cytoplasmic domains and SNARE motif.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85079.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have a number of concerns and recommendations.

As the reviewer points out, sedimentation velocity experiments are very useful for the determination of the association states of species. But sedimentation velocity data also disclose conformational changes, as they contain information about the shape of particles (Lebowitz 2002). The <italic>s</italic>-value is determined, among other molecular parameters as defined by the Svedberg equation (Svedberg, 1940), by the sedimentation frictional coefficient of the species, which informs about the shape of a molecule. For a given mass, a globular molecule – close to a compact sphere – is the fastest possible sedimenting species (i.e. sediments with an <italic>s</italic> close to the maximum), because it has the minimum surface area in contact with the solvent and, hence, the frictional coefficient is the minimum (Lebowitz 2002). In other words, for a given mass, a particle with an extended shape, because of the larger frictional coefficient, sediments slower than a globular particle. Examples of conformational changes characterized by AUC can be found in (Schuck 2001, Matte 2012, Brautigam 2020). Our statement that the double mutation in full-length Uso1 does not induce large conformational changes (lines 259 …) perfectly holds, as they have virtually the same mass and the same <italic>s</italic>-value. In the case of the comparisons of GHD (3.7S, 70 kDa) with CCD (2.7S, 100 kDa; lines 268-269) and with full length Uso1 (4.8S, 250 kDa; lines 271-276), the <italic>s</italic>-values are, in all likelihood, related with an asymmetry of the last two, which for the complete Uso1 has been demonstrated documented by EM. We have slightly rephrased the statement in line 284 to tone down the message.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Brautigam et al. 2020.

Please, also note that on figure 9B we show that full-length Uso1 shows the same elution profile in a gel filtration column irrespective of whether the protein is C-terminally tagged with His6 or HA3,</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 would benefit from a schematic diagram in each panel rather than the current top panel.</p></disp-quote><p>Schematic diagrams have been introduced as suggested by the referee.</p><p>Puncta originate downstream of COPII, removed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 339-341: “ in view of this…”.

It could be dimerising transiently/weekly, not allowing detection in vitro. In fact, alphafold seems to suggest a dimerization interface with high confidence.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, the statements that dimerization is not happening/not needed in vivo should be toned down as it might still occur at the site of GDH binding to vesicles.</p><p>Figure 9: It is surprising that overexpressed WT Uso1 supports viability more than the mutant. The authors suggest it is due to the toxicity of mutants due to high expression and tight binding.

They also show how the G540S mutant affects the interface. It would nicely complete the analysis if the models obtained with WT and G504S mutants could be run through the PISA PDB server to calculate binding energies and confirm the tighter binding predicted for the mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>The globular head is monomeric? Our data indicate that the GHD is a monomer whether extracted from bacteria or from Aspergillus. The referee argues that dimerization could occur in situ. It is difficult to argue against that, but we note that the coiled-coil has been completely removed from our construct. Moreover, figure 3-supplemental figure 1 shows that the GHD is monomeric at concentrations up to 5 µM, which appears incompatible with the presence of an efficient dimerization surface. Nevertheless, to avoid the concerns of the referee, we have toned down this point across the whole manuscript.</p><p>Overexpression and differences in toxicity: to be honest we do not have a straightforward explanation and we prefer not to speculate to avoid statements that might draw the readers' attention away from important points of the manuscript. Given the complexity of these macromolecular machines, the referee will surely appreciate that understanding this paradox might be a project by itself.</p><p>PISA analysis: as the reviewer suggests, a PISA analysis was run and mentioned in the former version of the manuscript. Under &quot;mechanistic insights… &quot; we provided some of the data pointing out the increment in surface of interaction resulting from G540S. We have now expanded information by adding a summary of the results as a new supplemental table 1. As already noted before, there is a discrete increment in the surface area from 824.5Å2 in the model for the wild-type complex to 833.1Å2 for the mutant. The change of G540 to S creates four new hydrogen bonds. Roughly, each hydrogen bond contributes about 0.5 kcal/mol into the free energy, which, combined with the ~0.3 kcal/mol of the four salt bridges on each of the models, makes an approximately total binding energy of -8.4 kcal/mol for the wild type complex and -9.6 kcal/mol for the mutant one (second complete paragraph under interpretation of the mutant, p 19-20)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 12: the alphafold2 structures coloured by confidence seem to be missing for the Uso1-Bos1 complexes.

Figure 7 shows that expression of GFP-tagged Uso1 E6K/G540S restores localization of Uso1 to Golgi punctate structures in rab1ts cells. But it was not clear if the Golgi punctate structures are normal in rab1ts cells. Or are Golgi structures dispersed in rab1ts cells until restored by Uso1 E6K/G540S? Imaging a Golgi marker (e.g. Sed5) in rab1ts cells would strengthen the proposal that the E6K/G540S mutations increase Uso1 localization to normal Golgi structures in rab1ts cells.</p><p>2. On Page 19, regarding AlphaFold predictions, it is stated that &quot;Lys (as in E6K) reinforces the positive charge of this a-helix, which would be inserted into the vesicle membrane, potentially contributing to Uso1 recruitment to COPII vesicles.&quot; This statement would be strengthened if it could be shown that the single E6K mutant displays increased levels of membrane association compared to the wild-type protein. Presumably, this association would be SNARE protein independent.</p><p>3. Based on the AlphaFold model in Figure 12, can it be demonstrated that the single G540S mutant is sufficient for increased binding to Bos1-GST? Similarly, do mutations in specific residues of Bos1 and Bet1 that are predicted to interact with surface residues of Uso1 GHD decrease binding? This could strengthen the proposed molecular model.</p><p>4. It would be helpful to explain why the Bet1-GST protein used in these studies deletes the SNARE motif while the other SNARE-GST proteins include their full cytoplasmic domains and SNARE motif.</p></disp-quote><p>Novelty of our conclusions? We have completely re-written the discussion to emphasize the contribution of our work; note that we have added more, we believe sound, experiments. Due to that reason, the abstract has also been fully re-written as has been the discussion.</p><p>Membrane targeting by E6K. We are very grateful to the referee for noting the lack of evidence supporting the interpretation that the N-terminal helix would bind membranes. It appears that it does not. We have removed from the manuscript any mention to this possibility (see below).</p><p>Are Golgi structures affected my rab1ts, and do they recover by the presence of E6K/G540S Uso1? This was a very nice suggestion. We chose GeaA/Gea1-mCh to label early Golgi cisternae and crossed it into the Uso1-GFP backgrounds. The experiment worked beautifully and has now been included as Figure 7C and 7D. rab1ts results in an statistically significant decrease in the number of cisternae and an increase in the cytosolic haze which is remediable by the additional presence of double mutant Uso1.</p><p>A collateral effect of this comment is that we were not happy with the incomplete colocalization of Uso1 with Golgi markers. We hypothesized that Uso1 would localise in a very early Golgi compartment. Then we used Rer1, a cargo receptor that cycles continuously between the Golgi and the ER to label this &quot;very early&quot; Golgi and we found essentially complete co-localization. This conclusion adds to the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Analysis of single mutants. We carried out this experiment. G540S was indeed capable of providing by itself strong binding to Bos1-GST. E6K was also capable of increasing the binding to the SNARE significantly, although, in agreement with the respective phenotypes, to a lesser extent than G540S. Therefore, it seems that E6K contributes to rescue rab1∆ by binding to SNAREs. These experiments have been included as panels G and H in figure 11.</p><p>Bet1-GST; There was a mistake in the coordinates of this construct in our list of plasmids. Indeed, we tried to split the Bet1 cytosolic region into SNARE and non-SNARE domains and the polypeptides were quite unstable. In all experiments included in the paper, the complete cytosolic domain of the SNAREs was used. We have added a statement to the Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
