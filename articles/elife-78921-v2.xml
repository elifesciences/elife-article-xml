Our group has previously reported that major pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is associated with improved overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Macedo et al., 2019</xref>). A major unmet need that remains is the discovery of biomarkers of pathologic response as well as subsequent disease trajectories in patients who undergo resection following NAC.</p><p>Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has emerged as a promising biomarker in localized and advanced PDAC. Beyond its prognostic value in advanced unresectable disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iwai et al., 2020</xref>), recent evidence implicates the value of pre-surgery NLR in forecasting recurrence in patients undergoing upfront pancreatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nywening et al., 2018</xref>), as well as pre- and post-treatment NLR in predicting pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hasegawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kubo et al., 2019</xref>). However, the precise relationship between NLR <italic>dynamics during</italic> neoadjuvant treatment and pathologic response and/or survival in localized PDAC patients undergoing pancreatectomy has not been previously explored.</p><p>Emerging evidence implicates stromal inflammation in the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME)âpredominantly through inflammatory polarization of cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAF) and CAF-derived secretion of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ãhlund et al., 2017</xref>)âas a major driver of chemoresistance in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hosein et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, prior work from our group has revealed that CAF-derived IL-6 engages in tumor-permissive crosstalk by activating STAT3 signaling within tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nagathihalli et al., 2016</xref>), and that heightened CAF-tumor cell IL-6/STAT-3 signaling crosstalk is a central mediator of chemoresistance in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dosch et al., 2021</xref>). As such, how tumor-permissive inflammatory cues such as neutrophil-lymphocyte balance intersect with such signaling mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance in PDAC remains critically underexplored.</p><p>In a cohort of patients with operable PDAC undergoing modern multi-agent NAC, we sought to determine if <italic>NLR dynamics</italic> predict pathologic response following NAC in patients undergoing curative-intent pancreatectomy. We further investigated if pharmacologically modulating NLR dynamics in preclinical models of PDAC would impact chemosensitivity and uncover potential immunologic- and stromal-mediated mechanisms underlying these effects in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Notwithstanding, since systemic chemotherapy does not appear to impact tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nywening et al., 2018</xref>) or circulating NLR in our preclinical studies, these data also suggest that therapeutic strategies to attenuate NLR <italic>during</italic> NAC may improve pathologic response in operable PDAC.</p><p>While the etiologies underlying the attenuation of <italic>endogenous</italic> NLR in patients demonstrating decreasing ÎNLR during NAC in this study are undoubtedly complex and remain unclear, modeling this phenomenon in preclinical models suggests that a âprimingâ phase in which the systemic NLR is <italic>actively</italic> dampened improves chemosensitivity and is associated with heightened adaptive anti-tumor immunity in the PDAC TME. In our preclinical modeling, attenuation of NLR immediately preceding and during gemcitabine/paclitaxel chemotherapy not only improved CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-effector cell trafficking, but also amplified CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory skewness as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell antigen experience and degranulating capacity. Our data add nuance to previous findings indicating that depletion of Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells unmasks adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stromnes et al., 2014</xref>), or that ablation of CXCR2<sup>+</sup> tumor-associated neutrophils augments IFN-Î³<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration to potentiate FOLFIRINOX responses in PDAC models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nywening et al., 2018</xref>). Given that systemic neutrophilic <italic>silencing</italic> is not only clinically impractical, but also drives a compensatory and dynamic myelopoiesis (e.g. of CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages) that thwarts anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nywening et al., 2018</xref>), the chemosensitizing and immune-potentiating effects of NLR <italic>attenuation</italic> in our model may be related to the disruption of specific tolerogenic functions inherent to tumor-associated neutrophils. Indeed, ongoing investigation in our laboratory is focused on deciphering and targeting neutrophil-intrinsic tolerogenic mechanisms that orchestrate immunosuppressive tumor-stromal-immune crosstalk and promote therapeutic resistance in PDAC.</p><p>One such potential mechanism governing therapeutic resistance unveiled in the present study is the previously unrecognized role of neutrophil-derived IL-1Î² in driving iCAF polarization and CAF-tumor cell IL-6/STAT-3 signaling in the PDAC TME. As such, the improved chemosensitivity associated with NLR attenuation in our preclinical models suggest that combining chemotherapy with therapeutic strategies to mitigate neutrophil-stromal-tumor cell IL-1Î²/IL-6/STAT-3 signaling in PDAC patients may be advantageous. Results from the Precision Promise<sup>SM</sup> trial investigating anti-IL-1Î² antagonism in combination with gemcitabine/<italic>nab-</italic>paclitaxel and PD-1 inhibition in patients with advanced PDAC (NCT04581343) are eagerly awaited. Ultimately, decoding the intersection between NLR dynamics, the balance between tumor-permissive inflammation and anti-tumor adaptive immunity, and tumor-stromal-immune cellular crosstalk that perpetuates chemoresistant signaling circuitries in PDAC may lay the foundation for novel interventions to overcome chemotherapy resistance and improve contemporary outcomes in this lethal malignancy.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Grant support</title><p>Supported by KL2 career development grant by Miami CTSI under NIH Award UL1TR002736, Stanley Glaser Foundation, American College of Surgeons Franklin Martin Career Development Award, and Association for Academic Surgery Joel J.

obtaining Institutional Review Board approval for the study, patients with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with either mFOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/abraxane, or both and underwent pancreatectomy between 7/2015 and 12/2019 at a tertiary academic medical center were enrolled. This study duration was chosen due to the near-routine use of modern multi-agent chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for potentially operable PDAC at our institution beginning in 2015. Resectability criteria for patients were adjudicated by individual surgeons in our practice and/or in multidisciplinary discussion using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network resectability framework.</p><p>Complete blood count (CBC) data was accrued on 94 patients enrolled in the study at two timepoints: (1) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (pre-NAC); and (2) prior to surgical resection (pre-surgery). Specific elements of the CBC tabulated were total leukocyte count, proportion of neutrophils, proportion of lymphocytes, and platelet count. Extreme care was taken to ensure that the CBC accrued for analysis was obtained in the absence of cholangitis or other infection, and that no concurrent antibiotics were being administered. Moreover, we ensured that no patient included in the study was actively on immunosuppressive (e.g. steroids) or immunomodulatory (e.g. TNF inhibitors) agents. Utilization of filgastrim or G-CSF (Neupogen) during NAC was recordedâall but three patients (mFOLFIRINOX, n=1; gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, n=2) received G-CSF support during NAC to counteract neutropenia. Other clinical variables accrued have been defined previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Macedo et al., 2019</xref> and are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1âtable 1</xref>.</p><p>Perioperative information and data about the type and timing of NAC, including regimen, number cycles/months, and RT modalities were collected as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Macedo et al., 2019</xref>). The final analysis only included patients who underwent NAC with mFOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/abraxane, or both with or without radiotherapy followed by curative-intent pancreatectomy. The choice of chemotherapy regimen and dosage was selected at the discretion of the medical oncologist.</p><p>All patients included in this study underwent surgical resection following NAC. Surgically resected specimens were then evaluated by board-certified gastrointestinal pathologists at the University of Miami, and classified into the following grades as defined by the College of American Pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dosch et al., 2021</xref>) and as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Macedo et al., 2019</xref>): pCR or <italic>grade 0</italic> (ypT0/N0) was defined as no evidence of primary tumor or any nodal involvement in the final surgical specimen. No patient with pCR was included in this study either due to lack of follow-up and/or incomplete clinical annotation.

DFS was calculated from the time of surgical resection until the date of recurrence or death to avoid immortal time bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Statistical analysis of clinical data</title><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for patientsâ characteristics using median, interquartile range (IQR), frequencies, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Both pre-NAC absolute NLR as well as fluctuation of NLR during NAC, defined as ÎNLR = pre-surgery NLRâpre-NAC NLR was tabulated. The association between complete/partial and poor/absent pathologic response following NAC and the study variables (clinical variables, aNLR, and ÎNLR) were examined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models while controlling for demographic (age, gender, BMI), clinical (resectability status, tumor size, any CA19-9 decline [i.e. any decrease vs. stability or any increase during NAC]), and treatment-related (duration of NAC, radiotherapy receipt) variables. No pathologic or post-surgical variables were included in this model. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values were reported.</p><p>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were estimated for three biomarker models (pre-chemotherapy aNLR only, ÎNLR only, combined model aNLR + ÎNLR). Internal validation using bootstrap logistic regressionâwherein 1,000 random samples were generated with replacementâwas conducted to obtain mean AUCs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. An interaction test corroborated the incremental improvement of the combined aNLR + ÎNLR model (vs. aNLR or ÎNLR only) in predicting pathologic response (ÎNLR vs. combined ÎNLR +aNLR, &lt;0.001; aNLR vs. combined ÎNLR +aNLR, p=0.049).</p><p>From the combined biomarker model, we calculated an âNLR scoreâ comprising the product of regression coefficients and aNLR/ÎNLR = <italic>10.45â2.9224*aNLR-2.13*ÎNLR</italic>. Estimated scores were examined for three biomarker models of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) with respect to time-dependent AUC between 1 year and 3 years. We also conducted internal validation for time-dependent AUC and reported mean AUC at 1 year and 2 years along with 95% confidence intervals in time-specific receiver operating characteristic curve (data not shown).

Regions of Interest (ROI) were drawn on the image, and cell identification and segmentation were performed using the pretrained âNuclei Detection, AI (Fluorescence)â APP provided with the software. The APP was modified to allow detection of nuclei in IMC data by changing the input band from DAPI to 193Ir. After cells in the image were identified, a new APP was created to determine the cell phenotypes present within the ROI, using the embedded âPhenotypeâ Classification Method. Both the background and upper levels of staining were determined âFeaturesâ function for each marker, and then used in the âSetupâ section of the Phenotype classification to establish the range of positive pixel intensities for each marker. The APP was then trained to produce multiple phenotype classes. The resulting phenotypes were manually verified for each marker and, if inaccurate, the âSetupâ values were modified, and the APP was retrained. This process was repeated until the phenotypes identified matched the manually identified marker for each layer. Once verified T-cells and neutrophils phenotypes were combined into one main classification using post processing steps within the APP. In the final step of the APP creation, data output variables were created. This included the mean intensity, median, and standard deviation of the pixel intensity within each defined âobjectâ (cell). In addition, Center X and Center Y of the multiplexing values were added to the data output. The APP was then run, and a visual spatial phenotyping map was created. All the data outputs were also exported from the program as.tsv files which were converted in Excel to.xlsx files for further downstream analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-5"><title>Orthotopic murine PDAC model generation</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the NIH animal use guideline and protocol (#21â057) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Miami.

It is important for de Castro Silva et al. to discuss this study and provide a rationale that may underlie these distinct conclusions. In addition, while the preclinical results using anti-Ly6G in vivo are exciting, Ly6G is also expressed by granulocytes and some monocytes in addition to neutrophils. The authors should either state this caveat with respect to the lack of specificity for neutrophils in the manuscript text or inhibit neutrophils in vivo using an orthogonal approach to strengthen their claims with respect to neutrophil function. Finally, in light of the heterogeneity within the myeloid compartment observed across PDAC mouse models as well as patients, it would be informative to test the therapeutic potential of anti-Ly6G plus chemotherapy in an independent mouse model and report a limited number of key results (i.e., tumor growth and metastatic spread).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78921.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We believe your study should be revised prior to its acceptance in order to address the following four main points:</p><p>1.

We have now made substantial additions to the revised manuscript to address this deficit. We identified 6 human PDAC tumors with pre-chemotherapy tissue, and stratified these based on ultimate post-chemotherapy pathologic response into partial/complete vs. poor/absent. We then used a novel Hyperion imaging mass cytometry (IMC) platform to perform single-cell image segmentation and examine the relationship between tissue-level NLR (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD15<sup>+</sup> neutrophil:CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell ratios), chemotherapy response, and stromal density. These clinical and relevant IMC data can be found in the new Appendix-Table 2.</p><p>To further examine differences in stromal inflammation in these clinically annotated human PDAC samples, we performed co-IF for PDPN (see response to comment #2) and CXCL1 (iCAF marker). Results are highly supportive of our main conclusion, and validate recent findings reported from the WashU group suggesting that iCAF polarization in the PDAC tumor microenvironment is associated with chemotherapy resistance (Zhou et al., Nat Genet 2022).</p><p>Our findings are described in the revised Results under a new section (pg. 12):</p><p>âReduced tissue-level NLR correlates with chemotherapy response, CAF density, and stromal inflammation at single-cell resolution in human PDAC. To examine the association between tissue-level NLR, stromal density/inflammation, and chemotherapy response (partial/complete [n=3], poor/absent [n=3]) in human PDAC tumors at single-cell resolution, pathologist-selected regions of interest (ROI) from each tumor section probed with metal ion-conjugated antibodies for pancytokeratin (PanCK:epithelial), Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA:fibroblast), CD11b and CD15 (neutrophil), and CD3 and CD8 (T-cell) were laser-ablated, and atomized ions were acquired using time-of-flight mass cytometry (cyTOF) (Figure 4C). Image segmentation and quantification revealed significantly higher ratio of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD15<sup>+</sup> to CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (NLR; normalized to 5000 total single cells) in pre-treatment tumors from PDAC patients who demonstrated poor/absent pathologic response compared with partial/complete response (15.8Â±2.8 vs. 7.4Â±3.9; P=0.039) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Figure 4D). Interestingly, increased NLR in patients with poor/absent pathologic response correlated with significantly higher mean intensity of Î±-SMA expression (41.9Â±26.6 vs. 18.4Â±16.6 pixels/cell; P&lt;0.001) inâbut not absolute density ofâcancer associated fibroblasts in tumor ROIs (Figure 4D), as well as relative abundance of co-expressed PDPN<sup>+</sup>CXCL1<sup>+</sup> iCAF populations in corresponding tumor sections (29.7Â±8.8% vs. 18.4Â±7.4% tumor area; P&lt;0.001; Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Since this data is not shown in the human cohort, the authors should perform immunofluorescent staining to show, in situ, that the cells affected by these treatments are indeed CAFs.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) PDPN has been used as a pan-CAF marker in multiple high-profile PDAC studies. A few examples with relevant points are presented hereâPMID 31699795: PDPN is expressed in fibroblasts and CAFs;Â CD31<sup>+</sup> stromal cells were predominantly PDPN<sup>â</sup> blood endothelial cells; PMID 33495315: Used PDPN to define CAFs both via flow cytometry and IHC; PMID 31197017: Defined PDPN as a pan-CAF marker; PMIDÂ 30366930: PDPN used to sort and isolate CAFs; PMIDÂ 30575030: PDPN used to identify CAFs in human samples, including IHC.</p><p>(2) We have also invoked some of these studies in our revised manuscript (pg. 12). We now show single-cell RNA sequencing in both the spontaneous PKT PDAC model (Datta J et al., Gastroenterology 2022), as well as human PDAC patients (Steele et al., Nat Cancer 2020) demonstrating near-exclusive expression of PDPN in fibroblast populations in the murine and human PDAC tumor microenvironments. These data are now invoked in the revised Results (pg. 12): âFurthermore, leveraging the near-exclusive expression of PDPN/Pdpn in human and murine PDAC-associated CAFs via scRNAseq (Appendix-Figure 5B&amp;C)â¦â</p><p>(3) Endothelial cells are the other dominant cell subset in which PDPN is expressed. For this reason, we gated out CD31<sup>+</sup> cells prior to examining Ly6C and MHC-II markers in PDPN<sup>+</sup> cells. This gating strategy has been validated previously (Biffi et al., Cancer Discovery 2019) and we have now shown our strategy in Appendix-Figure 5C.</p><p>(4) We have now performed immunofluorescence co-staining of PDPN and CXCL1 in both PKT genetic murine tumors, as well as in human PDAC sections (see response to previous comment) as an orthogonal approach to show the relevance of PDPN as a CAF marker and PDPN<sup>+</sup>CXCL1<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts as representative of inflammatory CAFs. The data from PKT mice are described in the revised Results (pg. 12): âWe observed significant reduction in co-expressing PDPN<sup>+</sup>CXCL1<sup>+</sup> stromal cellsâpresumed iCAFsâin tumors from PKT genetically engineered mice treated with gemcitabine/paclitaxel+anti-Ly6G compared with gemcitabine/paclitaxel alone (P=0.02; Figure 4B), validating findings from the KPC orthotopic model.â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Statistical tests: Some of the differences shown do not seem to be significant. For example, in Figure 2A, C â did the authors correct for multiple comparisons? This should be detailed in the legends and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight. Yes, the comparisons shown in Figures 2A-C were performed using ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple-comparison post-hoc testing. This is now detailed in the revised Appendix (Supplementary Methods) section: âResults are shown as mean Â± SEM. Multiple comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test.â We have also updated the Figure 2, 4, 5 legends to reflect these edits (pg. 22-23, 27, 28).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3: FACS results in viSNE maps are not clear. The scale is unclear and it seems that anti-Ly6G+ expresses Ly6G+. The T cell panel also doesn't appear to indicate a decrease in PD-1. The authors should also provide histograms or dot plots.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the readability of the viSNE maps (see below). Regarding scant Ly6G expression in anti-Ly6G treated mice, we gently remind the reviewer that our intention was not to deplete but attenuate NLR (please see Appendix-Figure 3A) to mimic NLR attenuation in PDAC patients. We have reinforced this in the revised Supplementary Methods in Appendix: âOur specific intention was to attenuate, but not deplete, systemic neutrophils to simulate the endogenous decline in ÎNLR during neoadjuvant chemotherapyâ, as well as revised Results (pg. 11): âIn tumor-bearing animals, NLR attenuation significantly reducedâbut did not abolishâcirculating Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>dim</sup>F4/80<sup>-</sup> neutrophilic cells (Figure 3A).â We also provide adjoining histograms for these comparisons in Figure 3A.</p><p>As we and multiple groups have done previously, we use PD-1 as a marker of T-cell antigen experience (and not exhaustion per se, which has a more complex expression profile). We actually observed a significant increase in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PD-1 in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cellsâbut not absolute number of PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cellsâin chemotherapy+anti-Ly6G groups compared with either treatment alone. To clarify these comparisons between groups, we have removed prior Appendix-Figure 5 and have provided these histograms adjacent to the viSNE maps in Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4: Anti-Ly6G treatment resulted in a significant reduction of IL-1 secretion, however, the authors did not show any effect of gemcitabine/paclitaxel treatment, since this treatment could increase IL-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We have now performed and shown these data in the revised manuscript. As the reviewer predicted, gemcitabine/paclitaxel chemotherapy treatment modestly (but not significantly) increases IL-1Î², but combination anti-Ly6G+chemotherapy treatment recapitulates the effect of anti-Ly6G alone by significantly reducing IL-1Î² secretion compared with chemotherapy alone. These findings mirror the reduction in intratumoral Ly6G/Gr1<sup>+</sup> neutrophilic cells observed in both anti-Ly6G treated cohorts. To address the reviewer comment, these data are now described in revised Results (pg. 13): âSystemic NLR attenuation with anti-Ly6G treatmentâwith or without chemotherapyâresulted in significant diminution of IL-1Î² secretion in tumor lysates compared with vehicle or chemotherapy treatment in vivo (ANOVA P&lt;0.001; Figure 5E), likely due to its incident reduction in systemic and tumor-infiltrating Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cells (see Figure 3).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The prognostic significance of NLR for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy among PDAC patients has been assessed in prior studies not presently cited here, including PMID: 33517697 and PMID: 31549202.

It is important for de Castro Silva et al. to discuss this study and provide a rationale that may underlie these distinct conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. While acknowledging that the Strong et al., study (PMID: 33517697) has a different conclusion than our study, several issues limiting its applicability to our findings should be recognized and discussed:</p><p>1) These data are presented from an institution that sequences most patients with localized disease to a surgery-first approach, calling into question a substantial selection bias that compels utilization of neoadjuvant therapy and confounds the study conclusions.</p><p>2) Utilization of non-standard pathologic response nomenclatureâtheir study dichotomizes response by &lt; or â¥90% responseâwhich is not standard in the field. Our study uses standard College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria to categorize pathologic response. It is unknown how these two response metrics compare.</p><p>3) There is concerning covariate imbalance in good vs. poor responders in their study, wherein 88% of patients with âgoodâ pathologic response underwent neoadjuvant radiation vs. only 36% of patients with poor response (P&lt;0.001). Moreover, this variable was not accounted for when examining the impact of NLR on pathologic response.</p><p>4) Another imbalance was observed in the duration of chemotherapy between the cohorts, with âgoodâ responders receiving median 22 weeks of NAC vs. only 12 weeks in the âpoorâ responders. Again, this variable is not accounted for in a multivariable analysis. Our analysis, on the other hand, controls for duration of NAC in the multivariable analysis (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68-1.75, P=0.73), which is shown in Appendix-Table 3.</p><p>5) Of 93 patients included in the study, 14 patients had unknown baseline NLR values, of which 12 were in the poor responder cohort.</p><p>6) Finally, despite these major issues, there was a suggestion that âgoodâ responders actually had attenuation of NLR during chemotherapy (median ÎNLR = -0.02) compared with âpoorâ responders (median ÎNLR = +0.06; Table 2), although this comparison was not statistically significant. These findings are consistent with our present study.</p><p>Despite these major issues, we have incorporated this reference in the revised Discussion (pg. 14): âWhile these novel findings warrant large-scale multi-institutional validation to strengthen and/or reconcile data from heterogeneous PDAC populations [PMID: 26893780, 31549202, 33517697]â¦â</p><p>We apologize for overlooking the Japanese study that the reviewer points out (PMID: 31549202), which supports our overall conclusions. We have invoked this reference in the revised Introduction (pg. 4): ââ¦recent evidence implicates the value of pre-surgery NLR in forecasting recurrence in patients undergoing upfront pancreatectomy [4], as well as pre- and post-treatment NLR in predicting pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [5,6].â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, while the preclinical results using anti-Ly6G in vivo are exciting, Ly6G is also expressed by granulocytes and some monocytes in addition to neutrophils.

We now provide evidence that NLR-attenuating doses of anti-Ly6G Ab specifically disrupt intratumoral neutrophils/neutrophilic MDSCs and to a lesser extent monocytes/monocytic MDSCs. More importantly, to address the reviewerâs comment, we do not observe any differences in other granulocytic populations between vehicle- and anti-Ly6G Ab-treated cohorts, namely comparing tumoral (and circulating) CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>-</sup>Siglec-F<sup>+</sup> eosinophils and F4/80<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>FcÎµR1<sup>+</sup> basophils. These data have been provided in the Supplementary Methods section in Appendix: âThe anti-Ly6G clone 1A8 neutralizing antibody construct is a rat IgG2a that induces a Fc-dependent opsonization and phagocytosis of Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cells. To demonstrate the specificity of this antibody, a separate experiment showed that NLR-attenuating anti-Ly6G treatment in KPC orthotopic tumor-bearing mice specifically reduced splenic (data not shown) and intratumoral CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>-</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils, but not other granulocytic populationsânamely CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>-</sup>Siglec-F<sup>+</sup> eosinophils and F4/80<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>FcÎµR1<sup>+</sup> basophilsâcompared with vehicle treatment (Appendix-Figure 7).â</p><p>With respect to an orthogonal approach to constraining neutrophils and its effect on chemosensitivity, data from Linehan and colleagues have revealed that CXCR2 inhibition sensitizes PDAC to FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. We have invoked these prior data in the revised Discussion (pg. 15) but did not repeat these experiments in the present manuscript: ââ¦or that ablation of CXCR2<sup>+</sup> tumor-associated neutrophils augments IFN-Î³<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration to potentiate FOLFIRINOX responses in PDAC models (Nywening TM et al., Gut 2018).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in light of the heterogeneity within the myeloid compartment observed across PDAC mouse models as well as patients, it would be informative to test the therapeutic potential of anti-Ly6G plus chemotherapy in an independent mouse model and report a limited number of key results (i.e., tumor growth and metastatic spread).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this important comment. To address the reviewerâs suggestion, we performed pharmacologic Ly6G attenuation with gemcitabine+paclitaxel chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone in the genetically engineered Ptf1a<sup>cre/+</sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>;Tgfbr2<sup>flox/flox</sup> (PKT) mouse model. We have published extensively on this modelâmice form aggressive tumors by week 4 and die of local (but not metastatic) disease burden by 6.5 weeks (e.g., Datta J et al., Gastroenterology 2022; Nagathihalli et al., Cancer Res 2018). We have detailed this experimental design in Appendix.</p><p>We performed an endpoint experiment after 2 weeks of anti-Ly6G treatment + chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone vs. vehicle (omitted anti-Ly6G alone for these experiments), and observed significantly reduced tumor burden in cohorts treated with anti-Ly6G+chemo vs. chemo alone. We also observed reduced tumor area upon histologic analysis by a board-certified GI pathologist. These results are now described in the revised Results (pg. 10): âTo validate these observations in a spontaneous PDAC mouse model, we treated 4-week old PKT mice with vehicle, gemcitabine/paclitaxel alone, and gemcitabine/paclitaxel plus anti-Ly6G combinations for 2 weeks. In this model as well, NLR attenuation with anti-Ly6G improved chemosensitivity vs. chemotherapy alone as evidenced by decreased primary tumor weights (P=004; Figure 2E) and tumor area by H&amp;E staining (P=0.008; Figure 2F) at endpoint analysis.â</p><p>In addition, we validated the reduction in inflammatory CAF populationsâcharacterized by PDPN<sup>+</sup>CXCL1<sup>+</sup> stromal cellsâin the combination anti-Ly6G+gemcitabine/paclitaxel treatment arm compared with chemotherapy alone or vehicle treatment in PKT mice. These data are now described in the revised Results (pg. 12): âFurthermore â¦ we observed significant reduction in co-expressing PDPN<sup>+</sup>CXCL1<sup>+</sup> inflammatory CAF populations in tumors from PKT genetically engineered mice treated with gemcitabine/paclitaxel+anti-Ly6G compared with gemcitabine/paclitaxel alone (P=0.02; Figure 4B), validating findings from the KPC orthotopic model.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
