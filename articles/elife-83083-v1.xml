implantation and a successful pregnancy in human. Here, we demonstrated that knockout of Gαq lead to an aberrantly enhanced inflammatory state during decidualization. Furthermore, we showed that deficiency of Gαq resulted in over-activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling, due to the decreased expression of <italic>NFκBIA</italic>, which encode the IκB protein and is the negative regulator for NF-κB. Mechanistically, Gαq deficiency decreased the Protein kinase D (PKD, also called PKCμ) phosphorylation levels, leading to attenuated HDAC5 phosphorylation and thus its nuclear export. Aberrantly high level of nuclear HDAC5 retarded histone acetylation to inhibit the induced <italic>NFκBIA</italic> transcription during decidualization. Consistently, pharmacological activation of the PKD/PKCμ or inhibition of the HDAC5 restored the inflammatory state and proper decidual response. Finally, we disclosed that over-active inflammatory state in Gαq-deficient decidua deferred the blastocyst hatching and adhesion in vitro, and the decidual expression of Gαq was significantly lower in women with recurrent pregnancy loss compared with normal pregnancy. In brief, we showed here that Gαq as a key regulator of the inflammatory cytokine’s expression and decidual homeostasis in response to differentiation cues, which is required for successful implantation and early pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decidualization</kwd><kwd>early pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Gαq-PKD/PKCμ</kwd><kwd>HDAC5</kwd><kwd>inflammatory cytokine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Guixiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82288102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Haibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Shuangbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81701457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yufei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82101726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gαq stimulates HDAC5 phosphorylation by PKC-independent PKD/PKCμ activation to induce the IκB expression and limit the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response which essential for proper endometrial decidualization and early pregnancy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Successful pregnancy requires precisely coordinated immune responses between the mother and fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yockey and Iwasaki, 2018</xref>). Disorders in these communications are tightly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yockey and Iwasaki, 2018</xref>). Increasing evidence has demonstrated compromised inflammatory cytokine expression in the endometrium from RPL patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Cytokine signaling pathways participate the differentiation of endometrium to promote healthy pregnancy, for their ability to drastically alter cellular function, cell–cell communication, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vinketova et al., 2016</xref>). However, when dysregulated or inappropriately expressed during the inflammation, cytokines have the potential to act as teratogens and disrupt fetal and placental developmental, leading to birth defects and pregnancy complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yockey and Iwasaki, 2018</xref>). Investigating the molecular mechanisms to regulate the inflammatory cytokine’s expression, which impact pregnancy and fetal development, could provide important insights into congenital disorders and possible therapeutics to prevent pregnancy complications.</p><p>Cyclic decidualization, formed during the secretory phase of menstrual cycle from uterine mucosa termed endometrium, is crucial for embryo implantation and human reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). Decidual stromal cells (DSCs) differentiate from endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) under the influence of ovarian hormones and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). DSCs acquire specific functions related to considerable transcriptional and cellular remodeling, enabling implantation and placental development as well as establishment of maternal immune tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vinketova et al., 2016</xref>). At the molecular level, decidual transformation of ESCs involves genome-wide remodeling of the chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vrljicak et al., 2018</xref>), wholesale reprogramming of several signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cloke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leitao et al., 2010</xref>), including progesterone and cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways. These signals induce a downstream cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pavličev et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) and transcription factors, such as progesterone receptor (PGR), forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), homeobox (HOX), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein <italic>β</italic> (C/EBP<italic>β</italic>), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vinketova et al., 2016</xref>), that together set in motion for decidualization regulatory program. Progesterone and oestrogen, detached from decidual environment, are not strong stimulators of decidualization. This implies that other signal molecule, such as prokineticin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook et al., 2010</xref>), relaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tseng et al., 1992</xref>), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dimitriadis et al., 2005</xref>) from the endometrial niche synergistically augment decidual transformation of ESCs. The receptors of prokineticin-1, relaxin, and PGE2 are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane spanning domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook et al., 2010</xref>) that are primarily considered to couple Gαs to activate adenylate cyclase that subsequently forms the second messenger cAMP. cAMP signaling participates the decidualization by the activation of PKA to influence the expression of major decidual factors, including prolactin (PRL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Telgmann et al., 1997</xref>) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tamura et al., 2012</xref>), two specific markers of ESC decidualization.</p><p>Gαq, encoded by the GNAQ gene, belongs to the Gq/11 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins, and it is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilkie et al., 1991</xref>). The Gαq links GPCRs to activate Phospholipase C (PLC) that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, PIP2 to release inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) – two important second messengers causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ho et al., 2009</xref>). The activated molecules each participate in multiple signaling networks involved in inflammatory responses, and link Gαq family members to a host of different cellular events. As a critical downstream effector for GPCR, whether and how the Gαq-mediated signaling controls decidualization still need investigation. In the present study, we showed that Gαq played an important role in balancing the inflammatory cytokine expression and decidual progression in response to deciduogenic cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gαq is expressed in human endometrium, decidua of early pregnancy, and DSCs in vitro</title><p>The expression of Gαq protein in human endometrial tissues during menstrual cycle and in decidual tissues of early pregnancy was detected by immunohistochemistry. The positive expression of Gαq showed in the endometrium of mid-proliferative, mid-secretary phase, and decidual tissue of early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Expression of Gαq was higher in stromal cell at mid-secretary phase during menstrual cycle, which is the timing for implantation (implantation windows), and in deciduas of early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results imply that Gαq may play an important role during stromal cell decidualization which occurred in implantation windows and early pregnancy. To identify the pathophysiological relevance of Gαq to human endometrial decidualization, Gαq expression was further examined in the proliferative and differentiated human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) in vitro. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>, the expression of both the Gαq transcript and protein increased significantly in the HESC as the differentiation progressed over time in vitro. Recently, GPCRs, G proteins, and their downstream effectors have been uncovered on the nuclear membrane or in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Campden et al., 2015</xref>). So, with regard to the protein localization, immunofluorescence analyses and subcellular fraction experiments were performed to confirm the localization of Gαq in decidual cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>, Gαq was expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of proliferative and differentiated cells. This observation was further confirmed in primary cultured ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gαq deficiency causes aberrant progression of decidualization with high expressed decidual markers</title><p>To explore the role of Gαq during decidualization, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out endogenous <italic>GNAQ</italic> in HESC, and generated GNAQ-KO cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Sanger sequencing proved that the clonal cell line harbors a single base insertion near the Cas9 cutting site, causing a frameshift in the protein coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and this resulted in loss of endogenous Gαq expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We then interrogated the significance of Gαq during stromal cell decidualization by detecting the expression of Ki67, a proliferation marker. It showed no significant change in control (CON) and GNAQ-KO HESC in the proliferative state, but remarkable decrease in GNAQ-KO cells on the first day of decidua induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). According to previous studies, HESC usually stopped proliferating on the fourth day of decidual induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Meanwhile, compared with control decidual cells, GNAQ-KO significantly accelerated the expression of <italic>PRL</italic> and <italic>IGFBP1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Consistently, the level of IGFBP1 protein was also increased significantly upon Gαq deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Decidualization promotes profound changes of signaling pathways and expression of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pavličev et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). To identify novel downstream targets that contribute to Gαq-mediated progression of decidualization, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was utilized to explored the differently expressed genes in CON and GNAQ-KO decidual cells (differentiated for 3 days). More than 3880 genes were altered in the absence of GNAQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that most top-ranked biological processes included the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pathak et al., 2021</xref>) and JAK–STAT, NF-κB inflammation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>), which had been reported to regulate stromal apoptosis and differentiation during the decidualization, the latter consistent with the notions regarding the role of Gαq during immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization was advanced in the absence of Gαq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of Ki67 in control (CON) and GNAQ knockout (KO) proliferative HESCs (D0) and decidual HESC treated with differential culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium [DMEM]/F12 with 2% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum [CS-FBS], dibutyryl cAMP [dbcAMP], and medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate (MPA)) for 1 day.

Decidualization is characterized by a biphasic gene expression dynamic that likely corresponds to different phases in the establishment of the fetal–maternal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rytkönen et al., 2019</xref>). Secretions from decidualized ESCs promote invasion of trophoblast cells by activating proteases and altering expression of adhesion-related molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vinketova et al., 2016</xref>). The decidual secretions contain high amounts inflammatory cytokine that include IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">White et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine are potentially required to maintain normal pre-implantation embryo development and blastocyst hatching, leading to successful implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pathak et al., 2021</xref>). But, excessively elevated levels of inflammatory cytokine likely induce ER stress in the invading EVTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Above perspectives on blastocyst hatching and trophoblast have immense implications in the clinical management of human infertility. However, few functionally and indispensable factors could hold the key as master regulators of inflammatory cytokine in the context of decidual cells. In the present study, we uncovered that Gαq play an important role in balancing the cytokines expression and decidual progression in response to deciduogenic cues.</p><p>Transcriptional patterns suggested that the early decidualization inflammatory state is dominated by STAT signaling. In the late phase, however, STATs are downregulated and the transcription of NF-κB repressors decreases, possibly leading to NF-κB pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rytkönen et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we showed that, Gαq deficiency attenuated <italic>NFκBIA</italic> mRNA expression in early decidual cells (D2 and D4), but not late decidual cells and proliferative stromal cells. Meanwhile, we detected the expression of <italic>NFκBIA</italic> showed an early upregulated (D3) and late downregulated (D6) pattern in control decidual cells which consistent with Wagner’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rytkönen et al., 2019</xref>), and the phosphorylation level of IκBα with the same pattern of <italic>NFκBIA</italic>. These expression and phosphorylation patterns of inhibitor κBα suggest that the early decidualization inflammatory state is also balanced by Gαq inhibition for NF-κB signaling.</p><p>In addition, we detected nuclear localization of Gαq protein in DSCs. Previous studies have shown that G proteins, and their downstream effector that are found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Spiegelberg and Hamm, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Campden et al., 2015</xref>). There is a substantial body of evidence documenting other membrane proteins, for example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members and PD-L1 to be localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2010c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). The translocation of EGFR family members involves the recognition of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) by the nuclear transporter importin proteins, thus directing the proteins transport through the nuclear pore complex to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsu and Hung, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike EGFR or PD-L1, Gαq does not contain a classical NLS (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Even with a clear nuclear localization, in this study, we found that cytoplastic localization of Gαq played a dominate role in regulating the expression of <italic>NFκBIA</italic> to balance the progression of decidualization. Further study is needed to explore the potential roles and mechanism of nuclear localized Gαq during decidualization.</p><p>We also investigated the signaling pathways through which Gαq could mediate its differentiation effects in HESC. It is well known that Gαq directly activates PLC β, which generates the second messenger DAG. DAG activates PKC by binding their C1 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) and DAG induces the activation of PKD/PKCμ by PKC-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang, 2006</xref>). PMA as a PKC agonist, at the concentration of 100 nM was able to mimics the DAG to activate PKC. Interestingly, we found that PMA at the low concentration of 1 nM can activate PKD/PKCμ but not the PKCα/β or PKA in Gαq deficiency and normal decidual cells. These findings revealed that Gαq stimulate PKD/PKCμ activation may not via protein kinase C during decidualization, and suggest that there may be PKC-independent pathways stimulated by Gαq that are responsible for PKD/PKCμ activation during decidualization. Thus, further study is warranted to explore further alternative mechanism of Gαq involved in the modulation of PKD/PKCμ activation during decidualization.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated that HDACs universally expressed in ESCs and decidual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pavličev et al., 2017</xref>) which play an important role during decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sakai et al., 2003</xref>). However, just HDAC4 and HDAC5 expression have a dramatic change during the transformation of the endometrial stromal fibroblasts into secretory decidual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pavličev et al., 2017</xref>). While, in our present work, HDAC4 was only weakly expressed (data not shown). HDAC5 belongs to the class IIa HDAC family and phosphorylated form has been known to shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus. HDAC5 phosphorylation can be regulated by PKD/PKCμ or PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weeks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pietruczuk et al., 2019</xref>), which would promote HDAC5 shuttling to the cytosol and relieve its transcription suppress function. Our results demonstrate that PKD/PKCμ can serve as a HDAC5 kinase downstream of Gαq activation in decidual cells. Based on these observations, it suggested that the nuclear HDAC5 activity is precisely modulated both at the protein level and post-translational level through phosphorylation.</p><p>In conclusion, our results proved that Gαq expression is required for decidualization during early pregnancy and that a decrease in Gαq expression leads to over-activated inflammatory and aberrantly advanced decidualization progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). The results also provided new insights into the mechanism underlying the action of Gαq to balance the cytokines expression and decidual procedure in response to deciduogenic cues and confirm its important contribution in HESC decidualization. Meanwhile, Gαq-deficient decidualization deferred or even destroyed blastocyst hatching and adhesion in vitro. In addition, we found that Gαq expression was significantly lower in RPL samples than in normal endometrial samples, indicating the significance of Gαq to decidualization in vivo. Based on these finding, we demonstrated that, for a successful early pregnancy, a proper decidualization with homeostasis of cytokines secretome govern by Gαq is pre-requested, which provided a new hint for understanding the early pregnancy loss.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model outlining the functions of Gαq during decidualization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During normal decidualization, Gαq-PKD/PKCμ signal inactive HDAC5 through phosphorylation to induce the IκB expression and limit the nuclear factor (NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response for endometrial decidual homeostasis).

Chromatin was sheared by sonication to obtain the DNA fragment and the sheared chromatin was precleared by 15 μl protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen, 10007D). Chromatin fragments were incubated with 5 μg anti-HDAC5 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 98329, 1:50) overnight at 4°C. Normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-2025) was used as a negative control for nonspecific immunoprecipitation. The chromatin–antibody complex was pull-downed by the protein G Dynabeads after rigid washing. The beads were suspended in elution buffer and the precipitated protein/DNA complexes were eluted from the antibodies/beads. The resulting protein/DNA complexes were subjected to cross-link reversal and the captured DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Specific primers were used to detect immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments, as well as input chromatin (primers for ChIP assay are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol RNA purification kit (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the Takara PrimeScript RT reagent kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

All donors were informed that their abandoned blastocysts would be used for basic research and that the donation would not affect their clinical treatment. Twelve-well dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were pre-coated with CON and GNAQ-KO stromal cells, to induce decidualization with differential culture medium for 48 hr and changed the medium before co-culture. Unassisted hatching day – 5 or 6 human blastocysts were randomly and individually placed into wells and co-cultured for 96 hr at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Images were recorded after 8 hr co-culture. Human blastocyst hatching was defined as the beginning escaped from the zona pellucida. When trophoblast cells grown outward from the blastocysts and the trophoblast cells became visible, these embryos were designated as adhesion-initiating blastocysts.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ricardo Azziz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although all the experiments were well-designed and performed, the description is not clear enough to explain what they found. First of all, professional English editing is strongly recommended to provide a sound explanation for all the data in the manuscript. Many lines contain inappropriate words, typing errors, and grammar errors in the submitted manuscript. For example, in line 38 (in the abstract), HADC5 should be changed to HDAC5. In line 126, mid-proliferate should be changed to mid-proliferative. In line 273, &quot;G protein Gs&quot; what does it mean?</p><p>2) Whereas the data of Western blotting analyses in Figures 2 and 3 are convincing, it is not easy to see what they found in the immunofluorescence staining data in these figures. The authors are recommended to change the images for better understanding.</p><p>3) There are no statistical analyses for the role of stromal Gaq for blastocyst hatching and adhesion in a co-culture assay in Figure 6. Furthermore, considering the blastocyst number used in this experiment, the experiments seem to be performed once or twice. The authors are recommended to provide statistics for this experiment and to increase the number of the experiment. It is better to have data with statistical significance as graphs in this figure as well.</p><p>4) The authors need to provide a scientific rationale on why the authors stick to only HDAC5 as downstream of PKD/PKCu. They simply mentioned that &quot;PKD/PKCu could directly phosphorylate HDAC5&quot; before they describe the results in the result section.</p><p>Furthermore, it is not clear why the authors did not include the word, HDAC5, in the tile. Since HDAC5 is a key molecule of this manuscript, HDAC5 is supposed to be included in the title.</p><p>5) Lines 170-173: The investigators note that their findings using the KEGG analysis &quot;were highly related to decidualization&quot;. However, Figure 1F does not denote 'decidualization' as a category. Please restate and explain the statement.</p><p>6) Lines 183-185: The investigators note that &quot;As shown in Figure 2A-C and Figure supplement 3A, nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and p50 were higher in GNAQ-KO decidual cells than in control.&quot; However, examination of the figure does not indicate this finding. Please address.</p><p>7) Lines 195-198: The authors state that &quot;We performed western blot to analyze the STAT3 phosphorylation level in decidual cells upon Gaq knockout, and found that Gaq deficiency could significantly enhance the phosphorylation of STAT3 in decidual stromal cells (Figure 2F)&quot;. What were the results?</p><p>8) Lines 219-222: The authors state that &quot;Interestingly, we found that both mRNA and protein level of NF.BIA was significantly attenuated in GNAQ-KO decidual cells, but not in Gaq deficiency proliferative stromal compared with control cells (Figure 3A, B).&quot; On examination of the figure, this reviewer could not see any difference in the blots, except maybe in D2 and D4. Can the authors address this?</p><p>9) Lines 226-228: The authors state &quot;As expected, nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and p50 were less in NFκBIA overexpression GNAQ-KO decidual cells (Figure 3C)&quot;. Again, this reviewer does not see this difference in the figure cited.</p><p>10) Line 263: The authors note the response of the PKD/PKCμ pathway to 1 nM PMA. Was there any attempt to determine whether there was a dose-dependent response.</p><p>11) Lines 502-504: The authors state that &quot;The purity of stromal cells was verified by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against the stromal-specific vimentin at the third passage.&quot; Which antibodies?</p><p>12) Lines 664-675: Regarding the study of blastocysts, this reviewer could not find any details regarding the source of these in the Materials and methods. Human or murine? This needs to be clearly discussed in the Materials and methods and in the results.</p><p>13) In the figures the authors repeatedly state that &quot;Representative data are shown from three to five independent experiments.&quot; Could the authors clarify exactly what this means? Wasn't all data analyzed? Also, were the experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate? This needs to be noted.</p><p>14) In the manuscript (page 51 of merged PDF), part A (top) of Figure Supplement 3 appears to be a duplicate of Figure 1F and is different from the same figure at the end of the PDF (page 64).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Lines 170-173: The investigators note that their findings using the KEGG analysis &quot;were highly related to decidualization&quot;.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Diane Harper (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below by Reviewer #3:</p><p>1. In this work, the Authors have designed and performed the experiments in a well-defined manner. But in some cases the explanations need to be more clear and there are many typographical errors which need to be corrected. For example, using of different denotations like Gaq and Gαq of the same gene or protein (use single notation throughout the manuscript like either Gaq or Gαq).</p><p>2. In Line 154: The authors have mentioned the generation of GNAQ-KO cell lines through CRISPR. But a detailed explanation is required like the size of GNAQ gene (I will suggest doing a Schematic representation for the generation of the cell line).</p><p>3. Authors also mentioned that inserted mutation in both GNAQ alleles (line 155). If the cell lines are generated through inserting a mutation, what kind of a mutation and the location of the mutation and justification for the mutation site needs to be addressed? Knocking out a gene and inserting a mutation are two different strategies.</p><p>4. The authors have well represented the western blots with the loading controls. But in some figures like Figure 1E and Figure 2C loading controls of GAPDH and H3 are not comparable (not matching with) with the original blot. Original blot images without adjusting the contrast so much is needed for clarity.</p><p>5. In Figure 3, the Authors have mentioned an empty vector and in the legend it's mentioned as a control lentivirus. Are these both similar? If yes, it needs to be corrected as lentivirus transfected with empty vector.</p><p>6. Source of lentiviral vector (catalogue no.) needs to be mentioned.</p><p>7. In Line 247, the Authors have mentioned reintroducing the HA Tag. What does it mean by (like authors already have existing HA tagged Gαq, they removed it for some studies and they are reintroducing it again) or adding HA tag to WT- Gαq, details are required. Explain the details of how the amplification/cloning is performed.</p><p>8. HA-tagged WT Gαq can be denoted as HA-Gαq instead OF GNAQ-WT IN THE FIGURE LEGENDS (Figure 4).</p><p>9. Authors have performed the ChIP for localization studies (Figure 4). The amount of protein loaded looks quite high. Please mention the amount loaded and also the total amount of protein from Chip Assay along with the source material (starting material). The loading controls needs to be verified in Figure 4F.</p><p>10. Authors mentioned cytoplastic localization of Gαq. What does it mean by like Gαq is a cytoplasmic protein.</p><p>11. According to the western Blot results (Figure 4a)- Gαq is more widely expressed in nucleoplasm than cytoplasm and it is a cytoplasmic protein. A detailed explanation is required why it is so.</p><p>12. In Figure 5, the Expression of PKCα/β data is not shown. As the Authors are describing the expression of genes so the quantification of western blots is required.</p><p>13. References are required for the methodologies mentioned like Nuclear Protein Extracts and Chromatin protein precipitation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83083.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although all the experiments were well-designed and performed, the description is not clear enough to explain what they found.

In consistent with our data, its nucleoplasm localization has been reported in other published papers (PMID: 25590750, PMID: 16221676).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In Figure 5, the Expression of PKCα/β data is not shown. As the Authors are describing the expression of genes so the quantification of western blots is required.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added data of Western blotting quantification of p-PKCα/β and PKCα (See Revised Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and revised manuscript Line 1155).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. References are required for the methodologies mentioned like Nuclear Protein Extracts and Chromatin protein precipitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Very kind suggestion. We have added references for the methodologies mentioned Nuclear Protein Extracts and Chromatin protein precipitation in revised manuscript (See revised manuscript lines 643 and 657).</p></body></sub-article></article>
