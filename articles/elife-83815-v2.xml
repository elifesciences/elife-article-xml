What has not been considered is whether the internal neural states modulate visual sensitivity to short-term monocular deprivation. In this study we manipulated the internal neural state and reported changes in intrinsic neural oscillations with a patched eye open or closed. We investigated the influence of eye open/eye closure on the unpatched eye’s contrast sensitivity and ocular dominance (OD) shifts induced by short-term monocular deprivation. The results demonstrate that internal neural states influence not only baseline contrast sensitivity but also the extent to which the adult visual system can undergo changes in ocular

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent studies have shown that when one eye is deprived of its input for a short period of time (30 min to 2.5 hr), visual brain mechanisms undergo a neural change that results in not only a change in visual sensitivity but also interocular balance (i.e., ocular dominance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lunghi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>). However, unlike the long-term neuroplastic changes by abnormal visual experience in critical period, such change peaks immediately after patch removal and remains for up to 30–90 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lunghi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>), which we call as short-term monocular deprivation effect. A number of results suggest that this short-term monocular deprivation effect mainly involves V1 (the primary visual cortex), these include intrinsic optical imaging in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Begum and Tso, 2015</xref>), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chadnova et al., 2017</xref>), electroencephalogram (EEG) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lunghi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binda et al., 2018</xref>), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lunghi et al., 2015b</xref>) and psychophysics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) in human adults. The role played by a number of exogenous factors have been investigated, namely image properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lunghi and Sale, 2015c</xref>), visual pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lunghi et al., 2019b</xref>), body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lunghi et al., 2019a</xref>). What is not known is whether there is a role played by internal neural states in modulating this short-term monocular deprivation effect.</p><p>It is well known that there are characteristic differences in resting-state brain activity in the absence of visual stimulation, for example, when the two eyes are open vs. closed in the dark, there is a significant decrease in occipital alpha oscillations called the Berger effect. There are power and coherence changes of a broad spectrum in the Δ, θ, α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2</sub>, and γ frequency bands that are presumed to be correlates of the switching of involuntary preliminary attention from internally directed attention specific for the eyes closed state to externally directed attention specific for the eyes open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boytsova and Danko, 2010</xref>). FMRI studies have shown that eyes open rest conditions are associated with larger activation of the visual cortex but smaller activation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marx et al., 2004</xref>). In the eyes closed state, activations of the ocular motor-related brain areas are larger, including the prefrontal eye fields, parietal and frontal eye fields, cerebellar vermis, thalamus, and basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marx et al., 2004</xref>). It has been argued that eye closure can alter the processing mode of the sensory system by decoupling geniculostriate processing in favor of enhanced thalamocortical coupling in non-visual brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodoehl et al., 2015</xref>). While it remains an important question whether this type of intrinsic regulation can modulate visual sensitivity, it is a difficult question to answer because any comparison between eyes open and eyes closed conditions necessarily excludes the ability to measure visual sensitivity using external visual inputs. Using the short-term monocular deprivation paradigm described above where one eye is deprived of its visual input for a short period of time, we have been able to assess the role of the internal state (comparing eyes open with eyes close behind the deprivation patch) for visual sensitivity and changes in binocular balance in adult humans. In particular, we directly compare the monocular deprivation effects, as assessed by changes in EEG power, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs), and contrast sensitivity, during the period when the patched eye (PE) is kept either open or closed <italic>behind</italic> the patch. We derive contrast gain and ocular dominance changes that occur as a result of patching one eye for a 2.5 hr period when the eye <italic>behind</italic> the patch is either open or closed. The results show that the short-term monocular deprivation effect can be modulated by the internal state in the absence of visual stimulation and is greater when the eye behind the occlude is kept open (i.e., eye-open state).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The immediate effects of open vs. close of the PE on intrinsic neural oscillations and the unpatched eye’s sensitivity</title><p>To investigate whether there is an internal state difference in intrinsic neural oscillations when only one eye is open or closed, we recruited 20 normal adults and measured the amplitudes of their alpha oscillations at the resting state with the two eyes closed, two eyes open, monocular patching with the PE open, and monocular patching with the PE closed. Here, we focused on the alpha oscillation because it is the strongest intrinsic neural oscillation in the brain, which is the hallmark of internal state changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boytsova and Danko, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> shows the amplitude spectrum averaged across subjects for the four conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows the average amplitude at the alpha peak frequency.

Under complete darkness conditions, such changes cannot be related to exogenous visual stimulation, suggesting that the differences may be caused by the switching of involuntary preliminary attention from internally directed attention specific for the REC state to externally directed attention specific for the REO state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boytsova and Danko, 2010</xref>). To our knowledge, we are the first to study the difference in brain state on visual sensitivity and changes in binocular balance in human adults. This was achieved by a monocular deprivation paradigm, with the PE that was being deprived of all visual input, being either open or closed. We show evidence that the PE-open and -closed states induce differences in alpha amplitude, which is quite similar with the differences in internal state when <italic>both eyes</italic> are open vs. when both eyes are closed.</p><p>The elevation of alpha oscillations when closing the PE, both for the resting state and SSVEP sessions, results in a reduction of contrast sensitivity of the UPE during deprivation of the other eye. This between-eye internal state effect suggests that these modulations of sensitivity by internal state manipulations are occurring at a binocular site. We also show that there is an endogenous modulation of the aftereffect from short-term monocular deprivation; the change in ocular dominance that results from such deprivation can be enhanced when the PE is kept open under the patch during the deprivation period. We show that this is true for binocular combination and also binocular rivalry even though the underlying mechanisms for these two tasks are thought to be very different; the former involves interocular gain control in early visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2010</xref>) and the latter involves interocular competition and top-down influences from high-level visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tong et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The unique aspect of the present study is that we modulate the brain’s internal state with one eye open and determine its impact on visual processing for both monocular contrast detection and binocular combination. By the manipulation of the internal states with one eye open or closed and assessing the visual sensitivity to the other eye, we can combine internal state manipulations with visual stimulation. We found that the alpha amplitude increased by 23.3% and 18.1% in the resting state and during visual stimulations, respectively, for the PE eye-closed condition compared to the PE eye-open condition. We demonstrate that both visual sensitivity and the regulation of binocular balance can be modulated by internal neural state. We showed that by keeping the eye under the patch open, the immediate SSVEP amplitude and contrast sensitivity of UPE was increased, the resultant contrast gain and ocular dominance change when removing the occlude after 2.5 hr patching was enhanced. It should be emphasized that these changes are temporary because contrast gain and ocular dominance return to baseline levels after a certain period of time. However, there are differences in recovery time scales between tasks, which may be due to the fact that different tasks may reflect different aspects of striate and extrastriata function. In particular, the binocular perceived phase change in binocular combination which may rely on the involvement of phase-sensitive simple cells in the primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2010</xref>) appears to recover to baseline within 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In contrast, changes in binocular rivalry, which involve more complex processing at multiple levels (involving extrastriate feedback as well as intrastriate processes) in the visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tong et al., 2006</xref>), persist at the 30’ post-measure session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). However, although we didn’t measure further effects beyond 30 min, it would be premature to conclude that this manipulation would have limited clinical significance. This study involved the investigation of the effects of only one single session of 2.5 hr patching. Multiple daily patching sessions over a number of months are known have a more sustained effect and this sustained effect may be further enhanced by modulation of the internal state. In fact, studies have suggested that depriving the amblyopic eye for 2.5 hr can strengthen the amblyopic eye’s contribution in binocular viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhou et al., 2013b</xref>), and repeated daily short-term monocular deprivation of the amblyopic eye not only can recover visual acuity of the amblyopic eye but lead to a more balanced binocular vision in adult amblyopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lunghi et al., 2019c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), which imply that monocular patching could have sustained therapeutic benefits to be implemented as a means to rebalance the visual system of amblyopic patients and improve their monocular acuity. Our study, combined with previous studies, suggest that it would be more effective to ensure that the eye remains open under the patch during treatment. On the other hand, the more traditional therapy for amblyopia is to patch the fellow good eye to force the amblyopic eye to improve. No one has ever considered whether the eye under the patch should be open or closed. The efficacy of this approach might be improved if the child was instructed to keep their fellow eye open under the patch. This may require a redesigned patch with enough eye clearance to ensure this is possible.</p><p>The differences that we found in brain states could be explained by the contrasting dynamics of GABA, which has implications in interpreting MRS measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kurcyus et al., 2018</xref>). In complete darkness, GABA concentration decreases after eye opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kurcyus et al., 2018</xref>). GABA has been shown to be correlated with changes in sensory eye dominance following short-term monocular deprivation, where resting GABA concentration decreases after deprivation and this decrease in GABA correlates with the individuals’ binocular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lunghi et al., 2015b</xref>). Animal models have confirmed that GABA can mediate the neuroplastic change in primary visual cortex through a long-range cortical fibers that connect the large basket cells in the superficial cortical layers of the same and opposite ocular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzás et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sengpiel et al., 1994</xref>), and short-term monocular deprivation effects are associated with reduced GABAergic inhibition in layer 4 of V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reynaud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tso et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the most parsimonious explanation is that deprivation with the PE open is expected to reduce GABA levels more compared to deprivation with the PE closed, and thus induce more changes in sensory eye dominance as a result of short-term deprivation.</p><p>Our results suggest that having the eye open under the patch, even though this does not change the exogenous stimulation because the eye is occluded, it will result in an enhanced short-term effect for ocular dominance due solely to the internal neural state associated with a reduction of alpha inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Wenzhou Medical University.

Electrode impedances were kept below 10 kΩ. The electrode REF on the cap between Cz and CPz was used as reference, and the electrode AFz was used as ground. EEG data were band-pass filtered from 1 to 30 Hz. For the resting-state conditions (conditions 1–4), EEG recordings of the first 10 s were removed to reduce the influence of artifacts, the remaining data were divided into 7 s epochs (i.e., same with the SSVEP-test time); for SSVEP recordings in conditions 5 and 6, EEGs of the first 2 s and the last 1 s were removed for each trial. To get the peak amplitude of alpha-band frequency, the amplitude spectrum for each epoch of each channel (occipital and parietal electrodes) was derived through fast Fourier transform (FFT) and was then averaged across epochs and channels. Then, Savitzky-Golay filter was performed on the averaged spectrum, and the peak value between 8 and 13 Hz was taken as the peak amplitude of alpha-band oscillation. To get the amplitude of SSVEP signals, we first averaged the EEG data across all trials and channels, and then derived the amplitude spectrum with FFT. The amplitude of the second harmonic at 15 Hz was taken as the SSVEP amplitude. To reduce the influence of large variations of SSVEP amplitude across subjects on the statistical results, the amplitude of SSVEPs of all conditions for each subject were normalized (divided) by the mean SSVEP amplitude across all conditions. The normalized amplitudes were then multiplied by the mean amplitudes across all subjects. Alpha amplitudes were normalized in the same way.</p><p>In a behavioral test, we measured contrast sensitivity for the UPE when the dominant eye was occluded. Eighteen observers, 13 of whom were the same as the EEG test, participated in the behavioral measurement. The behavioral test contains two conditions: the PE-open condition and the PE-close condition. The order of two conditions was counterbalanced across subjects. In this test, the contrast sensitivity was measured using an adjustment method. In particular, a 45° or 135° oriented sinewave grating (2 cycles/°, 8° in diameter) was presented to the UPE with an initial contrast lower than the observer’s threshold. During the measurement, subjects were instructed to adjust the contrast of the grating by key pressing until they were just able to discriminate the orientation of the grating, and this contrast level was taken as the contrast threshold. Trials that the subject made a correct judgment about the orientation of the grating were included for the contrast threshold calculation. Contrast sensitivity was defined as the inverse of contrast threshold. There were 40 trials for each condition. Subjects practiced 40–60 trials before the formal test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>The aftereffect of short-term patching on monocular contrast sensitivity</title><p>Twelve new observers participated in four patching sections. As with the psychophysical binocular test, each patching section consisted of three consecutive stages: a pre-deprivation measurement of contrast sensitivity (baseline), a 2.5 hr monocular deprivation stage, and a post-deprivation measurement of contrast sensitivity. For each observer, the dominant eye (assessed by the hole-in-the-card test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dane and Dane, 2004</xref>) was chosen for short-term monocular deprivation. Observers were free to do any visual work, except sleeping or exercising under patching. During the monocular deprivation stage, observers’ dominant eye was patched by a black patch with the PE open in sections M1&amp;M3 and with the PE closed in sections M2&amp;M4 (a medical pressure-sensitive adhesive tape was also used to ensure observers’ PE was closed). Given that the deprivation effect does not last for more than 1 day according to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Min et al., 2019</xref>), each condition was tested on a separate day in a random order so that the interval between each two session was at least 24 hr, to prevent the perceptual changes after monocular deprivation from being carried over to a subsequent session.</p><p>An orientation discrimination task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) was used to measure monocular contrast sensitivity of the PE (sections M1&amp;M2) and UPE (sections M3&amp;M4). In this task, the monocular contrast function was measured using a constant stimuli method. In particular, a vertical or horizontal oriented sinewave grating (0.46 cycle/°, 4.33°×4.33°) was presented to the PE (sections M1&amp;M2) or UPE (sections M3&amp;M4). During the measurement, the unmeasured eye was patched by an opaque patch. Subjects were instructed to answer whether the orientation of the grating was vertical or horizontal by key pressing. Probabilities of correct identification were measured at six contrast levels; each level contains 75 trials, lasting for 15 min. We fitted the psychometric functions using Quick functions with parametric maximum likelihood estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Watson, 1979</xref>). The parameter alpha of the Quick function represents the threshold corresponding to 81.6% accuracy, whose mean and variances were determined by 500 times’ bootstrap simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>). Contrast sensitivity was defined as the inverse of contrast threshold. Using this approach, observers’ monocular contrast sensitivity of each eye was assessed before the deprivation and at 0’ and 30’ after the completion of the 2.5 hr of monocular deprivation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and procedure of psychophysical monocular test.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The monocular contrast sensitivity task.

Each patching section also consisted of three consecutive stages: a pre-deprivation measurement of sensory eye balance (baseline), a 2.5 hr monocular deprivation stage and a post-deprivation measurement of sensory eye balance. For each observer, the dominant eye (assessed by the hole-in-the-card test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dane and Dane, 2004</xref>) was chosen for short-term monocular deprivation. Observers were free to do any visual work, except sleeping or exercising under patching. During the monocular deprivation stage, observers’ dominant eye was patched by a black patch with the PE open in sections B1&amp;B3 and with the PE closed in sections B2&amp;B4 (a medical pressure-sensitive adhesive tape was also used to ensure observers’ PE was closed). Different deprivation conditions were conducted in a random order on different days for different observers.</p><p>In sections B1&amp;B2, a binocular phase combination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2013a</xref>) was used to quantitatively assess the degree of sensory eye balance, in which the binocularly perceived phase was measured and used as an index of sensory eye dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). In particular, two horizontal sinewave gratings (0.46 cycle/°, 4.33°×4.33°) with equal and opposite phase-shift of 22.5° relative to the center screen were dichoptically presented to the two eyes; the contrast of the UPE was fixed at 100% and the contrast of the PE was chosen close to an individuals’ balance point in binocular phase combination before the deprivation (at that balance point, observer’s two eyes are equally effective in binocular phase combination and the binocular perceptive phase is 0°). Two configurations were used to cancel any potential positional bias. In configuration 1, the phase-shift was +22.5° from horizontal in the UPE and –22.5° from horizontal in the PE and in configuration 2, the reverse. Each configuration was repeated eight times in one measurement session, in which 16 trials (8 repetitions × 2 configurations) were randomly interleaved. Normally, subjects could finish one measurement in 3 min after a short period of practice. Observers’ binocular perceived phase was calculated by the averaged difference between the two configurations and was assessed before deprivation and at 0’, 3’, 6’, 9’, and 30’ after the completion of the 2.5 hr of monocular deprivation. Thus, if the PE became stronger, the binocular perceived phase would be decreased, otherwise, if the PE became weaker, the binocular perceived phase would be increased.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and procedure of psychophysical binocular test.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The binocular phase combination task.

In this task, the interocular ratio of total phase duration (UPE/PE) was measured and used as an index of sensory eye dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). In particular, two vertically orthogonally oriented sinewave gratings (0.46 cycle/°, 4.33°×4.33°) were dichoptically presented to the two eyes; the contrast of the nondominant eye was fixed at 80%, and the contrast of the dominant eye was chosen close to an individuals’ balance point in binocular rivalry before deprivation (at that balance point, observer’s two eyes are equally effective in binocular rivalry and the ratio of total phase duration closed to 1). Each test session consists of two 90 s sub-blocks for two configurations: in configuration1, the orientation was 135° in the UPE and was 45° in the PE; in configuration 2, the orientation was 45° in the UPE and was 135° in the PE. Using this approach, observers’ eye dominance ratio was calculated by the ratio between the UPE dominant duration and the PE dominant duration, and assessed before the deprivation and at 0’, 3’, 6’, 9’, and 30’ after the completion of the 2.5 hr of monocular deprivation.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Eric D Gaier as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lois Smith as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise language re: causation in manipulating α activity.</p><p>2) Revise language re: &quot;neuroplasticity&quot; and &quot;endogenous.&quot;</p><p>3) Revise language in the Discussion re: GABA and pulvino-cortical inhibition (too speculative).</p><p>4) Improve the clarity of figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The statement from the abstract: &quot;In this study we modulate the neural oscillations that determines the internal neural state to demonstrate that endogenous factors play a critical role in not only baseline contrast sensitivity but also the extent to which the adult visual system can undergo neuroplastic change in binocular balance&quot; is representative of the major conclusions reached by the authors but is misleading in two important respects. First, while the investigators demonstrate changes to oscillatory activity as a function of eye open status under the patch, they do not directly manipulate oscillatory activity. It is acknowledged that the authors demonstrate a correlation between oscillatory effect and changes to SSVEP amplitude and contrast sensitivity, but again this does not demonstrate causality. Therefore, the effects of eye open status under the patch are only associated with these oscillatory changes, and their ability to conclude that the other observed effects result from changes in oscillatory activity is overstated. This should be modified in the abstract and throughout the text. Second, the term &quot;neuroplastic change [plasticity]&quot; can be generally applied to the subject of study here, but their use is misleading to audiences to whom these studies are most relevant. In particular, the (&quot;neuroplastic&quot;) change imparted by these manipulations is essentially inconsequential, fleeting effects on sensory sensitivity with less than an hour. The term neuroplasticity is traditionally applied to long-term effects, especially when those effects are read out following cessation of experimental manipulations. This is not to undermine the potential importance of these findings, but they should be more accurately represented. The title and text should be modified to be more specific with regards to what was studied and what the main conclusion was rather than making such broad claims.</p><p>2. The abstract should focus less on background (currently 3 sentences) and more on the results (currently 1 sentence without specification of the direction of change). Additionally, the nature of the manipulations (see point #1 above) should be described.</p><p>3. The introduction defines what is meant by &quot;endogenous&quot; via contrast with what are defined as &quot;exogenous&quot; influences including image properties, exercise, visual pathology, and BMI. However, many would consider these to also engage &quot;endogenous&quot; factor as opposed to strictly exogenous factors such as pharmacologic, external brain stimulation, etc. Further to this point, the closed eye is mechanically taped shut per methods, and whether the patient's levator muscle is actually relaxed or active (as would be more of an &quot;endogenous&quot; factor as opposed to &quot;exogenous&quot; mechanical closure) may be important but is not controlled for here. As such, the term endogenous should be reconsidered and substituted.</p><p>4. The authors cite broad spectrum changes as a function of eye open/closed status, but they only seem to examine and show changes in α power. Additionally, though speculative, the discussion of GABAergic activity as a potential mechanism is appreciated.</p><p>5. The authors should report and comment on the magnitudes of these effects (EEG, CS, and binocular balance) and whether they are physiologically and/or clinically relevant changes. The normalization and extensive processing of data obscures this important perspective.</p><p>6. The application of these results to amblyopia is important, and the discussion paragraph lines 287-304 is much appreciated. However, this discussion (namely the suggestion to keep the patched eye open) is over-simplified; while contrast sensitivity may be enhanced for the amblyopic eye when the strong, fellow eye is kept open under the patch, the data clearly indicate that this benefit would be negated as soon as the patch is removed via increase contrast sensitivity and shift in binocular balance in favor of the stronger, patched eye for at least 30 minutes after a treatment session. A more carefully thought-out application of these data to the treatment of amblyopia would be appreciated for the suggestion on lines 299-304. The authors should consider expanding the discussion of the papers cited in this paragraph to inform readers of what the major findings were in those studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is unclear how the use of the word &quot;neuroplastic&quot; differs from adaptation. Is there a difference?</p><p>Figure 1c- SSVEP amp increased with PE open vs closed- is there any possibility that light scatter around the patch could be entering the PE open?</p><p>Figure three y axis- contrast sensitivity change (in % change)?</p><p>Why plot figure 3 as change from baseline and then plot figure 4 as a ratio- both figures are normalized in different ways but neither show the actual data (i.e. contrast sensitivity values). Is the ratio calculated by dividing contrast sensitivity of PE /UPE or is it calculated by dividing CHANGE in contrast sensitivity of PE/UPE?</p><p>&quot;Clearly, the perceived phase changes in a more minus direction for both of the two monocular deprivation conditions.&quot; This is not clear- what does more minus direction mean in terms of binocular balance.</p><p>&quot;Compared with deprivation with PE closed, deprivation with PE open would be expected to reduce the GABA levels and thus induced more change in sensory eye dominance as a result of short-term deprivation. &quot; Other than just presuming a reduction in GABA, it is unclear how the reduced GABA levels would induce a larger change in sensory eye dominance.</p><p>&quot;On the other hand, previous studies show that occipital α inhibition originates from the pulvinar of the visual thalamus (Liu, de Zwart et al., 2012), our findings may suggest the role of pulvino-cortical inhibition in regulating ocular dominance plasticity in the early visual cortex.&quot; This claim is not well supported by the data.</p><p>Although the authors comment that the mechanism between binocular rivalry and binocular imbalance is different, they do not discuss any reasoning for why the phase change in binocular combination appears to almost recover to baseline, while the changes in binocular rivalry persist. Do the authors have any explanation for this difference?</p><p>What type of patch was used for the initial set of experiments? Was it the same type of patch for the monocular deprivation experiments (reported as a black patch)? Was there any perception of luminance changes through the patch? Was the patch positioned any differently for eyes open vs eyes closed conditions?</p><p>For the method of adjustment contrast sensitivity test, did you only include trials that the subject made a correct judgment about the orientation of the grating?</p><p>The legend of Figure 7 &quot;started at multiple time points (0-30 min)&quot; is confusing. My understanding is that CS was tested immediately after monocular deprivation (0 min) and then 30 minutes after deprivation.</p><p>The methods section could benefit from additional clarification regarding the timing of binocular balance and rivalry measures for Sections B1-B4. It says this was randomized, but there may be differences in monocular deprivation effects depending on if binocular phase combination or binocular rivalry was measured first or second. Did the authors compare these two groups to see if there was any pattern?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83815.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise language re: causation in manipulating α activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on Reviewer #1’s suggestions, we have revised our demonstration in manipulating α activity in Title, Abstract and the main text, details of which can be found in our response to Reviewer #1’s Comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Revise language re: &quot;neuroplasticity&quot; and &quot;endogenous.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>In response to Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2’s suggestion that the use of &quot;neuroplastic change [plasticity]&quot; may be misleading to audiences, we have rephrased the Title and emphasized the short-term changes in Introduction, and modified “endogenous factors” to “the internal neural states”.

In particular, the (&quot;neuroplastic&quot;) change imparted by these manipulations is essentially inconsequential, fleeting effects on sensory sensitivity with less than an hour. The term neuroplasticity is traditionally applied to long-term effects, especially when those effects are read out following cessation of experimental manipulations. This is not to undermine the potential importance of these findings, but they should be more accurately represented. The title and text should be modified to be more specific with regards to what was studied and what the main conclusion was rather than making such broad claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. It’s right that we found an association between the effects of eye open status under the patch and oscillatory changes, rather than a causality. We have now revised our demonstration in Title, Abstract and the main text.</p><p>We agree with the comment that the use of &quot;neuroplastic change [plasticity]&quot; may be misleading to audiences.

The abstract should focus less on background (currently 3 sentences) and more on the results (currently 1 sentence without specification of the direction of change). Additionally, the nature of the manipulations (see point #1 above) should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the Abstract:</p><p>“The adult human visual system maintains the ability to be altered by sensory deprivation. What has not been considered is whether the internal neural states modulate visual sensitivity to short-term monocular deprivation. In this study we manipulated the internal neural state and reported changes in intrinsic neural oscillations with a patched eye open or closed. We investigated the influence of eye open/eye closure on the unpatched eye’s contrast sensitivity and ocular dominance (OD) shifts induced by short-term monocular deprivation. The results demonstrate that internal neural states influence not only baseline contrast sensitivity but also the extent to which the adult visual system can undergo changes in ocular dominance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The introduction defines what is meant by &quot;endogenous&quot; via contrast with what are defined as &quot;exogenous&quot; influences including image properties, exercise, visual pathology, and BMI. However, many would consider these to also engage &quot;endogenous&quot; factor as opposed to strictly exogenous factors such as pharmacologic, external brain stimulation, etc. Further to this point, the closed eye is mechanically taped shut per methods, and whether the patient's levator muscle is actually relaxed or active (as would be more of an &quot;endogenous&quot; factor as opposed to &quot;exogenous&quot; mechanical closure) may be important but is not controlled for here. As such, the term endogenous should be reconsidered and substituted.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have modified “endogenous factors” to “internal neural states”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors cite broad spectrum changes as a function of eye open/closed status, but they only seem to examine and show changes in α power. Additionally, though speculative, the discussion of GABAergic activity as a potential mechanism is appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>Although there could be broad spectrum changes with eye open or closed, the most robust change is in the α band which is the hallmark of internal state changes (Boytsova and Danko, 2010). As shown by Figure 1a, our data indeed showed robust signals and significant changes in the α band. There were also weak signals in the β band (about 20 Hz), but without significant changes with eye open vs. closed.</p><p>We now clarified the reason for the focused analysis of the α band oscillation in the Results section.</p><p>In Line 100-102:</p><p>“Here, we focused on the α oscillation because it is the strongest intrinsic neural oscillation in the brain, which is the hallmark of internal state changes (Boytsova and Danko, 2010).”</p><p>In Line 110-111:</p><p>“There were also weak signals in the β band (Figure 1a, 20 Hz), but without significant changes in the eye-open than eye-closed condition.”</p><p>We have now discussed more about the link between GABA and the change in sensory eye dominance in Discussion (Line 414 – 439):</p><p>“The differences that we found in brain states could be explained by the contrasting dynamics of GABA, which has implications in interpreting MRS measurements (Kurcyus, Annac et al., 2018). In complete darkness, GABA concentration decreases after eye opening (Kurcyus, Annac et al., 2018). GABA has been shown to be correlated with changes in sensory eye dominance following short-term monocular deprivation, where resting GABA concentration decreases after deprivation and this decrease in GABA correlates with the individuals’ binocular changes (Lunghi, Emir et al., 2015). Animal models have confirmed that GABA can mediate the neuroplastic change in primary visual cortex through a long range cortical fibers that connect the large basket cells in the superficial cortical layers of the same and opposite ocular domains (Buzas, Eysel et al., 2001, Sengpiel, Blakemore et al., 1994), and short-term monocular deprivation effects are associated with reduced GABAergic inhibition in layer 4 of V1(Reynaud, Roux et al., 2018, Tso, Miller et al., 2017). Therefore, the most parsimonious explanation is that deprivation with the PE open is expected to reduce GABA levels more compared to deprivation with the PE closed, and thus induced more changes in sensory eye dominance as a result of short-term deprivation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors should report and comment on the magnitudes of these effects (EEG, CS, and binocular balance) and whether they are physiologically and/or clinically relevant changes. The normalization and extensive processing of data obscures this important perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have highlighted the algorithm of changing values in the Figures, explained the change of original values in the Results, and added their physiological/clinical significance in the Discussion.

This means that the short-term monocular deprivation temporally decreased the contrast sensitivity of UPE by 32.1%. In contrast, the contrast sensitivity of UPE decreased from 90.324 ± 6.791 to 69.324 ± 4.685 after 2.5 hours of monocular patching in the PE closed condition.

In contrast, in the PE closed condition, binocular perceived phase changed from -0.214 ± 0.308 degrees to -6.357 ± 1.962 degrees.

In contrast, in the PE closed condition, the eye dominance ratio changed from 0.922 ± 0.042 to 0.508 ± 0.075.

We demonstrate that both visual sensitivity and the regulation of binocular balance can be modulated by internal neural state. We showed that by keeping the eye under the patch open, the immediate SSVEP amplitude and contrast sensitivity of UPE was increased, the resultant contrast gain and ocular dominance change when removing the occlude after 2.5-hour patching was enhanced. It should be emphasized that these changes are temporary because contrast gain and ocular dominance return to baseline levels after a certain period of time. However, there are differences in recovery time scales between tasks, which may be due to the fact that different tasks may reflect different aspects of striate and extrastriata function. In particular, the binocular perceived phase change in binocular combination which may rely on the involvement of phase-sensitive simple cells in the primary visual cortex (Huang, Zhou et al., 2010) appears to recover to baseline within 30 minutes (Figure 5a). In contrast, changes in binocular rivalry, which involve more complex processing at multiple levels (involving extrastriate feedback as well as intrastriate processes) in the visual pathway (Tong, Meng et al., 2006), persist at the 30’ post-measure session (Figure 6a). However, although we didn’t measure further effects beyond 30 minutes, it would be premature to conclude that this manipulation would have limited clinical significance. This study involved the investigation of the effects of only one single session of 2.5-hour patching. Multiple daily patching sessions over a number of months are known have a more sustained effect and this sustained effect may be further enhanced by modulation of the internal state. In fact, studies have suggested that depriving the amblyopic eye for 2.5 hours can strengthen the amblyopic eye’s contribution in binocular viewing (Zhou, Thompson et al., 2013), and repeated daily short-term monocular deprivation of the amblyopic eye not only can recover visual acuity of the amblyopic eye but lead to a more balanced binocular vision in adult amblyopes (Lunghi, Sframeli et al., 2019, Zhou, He et al., 2019), which imply that monocular patching could have sustained therapeutic benefits to be implemented as a means to rebalance the visual system of amblyopic patients and improve their monocular acuity. Our study, combined with previous studies, suggest that it would be more effective to ensure that the eye remains open under the patch during treatment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The application of these results to amblyopia is important, and the discussion paragraph lines 287-304 is much appreciated. However, this discussion (namely the suggestion to keep the patched eye open) is over-simplified; while contrast sensitivity may be enhanced for the amblyopic eye when the strong, fellow eye is kept open under the patch, the data clearly indicate that this benefit would be negated as soon as the patch is removed via increase contrast sensitivity and shift in binocular balance in favor of the stronger, patched eye for at least 30 minutes after a treatment session. A more carefully thought-out application of these data to the treatment of amblyopia would be appreciated for the suggestion on lines 299-304. The authors should consider expanding the discussion of the papers cited in this paragraph to inform readers of what the major findings were in those studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded the Discussion (Line 372 – 408):</p><p>“We found that the α amplitude increased by 23.3% and 18.1% in the resting state and during visual stimulations, respectively, for the PE eye closed condition compared to the PE eye open condition.
