<italic>SPRTN</italic> gene. Cells derived from patients with SPRTN mutations elicit genomic instability and people afflicted with this syndrome developed hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we describe the molecular mechanism by which SPRTN contributes to genome stability and normal cellular homeostasis. We show that SPRTN is a DNA-dependent mammalian protease required for resolving cytotoxic DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs)— a function that had only been attributed to the metalloprotease Wss1 in budding yeast. We provide genetic evidence that SPRTN and Wss1 function distinctly in vivo to resolve DPCs. Upon DNA and ubiquitin binding, SPRTN can elicit proteolytic activity; cleaving DPC substrates and itself. <italic>SPRTN</italic> null cells or cells derived from patients with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome are impaired in the resolution of covalent DPCs in vivo. Collectively, SPRTN is a mammalian protease required for resolving DNA-protein crosslinks in vivo whose function is compromised in Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21491.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21491.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA-protein crosslinks</kwd><kwd>SPARTAN</kwd><kwd>SPRTN</kwd><kwd>Dvc1</kwd><kwd>c1orf124</kwd><kwd>Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome</kwd><kwd>progeria</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>metalloprotease</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>Topoisomerase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CEF-MC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Frontiers Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopez-Mosqueda</surname><given-names>Jaime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Zentrum CGT and Loewe Network Ub Net</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SPRTN is a protease essential for the repair of cytotoxic DNA-protein cross links and this function is defective in patients afflicted with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome -a segmental progeroid syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA is continuously subjected to various forms of damage stemming from endogenous and exogenous sources. The DNA lesions are highly diverse and can include UV-induced photoproducts, inter- and intra-strand crosslinks, abasic sites, oxidative damage, bulky chemical lesions or single and double strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoeijmakers, 2009</xref>). Specialized DNA repair systems have evolved to repair the multitude of lesions and these repair systems collectively contribute to maintaining genome stability and cellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>). Numerous proteins assemble on DNA to carryout essential metabolic transactions and their recruitment and removal is precisely regulated.</p><p>Naturally occurring cellular processes, such as histone demethylation, can also lead to covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) of neighboring proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsukada et al., 2006</xref>). DPCs, if not resolved, are formidable impediments to ongoing DNA replication forks, gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stingele and Jentsch, 2015</xref>) and conceivably chromatin remodeling. As DNA replication machinery synthesizes new DNA at the replication fork, DNA supercoiling is created ahead of and behind the replication fork, profoundly altering DNA topology. Topoisomerases 1 and 2 (Top1 and Top2) relax DNA supercoiling by breaking and re-ligating one or both strands of the DNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pommier and Marchand, 2012</xref>). Top1 and Top2 naturally form DPCs as part of an obligate intermediate step required for the re-ligation step. Because enzymatic reactions have an intrinsic error rate, malfunction in the re-ligation steps cause Top1 and Top2 to be permanently trapped on DNA in the form of DPCs. DPCs must be adequately resolved to not only ensure the timely completion of chromosome duplication and segregation but also for the synthesis of proteins that are necessary for cellular homeostasis. Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which DPCs are repaired remain poorly characterized.</p><p>Recently, a repair mechanism that resolves DPCs was identified in the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balakirev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). Wss1 was shown to counteract DPCs induced by the anti-cancer agent Camptothecin (CPT) or those induced by the unspecific crosslinking agent, formaldehyde. Moreover, yeast cells missing key components of the DPC repair system succumb to cell death upon exposure to CPT, underscoring the importance of DPC removal. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract, an analogous DPC repair mechanism has been identified in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duxin et al., 2014</xref>), however the identity of the protease(s) involved was not elucidated. The recent identification of a DPC-repair pathway suggests that DNA-protein crosslink resolution is an important repair mechanism that is conserved throughout evolution. However, it is unknown whether a protease that counteracts DPCs exists in mammalian cells.</p><p>DNA is an important molecule that is targeted for time-dependent deterioration. This is highlighted in the rare inherited disorders called segmental progeroid syndromes in which genome maintenance is compromised and select indicators of physiological aging are accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lopez-Otin et al., 2013</xref>). SPRTN (also known as Dvc1 or <italic>C1orf124</italic>) was initially discovered as being an important protein for translesion DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghosal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juhasz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Machida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>). SPRTN is a multi-domain containing protein that is endowed with an SprT-like domain, a SHP and PIP box as well as a ubiquitin binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain. SPRTN binding to ubiquitin and to PCNA was suggested to be critical for its recruitment to sites of UV-induced DNA damage, while interactions with a ubiquitin-dependent molecular segregase p97 (known as VCP in higher eukaryotes and Cdc48 in yeast) are implicated in extraction of the translesion polymerase Pol eta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the presence of an SprT-like metalloprotease domain with similarity to the WLM domain in Wss1, it was proposed that SPRTN and Wss1 could belong to a related family of DPC-resolving proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stingele et al., 2015</xref>). Later work revealed that SPRTN is an essential protein, as mice with homozygous null alleles die very early during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maskey et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, hypomorphic murine <italic>SPRTN</italic> alleles render mice with premature aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maskey et al., 2014</xref>). Very recently, we identified rare <italic>SPRTN</italic> germ-line mutations in three patients from two unrelated families afflicted with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lessel et al., 2014</xref>). The first proband inherited homozygous point mutations that resulted in a premature stop codon and subsequent loss of the carboxyl-terminal half of the SPRTN protein (herein referred to as SPRTN-∆C). The second set of probands inherited biallelic mutations such that one allele was also a point mutation that, coincidentally, is highly reminiscent to the SPRTN-∆C, while the second allele has a tyrosine to cysteine substitution at position 117 (herein referred to as SPRTN-Y117C). Individuals harboring these mutations were shown to have segmental progeroid features and developed early onset hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lessel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruijs et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, cells derived from affected individuals showed genomic instability associated with DNA replication stress. DNA fiber assays confirmed slower replication fork movements in cells from affected individuals and the slowing of replication forks was further exacerbated with the replication inhibitor Aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lessel et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that cells with SPRTN mutations had difficulty replicating through blocking lesions.</p><p>In this report we identify SPRTN as the first mammalian protease that is required for the resolution of DPCs in cells. Cells deficient in SPRTN expression or cells from individuals with SPRTN mutations are sensitive to formaldehyde, CPT and Etoposide, treatments that are known to induce covalent DNA-protein crosslinks. Moreover, we show that drug-induced DPCs are not resolved and are sustained in cells lacking SPRTN proteolytic activity. In vitro, SPRTN elicits proteolytic activity as it can readily act on itself and other DNA binding proteins. Finally, we provide molecular insight into the defects in patients afflicted with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome and show that DPC resolution is compromised in these individuals rendering them susceptible to premature aging and cancer predisposition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SPRTN reconstitution in yeast</title><p>Since the recent discovery of a dedicated DPC-resolution mechanism in the budding yeast, there has been much speculation that SPRTN is the mammalian orthologue of the yeast protease Wss1. Although SPRTN and Wss1 share some common domains like a zinc metalloprotease domain and a SHP/VIM domain (p97/Cdc48 binding), they are also distinct in that they recognize substrates differently. SPRTN preferentially binds to ubiquitin via its UBZ domain whereas Wss1 binds to SUMO via its SIM motives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balakirev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghosal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juhasz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Machida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the similarities in domain organization, the overall amino acid sequence conservation between SPRTN and Wss1 is relatively poor, particularly within the protease domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), sharing only the conserved signature HEXXH motif found in the SprT family of metalloproteases, with glutamic acid being the catalytic amino acid. Recently, it was shown that Wss1 provides resistance to CPT in the absence of Tdp1, a tyrosyl phosphodiesterase that removes Top1 remnants from 3’ ends of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pommier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pouliot et al., 1999</xref>), such that Wss1 and Tdp1 double deletion mutant strains die upon exposure to the DPC-inducing drug CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balakirev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). This experimental setting provided an opportunity to directly test whether SPRTN can functionally complement Wss1 activity and rescue the CPT-dependent lethality observed in <italic>wss1∆ tdp1∆</italic> cells. Towards this aim, we expressed SPRTN or mutants thereof under the control of the endogenous Wss1 promoter. It is noteworthy that <italic>wss1∆ tdp1∆</italic> cells accumulate spontaneous second-site mutations that often suppressed the CPT-induced lethality. To circumvent this complication, we opted for a dual protein depletion system where Wss1 transcription is under control of a tetracycline repressible promoter and Wss1 itself is reduced by N-end rule degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachmair et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gnanasundram and Kos, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this system, Wss1 depletion occurred as rapidly as 40 min after doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and without overt consequences to the overall fitness of the cells. Consistent with previous reports, <italic>wss1∆ tdp1∆</italic> cells lost viability when exposed to CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Mullally et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, expression of SPRTN could not support the growth of <italic>wss1∆ tdp1∆</italic> cells on CPT containing media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>SPRTN</italic> also failed to complement Wss1 activity when SPRTN protein levels was increased to high levels using the inducible Galactose promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lack of functional complementation was not simply due to poor induction of SPRTN expression or a failure of SPRTN to reach the nucleus, as SPRTN expression is readily detected by Western blot analysis and its expression co-localizes with DAPI nuclear stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because SPRTN failed to functionally complement Wss1 protease activity, we could not fully characterize SPRTN-Y117C or SPRTN-∆C in this experimental setting. We did observe, however, that ectopic SPRTN expression induced a slow-growth phenotype, in a catalytic-dependent manner, such that neither SPRTN-E112A nor SPRTN-Y117C expression induced this slow-growth phenotype in <italic>tdp1∆</italic> cells. This genetic assay suggests that SPRTN-E112A and SPRTN-Y117C are catalytically inactive in yeast and that SPRTN expression elicits a dominant negative function over endogenous Wss1. Taken together, we conclude that SPRTN cannot functionally complement Wss1 function due to either additional regulation of SPRTN not present in yeast or to inherently different pathways between yeast and metazoan cells involved in DPC resolution.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21491.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SPRTN fails to complement Wss1 activity in yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of SPRTN and Wss1 domain organization.

We took advantage of the fact that Etoposide induces Top2 covalent complexes (Top2cc) on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2011</xref>) and that these DPCs can be detected using the in vivo complex of enzyme (ICE) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trask and Muller, 1988</xref>). Briefly, the ICE assay depends on the separation of Top2 covalently bound to DNA from free Top2 by ultracentrifugation through a cesium chloride gradient. DNA will pellet along with Top2 covalently bound to DNA, while free Top2 will remain in suspension near the top of the centrifuge tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Equal amounts of isolated DNA are subsequently dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The presence of Top2cc can be detected with specific antibodies raised against Top2 subunits. Using this experimental approach, Top2 DPCs were not appreciably detected in untreated cells but were detected in DNA isolated from control SPRTN cells treated with Etoposide for 0.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Subramanian et al., 1995</xref>). The Top2 signal diminished 1 hr after Etoposide treatment, indicating that Top2 had been cleared from DNA. In <italic>SPRTN-KO</italic> MEFs, Top2 signals are also detected at 0.5 hr into the Etoposide treatment. In contrast to control MEFs, Top2 signals are sustained throughout the duration of the time course in <italic>SPRTN-KO</italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that Top2 is not proteolyzed in cells lacking the SPRTN protease. To further substantiate our findings, we reconstituted conditional <italic>SPRTN-KO</italic> MEFs with human <italic>SPRTN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or mutant alleles and analyzed Top2cc resolution using the ICE assay. As expected, knockout MEFs reconstituted with SPRTN-WT are able to resolve Top2cc from DNA, albeit with slower kinetics than the control <italic>SPRTN</italic> MEFs probably due to low levels of ectopic SPRTN expression. Contrary to SPRTN-WT, <italic>SPRTN-KO</italic> MEFs reconstituted with <italic>SPRTN-∆C</italic> were delayed in Top2cc resolution under these conditions. Notably, <italic>SPRTN-KO</italic> MEFs could not be stably reconstituted with either <italic>SPRTN-E112A</italic> or <italic>SPRTN-Y117C</italic>. Nevertheless, SPRTN-KO MEFs reconstituted with either SPRTN-E112A or SPRTN-Y117C by transient transfection, failed to resolve Top2 DPCs. This finding is consistent with the notion that these alleles code for mutant SPRTN proteins lacking essential proteolytic activity. These results strongly suggest that SPRTN is the mammalian protease responsible for DPC removal and that this function is compromised in cells expressing SPRTN-Y117C, SPRTN-E112A or SPRTN-∆C mutant proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SPRTN is a DNA binding protease in vivo and in vitro</title><p>SPRTN contains an SprT-like domain within its amino-terminus with the characteristic HEXXH catalytic signature motif found in zinc-dependent metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In this screen we found that histones were significantly over-represented as candidate SPRTN substrates. It is likely that core histones can be relevant SPRTN substrates as they are intimately associated with DNA and are poised to become crosslinked upon exposure to endogenous formaldehyde. Consistent with this initial finding, we can observe the presence of a clear histone H3 fragment when SPRTN is overexpressed in 293T-HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, the histone H3 cleavage product is not detected when SPRTN-E112A is over-expressed irrespective of stimulation with Etoposide and despite its chromatin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with this mutation being catalytically inactive. We next assessed the effect of SPRTN-∆C overexpression with respect to histone H3 cleavage. Notably, SPRTN-∆C overexpression does not produce histone H3 cleavage fragments despite the fact that we observe SPRTN-∆C chromatin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result suggests that SPRTN needs the C-terminus region to either target histone H3 or for DNA binding.</p><p>To distinguish between these two possibilities, we asked if SPRTN could directly bind to DNA. We used purified full length SPRTN and a truncated fragment composed of amino acids 1–216 (SPRTN-∆C<sup>1–216</sup>) and assessed DNA binding using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) that incorporated the use of a fluorescently labeled 39-mer single or double stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (6-FAM-ssODN or 6-FAM-dsODN, respectively). As SPRTN levels were gradually increased, we observed a corresponding increase in the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA probe, indicative of SPRTN binding to single or double stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D)</xref>. The electrophoretic mobility shift is not detected when we employ the SPRTN-∆C<sup>1–216</sup> protein in this EMSA assay. This result suggests that a region(s) located in the carboxyl-terminal half of SPRTN contains a DNA binding domain as detected in purified in vitro binding assays and that this domain is probably required to target histone H3 for degradation in cells.</p><p>To formally test whether SPRTN is a protease in vitro, we utilized purified recombinant SPRTN in in vitro cleavage reactions. Purified SPRTN elicits auto-cleaving activity in the presence of double stranded DNA similar to that observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, the auto-cleaving activity is dependent on the conserved catalytic glutamic acid residue at position 112, because the SPRTN-E112A mutant is devoid of autocatalytic activity. In addition, SPRTN autocatalytic activity is inhibited by the zinc chelator, 1,10-Phenantroline, indicating that SPRTN is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease. In vitro, the SPRTN-Y117C mutant protein has no detectable autocatalytic activity. In sharp contrast to the SPRTN-Y117C, and to what is observed in cells upon SPRTN-∆C expression, recombinant SPRTN-∆C protein is catalytically active as it auto-cleaves into smaller cleavage fragments in in vitro reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To further characterize SPRTN as a protease, we showed that purified SPRTN cleaves itself and histone H3 in in vitro settings in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, we did not detect histone H3 cleavage when treated with SPRTN-E112A. Similarly, SPRTN-Y117C also failed to cleave histone H3 at the latest time-point. To test whether SPRTN can directly act on Top2, we used purified SPRTN or SPRTN-E112A and purified Top2 in in vitro cleavage reactions. We found that SPRTN, but not SPRTN-E112A, can reduce the levels of full length Top2. Interestingly, the addition of recombinant ubiquitin can enhance not only Top2 cleavage, but also SPRTN self-cleavage, whereas addition of recombinant SUMO cannot mediate this enhanced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To further assess the effect of free ubiquitin on SPRTN self-cleavage, we compared the kinetics of SPRTN self-cleavage, in a time-course experiment, while in the absence or presence of ubiquitin. The addition of DNA induces SPRTN self-cleavage in a time dependent manner, with enhanced SPRTN cleavage fragments seen at later time points. This effect is further enhanced when free ubiquitin is included in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Importantly, the addition of ubiquitin has no effect on SPRTN-E112A or SPRTN-Y117C self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), ruling out the presence of a contaminating protease in our ubiquitin preparations. Taken together, these results clearly show that SPRTN is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that can proteolyze itself and other DNA binding proteins, and that presence of free ubiquitin in the reaction enhances SPRTN cleavage activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21491.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>In vitro SPRTN substrate cleavage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro SPRTN self-cleavage reactions. Purified proteins were incubated with or without DNA for 5 hr at 37°C. 1,10 Phe = 1,10 Phenanthroline, a zinc metal chelator and inhibitor of zinc metalloproteases.

In agreement with previous reports, GFP-SPRTN expression is confined to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghosal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juhasz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lessel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Machida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>). The SPRTN-Y117C mutation has no effect on localization akin to catalytic inactive SPRTN-E112A mutant. However, the GFP-SPRTN-∆C protein is evidently mislocalized to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This apparent SPRTN-∆C mislocalization suggests an obvious molecular explanation for compromised function in DPC removal. To further explore the putative NLS sequence in SPRTN, we mutated two residues in SPRTN, namely R408A and L411A and stably transduced U2OS cells with lentivirus encoding GFP-SPRTN-R408A L411A. As expected, GFP-SPRTN-R408A L411A is mislocalized to the cytoplasm similarly to the GFP-SPRTN-∆C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To explore if the NLS is sufficient for nuclear SPRTN expression, we created a chimeric protein consisting of SPRTN-∆C and the NLS from the c-myc transcription factor (SPRTN-∆C+NLS). The NLS fusion to GFP-SPRTN-∆C is sufficient for restoring nuclear expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and histone H3 cleavage in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To functionally assess the DPC resolving activity of SPRTN-∆C+NLS and of SPRTN-R408A L411A, we again employed the ICE assay. As expected, the addition of a heterologous NLS to SPRTN-∆C, as in <italic>SPRTN-∆C+NLS</italic>, enhances its Top2 resolvase activity relative to SPRTN-∆C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>). It then follows, that removal of the NLS signal from full length SPRTN, as in <italic>SPRTN-R408A L411A</italic>, would result in an attenuation of DPC resolvase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that SPRTN-∆C is hypomorphic, at least in part, due to its mislocalized expression and its inability to bind to DNA. In addition, we conclude that the NLS in SPRTN is both, necessary and sufficient, for proper nuclear localization and function.</p><p>Having already established that <italic>SPRTN-KO</italic> cells are sensitive to DPC-inducing drugs and that SPRTN has proteolytic activity both in vivo and in vitro, we asked if cells derived from patients with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome were also compromised in DPC resolving activity. To test this hypothesis explicitly, we treated patient derived lymphoblastoid (LCL) cells (B-II-1) with formaldehyde, CPT, or Etoposide and used the pan-DNA damage marker, γ-H2AX, as a proxy for DNA damage resulting from DPC-induced double strand breaks. Control LCLs show background levels of γ-H2AX staining, commonly observed in most cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Compared to control LCLs however, B-II-1 LCLs have more γ-H2AX staining in formaldehyde and Etoposide treatment as the majority of patient cells have increased DNA damage. B-II-1 LCLs contained modest increase in γ-H2AX staining when exposed to CPT treatment. To functionally test the consequence of cells expressing biallelic SPRTN mutant variants, we employed the ICE assay to assess Top2cc removal from chromatin after an acute Etoposide treatment. Consistent with SPRTN-∆C and SPRTN-Y117C mutant variants being compromised for proteolytic activity, Top2cc are removed from DNA but with slower kinetics relative to control LCLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Taken together, these results provide a molecular explanation for the defects associated with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome and shed light on how mutations in SPRTN can contribute to segmental progeroid syndrome, genome instability and hepatocellular carcinoma development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21491.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of SPRTN removal of DNA-protein crosslinks.</title><p>DNA-protein crosslinks may arise stochastically as a consequence of normal metabolic processes occurring at or in the vicinity of DNA or by exogenous sources such as Etoposide. DPCs are resolved by SPRTN to allow for unperturbed and timely DNA replication.

Because the types of DNA lesions are diverse, intricate DNA repair and checkpoint systems have evolved to detect and repair specific lesions.

Cells that have undergone mutational ablation of the carboxy-terminal half of SPRTN or single amino acid substitution of a tyrosine to cysteine at position 117 such as those identified in the Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome probands, are compromised for proteolytic activity and are sensitive to DPC-inducing agents. Our work revealed that these mutant alleles are hypomorphic for proteolytic activity for at least two reasons. First, SPRTN-∆C is missing the critical NLS at the carboxy-terminal domain that makes it necessary for nuclear import and thereby SPRTN-∆C cannot adequately reach its targets. Second, the C-terminal domain harbors a major DNA binding domain that is missing in SPRTN-∆C. Despite these shortcomings, the hypomorphic SPRTN-∆C protein retains enough proteolytic activity to sustain life. Evidently, in vitro SPRTN-∆C is catalytically active and at least one Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome patient with homozygous <italic>sprtn-∆C</italic> alleles lived through his adolescent years until eventually succumbing to hepatocellular carcinoma in early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruijs et al., 2003</xref>). In these patient derived cells, SPRTN-∆C most probably enters the nucleus of proliferating cells during each prophase – concomitant with nuclear envelope breakdown. Contrary to SPRTN-∆C expression in humans, complete genetic ablation of <italic>SPRTN</italic> is embryonic lethal in mice. This finding argues that SPRTN’s protease activity is essential for cellular viability. Consistent with this notion, conditional <italic>SPRTN</italic> MEFs failed to proliferate when reconstituted with <italic>SPRTN-E112A</italic> or <italic>SPRTN-Y117C</italic> alleles as the only <italic>SPRTN</italic> source. In addition, like the catalytic inactive SPRTN-E112A mutant protein, SPRTN-Y117C has very weak catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, mice with hypomorphic SPRTN alleles display accelerated aging features. Our finding that the <italic>SPRTN-∆C</italic> and SPRTN-Y117C alleles found in Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome patients are hypomorphic is consistent with accelerated aging phenotypes observed in the hypomorphic SPRTN mouse model - linking DPC repair deficiency to segmental progeroid syndrome.</p><p>The conservation of DNA repair mechanism across species underscores the importance of genome maintenance. SPRTN and Wss1 may form a common family of DPC resolving proteases in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stingele et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, SPRTN and Wss1 are functionally related as they are both implicated in the repair of DPCs. Mechanistically, however, differences exist as SPRTN cannot functionally complement Wss1 activity in budding yeast. This inability of SPRTN to complement Wss1 could be attributed, in part, to the differing ubiquitin and SUMO binding abilities that are also reflected in subsequent activation of their respective protease domains. In addition, Wss1 is not essential in yeast, whereas SPRTN is essential in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maskey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Winzeler et al., 1999</xref>). The fact that <italic>wss1∆</italic> yeast cells are resistant to CPT and mildly sensitive to formaldehyde, whereas <italic>SPRTN-KO MEFs</italic> are highly sensitive to CPT and formaldehyde strongly argues that partially overlapping pathways contribute to DPC bypass in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>SPRTN</italic> is also dispensable in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>), further underscoring the hypothesis that in lower eukaryotes such as in yeast and worms, other pathways can contribute to resolving DPCs.</p><p>There are numerous proteins that are intimately associated with DNA, yet these proteins are spared from indiscriminate SPRTN-dependent proteolysis. Therefore, the activity of SPRTN must be carefully regulated. How SPRTN activity is regulated to target DPCs is still an open question. One potential explanation could be that post-translational modification of SPRTN dictates whether SPRTN can access proteins for proteolysis. Specifically, the mono-ubiquitylation of SPRTN may render it in a closed/inactive conformation. Indeed, we have previously uncovered a mono-ubiquitin-mediated mechanism of inactivation for the translesion polymerase, Pol eta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bienko et al., 2010</xref>), setting precedent for this mode of regulation. Moreover, Pol eta and SPRTN are both UBZ-containing proteins and both are mono-ubiquitylated in an UBZ-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bienko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>). It is conceivably possible that mono-ubiquitylated SPRTN is inactivated because its active site and/or DNA binding site is occluded akin to how Pol eta mono-ubiquitylation prevents its recruitment to PCNA. Alternatively, in trans binding to other ubiquitylated proteins in the vicinity may lead to allosteric activation resulting in the opening of the protease domain. This model is supported by evidence that the addition of ubiquitin, but not SUMO, promotes SPRTN cleavage of Top2 in vitro. Similarly, binding to PCNA or p97 may contribute to the same phenomena, leading to a step-wise activation process in vivo. Based on these and other data we propose a model where SPRTN’s proteolytic activity is restricted by a naturally occurring conformation that occludes the protease active site. Either substrate/DNA binding or de-ubiquitination of SPRTN leads to allosteric changes in SPRTN that expose its active site thus unleashing its proteolytic activity. This mechanism appears different in the case of Wss1, whereby binding to SUMO rather than to ubiquitin may act as a critical signal for Wss1 activation. Clearly more work will be required to understand the molecular mechanism underlying substrate selection for members of the DPC protease family including SPRTN and Wss1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>W303a yeast cells were used to construct targeted gene deletions using standard yeast methods.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SPRTN is a mammalian DNA-binding metalloprotease that resolves DNA-protein crosslinks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Wade Harper, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper is timely and makes several important points, including demonstrating the in vitro protease activity of SPRTN, showing that cells defective in SPRTN fail to remove Top2 from DNA, and demonstrating that mutations in Rujis-Aalfs syndrome are pathogenic. The paper also suggests roles for UB or SUMO in SPRTN activation in vitro, although the mechanisms of this isn't fully developed. This is a rapidly emerging area of DNA repair, and the paper goes some distance towards understanding the function of SPRTN. Nevertheless, the reviewers suggested improvements to the paper, including addition of missing controls and other relevant data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiments looking at the effect of UB and SUMO effects on activity could be improved and better controlled. This is especially the case if you want to be able to suggest an underlying mechanism. The pattern of cleavage of Wss1 is different when SUMO is added relative to addition of ssDNA. Do you have any info on the different cleavage patterns? Minimally, to be convincing, the input lanes would have to be shown without the Wss1 or better yet with catalytically dead Wss1.</p><p>2) For completeness, the authors need to show the levels of SPRTN over-expression in experiments where SPRTN is over-expressed.</p><p>3) Additional evidence that SPRTN auto-cleaved in vivo (when over-expressed) – rather than being cleaved post-lysis – would strengthen the paper. The fact that the mutant protein doesn't do this is a reasonable argument, but if you have data on this to include (for example a pulse chase), it would improve the paper.</p><p>4) The experiments looking at Wss1 activation by ssDNA are interesting but bring up the question of whether dsDNA also activates, particularly since the SPRTN EMSA assays were done with dsDNA (See subsection “SPRTN is a DNA binding protease in vivo and in vitro”, last paragraph and subsection “in vitro cleavage of Top2”)? This is also relevant to the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, since the extract presumably already contains DNA. The reviewers feel the paper would be strengthened by testing both in vitro binding and activation with both ssDNA and dsDNA (and possibly other types of DNA such as forks if available). If SPRTN only binds ssDNA but is activated in vitro only by dsDNA then that wouldn't fit your model and would suggest that there may be some sort of contaminant in the protein preps. These experiments would bridge what appears to be a disconnect between the protease assays and the EMSA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21491.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The experiments looking at the effect of UB and SUMO effects on activity could be improved and better controlled.

In addition, we include as controls both SPRTN-E112A and SPRTN-Y117C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We have removed the Wss1 self-cleavage assay in the presence of free sumo or free ubiquitin. After repeating this assay with more controls, we found that sumo enhances Wss1 self-cleavage as we initially observed (lane 6), but unfortunately, we also see this sumo-dependent effect with the Wss1 EQ catalytic mutant (lane 7) and in the negative control (lane 11- presence of EDTA). Finally, the use of commercial sumo had no effect on Wss1 self-cleavage (not shown).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21491.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21491.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21491.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21491-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) For completeness, the authors need to show the levels of SPRTN over-expression in experiments where SPRTN is over-expressed.</italic> </p><p>Western blots have been included in experiments where SPRTN is over-expressed.</p><p><italic>3) Additional evidence that SPRTN auto-cleaved</italic> in vivo <italic>(when over-expressed) – rather than being cleaved post-lysis – would strengthen the paper.

First, we over-expressed GFP-SPRTN or GFP-SPRTN-E112A in 293T-HEK cells and lysed cells directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. This experiment shows the presence of SPRTN cleavage fragments in two independent transfections, but not in the SPRTN-E112A samples. Secondly, we made an SPRTN expression plasmid containing two fluorescent tags – GFP at the amino-terminus and mCherry at the carboxy-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on the size of the cleavage fragments we observe, we reasoned that SPRTN self-cleaves, probably in trans, in a region just C-terminal to the Sprt-like protease domain. The self-cleavage of GFP-SPRTN would be reminiscent of GFP-SPRTN∆C expression – which is entirely cytoplasmic. Upon over-expression of this plasmid in HeLa cells, we can readily detect GFP fluorescent signal in the nucleus as well as is the cytoplasm, while the mCherry fluorescent signal remains in the nucleus. Taken together, these findings strongly support the notion that SPRTN self-cleaves in cells and is not simply a consequence of in trans cleavage in lysates.</p><p><italic>4) The experiments looking at Wss1 activation by ssDNA are interesting but bring up the question of whether dsDNA also activates, particularly since the SPRTN EMSA assays were done with dsDNA (See subsection “SPRTN is a DNA binding protease</italic> in vivo <italic>and in vitro”, last paragraph and subsection “in vitro cleavage of Top2”)?

If SPRTN only binds ssDNA but is activated in vitro only by dsDNA then that wouldn't fit your model and would suggest that there may be some sort of contaminant in the protein preps. These experiments would bridge what appears to be a disconnect between the protease assays and the EMSA.</italic> </p><p>We have now done SPRTN-DNA binding experiments using the EMSA with either ssDNA or dsDNA, as requested by reviewers. We found that SPRTN can bind to either ssDNA or to dsDNA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
